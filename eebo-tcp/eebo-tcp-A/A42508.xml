            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

confeſs, for I look upon ſuch Expoſitions as have been already given to the Fables of the Heathen Gods, as the ſilly producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and groundleſs fancies of Religious Minds, who have laboured to find in the ignorance of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> the knowledges of the Goſpel. In the contrivances and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of the Devil, the ſublimest Myſteries of Chriſtianity. Such Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Poets, are near related to that wiſe Expoſitor of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> who would needs declare the meaning of the Viſions of S. <hi>John,</hi> by certain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters found upon the back of ſome Fiſhes taken near the Northern Pole. The wit of Man may ſtretch out a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Light and Darkneſs, between Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice, between Chriſtianity and Gentiliſm; But I ſee no reaſon to believe that the latter was a favourer of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

The Grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Satan the enemy of Man-kind, was, to oppoſe Gods Promiſes of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſettle his Intereſt amongst men, by poſſeſſing them with Stories, and a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief contrary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and by promoting ſuch Practices as might engage Men in his ſervice, and cauſe them to abhor the ſanctity and purity of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.

We are therefore by the chief God, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every place, to underſtand the Chief &amp; Prince of the Apoſtate Angels. He did ſuffer his fellow Devils to ſhare with him in the reſpects of the nations, but they were not ſo univerſally adored, becauſe their power and inſpection was not ſo univerſal as his; Therefore the Scripture puts a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table difference between the Gods of the ſeveral Nations of the Eaſt. In every place of the world theſe evil Spirits had uſurped Gods Rights, and the Peoples De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and had drawn them to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto them, Creatures and humane victims. According to this opinion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to look upon many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Gods, as myſterious diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Eſtate of the Devils amongst themſelves, when they ſpeak of Marriages and Alliances between them, they do then ſhew unto us ſome real Truths, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to our weak Capacities, and to our manner of expreſſion. I will not venture to particulariſe any of theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, nor offer to interpret things, of which we have but ſtrong conjectures and

a probable opinion. I ſhall only ſay that the Diſpoſitions of theſe ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, are clearly manifeſt in their manner of Worſhip, in the Sacrifices that they did require, and in the things aſcribed to their tuition. <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Emperor of Heaven is the chief, and the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">

delights in Ship-wracks; and amongst the Storms and Billows of the raging Sea, therefore he is named <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Pluto</hi> is ſome infernal Fiend that is aſhamed to behold the Light; therefore the reſt of the Devils have aſſigned unto him Hell, or the concavities of the Earth for his abode. <hi>Mars,</hi> the God of War, encourageth the effuſion of Blood. This intimates his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and tyrannical diſpoſition. I could run over the reſt of the Gods, worſhipped by the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but this general intimation may ſufficiently diſcover unto the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader the other truths of the Fables.</p>
                  <p>I think that this may be another reaſon of the frequent Relations between the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Gods that are all allied one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If they had not been diſcovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in this manner, the Devil could not have recommended the foul practice of thoſe Vices; which are deſcribed in their ſtories; for as the miſcarriages of our lives, do depend upon our relations to one another, or to God our Creator: The
<pb facs="tcp:57461:11"/>
Devil could not have propoſed a perfect example of thoſe actions, nor encouraged us to the imitation of them, if he had not invented the ſame Relations between the Apoſtate Angels, as are between Men. Therefore theſe ſtories of the Heathen Gods, are not only a real declaration of certain ſecrets concerning the eſtate of the evil Spirits, and the works of Nature, but many of them are ingenious Fables, contrived by the Devil, and delivered to the Poets to diſcredit Virtue, and cauſe Vice to raign with authority amongst Men; for when the Divinities whom they did worſhip, were guilty of ſuch miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, when ſuch as had power to puniſh, were the grand abettors and protectors of their vicious actions, they could neither think it a ſhameful nor a dangerous thing to obey their ſuggeſtions, and follow their Examples. By this means the Enemy of Man-kind did labour to deſtroy the works of God, and to deface the beautiful Image of our Creator imprinted in our Souls, with all manner of Vices. The Devils did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into their Society and to their Divine Honors many brave Souls when they were departed ont of the world.</p>
                  <p>

Our Learned <hi>Jeſuite</hi> hath here given an account of theſe Fables, with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary interpretation in ſome places where they relate to Nature, and to its Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And becauſe he had omitted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, tending to the understanding of the Poets, I have ſupplyed what was wanting in him.</p>
                  <p>The other Treatiſes will be no leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſame purpoſe; for ſeveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors do make frequent alluſions to the <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> and to the <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Therefore, without the knowledge of theſe things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand paſſages of the Poets and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, are as obſcure, as unknown paths to the blind.</p>

But <hi>Saturn</hi> having learnt by ſome Oracle that one of his Sons ſhould take from him his Scepter and Kingdom, he reſolved to lay ſnares for his Son <hi>Jupiter</hi> that he might deſtroy him. This reſolution was the cauſe of his final ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; for <hi>Jupiter</hi> was ſo much offended at the deſign of his Father, that he revolted from him, and by force of Arms caſt him out of his Kingdom, and the Empire of Heaven; from whence he came ſtrait into <hi>Italy</hi> to hide himſelf, and therefore it was called <hi>Latium à latendo.

                           <hi>Latona</hi> was there brought to Bed of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> upon the large leaf of a Palm-tree, which by chance was found in that Deſolate Iſland.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Apollo</hi> came to be of years, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred unto what ſhifts and extremity the Serpent <hi>Python</hi> had reduced his poor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore he kill'd him with his Bow and Arrows, after a long and grievous fight, during which, theſe words <hi>Jo Paean</hi> were frequently heard.

                        <p>After this happy Combat, he begot a Son called <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> whom he committed to the Tuition of <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaur,</hi> to be brought up in the Myſteries of Phyſick, whereof he was afterwards eſteemed the God.

                        <p>Another of his Offices was to ſhew the ways, and to guide the deceaſed Souls into hell; therefore the Poets do ſay, that none can die until <hi>Mercurius</hi> comes with his Rod to break the tye that unites the ſoul to the body.

                        <p>Some ſay that this <hi>Mercurius</hi> made <hi>Daedalus</hi> ſo excellent an Architect, and taught him ſo many rare inventions, that they rendred him famous all over the World.

                        <p>She fell in love with <hi>Tithonus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Laomedon,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> at her requeſt made Immortal, without granting unto him the priviledge of continuing always young: When he came to be extreme old, he was impatient of thoſe many evils that did trouble him in his decrepit Age; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he conſented to be metamorphoſed into a Graſhopper. This Fable contains much truth, for it is certain, that <hi>Tithonus,</hi> a great lover of Aſtrology, was wont to riſe by break of day to behold the Stars: This continual and conſtant vigilancy had rewarded him with a long life, and preſerved him from all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but as Old Age, amongſt other Vices, is ſubject to exceſſive pratling, from hence it is that they imagine that Old <hi>Tithonus</hi> was turned into a Graſhopper.

                        <p>That Star that we call <hi>Venus,</hi> which riſes at break of day, was the Daughter of <hi>Aurora,</hi> it is called alſo <hi>Lucifer,</hi> or <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> when it marches before the Sun; but at night, when it marches before the Sun; but at night, when it remains behind, at Sun-ſetting, it is named <hi>Veſper,</hi> or <hi>Heſperus,</hi> whoſe Office is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the head of all the other Stars, when they come to enlighten the night.</p>

                        <p>If the Heathens have enrolled <hi>Aurora</hi> in the number of the Gods, we muſt not wonder at what they have believed concerning the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> as we have already ſeen, and of all the other Heavenly Bodies, who were, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, certain men, and Animals tranſlatid from

But at the end of a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, they did return into the World again to live in other Bodies, and that the Souls might not retain any remembrance of theſe <hi>Elyſian</hi> Feilds, they did drink of the River <hi>Lethe,</hi> that had the virtue of cauſing them to forget all the things paſt.</p>

It is very remarkable that the Papiſts do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in their deſcriptions and fancies of Hell, and of its ſuburbs, the Heathens, or Romans their predeceſſors, who with the Empire of the World have left them many of their groundleſs opinions, and ſtrange ſuperſtitions, as the former did imagine, ſeveral apartments under ground, and ſubterraneous places, ſo the latter do maintain divers retreats of the ſoul after Death, The Purgatorie of the Poets deſcribed by <hi>Virgil,</hi> is the ſame as that of theſe miſtaken Chriſtians.</p>

                        <p>In theſe lower Regions of the Earth were ſeveral ſtrange Goddeſſes, <hi>Nox</hi> the night was ſhe that had the greateſt command, and that was one of the moſt remarkable; ſhe was held to be the Mother of Love, of Deceit, of Old-Age, of Death, of Sleep, of Dreams, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, of Feare, and of Darkneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Cock was offerred in ſacrifice to her, &amp; ſhe was painted with black hair, with a Garland of Poppies about her head, and her Chariot was draw'n with black Horſes, and in her Arms a white boy ſignifying Sleep, and a black one intimating Death, both taking their reſt.</p>
                        <p>The harpies were ſtrange ſorts of Birds paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with womens Faces, Dragons Tailes, and Eagles Talons; they are ſometimes called Furiae, Striges, and Lamiae.

and <hi>Zetis</hi> the two Children of <hi>Boreas</hi> and <hi>Orythea,</hi> had pity of the old man having therefore winged feet, they perſued the Harpies and drove them from <hi>Peneas</hi> Stable, afterwards they were confined to Hell, their next neighbour was a cruel Monſter, named <hi>Chimera,</hi> that was dreadfull becauſe of it's miſhapen body, but much more becauſe it breathed forth nothing but flames of fire.

This repreſents unto us, how the Devils do tempt us inwardly to evil.</p>
                        <p>The Heathens did imagine a ſeverer Juſtice in Hell than was upon Earth, for they placed three Kings eminent for their upright deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to judge and diſpoſe of the eſtate of every one according to his deſerts, the Souls were brought before them naked, without any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or name that might render them recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, therefore the wicked were puniſhed with fire, but the good were admitted immediately into the Elyſean feilds.</p>

                        <p>The domeſtick Gods were named <hi>Lares</hi> or <hi>Penates</hi> they were in ſhape like Monkies pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſome private part of the houſe, or in the Chimney corner, they did honour them as their Protectors, and therefore did make unto them offerings of wine and frankinſence.</p>
                        <p>They did alſo imagine that every one was borne with two Genii proper unto his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, named <hi>Daemones;</hi> the one was the good and favourable, who did perſwade him to honeſty and virtue, and in recompence did procure unto him all manner of good things proper to our Eſtates.

                        <p>The Heathens did acknowledge alſo a Great Goddeſs, named <hi>Fortune,</hi> who had in her poſſeſſion, and at her diſpoſal, the honors, the riches, and the happineſs of this life, ſhe did give them and take them away at her pleaſure: But this is noted of her, that ſhe was blind, and very unconſtant; in her hand was a Wheel that ſhe did turn without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57461:55"/>
raiſing ſometimes men on the top of the Wheel, and ſometimes caſting them down, ſo that there was nothing ſetled or aſſured that did concern her. She was adored by the moſt part of men, the greateſt Princes had one of Gold kept ſafe with them in their dwellings, that ſhe might be always favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto them: The Goddeſs <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> or <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> had an eye upon the crimes and miſdemeanours of every one to puniſh them. The God <hi>Momus</hi> was worſhipped by them, but he grew mightily out of favour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came odious to all the World, becauſe of his ill qualities; for he had his beginning from Sleep, and the Night: And although he was very ſlothful and ignorant, he was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one that found fault, and who did prattle of every thing, which did proceed partly from his vanity, and the partly from the neſs of his judgment.</p>

They did paint them differently, ſometimes as a Serpent, and ſometimes as Boys or Girls, or as Old Men; but a Garland of a Palm-tree was always upon their heads, therefore this Tree is named <hi>Genialis.</hi> In ſome ancient Medals, the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Emperour was repreſeuted as a Man, with a large diſh of all ſorts of Flowers in one hand, and a Scourge in the other, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs both rewards and puniſhments: They thought it not lawful to kill any Creature unto their <hi>Genius,</hi> becauſe it was not decent that they ſhould cauſe Creatures to looſe their lives, the day on which they received theirs; yet <hi>Horace</hi> mentions the killing of a Pig of two moneths old.

                           <hi>Tharamis,</hi> or <hi>Thor,</hi> was a famous Idol of the Northern People, adored for <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for he was placed upon a high Throne, with a Crown of Gold on his head, encompaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with many Stars, and ſeven Stars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the ſeven Planets in his left hand, and a Scepter in the right.

                  <head>The Preface.</head>
                  <p>WE do learn from <hi>Heſiod,</hi> how the Heathens did acknowledge three ſorts of Gods. For beſides thoſe of the Firſt Rank, of whom we have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former Book, they did ſuppoſe, that the Aire was full of many little gods called <hi>Daemones,</hi> who, according to their belief did imploy themſelves in the affairs of mankind.</p>
                  <p>The Laſt Sort are thoſe that they call <hi>Heroes</hi> or <hi>Demi-gods,</hi> who did fetch their beginning from a God either of the Father or Mothers ſide; nevertheleſſe, they did admit into their number, ſuch as by their noted vertues or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary deſervings did repreſent the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the gods, although both their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers were mortals as the the reſt. The Statues aſigned unto them were for this reaſon greater and larger
<pb facs="tcp:57461:75"/>
than ordinary men, unto them the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was dedicated, as a ſign of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unto which they had attained as we may ſee in <hi>Virgil,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the Tomb of <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> he ſayes that out of it came forth a great Serpent. And <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> was eſteemed a God by the Egyptians, becauſe they had ſeen a Serpent engendered of his corrupted body after his Death. The most famous of theſe <hi>Demi-gods</hi> were <hi>Perſeus, Hercules, Theſeus,</hi> the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and many of thoſe famous Captains, that got ſo much honor in the Wars of <hi>Thebs</hi> and <hi>Troy:</hi> of theſe we ſhall now treat in this Second Book.</p>

                           <hi>PErſeus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and of <hi>Danae</hi> Daughter of <hi>Acriſius</hi> King of the Argives. <hi>Acriſius</hi> having been informed by the Oracles, that the Child, that ſhould be born of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was to take away his Life, he ſhut her up in a Tower of Braſs, that ſhe might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the acquaintance of any man, nor a Child to trouble him with ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But he could not hinder <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> from viſiting her when he began to be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57461:76"/>
for by the top of the Tower in a golden ſhowre, this letcherous god found an entrance to <hi>Danae,</hi> of whom <hi>Perſeus</hi> was born as we have ſeen in the Story of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which when <hi>Acriſius</hi> did underſtand, he commanded the Mother and the Child to be ſhut up in a Cheſt, and to be thus caſt into the Sea. The Kings command was executed, but the cheſt was afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by ſome Fiſhermen, that found it floating upon the waves, and both the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Child yet alive, by this means the Prophecy of the Oracle proved true; for at a certain time, when <hi>Acriſius</hi> was preſent to ſee a paſtime or a delightful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, <hi>Perſeus</hi> gave him accidently a blow that killed him.</p>
                        <p>When this <hi>Perſeus</hi> came to age, he was mightily honoured, and favoured of all the gods. <hi>Minerva</hi> beſtowed upon him her looking glaſs: for a Buckler <hi>Mercurius</hi> gave him the wings of his feet and of his head with his Cimiter, by which he performed notable exploits, for ſome ſay he ſubdued all that Country, that is named Perſia from him. He delivered the wretched <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda</hi> from the cruelty of the <hi>Nereids,</hi> who had bound her to a Rock to be there devoured of the Sea Monſters, becauſe they had been incenſed againſt her Mother for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing their beauty,</p>
                        <p>In his time there were three Siſters the Dau <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57461:76"/>
They were all miſhapen and cruel, having but one eye in common to them all; nevertheleſs the poets do ſay, that the third named <hi>Meduſa,</hi> had been a rare beauty, ſo that when <hi>Neptnne</hi> ſaw her in <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple, he was mightily taken with her, and oblidged her to yield to his luſt at the ſame time. This action did diſpleaſe <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> ſo much, that ſhe changed <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s locks of hair into fearful Serpents, whoſe onely looks cauſed every one to be turned into Stones. <hi>Perſeus</hi> reſolved to cut off her head that he might deliver the Country from this grievous Monſter: Out of the drops of her blood was begot, as they ſay, the Horſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſus</hi> with his great wings, who with a ſtroke of his heels opened the fountain <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crene</hi> ſo highly eſteemed of the Poets. This Horſe afterwards became more famous, when he gave his aſſiſtance to <hi>Bellerophon</hi> in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the <hi>Chimaera,</hi> afterwards being frighted by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he caſt his Rider upon the ground, and took his flight to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he is at preſent among the Stars.</p>
                        <p>But to return to <hi>Meduſa,</hi> we muſt take notice, that although her head was cut off it retained the ſame vertue and qualities as before, for it changed every one unto whom it was preſented into Stone; as it did poor <hi>Atlas,</hi> of whom <hi>Perſeus</hi> did thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, becauſe he would not afford him a Lodging with him. But <hi>Perſeus</hi> was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57461:77"/>
not only notable by his valour and warlike feats, but alſo by his favouring of good Learning, which he cauſed to flouriſh in his time, as the manner of great perſons is: for that purpoſe he built a Colledge upon the Mount <hi>Helicon</hi> for to inſtruct Youth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poets and Aſtrologers have advanced his Name amongſt the Stars; ſo that behind him he hath left the eſteem of a great Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and of an excellent favourer of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His furniture and weapons are Sacred Hieroglyphicks of rare qualities that were in him, and that are required to undertake and compaſs with ſucceſs glorious deſigns. The Looking-glaſs of <hi>Minerva,</hi> that was his Buckler, is an Embleme of Prudence: The Cimeter and wings of <hi>Mercurius,</hi> that were given unto him, do intimate that ſtrength and valour muſt be ſeconded with ſpeed and celerity in the execution of great matters: And that which is ſaid of the Head of <hi>Medu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> teacheth, that the only preſence of a great man, furniſhed with ſuch excellent qualities, are able to ſtrike a terror into the minds of his Oppoſers, and ſtop them in ſuch a manner, as if they were but ſtatues and ſtones.</p>

Mothers of a Noble Race, when their actions and life were worthy of eſteem, they did then labour to cloak the ſhame of their Birth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that they proceeded from no Mortal Race, but were begotten by a God: The people engaged by their good Offices and virtuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to believe them, did imbrace and maintain ſuch tales with much heat and animoſity. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> was of the number of theſe men, that did caſt the reproach of their birth upon the Chief of the Gods; for his Mother being deprived of all hopes of having any lawful iſſue, by the cruelty of her jealous Father, who confined her to a cloſe Priſon, ſhe was not unwilling to accept of the ſolicitations of her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle <hi>Pretus;</hi> ſo that of this inceſtuous Copulation was born <hi>Perſeus:</hi> He was with his Mother caſt into the Sea, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence convey'd him alive thorough the waves of the Sea to the Iſland <hi>Seriphus,</hi> where <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dectes</hi> did command as King. It happened, that when his Brother <hi>Dictys</hi> was fiſhing upon the Sea, he happily met with theſe unfortunate creatures ſhut up in the Cheſt, floating alive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water; he conveyed them into the Iſland, and there nouriſhed them at his Brothers Court.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Perſeus</hi> came to Age, he was taken notice of for his valour and ſtrength, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was deſirous to ingratiate himſelf with the people, he undertook to deſtroy the Monſters of Women that were in <hi>Africa,</hi> called <hi>Gorgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> ſome think them to be <hi>Baſilisks,</hi> that kill with their eye-ſight. He cut off the Head of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> and from the drops of corrupt blood

that fell on the ground, did proceed that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Serpents and venomous Beaſts that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Africa</hi> more than any other part of the World. But <hi>Perſeus</hi> could not have overcome them, had he not been furniſhed with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Armour of the Gods, and the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of <hi>Pluto,</hi> by which he became inviſible. He did many brave actions, inſomuch that he obtained, not only for himſelf a place amongſt the Stars, but alſo for his Father and Mother-in-law, <hi>Cepheus,</hi> and <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> and for his Wife <hi>Andromeda.</hi> The Poets do take notice, that when he went to cut <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head whiles ſhe was aſleep, he turned from her his eyes, and lookt in his Buckler, that was a Looking-glaſs, how to direct his Sword.</p>

                        <p>His Mother was <hi>Alcmena,</hi> who eſpouſed <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> a Theban Prince, upon condition that he would revenge the maſſacre of her Brother.

<pb facs="tcp:57461:78"/>
company longer without diſcovery, he made the Night to continue longer than any other. <hi>Alemeni</hi> was then big with <hi>Iphiclus;</hi> ſhe did nevertheleſs conceive <hi>Hercules</hi> from <hi>Jupiters</hi> acquaintance, and was brought to bed of both of them together. Although <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryon</hi> was not the Father of <hi>Hercules,</hi> he is by the Poets called <hi>Amphitrymiades.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At that time <hi>Sthelenus,</hi> King of <hi>Mycene,</hi> was in great hopes of obtaining ſpeedily a Son, afterwards called <hi>Euryſtheus. Jupiter</hi> took an oath, that he that ſhould be born firſt of him or <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſhould be King, and have an abſolute command over the other; which when <hi>Juno,</hi> the ſworn Enemy of all her Husbands Concubines, and of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were born of them, had acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally heard, ſhe cauſed <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> to come forth of his Mothers Womb at the end of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moneths, and by that means procured unto him the Scepter with the Sovereign Command.</p>
                        <p>Some ſay, that <hi>Juno</hi> ſolicited earneſtly by <hi>Pallas,</hi> was reconciled to <hi>Hercules;</hi> and that in teſtimony of her good will and amity, ſhe gave him to ſuck of her own milk; by that means it hapned, that the Little <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> having ſpilt ſome of the Milk out of his mouth, he whited all that part of the Sky that we call the Milken Way. This kindneſs was but feigned, to ſatisfie the requeſt of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> for a while after, when he was yet in the Cradle, ſhe ſent two dreadful Serpents to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57461:79"/>
devour him, which did not anſwer her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for the Child without any ſhew of fear caught them in his hands, and tore them in pieces.</p>
                        <p>When he was come to Age, <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to all manner of dangers to cauſe him to periſh: So that once he took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey him no longer; but the Oracle informed him, that it was the Will of the Gods that he ſhould paſs twelve times more through dangers, in obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this Tyrant. Theſe are named the Twelve Adventures of <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt was when he was ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a great Lyon of the Forreſt of <hi>Nemea,</hi> that was fallen from the Globe of the Moon, and that did ſpoil all the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: The people had often caſt Darts and Arrows at him, but his skin could not be pierced. <hi>Hercules</hi> purſued him, and drove him into a Cave, where he ſeiſed upon him, and ſtrangled him. Afterwards he always did wear the skin of this Lyon about him, as the Trophy of his Victory. Some ſay, that this is the Lyon that was placed amongſt the twelve Signs of the Zodiack.</p>
                        <p>He was ſent next to the Lake of <hi>Lerna,</hi> near <hi>Argos,</hi> to encounter with the <hi>Hydra,</hi> a notable Serpent, of a ſtrange Nature; for it had ſeven heads, when one was cut off, many others did immediately burſt forth; ſo that it was not poſſible to overcome this Monſter, unleſs all his Heads were cut off at one time,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57461:79"/>
and the reſt of his body deſtroyed by Fire and Sword, which was executed by <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> About that time a wild Boar, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary bigneſs, whoſe reſidence was upon Mount <hi>Erymanthus</hi> in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Neighbouring Fields. <hi>Hercules</hi> drag'd him alive to <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt frighted out of his Wits when he beheld him.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place he got hold of the Stag of the Mountain <hi>Menalus,</hi> whoſe feet were of braſs, and horns of gold, when he had purſued it a whole year.</p>
                        <p>He put to flight the Birds of the Lake <hi>Stym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Called <hi>Stym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalides.</hi>
                           </note>that were ſo numerous, and of ſuch a prodigious greatneſs, that they did darken the Air, and hinder the Sun from ſhining upon men when they did fly over them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they did often take up ſome, and carry them away to devour them.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Encounters were not worthy to be compared with his Combat againſt the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons; <note place="margin">Now <hi>Tartari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>This ſeventh Adventure, as <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgilius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, was to cleanſe the Stables of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> King of <hi>Elis,</hi> in them thouſands of Oxen had been nouriſhed every day; ſo that the dung, by a long continuance, was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily encreaſed, and did fill the Air with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Hercules</hi> therefore turned the currant of the River <hi>Alpheus</hi> from its ordinary courſe, and cauſed it to paſs thorough the Stables. Thus he carried away all the filth in a day, according to his bargain: But <hi>Augias</hi> was not grateful to him for his pains, for he denied him the tenth part of the Oxen that were kept there: This cauſed his death, and the loſs of all his goods.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards <hi>Hercules</hi> went and ſeiz'd upon a Bull that did breath nothing but fire and flame, which <hi>Neptunus</hi> had ſent into <hi>Greece</hi> to puniſh ſome diſgraces and affronts that he had received from that Country.</p>
                        <p>He paſſed from thence into <hi>Thracia,</hi> where
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57461:80"/>
he cauſed the King <hi>Diomedes</hi> to endure in his own perſon that which he made others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for he gave all the ſtrangers that he could catch in his Kingdome to his Horſes, to be devoured by them. <hi>Hercules</hi> ſerved <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the ſame manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo cruel to all ſtrangers, as to cut their throats upon the Altars of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he might cloak his cruelty with a gaudy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Piety. Likewiſe <hi>Geryon,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was reported to have three bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe he did command three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, was no leſs cruel than the former; he did feed ſome Oxen that he highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Diomedes</hi> did his Horſes; and to keep them, he had a Dog with three heads, and a Dragon with ſeven. When <hi>Hercules</hi> was ſent thither by <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> he treated him as he had formerly done <hi>Diomedes.</hi> Now this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryon</hi> who had three Heads, and three Bodies, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Erytio</hi> was his cruel Miniſter of State, who was kill'd. He drove theſe Oxen from <hi>Italy,</hi> where he kill'd <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hys Dereylus,</hi> and <hi>Alebion,</hi> who offered to hinder his paſſage, and ſteal his beaſts He ſacrificed them all to <hi>Juno.</hi>
                           </note>and but one Soul to move them, was not like King <hi>Herilus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the eighth Book of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> who had three Souls in one Body, ſo that he could not die by one or two deaths; he was to be kill'd three times before he could be diſpatcht. Another Adventure of <hi>Hercules</hi> was, to put into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> certain Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Apples belonging to <hi>Juno,</hi> that were in the cuſtody of ſome Nymphs, <hi>Heſperides</hi> Daughters of <hi>Heſperus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las:</hi> But before that any could come to them, a great Dragon, that was at the entry of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57461:81"/>
Garden where they did grow, was to be firſt overcome. He found a means to accompliſh this Enterpriſe alſo: Some ſay that he made uſe of <hi>Atlas,</hi> who went to gather them, in the mean whiles he took upon him the others burden, and bore up the Heavens with his ſhoulders.</p>
                        <p>The laſt injunction that he received from <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> was to fetch from Hell the Dog <hi>Cerberus,</hi> from whence he brought alſo <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> that was gone down to keep company to his dear friend <hi>Pirithous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe glorious actions made <hi>Hercules</hi> to be dreadful to King <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> and to all the other Princes of the World. Afterwards there was no Monſters nor Tyrant known, but he undertook to deſtroy them. Thus he put to death <hi>Buſiris,</hi> the Son of <hi>Neptunus,</hi> who did lay Embuſcado's to take ſtrangers, that he might maſſacre them upon his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. Thus he killed <hi>Cacus,</hi> who had three Heads; the Son of <hi>Vulcanus,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> becauſe he was a notable Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that did ſpoil and deſtroy all that came near the Mount <hi>Aventin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From thence he went to the Mount <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſus,</hi> where he delivered <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and kill'd the Eagle that did devour his Liver, as we have already noted in the former Book, Chap. 3.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hercules</hi> had alſo an encounter with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus,</hi> the Son of the Earth, who was of a prodigious bigneſs, and who did commit all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57461:81"/>
of cruelties. This was very remarkable of him, that as often as he did fall and touch the Earth, ſo often he did receive a freſh ſupply of ſtrength; which when <hi>Hercules</hi> did perceive, he lifted him up from the ground, and in his Arms preſt the breath out of his body. But as <hi>Hercules</hi> was big, and had a great body, a ſmall matter was not ſufficient to nouriſh him. One day when he was a hungry, walking in the Fields, he met <hi>Theodamas</hi> tilling the ground, from whom he ſnatcht one of his Oxen that he laid upon his ſhoulders, and devoured every bit of him before <hi>Theodamas,</hi> who in the mean whiles did load him with imprecations and curſes in his fury. From hence was derived the cuſtom of that Country, to offer unto <hi>Hercules</hi> an Oxe in Sacrifice, with all manner of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                        <p>He made alſo a journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he ſeparated the two Mountains <hi>Calpe</hi> and <hi>Abyla,</hi> to let in the main Ocean into the Land by the Straits of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> Theſe two Mountains ſcituate one againſt another, <hi>Calpe</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Abyla</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear afar off as two Pillars; they are ſaid to be the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> where he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave theſe words, <hi>Non plus ultra;</hi> as if that were the laſt confines of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which he could not inlarge his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. In all his Conqueſts he made uſe of no other weapon but a Club of an Olive Tree, which at laſt he dedicated to <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57461:82"/>
the God of Eloquence, whoſe virtue he did acknowledge to be more profitable than the power of Arms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Juno</hi> was inwardly grieved to ſee him purchaſe ſo much glory, therefore ſhe ſought an opportunity of deſtroying him, or at leaſt of creating unto him ſome miſchief whiles he was in his journey to Hell: She perſwaded <hi>Lycus,</hi> baniſhed from <hi>Thebs,</hi> to ſurprize this City in his abſence, and to kill <hi>Creon</hi> the King, with all his Sons. He had in it taken <hi>Megara,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and Daughter of <hi>Creon,</hi> and was going to force her to his luſt, when <hi>Hercules</hi> returned from Hell, and kill'd <hi>Lycus,</hi> with all his Aſſociates. This was no ſmall diſgrace to <hi>Juno,</hi> who was reſolved to revenge it; therefore ſhe cauſed <hi>Hercules</hi> to enter into ſuch a fury, that he killed his Wife and Children. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he became ſo much afflicted for this deed, when his anger was appeaſed, that he reſolved to deſtroy himſelf, if he had not been hindered by the prayers and tears of <hi>Amphitryon</hi> and <hi>Theſeus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this famous man, after ſo many brave actions, and after that he had overcome all things by his valour, he became a Slave to Women, and to the affections that he did entertain for them. <hi>Omphalis,</hi> Queen of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> was one of thoſe that did poſſeſs him ſo much, that he changed his Club into ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inſtruments; he cloathed himſelf with the garments of a Damoſel, and ſerved this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57461:82"/>
Princeſs in the quality of a Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards he became amorous of <hi>Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira,</hi> for whom he was to fight with <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> the Son of <hi>Thetys:</hi> But the latter being ſenſible of his own weakneſs, did encounter with him in ſeveral ſhapes, changing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now into a Serpent, anon into a Bull: Whiles he thus appeared to <hi>Hercules,</hi> he caught hold of one of his horns, and tore it up by the root, which made him ſo aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ever ſince he hath remained in the form of a River that bears his Name. The <hi>Naiades,</hi> his Daughters, being extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted at this diſgrace received by their Father, they offered the Horn of Plenty, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> had beſtowed upon them to redeem that of their Father; for we muſt underſtand, that when <hi>Jupiter</hi> was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, he was nouriſhed with the Milk of a certain She-goat, named <hi>Amalthea,</hi> by ſome Nymphs that tended him: Afterwards he requited their kindneſs in this manner, the Goat he advanced amongſt the Stars, and gave to the Nymphs one of her horns, with this rare virtue annexed to it, of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to procure unto them all the things that they ſhould wiſh for; therefore they named it the Horn of Abundance, or of Plenty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hercules</hi> returned Conquerour with <hi>Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira,</hi> but he was ſtopt at the Ford of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where <hi>Neſſus</hi> the <hi>Centaur</hi> offered his ſervice to him, to carry <hi>Deianira</hi> behind him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57461:83"/>
on the other ſide. As ſoon as the Traytor was there landed, he would have abuſed her, had not <hi>Hercules</hi> pierced him ſpeedily with an Arrow, which when he did feel that it had ſtruck him to the heart, and that he was ready to expire, he reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf in this manner; he gave his garment dropping with his blood to <hi>Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira,</hi> perſwading her, that if her Husband did wear it but once, he would never have love for other Women: The ſilly creature believes him, therefore ſhe ſent it to him by <hi>Lychas</hi> his man, when he was ſacrificing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Oeta:</hi> But it fell not out as ſhe had imagined, for as ſoon as he had put on this Coat, the blood of <hi>Neſſus,</hi> that was a moſt powerful poyſon, cauſed ſo great a burning all over his body, that in deſpair he caſt himſelf into a flaming pile of Wood, and was there conſumed to aſhes. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitor <hi>Lychas</hi> was drown'd in the Sea, where he was changed into a Rock, and <hi>Deianira</hi> for grief killed her ſelf with a blow of her Husbands Club.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Hercules</hi> before he died did oblige <hi>Philoctete,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pean,</hi> his companion and friend, to ſwear unto him to never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto any body the place where his aſhes were buried: He delivered unto him then his Arrows coloured with the blood of the <hi>Hydra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But when the Grecians were preparing for an expedition againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> the Oracle gave

                           <hi>THeſeus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Aegeus,</hi> King of <hi>Athens,</hi> who gave his name to the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean Sea: He did live in the time of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and was nearly related to him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was often a Companion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and a perfect follower of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, after that he had eſcaped from the ſnares of his Mother-in-law <hi>Medea,</hi> who with a Cup of Poyſon intended to deprive him of the ſucceſſion to the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The moſt part of the Princes and great Lords of that time were Robbers, who made their greatneſs conſiſt in a Tyrannical Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their miſerable Subjects, and over all thoſe that were ſo unhappy as to fall into their hands. <hi>Phalaris,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was one of them; he was wont to ſhut men alive into the body of a Brazen Bull hollow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cauſing fire to be put under it, that it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57461:86"/>
might oblige them to ſend forth groans and cryes out of the throat of this Inſtrument of his cruelty: In the mean while he did take a ſingular delight to hear the Bull bellow thus.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that wanted neither courage nor goodneſs, reſolved to give a check to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency of all theſe Tyrants, and to treat them as they had treated others before. Firſt he marched againſt one <hi>Scirron,</hi> who took pleaſure in drowning all Paſſengers in the Sea. Thus he puniſhed <hi>Procuſtes,</hi> becauſe he was wont to cut in pieces all thoſe that came into his hands: Sometimes he did cut off their Legs even with the Bed where he did lye.</p>
                        <p>Thus he encountred with all the Monſters that came into the World, as with the Bull of <hi>Marathon,</hi> that was of a prodigious bigneſs; and as with the Boar of <hi>Calydonia</hi> that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager</hi> had undertaken, but could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him without the help of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> from whence riſeth the Proverb, <hi>Non ſine Theſeo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The moſt famous and notable of all his exploits, was the victory that he obtained of the <hi>Minotaurus,</hi> who was half a man and half a Bull, whoſe birth we have mentioned in the former Book, ſpeaking of <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Minos,</hi> who was the Mother of this Monſter, begot by a Bull on her body. And that we may know how <hi>Theſeus</hi> was engaged in this buſineſs, we muſt underſtand, that King <hi>Minos</hi> did make War upon the people
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57461:86"/>
of <hi>Attica,</hi> to revenge the Death of his Son <hi>Androgeus,</hi> maſſacred by them in a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner. In this War he took the City of <hi>Megara,</hi> and overcame the Athenians; ſo that he obliged them to ſend unto him as a Tribute every year, a certain number of young men whom he did give to this <hi>Minotau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to be devoured by him. <hi>Theſeus</hi> reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to be ſent amongſt the other young men, that he might deſtroy this Monſter that had devoured already ſo much of the blood of his Citizens. The <hi>Labyrinth</hi> was the place where this <hi>Minotaurus</hi> was kept. This Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice had been built by <hi>Dedalus</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there were in it ſo many windings and turnings, that it was a difficult matter for one within to find the way out again. <hi>Theſeus</hi> wiſely gave order to this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, for he won the good liking of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adone</hi> the Kings Daughter, and ſhe delivered to him a Thred, by its aſſiſtance he fo nd a way out of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> after that he had killed the <hi>Minotaur</hi> in it. <hi>Ariadne</hi> he took with him, promiſing unto her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful advantages in his Kingdom of <hi>Athens.</hi> Nevertheleſs he left her by the way, in the Iſland of <hi>Naxos,</hi> to comply with the deſires of the God <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who wiſhed to have her in Marriage; and therefore he preſented her with a Crown, that hath been ſince placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Stars.</p>
                        <p>The Ship in which <hi>Theſeus</hi> was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſland of <hi>Crete,</hi> had no other ſails

but Black and Mourning: But he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his Father <hi>Aegeus,</hi> that in caſe he obtained the Victory, he would come home with White Sails; which the exceſs of joy proceeding from the conſideration of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py return from ſo imminent a danger, cauſed him to forget: Therefore it happened that his Father, who was always expecting with much impatience his coming back, when he ſaw the black ſails, the ſigns of ſadneſs and of ſorrow approaching with the Ship, he was taken with ſo piercing a grief, that he caſt himſelf headlong into the Sea at the ſame moment, and there was drowned.</p>
                        <p>This Ship was afterwards kept by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, as the Remembrancer or Monument of the happy Victory that had freed them from ſo much miſery and apprehenſion. They did therefore repair i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When both met together, they were ſo much taken with the beautiful countenance, with the courage and generous behaviour one of the other, that they did ſwear to be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Friends, and to lend a mutual aſſiſtance in all difficult affairs.</p>

                        <p>THe common Opinion of the Poets is, that <hi>Leda,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Tyndarus,</hi> King of <hi>Oebalia,</hi> having had familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhe brought forth two big Eggs: Out of one, which was of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>

                        <p>The two Brothers, <hi>Caſter</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> did love one another entirely, inſomuch that they were inſeparable, and they always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their undertakings together; but only <hi>Pollux</hi> was immortal by the priviledges of his Birth; therefore out of a tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for his Brother, he perſwaded <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who had a great kindneſs for him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit alſo the other into the number of his Sons.

But they did not attain unto this great Honour, until they had deſerved it by a many glorious actions; for they forced <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> to reſtore their Siſter <hi>Helena</hi> that he had taken; they cleared the Coaſt of all Pyrats at Sea that interrupted the Trade; therefore they have been adored amongſt the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Sea, and been put in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that were ſirnamed <hi>Apotropaei,</hi> that is, who did protect them from evil. For this cauſe the Heathens did ſacrifice unto them white Lambs.</p>
                        <p>The Romans had a particular reſpect for them, becauſe of the aſſiſtance that they had received from them in a Battel againſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin people, near the Lake <hi>Rhegilus:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did erect to them a very ſtately Temple, and did ſwear commonly by their Names: The Oath of the Women was <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtor,</hi> as that of men was <hi>Hercule</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> are reckoned amongſt the famous men that have deſerved an immortal name by their valour and generoſity. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <hi>Jaſon,</hi> and his Argonauts, in their expedition, to fetch back again the Golden Fleece, in which theſe two Brethren did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare their courage and skill in Arms, <hi>Pollux</hi> eſpecially: He undertook to correct the temerity of <hi>Amycus,</hi> when he offered to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge one of their company out of the Ship to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57461:90"/>
fight with him at handy blows. <hi>Pollux</hi> went out, and ſoon laid him dead upon the ground. In this voyage, when a dangerous Tempeſt had overtaken them, they ſaw two flames of fire lighting upon the head of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> which were the happy Omens or forerunners of the end of their fears and danger; for the Marriners take notice, that when two fires ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear together at Sea, they are to expect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their undertakings, and a notable calm; whereas if there be but one, they prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a grievous ſtorm. From hence theſe two lights, that are Meteors, or the dry exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, inflamed in the Air, are called <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> but when one is ſeen, it is called <hi>Helena,</hi> as dangerous to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as ſhe was to <hi>Troy.</hi>

                        <p>They undertook next a War with <hi>Lynceus</hi> and <hi>Ida,</hi> the valiant Sons of <hi>Alphareus,</hi> in favour of their Miſtreſſes that had been eſpouſed to them formerly. In the encounter with them, <hi>Caſtor</hi> was unhappily kill'd by <hi>Lynceus,</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> dangerouſly wounded by <hi>Ida;</hi> but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> revenged his Sons quarrel, for he ſtruck

The Locrenſes did alſo ſee them leading their Army againſt the Crotoniats, with Caps on their heads, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their hands, upon two white Horſes. From hence it is that they are thus repreſented, and that the Romans have affected a Cap, as a badge of liberty.

                        <p>THe Poets do relate wonderful ſtories of ſeveral Muſitians of the firſt Ages; as of <hi>Amphion,</hi> who built the walls of <hi>Thebs</hi> only with the pleaſant harmony of his Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruments, for the ſweetneſs of the Tunes cauſed the ſtones to move, and place themſelves in good order.</p>

                           <hi>Arion</hi> was alſo admired for his skill in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as we may take notice in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when he was ſailing from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> the Seamen reſolved amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cut his throat, that they might have his Purſe: But he requeſted of them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſuffer him to play once more with his Harp before they did diſpatch him.

the Stars, for the good office that he had done to this poor Muſitian.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not mention the Satyr <hi>Marſias,</hi> who becauſe he had more skill in Muſick than the common ſort of people, he was ſo tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vanity and preſumption, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf with <hi>Apollo.</hi> This God was ſo diſpleaſed with him, that when he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him, according to the judgment of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> he flead him alive, to puniſh his temerity; as we have already ſaid in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There happened alſo a like controverſie between <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Pan</hi> the God of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Shepherds, becauſe he knew pretty well how to play upon the Pipe, and that theſe Country Clowns did cry him up for the moſt expert Muſitian of the World: He was ſo audacious as to diſpute this Honour with <hi>Apollo.

And that we may not make any longer diſcourſe of thoſe that have excelled in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, it is the common Opinion, that <hi>Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who was not only a Poet, but alſo a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, hath carried away the Palm from <note place="margin">See <hi>Ovid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorph.</hi> 10 and 11 Books.</note>all the reſt.

                        <p>He performed ſomething more than this; for when he loſt by death his Wife <hi>Eurydice,</hi> who flying from the amorous imbraces of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteus,</hi> King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> died ſuddenly of a Wound received by a Serpent.

He prevailed by that means ſo much upon them, that they granted unto him the favour to carry with him his Wife back again, to live longer upon Earth, upon condition, that in his return he would not look back upon her, until he was aſcended into the light; which condition his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent love for her cauſed him to break, by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>VVHiles the <hi>Thebans</hi> and the men of <hi>Argos</hi> were at variance, <hi>Tantalus</hi> and his Poſterity were afflicted with many
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57461:110"/>
ſenſible evils. The horrid impiety of this Prince was the cauſe of them; for as he was one of the Sons of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Gods at a certain time paſſing over the World, did him the honour to lodge with him in his Palace. Being therefore obliged to treat them at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he cauſed the members of his Son <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops</hi> to be cut in pieces, and to be prepared for them to eat, that he might try whether they would perceive it, and whether they were really Gods.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ceres</hi> was deceived at firſt, for being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hungry ſhe eat up one of the ſhoulders, but the reſt of the company did abominate this cruel Feaſt; therefore in compaſſion of the young Prince they reſtored him to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for <hi>Mercurius</hi> went down into Hell to fetch from thence his Soul, and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were reſtored to him, and eſtabliſhed in their right place, only in lieu of his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which had been eaten, they gave one of Ivory, which had the virtue of healing all manner of diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Tantalus</hi> was puniſht for his cruelty; he was condemned to Hell, to be there tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with a continual appetite of hunger and thirſt, in the midſt of waters, and the plenty of all varieties, that did fly from him when he did endeavour to catch at them, as we have already ſaid in the firſt Book.</p>
                        <p>His Daughter <hi>Niobe</hi> periſht alſo miſerably becauſe of her vanity and pride, for having a great number of children; ſhe did prefer
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57461:111"/>
her ſelf to <hi>Latona;</hi> therefore <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> deſtroyed all her Children with Arrows, except one named <hi>Cloris,</hi> which affliction caſt her into a Conſumption, ſo that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and diſpleaſure did dry her up. From hence the Poets have taken occaſion to ſay, that ſhe was changed into a Rock.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pelops</hi> left <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and departed into <hi>Greece,</hi> to go to the Kingdom of <hi>Elis,</hi> where he fell in love with <hi>Hippodamia,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Oenomaüs:</hi> But this King having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Oracles, that his Son-in-law ſhould be one day cauſe of his death, he would never venture to give his Daughter to any man, but upon this condition, that he ſhould firſt overcome him in a Chariot-Race, or looſe his life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pelops</hi> was not frighted with the danger, therefore he undertook to run; and that he might not miſs of his purpoſe, he won the Coach-man of <hi>Oenomaüs,</hi> named <hi>Myrtilus,</hi> with many golden promiſes, and oblig'd him to diſorder the Axle-tree of the Chariot in ſuch a manner, that it broke in the middle of the courſe: The poor <hi>Oenomaüs</hi> fell to the ground, and killed himſelf. After his death, <note place="margin">Pelopis <hi>talen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> a great ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.

                           <hi>Pelops</hi> took the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with his Daughter <hi>Hippodamia,</hi> and in a ſhort time he grew to be one of the moſt Illuſtrious Princes of his Age.

                        <p>THeſe two Brethren have given occaſion to many Tragedies, which proceeded from an irreconcilable hatred that they did bear to one another: For <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> having no other intent but to vex <hi>Atreus,</hi> defiled his Bed with Adultery and Inceſt, and then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf out of his reach. And <hi>Atreus</hi> ſurprized the ſons of <hi>Thyeſtes,</hi> and got them all into his power: Then he ſent unto him to invite him to a Feaſt, as if they had been to end all their differences, and reconcile themſelves together. <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> perſwaded with the deſire of ſeeing his Children, came readily to the Feaſt: But when they were both riſen from the Table, <hi>Atreus</hi> ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the ſad Spectacle of their hands and heads chopt off, telling him alſo at the ſame time, that he had fed at ſupper only upon their fleſh.

                        <p>But as one Crime draws after it another; it happened that <hi>Aegiſtus,</hi> the Baſtard Son of <hi>Thyeſtes,</hi> who was reckoned amongſt the Dead, becauſe he had been caſt away in a Wood, ſatisfied his Fathers vengeance, by ſpilling the blood of <hi>Atreus.</hi> This <hi>Aegiſtus</hi>

This accident cauſed them all to reſolve to drag and carry this wooden engine into the City.</p>
                        <p>They were far more eager when they heard the Relation and Diſcourſe of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sinon,</hi> a fellow taught for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by <hi>

                        <p>When <hi>Sinon</hi> ſaw all things in this poſture he opened the belly of the Horſe to let out the Souldiers, who had been there ſhut in and then he lighted a fire to give notice to the Army which did haſten back again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe.

Which news cauſed many young Lords to wo her and ſeek her in marriage very ſeriouſly, But ſhe did preſerve ſuch a faithful love for her husband, which was entertained by the hopes of his return, that ſhe would never give unto them any anſwer, and that ſhe might put them off, ſhe undertook the making of a piece of cloath, promiſing to declare her reſolution, when this work was finiſht, but to delay it the longer, ſhe did undo at night, whatſoever ſhe had made up in the day.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while <hi>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57461:141"/>
of his own, for he did juſtly fear to be ſlain by thoſe, who were Suiters to his wife. <hi>Minerva</hi> adviſed him in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſguiſe himſelf, and in the habit of a poor Country fellow to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known firſt to <hi>Telemachus</hi> his Son, and to one of the old Officers of his houſe, which when he had performed, with their aſſiſtance he put to death all thoſe of whom he was jealous, and ſo entred again into the poſſeſſion of his Eſtate and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                        <p>But after all this his mind could not be in reſt, becauſe <hi>Tireſias</hi> the Soothſayer had informed him, that one of his Sons ſhould one day kill him. Therefore to prevent this miſchance, his reſolution was to forſake the world and to retire himſelf into ſome deſolate and ſolitary place there to end his dayes in peace.

                        <p>About this time <hi>Juno</hi> the ſworn enemy of the <hi>Trojans</hi> ſent to <hi>Aeolus</hi> the god of the winds to perſwade him to let them

Protection from his Queen, who received them very kindly. She grew ſo amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that ſhe was willing to have made him her husband, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reſolution, that ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken to marry none after <hi>Sicheus</hi> unto whom ſhe had devoted her heart and affections, when therefore <hi>Hiarbus,</hi> King of <hi>Getulia,</hi> her neighbour, was a Suiter to her, ſhe ſent him back with a flat denial, and by that means procured unto herſelf his diſpleaſure.</p>
                        <p>But when <hi>Aeneas</hi> had made ſome ſhort ſtay in this place, <hi>Jupiter</hi> diſpatcht away a meſſenger unto him to command him to leave <hi>Africa</hi> and obey his Deſtinies that did call him into <hi>Italy. Dido</hi> endeavoured in vain to ſtop him; when therefore ſhe ſaw him reſolved to depart, ſhe loaded him with the curſes and reproaches of a furious and deſpairing Lover, then having cauſed a pile of wood to be erected, ſhe aſcended upon it and kill'd her ſelf, with a ſword prepared for that purpoſe. Her body was burning in the ſight of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when he was under ſail. <hi>Virgil</hi> relates the Story in this manner in the Fourth Book of the <hi>Aeneids</hi> after that in the Firſt he had deſcribed that furious Storm that caſt him after his depart from <hi>Sicily</hi> upon the coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> where he was joyfully received by <hi>Dido.</hi> In the ſecond he relates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Queen, the manner of the burning
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57461:144"/>
of <hi>Troy,</hi> and in the Third Book, he gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her an account of the ſeveral particulars, that had happened unto him after his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Troy,</hi> until his firſt arrival into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> for the next year after he was forced by another tempeſt to put into <hi>Sicily,</hi> when he had left <hi>Carthage.</hi> At this time he paid unto the memory of his Father <hi>Anchiſes</hi> many funeral Rites, celebrating ſeveral ſorts of playes and combats upon his tomb. Afterwards he left all the weak and decri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit perſons, uſeleſs in war, with <hi>Alceſtes,</hi> with the reſt of his companions he paſſed into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He arrived very happily at <hi>Cumes,</hi> where he viſited the <hi>Sybil</hi> in her Cave, that by her means he might go down into Hell, and enter into the <hi>Eliſian</hi> Fields, to diſcourſe with his Father, and learn all the paſſages of his life, and his future adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He performed this Journey in the company of the <hi>Sybil,</hi> having firſt found the golden branch, which was at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Hell, and which was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by him to <hi>Proſerpina.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At his return from Hell he puts again to <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſails with his Fleet to the mouth of the River of <hi>Tiber,</hi> from thence he went to <hi>Laurentum</hi> to viſit King <hi>Latinus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> who did command in that place. This Prince received him with all expreſſions of kindneſs, and when he underſtood the cauſe of his coming, he promiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb facs="tcp:57461:145"/>
upon him his onely Daughter, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinia</hi> in marriage, becauſe he had been informed by the Oracle, that the gods had deſigned her for this forrein Prince. She had been nevertheleſs promiſed before to <hi>Turnus</hi> the King of the <hi>Rutuli,</hi> and <hi>Amata</hi> the Queen her Mother, the Wife of <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> did mightily favour him.</p>
                        <p>This happy beginning did increaſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, and raiſe the Spirits of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and cauſed him to forget all the miſeries, that he had endured in his long voyage of ſo many years. But <hi>Juno</hi> was not a little diſpleaſed at his felicity, therefore ſhe ſent for <hi>Alecto,</hi> one of the furies of Hell to kindle a war, and deſtroy the hopes of the Trojans.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Turnus</hi> had underſtood theſe paſſages, he gathered all his forces, and thoſe of his friends together to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and his <hi>Trojans.</hi> But their number being few, and not able to reſiſt, the god <hi>Tiberinus</hi> encouraged them, when they were ready to faint away for fear, and adviſed <hi>Aeneas</hi> to aſcend higher up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country to the place, where <hi>Rome</hi> was afterwards built, to viſit King <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> with whom he made a firm league, and from whom he obtained ſuccours, which <hi>Pallas</hi> the only Son of this Prince was reſolved to lead in Perſon to aſſiſt <hi>Aeneas.</hi> He departed therefore with them to joyn with the Trojans, whileſt <hi>Aeneas</hi>

accepting of a favourable opportunity, that was there preſented unto him to engage the <hi>Tyrrhenians</hi> in his party, he departed into that Country to perſwade them, he found them all in arms againſt their King <hi>Mezentius,</hi> who had committed moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelties, for he did joyn and tie the living to the dead, placing their mouths and all the foreparts of the bodies of the one againſt the ſame members of the other, and did cauſe them to languiſh to death in this moſt cruel and loathſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                        <p>The Poets do relate alſo how <hi>Amphion</hi> with the harmony of his Lute built the Walls of <hi>Thebs,</hi> becauſe he perſwaded by his fair ſpeeches, all the Inhabitants of the Forreſts, and the wild people of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, to come and live together in that City. <hi>Prometheus</hi> taught the way of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> from whence he did continually behold the Stars, and ſtudy their motions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences: Therefore the Poets did declare, that <hi>Mercurius</hi> had bound him to this Mountain, and that an Eagle was put to conſume his Liver. By this laſt Fiction, they did ſignifie, how the thoughts of his ſtudies did eat him up. They did alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that his Brother <hi>Atlas</hi> did carry the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57461:157"/>

                        <p>About that time <hi>Argus</hi> built a City, which he called it after his own name, and becauſe he was a moſt watchful Prince, and very circumſpect, the Poets did give unto him many eyes.</p>
                        <p>We have already ſaid in the ſtory of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> how he repreſents the qualities of a brave Commander. <hi>Pegaſus</hi> there mentioned, is nothing elſe but the Ship that carried <hi>Bellerophon</hi> againſt the <hi>Chimera;</hi> and the wings of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> were nothing elſe but the ſails of a Ship which he invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry himſelf out of <hi>Creta.</hi> What is related of his Son <hi>Icarus,</hi> and of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> repreſents the Picture of the ambitious men; as the ſtories of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and of the Harpies, do ſhadow out unto us the Covetous, and the Syrens the Voluptuous.

command the Fleet: <hi>Pluto</hi> was the God of Hell, becauſe he invented the Funeral Rights paid unto the Dead. The Court of every King was as a Heaven, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Gods. If any happened to be driven from thence, he was ſaid to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of Heaven: If any did eſcape from an eminent danger, by flying from it, they did publiſh, that he was metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a Bird: If any did hide himſelf in the Woods, he was ſaid to be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Beaſt, as it happened with <hi>Lycaon</hi> the Son of <hi>Pelaſgus,</hi> King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who was purſued by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becauſe of his Railleries and Jeſts which he did caſt upon the Worſhip of the Gods: The Poets therefore ſeigned, that he was changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wolf.</p>

However theſe things were firſt invented, it is certain that during many hundred years they were publiſhed and believed for truths, therefore the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did acknowledge nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and ſacred, becauſe they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> their Temples, their Sacrifices, and their Solemnities, were conſecrated to theſe kind of Divinities, as the holy Scripture, and all profane and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Authors do inform us; as the Fathers of the Primitive Church of Chriſt did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the Heathens, and as ſome of them, after their Converſion to the Faith, did openly confeſs.</p>
                        <p>And let us not imagine, that theſe Fables were only popular errors, for the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, learned in the Myſteries of Nature, and acquainted with many diſcoveries of the true God, did nevertheleſs promote all manner of Idolatry and Superſtition, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> for they were afraid of the Laws of the Country, that did not ſuffer any to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57461:159"/>
them; therefore they did haſtily comply with the Opinions and ſacrilegious Tales of the people. It is ſtrange, that the Monarchs, and the Commonwealths, full of the wiſeſt and moſt excellent Polititians, have been ſo blind, as to adore the Stars, the Elements, and the Princes that reigned before them. Thus the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Baal,</hi> otherwiſe named <hi>Belus,</hi> who had been the firſt King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> The Hiſtory of <hi>Daniel</hi> doth alſo relate unto us, that the Emperour of <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to the Religion of his Country, did adore not only the God <hi>Belus,</hi> but alſo a great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon which <hi>Daniel</hi> broke in pieces, to ſhew unto them who was the true God.</p>
                        <p>When the Egyptians were moſt Famous for learning, they did conſecrate their Temples to the God <hi>Serapis,</hi> which was an Ox<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> marked in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; becauſe they did believe that <hi>Oſiris,</hi> one of their Kings, the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> had been metamorphoſed into an Oxe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death. From hence the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did derive their ſhameful cuſtom and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of worſhipping Golden Calves.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did adore the Sun, and named him <hi>Oſiris;</hi> and the Moon, and called her his Wife Queen <hi>Iſis.</hi> They did alſo believe, that the Cats, the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dils, and the Onions, were to be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as Gods, becauſe the Gods went into <hi>Egypt</hi> to hide themſelves in the ſhape of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57461:159"/>
thoſe things during the War of the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
                        <p>The Romans, by the Decrees of their Senat, placed amongſt the Gods many of their <hi>Caeſars,</hi> beſides that infamous Varlet <hi>Antinoüs,</hi> the Favourite of the Emperour <hi>Adrian.</hi> To flatter and alleviate the grief of this Prince conceived for his death, they perſwaded him that <hi>Antinoüs</hi> was changed into a new Star, which appeared about that time in the Heavens.</p>
                        <p>Therefore from hence we may conclude, that theſe follies and impieties were not only amongſt the ſilly Vulgar, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the greateſt Wits, and Nobleſt men; and that they were eſteemed as Maxims of Religion in the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Empires and Commonwealths. This blindneſs and exceſſive folly will appear more plainly unto us, by that which we ſhall declare in the firſt Chapters of the next Book, concerning the worſhip paid to the Heathen Idols.

                     <p>THE knowledge of a God doth neceſſarily require from us O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Worſhip, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: which we are bound in Juſtice to render to him as to a being infinitely excelling all the reſt, and to whom we owe our ſelves, and all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. From hence proceeds Religion, which is the ſublimeſt and moſt excellent of all the moral virtues. It teacheth us how to adore our God with outward expreſſions of humility, as well as with inward, that we may acknowledge thereby his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over us. It teacheth us to make our addreſſes unto him by Prayer, as to the first ſource from whence iſſue all our good things. It teacheth us to publiſh his

Praiſes, to glorify his Greatneſs, and offer unto him Sacrifices, becauſe he is the first principle, and the laſt end of all his Creatures; He is the abſolute Lord of Life and Death. It teacheth us alſo for theſe reaſons to erect Temples, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Dayes to worſhip him, that we might have both times and places to mind us of our obligations to him. Theſe duties we ought as his Servants and Vaſſals, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with all diligence and delight.</p>
                     <p>But the Devils having baniſhed from the world the true knowledge of God, and eſtabliſhed themſelves in his room, they obliged man kind to adore them and their Statues inſtead of God, and uſurped by that means all the Prerogatives and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Rights of the God-head. For unto them all publick and private Prayers, and Vows were directed, for them the Temples and Altars were built, and the Feſtival dayes, the Sacrifices, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Plays, and ſuch like Ceremonies were instituted, as we ſhall ſee in this laſt Book of this Treatiſe.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Images or Statues are viſible expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Reverence: And becauſe they have a relation ſometimes to Perſons of Honour, who have deſerved from us our eſteem, they ſeem to demand ſome kind of reſpect; and in proceſs of time they do appear venerable Monuments of former Ages. But the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

done unto them, is intended only to the Perſons that they do repreſent.</p>
                     <p>Thus in the Church of Chriſt, He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed unto us by Images to raiſe our mind to the contemplation of this Holy Saviour, and to cauſe the ruder ſort of People to learn the myſteries of his Life and Death. But the Heathens did commit two grievous Sacriledges by erecting Statues to their Gods; <hi>Firſt,</hi> They did acknowledge others beſides the true God Almighty, who only is worthy of our ſervices, and of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme religious reſpect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They did eſteem theſe material Statues as Gods, and did Worſhip and Adore the Works of their hands.</p>
                     <p>For we muſt take notice, that Idols pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly are not Images of real things, but of falſe Divinities, or of ſuch as were unjuſtly Honoured as Gods; Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle informs us that an Idol is nothing, which cannot be ſaid of the Images of the Saints, becauſe they do expreſs Perſons that are really in being.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we muſt obſerve, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did adore theſe very Idols as Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which was not only the miſtake of the vulgar ſort of men, but of the Learned; Some I confeſs of them did acknowledge the folly of ſuch Practices. This is confirmed unto us in many places of Holy Scripture, in 14 of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> where <hi>David</hi> upbraids the Idolaters becauſe they did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

This was alſo practiſed by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who ſcourged their Children in honour of <hi>Mercurius.</hi> The <hi>Germans,</hi> and the <hi>Cimbri</hi> did ſacrifice alſo Men, when they had cruelly tormented them. Some of the Heathens did chooſe the aged, to caſt them into a River to pleaſe their Gods, and to free themſelves from the trouble of their companies, eſpecially when they grew decrepit and uſeleſs, therefore they were called <hi>Senes depontani.</hi> The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the moſt Northerns Climates, did dreſs for them a Feaſt, where they did make merry with their friends, and then they did crown them with Garlands, and caſt them down from the top of a high Rock into the Sea. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> ſpeaks of the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> who did trim up a great Statue made of branches of Ozier, and then did fill it with Men alive, to burn them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their Idols. <hi>Alexander</hi> ab <hi>Alexandro</hi> mentions a certain <hi>Ariſtomenes,</hi> who in a Sacrifice cauſed 300 Men to be ſlain in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his God.

paſs between two fires ſo often, till they were miſerably ſcorched. They did alſo ſhut them up in a hallow Idol of Braſs called <hi>Moloch,</hi> that was red hot; and whiles theſe innocent Victims were conſuming in this manner, they did ſound the Trumpets, and beat the Drums and other Inſtruments, that the People might not hear the complaints and outcries of the poor creatures; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place was called <hi>Tophet,</hi> that is, a Drum. <hi>Achaz</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> Kings of <hi>Jadea,</hi> were ſo wretched, as to cauſe their Children to paſs through this Fire: From hence we may ſee, unto what exceſs of impiety and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they were arrived by the Devils perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Sacrifices that were offered for the deceaſed, were no leſs inhumane, for many Nations did keep this cuſtom at the Funerals of Perſons of Quality, to kill and burn with them ſuch as had been acceptable to them in their lives, and ſuch as were judged able to do them ſervice in the other world. Some did take in War as many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners as they could, to ſacrifice them at this time, as <hi>Virgilius</hi> tells us; and <hi>Homerus</hi> relates how <hi>Achilles</hi> butcher'd twelve <hi>Trojans</hi> to <hi>Patroclus</hi> his dear friend. Alſo that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Gladiator <hi>Spartacus,</hi> who was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and daring, as to raiſe an Army of Slaves in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to march againſt the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> did force 300 of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War to kill themſelves in honour of his Captains ſlain in the Fight, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57461:172"/>
unto them the favour of the infernal Gods. This cruel Ceremouy became ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> that ſcarce any of the Chieftains of the Commonwealth, or of the Emperors did die, but ſeveral thouſands of Gladiators did follow them.</p>
                     <p>Now there were ſeveral <hi>Kinds</hi> of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices amongſt the Heathens: When they were made for the increaſe of the Fruits of the Earth, which was done after that they had led the Victim round about the Fields. <note place="margin">Others went about the City and were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Amburba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les hoſtiae.</hi>
                        </note>Theſe Sacrifices were named <hi>Ambarvalia,</hi> or <hi>Ambarvales hoſtiae.</hi> Sometimes they did offer a hundred Beaſts at a time; as a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Oxen, and this was called <hi>Hecatomb.</hi> We ſhall not inſiſt upon the different kinds of Offerings, but proceed to the principal Ceremonies that were commonly obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a choice was made of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals according to the diſpoſition of the Gods unto whom the Sacrifice was to be offered. For <hi>Mars</hi> did love no creatures, but only ſuch as were furious and war-like; as the Buck which was not lawful to be ſacrificed to <hi>Jupiter. Neptunus</hi> did affect the Horſe and the Bull. The He-Goat was dedicated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> becauſe it is a creature that ſpoils the Vineyards. The Cowes were killed in honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and of <hi>Juno.</hi> The She-Goats were offered to <hi>Diana,</hi> and the young Kids to <hi>Faunus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They were to be very careful to ſee that the Victims had no blemiſh nor ſpot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57461:172"/>
it was to paſs through a Ceremony cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Luſtration.</hi> This was alſo practiſed with them who were preſent at the Sacrifices. If they had any natural default, they were to be gone. The Herald gave them notice, by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Pocula luſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant ſulphure &amp; aqua pura &amp; aliquando cum ovo &amp; piſce.</note>

                     <p>After this, they did dance round about the Altar, ſinging Hymns and ſongs in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the God unto whom the ſacrifice was made. In theſe Hymns there were three Stances or Parts; The firſt called <hi>Strophe,</hi> was ſung in turning from the Eaſt to the Weſt: The other named <hi>Antiſtrophe,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the Weſt to the Eaſt; then they did ſtand before the Altar, and ſing the <hi>Epode</hi> which was the laſt part of the ſong. All this while it did concern the Prieſt to

be wonderfully intent about his buſineſs. The Herald was wont to forwarn him by theſe words, <hi>Age quod agis,</hi> as he did the People in the beginning, by telling them <hi>favete linguis;</hi> thereby he did ſignify unto them, how every one was to hold his peace.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Addit. Not.</note> There was a great difference in the order and manner of the Ancient Sacrifices. The chief was between the Honours offered to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Gods, and between thoſe that were paid to the Infernal, the Maritime and Terreſtrial Gods.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſuperior Gods did require high Altars in eminent places, and their Temples were to be built upon ſuch high ground, that they might without any impediment receive the firſt Rayes of the Suns riſing upon our Horizon. The Prieſt was to appear in a Purple or a white Gown, and before he did approach the Altar, <note place="margin">This they Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Jews, and moſt of their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſee <hi>Court Gentil.

The Heathens did fancy that this waſhing did cleanſe at the ſame time the Soul from its defaults, and render it acceptable to the Gods. He did then lead the Victime to the Altar with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and Ribbons upon his own, and the beaſts head, followed by a crowd of people. The Purveyer of Wood had a care to provide ſuch as was acceptable to the Divinity. It was the cuſtom, when Sacrifices were to be offered to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to offer ſome preparatory things, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Praecidaneae hoſtiae,</hi> to the Doemones or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57461:173"/>
that they might intercede and convey the Prayers ſafe up into the preſence of God: If they did not ſeem happy by ſome unluckie Sign, they did then offer others, which were called <hi>Succidaneae hoſtiae.</hi> The Victime that was to be offered, was to remain near the Altar a little ſpace of time, during which the Prieſt did offer a ſet form of Prayer to <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Veſta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> then he did mark the Beaſt with his Knife from the Head to the Tail, and if it did appear unruly, and unwilling to ſtay there longer, they did imagine that God would have none of it, therefore they did fetch another. <note place="margin">From hence comes <hi>immol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When the War was intended againſt any Nation, the chief of theſe Prieſts called <hi>Pater Patratus,</hi> was ſent to declare it. And when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace were concluded, he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before an Altar, with a Hog at his Feet, which he did knock down, deſiring
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57461:176"/>
the Gods, that thoſe who did break the Treaty by any hoſtility might periſh miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, as that Hog.</p>
                     <p>There were alſo in <hi>Rome</hi> ſeveral ſorts of Soothſayers, whoſe Office was to foretell the things to come, and to enquire into the will of the Gods when any buſineſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance was in conſultation. Some of them named <hi>Haruſpices,</hi> did draw their conjectures from the ſight of the Entrails of the Victims offered to the Gods. The <hi>Augures</hi> did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie by the flying and motion of the Birds in this manner. The Soothſayer did aſcend upon ſome eminent place with the <hi>Augural</hi> Robe upon his back, and in his hand a crooked ſtaff called <hi>Lituus,</hi> with which he did limit a certain ſpace in the Air named <hi>Templum;</hi> the Birds that did fly within this ſpace, did intimate the things deſired, and they were called <hi>Praepetes:</hi> but the other Birds that were conſulted when they did ſing, were named <hi>Oſcines.</hi>

This was called <hi>Terripavium,</hi> or <hi>Tripudium ſoliſtimum,</hi> becauſe when the meat did fall back again, it did ſtrike the ground: if theſe Pullets did eat nothing, or but ſlowly, they did interpret it for a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſign. This is that which did cauſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57461:177"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies to March or ſtay, and which did govern the Empire; for it was not lawful to reſolve upon any buſineſs of importance until theſe Oracles had been conſulted.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> eſtabliſhed above all theſe Orders of Prieſts, a Society or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Eight <hi>Pontifs,</hi> with a <hi>Chief,</hi> who was Supreme; His office was to regulate all the Ceremonies that did belong to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Gods: He had in his cuſtody the Books of <hi>Sybilla Cumana;</hi> She was one of thoſe Virgins who did ſhew an innocent life in the midſt of the corruption of the Heathens. They being all inſpired from <note place="margin">Named <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea.</hi>
                        </note>Heaven, did foretel many of thoſe things that relate unto Jeſus Chriſt, and unto the chief Myſteries of his Life. But the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did ſhut their eyes to theſe Truths; ſo that they never came to underſtand theſe Predictions till the preaching of the Apoſtles when they left Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>In this Diſcourſe of the Prieſtly Orders, we have only mentioned thoſe that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that were in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt credit. Amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the other Nations of the World, there were ſome that did the ſame Offices. <hi>Diodorus, Siculus, Julius Ceſar</hi> in his Commentaries, <hi>Strabo, Beroſus,</hi> and others, do mention ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently the <hi>Druids,</hi> who had an inſpection into all that relate to the Worſhip of the Gods amongſt the <hi>Gauls.</hi> They were ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57461:177"/>
cruel, that they did ordinarily murder Men upon the Altars of their Gods. At the end of the year their cuſtom was, to go with great Reverence, and gather branches and leaves of Oak, to make a Preſent to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> inviting all the People to the Ceremony by theſe words, which they cauſed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd; <hi>Come to the Oak branches. The new year.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Druids</hi> had the Tutoring of the young Children, who did commonly remain under their diſcipline, and in their keeping about twenty years. They did teach them many Verſes, which they did learn by heart without the aſſiſtance of any writing. Thoſe who had not been inſtructed by theſe <hi>Druids,</hi> were not eſteemed ſufficiently qualifyed to manage the Affairs of State. In their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſemblies, they practiſed that which <hi>Pliny</hi> relates of the Storks, who uſually tear in pieces the laſt that comes to their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to oblige the reſt to be more diligent. This Spirit of cruelty, natural to the Devils of Hell, did appear, not only in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of theſe Men, but alſo in their Schools; for it is reported of one of their Doctors, named <hi>Herophilus,</hi> that he did teach Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in his life, over the bodies of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred living Men, that he opened, only to ſhew the ſecrets and wonders of Nature.</p>

                     <p>THE Feſtival Solemnities of the Heathens were ſuitable to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and fancy of the Gods; and the Ceremonies that they uſed, were nothing but expreſſions of things proper to the Divinity whoſe Feſtivals they did keep. As we have already taken notice, when we have ſpoken of <hi>Cybele,</hi> and of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> In the Feſtival of <hi>Ceres,</hi> her Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers did run up and down with lighted Torches in their hands, becauſe that ſhe did in this manner run about the world after her Daughter <hi>Proſerpina</hi> to ſeek her out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Inhabitants of <hi>Eleuſis</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this Ceremony that was to be acted only by Women, who did in the Temple of <hi>Ceres</hi> commit a thouſand ſhameful pranks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And becauſe <hi>Ceres</hi> did not reveal her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, nor diſcover her deſign, until ſhe had heard of her Daughters welfare, it was not lawful to declare what was acted in her Temple during the Feſtival. We cannot without bluſhing ſpeak of the liberty that the <hi>Roman</hi> Dames did take in the Feſtivals of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Priapus.</hi> In ſome places on the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57461:180"/>
dayes conſecrated to <hi>Pallas</hi> the Goddeſs of War, the Damſels were commanded to meet together, and fight one againſt another, until ſome did fall dead to the ground. At <hi>Rome</hi> in the Feſtival of the <hi>Lupercals,</hi> the Prieſts did run naked about the ſtreets with Goat skins in their hands, becauſe hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Romans</hi> did happily recover their Beaſts when they did run in this manner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them who had driven them away, whiles they were ſacrificing to the God <hi>Pan,</hi> whoſe Prieſts were named <hi>Luperci,</hi> from the place <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lupercal</hi> was the place where <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>R.</hi> were nouriſhed by a Bitch.</note>where his Altars were erected, called <hi>Luper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> were Feſtival dayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted at <hi>Rome</hi> in honour of <hi>Saturn,</hi> in the month of <hi>December;</hi> while they laſted, the People did ſend gifts to their friends, and the Slaves did Lord it over their Maſters, and commit many extravigancies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> were mightily addicted to the obſervance of theſe Feſtival dayes; as the <hi>Athenians</hi> in keeping their <hi>Panathenea,</hi> that were appointed in honour of <hi>Minerva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> did conſecrate their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſolemnities to the God <hi>Apis,</hi> or <hi>Serapis,</hi> which was an Oxe, bearing upon his hide ſome particular marks: He was to live a certain number ofyears, and then the Prieſts did drown him in the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and all the Land did mourn and lament for his death, until another was found with the ſame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57461:181"/>
marks upon him, which cauſed an univerſal rejoycing all over the Countrey, expreſt by all manner of Sports and Banquets.</p>
                     <p>Thus the other Nations did dedicate Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals in honour of their Gods, to ſuch as were proper to certain places, called <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes;</hi> as alſo to their Domeſtick Divinities, and to thoſe illuſtrious Men, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among the number of their Gods. Theſe laſt when they were conſecrated by an <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> were alſo named <hi>Indigetes dij,</hi> becauſe they were freed from all want of earthly things.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Conſecration,</hi> was a Ceremony in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the <hi>Romans</hi> in favour of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, unto whom they did pay Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: The manner of it is thus deſcribed by <hi>Roſinus,</hi> and by <hi>Herodianus.</hi> The Body of the Emperor being buried according to the uſual cuſtom, his Effigies of Wax was placed at the entry of the Pallace upon a large bed of Ivory, ſumptuouſly adorned: The Phyſicians did viſit it during ſeven days, and treat it as if it were alive in the fit of ſickneſs. In the mean while all the <hi>Senate</hi> and Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> were preſent in mourning Habits. When theſe dayes were expired he was held for dead; therefore they did tranſport him to a publick place, where the Magiſtrates did quit their Offices, there the new Emperor was wont to aſcend to a high Pulpit, called <hi>Roſtra,</hi> becauſe it was adorned with the Sterns of Ships taken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57461:181"/>
from the enemies in Sea-fights; from hence he did make a Funeral oration in hononur of the deceaſed. Afterwards they did carry this Image of the Emperor out of the City to the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> where a Pile of <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi> wood was erected to burn it: in the mean while the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen did ride round ſeveral times in order. At laſt the new Emperor with a Torch did ſet the Pile of wood in a flame; At the ſame time an Eagle was diſmiſt from the top of it, which was imagined to carry the Soul of this new God into Heaven.</p>
                     <p>When this <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> or <hi>Conſeration</hi> was ended, the People did Feaſt and divert themſelves with all manner of ſports.

Time brought many alterations to theſe Paſtimes of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for beſides the <hi>Gymnick</hi> Fights, and the Horſe and Chariot Races, they did invent the Butchery of the Gladiators, and the <hi>Naumachias,</hi> or the fight of Ships, and the hunting of divers ſorts of Beaſts; for that purpoſe they erected large <hi>Amphitheatres,</hi> whereof the manner of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Called <hi>Viſoria,</hi> becauſe they were built handſomly for all to ſee. The Seats were called <hi>Cunei</hi> from their form. <hi>Arena vocatur etiam Cavea.</hi>

                     <p>In the bottom of theſe <hi>Amphitheatres,</hi> were large Caves and Dens for to keep the wild Beaſts, or to receive the water, upon which they did repreſent many Sea fights; a little higher were the Vaults, &amp; the Stairs by which they did aſcend to the ſeats. The entrance of theſe vaulted Galleries, were called <hi>Vomitoria,</hi> becauſe of the multitude of People who did commonly burſt out of that place at the end of the ſports.

The Emperor <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> built an <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre</hi> of Stone, which was finiſht by his Son <hi>Titus:</hi> It was able to hold ninety thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſpectators ſitting, with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more upon their legs.</p>
                     <p>The chief ſport of the <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> was that of the Gladiators or Fencers, who were appointed to divert the People in ſpilling their own blood, in the ſame manner as the Duelliſts of our time; A cruel cuſtom intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <note place="margin">

This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travigancy or inhumanity was ſo great, that ſome Emperors gave a thouſand, the others ten thouſand Fencers, that they might fight and continue the ſlaughter, to divert the People many dayes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Fencers were for the moſt part Slaves, kept for this bloody purpoſe. And before they did bring them out, they were wont to ſend them to a Fence-maſter, called <hi>Laniſta,</hi> to prepare them for this Exerciſe. Their Fencing-School was ſtiled <hi>Batualia,</hi> where they did learn to handle the weapons, with a wooden Sword called <hi>Rudis;</hi> ſo that <hi>rudibus batuere,</hi> is to Fence or Exerciſe with this kind of Inſtrument.</p>

                     <p>He that did overcome, was wont to kill his Antagoniſt, if the ſpectators did not ſave his life with the bended Thumb lifted up, by which they did make known their pleaſure; and when they did open the Thumb ſtraight, it was a ſign of condemnation.</p>
                     <p>The oldeſt Fencers did obtain their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſuch as had given any teſtimonie of their valour and activity.

                     <p>The Chaſe of wild Beaſts was one of the moſt pleaſant Paſtimes of the <hi>Circus,</hi> or of the <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> when it was built. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three or four hundred Lyons, or a hundred Auſtriches were to be ſeen at once.

Many Chriſtians have thus ended their dayes for the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they did bring into the middle of the <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> a pleaſant Forreſt full of theſe wild Beaſts running up and down, and did cauſe at the ſame time ſeveral artificial Pipes to be opened, to fill the Air with excellent ſcents and perfumes, ſo that all the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were embalmed to their great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Chriſt judged it ſo; and all the Laws of the World have deem'd it neceſſary in ſuch a caſe, to give way to a Divorce. But becauſe Men might not upon every ſlight occaſion, and every frivolous diſtaſte run to this extremity, the Laws have provided Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts, who are only able to Judge of the Truth of ſuch Reports and Miſcarriages.

The loweſt ſort of People were named <hi>tenuis cenſus homines,</hi> men of a ſmall Eſtate. In every Claſſis were many Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reckoned; ſome mention 139 in all.

At firſt, in ſuch a Potent Empire, it could not but meet with oppoſition. In ſuch a caſe, what ever ſide gets the Victory, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick looſeth its Freedom, unleſs the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be managed by the Publick it ſelf, and ſuch perſons of integrity be intruſted with the defence of Liberty, as may not intend the making of their own Fortunes, rather than the maintenance of the univerſal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Therefore, if either <hi>Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Brutus</hi> had overcome, it is imagined by all rational People, that they had never reſtored unto the <hi>Romans</hi> that beloved liberty which they enjoyed before. The truth is, that then the Empire was grown ſo great, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Citizens ſo powerful, that if there had not been one above them, to moderate their pretentions, and keep them from Diviſions, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had been often troubled vvith civil Wars.

vvhen the Empire began to flouriſh, and the Enemies of it began to multiply, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls were continually imployed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Publick Intereſt from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Invaſion, and in forcing the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations to yield obedience to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Eagles; ſo that they could not mind the domeſtick Affairs: Therefore the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were choſen by the People, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with a Power not much leſs than that of the Conſuls. Their office did oblige them to look to the Publick Revenues, to take an account of every Citizens Eſtate and ability, to correct miſdemeanors and publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces.

But we muſt take notice, that before the Armies did march to find out the Enemy; the General, with the reſt of the ſuperior Officers, were very diligent and careful in the placing of their Men, and diſpoſing of them to the beſt advantage.

They were lightly Armed, and therefore from their ſwiftneſs in Retreats, they were called <hi>Velites.</hi> When the Army was ready to Fight, ſuch did appear at the VVings, or in the Van, as our Forlorn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hope.

                     <p>In the <hi>Roman</hi> Army there was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent varieyt of Weapons fit for all ſorts of encounters and occaſions. In this the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their firſt Warriors did appear in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting ſuch convenient Arms, as might be ſuitable to the ſtrength of their Bodies, and might be able to defend them with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt other People.

                     <p>But before a General did undertake an Expedition againſt the Enemy, it was the cuſtom, not only to conſult the <hi>Augures,</hi> but to enter into the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> and there to begg the aſſiſtance of that God. When he did march with his Army, they were commonly ordered according to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57461:231"/>
dangers, or the ſafety which they did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Every night the Army did Encamp in a convenient place. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> taught the <hi>Romans</hi> the Art and uſe of lodging their Army within a fortifyed Camp every night, for fear of a Surpriſal. The Generals Tent was uſually in the middle, <note place="margin">Castrametari.</note>and the Horſe and Foot placed round about at a convenient diſtance, in ſuch a manner, that there was from the Generals Pavilion ſo many ſtraight Lanes reaching as far as the Fortifications There were commonly four Gates, or places to go out; in every <hi>Roman</hi> Camp.

VVhen they intended to fight the Enemy, <hi>aciem educebant;</hi> They led their Army out in order of Battle, which was not always the ſame: Sometimes the Enemy with which they were to fight, or the nature of the place did cauſe them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Army. The Spear-men called <hi>Haflati,</hi> with the <hi>Velites</hi> did uſually begin the Fight; and if they were worſted, they did retreat to a ſpace left open behind the luſty <hi>Principes,</hi> who did then ſucced in their room, and maintain the Quarrel againſt the Enemy. After them the <hi>Triarij</hi> did fight. <note place="margin">Ad Triarois ventum est.</note>Every wiſe Commander had commonly ſome Reſerves, which were not brought to the

Battle, but in caſe of neceſſity. When the Enemy was ſufficiently weary in the Fight, the Generals did then give order to theſe Reſerves, named <hi>Subſidia,</hi> to fall upon them and end the diſpute. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> ſpeaks of a certain order of Battle, called <hi>Orbis,</hi> which was in caſe of neceſſity, <note place="margin">Orbis vel Globus vocabatur.</note>when the Enemies were numerous, and too powerful for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they did caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a * round Body, that they might more conveniently reſiſt the multitude of their Enemies, who did attach them on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">The Banner was called <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> or <hi>Vexil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>

                     <p>But there was nothing that did more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and increaſe their Power, than their skill in the taking of Fortified Towns. Many times, although the number of the Enemies within, was far greater; and although they had all things neceſſary to oppoſe the Beſiegers, and were lodged within ſuch ſtrong and walls, that it did ſeem a madneſs to offer to take them by force; Yet the <hi>Romans</hi> did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſit down before ſuch places, amd when they had fortifyed themſelves within their VVorks, they did undertake the Beſieging
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57461:232"/>
of them with ſuch ſucceſs, that within a few dayes their Flags and Banners did flie on the top. If the Town walls were low, and the oppoſition not great, they did take it uſually by Aſſault with their Ladders. But if the Beſieged were numerous, and the wayes to the Town eaſie, they did raiſe high Towers of Planks &amp; Beams, cover'd with raw Hides which they did drag cloſe to the walls of the beſieged City. And then they did bring on their Companies under their Bucklers to the Tower, upon which they did aſſend by ſtairs, and ſteps within, to the top, that was equal with the walls; ſo that by that means they did Fight without the leaſt diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>They had ſeveral wayes to take Towns, according to the nature and diſpoſition of the Ground, and the ſcituation and ſtrength of the VValls, they did accordingly imploy ſuch Inſtruments and Engines as were moſt convenient, Theſe are the chief Engines imployed in the Siege of Towns. <hi>Agger,</hi> was a high Mount which they did raiſe near the wall with Earth and Stakes to ſupport it: From the top of this Mount, the <hi>Romans</hi> did fight againſt the beſieged, and kill every man that did appear upon the wall.

They had many move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Towers made of Boards, and covered with raw Hides to hinder them from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they did dragg upon wheels near the Walls, to give the aſſault. They did make their approaches under a large co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering made of Hurdles and Planks, called <hi>Vinea. Teſtudo,</hi> was an Engine, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the upper part of a Tortoiſe, under it the Soldiers did hide themſelve; when they did either draw near the Walls, or when they did undermine them. Sometimes theſe Engines were made of the Bucklers of the Soldiers joyned together. <hi>Muſculi,</hi> were other Engines of Defence, to protect the Soldiers in making the Works for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſault. <hi>Plutei,</hi> were other Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to bring the Soldiers to the Walls without danger.

The Soldiers did caſt down the ſtrongeſt Walls by the frequent blows which they did give with it. <hi>Malleoli,</hi> were a kind of Arrows with a large belly, full of Wild-fire, to burn any thing upon which it did light, and nothing was able to extinguiſh the Fire but Duſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> did beſiege a City, they did before the taking of it, deſire the leave of the Tutelar Gods of the place, and did invite them to dwell at <hi>Rome,</hi> promiſing unto them Temples, Altars, Sacrifices, &amp;c. They were better Soldiers at Land, than at Sea; nevertheleſs, they have had great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and have obtained famous Victories by their Ships, upon which they did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſight as at Land, by joyning their Ships together, and cauſing them to afford a firm ſtanding.

But the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests, unto whom it did belong to teach, did not ſuffer their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines without a ſhaddow, or ſome dark Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem. Their manner was to diſcover unto their Auditors the Myſteries of God, and of Nature in <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> which were certain viſible ſhapes and forms of Creatures, whoſe inclinations and diſpoſitions did lead to the knowledge of the Truths, intended for Inſtruction. All their Divinity, their Philoſophy, and their greateſt ſecrets, were comprehended in theſe ingenious Characters, for fear that they ſhould be prophaned by the inquiſition and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Common People. The Learned of Antiquity ſeem not willing to make them ſhare in any part of the profound ſciences; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Alexander</hi> was diſpleaſed at his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for publiſhing ſome of his Treatiſes that contain the Curioſities of Nature in the common Language. Doubtleſs the Heathens had very good reaſons to keep from the Vulgar ſome of their Myſteries; for they did ſee what we have experienced to our ſorrow, That too much knowledge is as dangerous, as a ſtupid Ignorance, when ſuch do poſſeſs it, who have not wiſdom to make a right uſe of it. Sublime Myſteries in the ſhallow pates of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57461:238"/>
do ſerve but to fill their minds with lofty conceits of their excellency; For as their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs cannot ſuffer them to make it their buſineſs to ſtudy, they can never attain but to the imperfect knowledge of a few Notions, which are apt to bewitch them with an invincible fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their own ſufficiency, and to make them deſpiſe the wholſom admonitions of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I conſeſs we are not to opppoſe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of permitting the People to enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his holy word, but I think it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of this divided Nation, to have ſuch pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Miniſters in every Pariſh, that can know what to Preach to their Auditors. I think it very dangerous to declare indifferently any My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery unto them. <hi>S. Paul's</hi> wiſdom could pro-Vide Milk for Babes, as well as ſtrong meats for grown ſttomaks. Knowledge is to be fitted to the capacities of every one, and ſome Truths are more uſeful concealed than divulged. It is neither juſt nor proper that the ſublime Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the learned Brains, concerning many Myſteries, ſhould be as ordinary as <hi>A B C.</hi> The wiſe Prieſts of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for this cauſe, did vail their knowledges of God, and of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the ſhadow of their <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi> from the view of every Mechannick. But theſe ingenious Inventions were contrived, not only to hinder the ſublime knowledge of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy from being prophaned, but alſo that they might abbreviate the diffuſed Notions of that ſcience, and fit them for a more eaſie
