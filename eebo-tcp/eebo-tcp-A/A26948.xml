         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO
DISSENTERS.</head>
            <p>THE Inſtructions here recommended as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Legacy, were collected out of his own genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Writings, and peruſed by him in his Life-time,
and being much for his Reputation with all ſober Perſons;
he ſeemed well pleaſed with them, notwithſtanding much oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy
and reproach from divers Diſſenters; for in the Preface
to his <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> he ſays, It was objected, that his
Writings differing from the common Judgment, had already
cauſed offence to the Godly; to which he anſwers, If God
bleſs me with opportunity and help, I will offend ſuch Men
much more, by endeavouring farther than ever I have done,
the quenching of that Fire which they are ſtill blowing up,
and detecting the Folly and Miſchief of thoſe Logomachies
by which they militate againſt Love and Concord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
and tear the Church of God. And in his Second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
to <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> he ſtiles himſelf a Long-maligned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
endeavourer of the Churches Vnity and Peace; and in
<hi>p.</hi> 11. of that Book, he thus declares his Chriſtian temper
<pb facs="tcp:41925:3"/>
and reſolution. If Injuries or Intereſt would excuſe any Sin,
I think their are few Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> who have more
inducement to the angry ſeparating way than I have; But
ſhall I therefore wrong the Truth? God forbid! and <hi>p.</hi> 52.
He further tells <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> I repent that I no more diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Spirit of peeviſh quarrelling with Superiours and
Church Orders, and though I ever diſliked it and oppoſed it,
yet that I ſometimes did too much encourage ſuch as were of
their temper, by ſpeaking too ſharply againſt thoſe things
which I thought to be Church Corruptions, and was too loth
to diſpleaſe the Contentious, for fear of being uncapable to do
them good, meeting with too few Religious Perſons that were
not too much pleaſed with ſuch invectives; and when Mr.
<hi>Bagſhaw</hi> objected, that he choſe to communicate on <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day
in a very populous Church, purpoſely that it might be
known; he anſwered, <hi>p.</hi> 76. If a Man by many years for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
all publick Prayers, and Sacraments ſhould tempt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to think that he is againſt them or counts them needleſs,
How ſhould he cure that Scandal, but by doing that openly
and pleading for it which he is ſuppoſed to be againſt? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
being bound to teach the People by Example as well as
Doctrine. The Queſtion which he maintained againſt Mr.
<hi>Bagſhaw</hi> was, Is it lawful to hold communion with ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Churches as have worthy or tollerable Paſtors, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Parochial order of the Miniſters Conformity and
uſe of the Common Prayer-Book? And concludes, <hi>p.</hi> 89. That
we ought to do ſo when ſome ſpecial Reaſons as from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Scandal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do require it.</p>
            <p>He ſaith,<note place="margin">In the 3d. Part of his Life. <hi>p.</hi> 169.</note> I wrote a Book at the end of my <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>
on purpoſe to ſhew the lawfulneſs of communicating with the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> but before it was printed, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
(having heard of it) ſent me 12 Arguments againſt joyning
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I anſwered; whereupon
a ſwarm of Revilers poured out their keeneſt Cenſures upon
<pb facs="tcp:41925:3"/>
me; one ſaid I was an Apoſtate; another ſaid that my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Epiſcopacy fully proved the duty of Separation, and I
were reported to be a pleader for <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Anti-chriſt;</hi> in
Anſwer to all which, I publiſhed a Treatiſe in defence of
<hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> to which I refer you.</p>
            <p>I will tell the World a certain Truth, I Preach, I Write,
I frequently and openly talk againſt Separation, and for the
lawfulneſs of joyning with the Church in the uſe of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and to rebuke Mens extreams and cenſures of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Clergy, and for an impartial Love of all true Chriſtians.
I ſharply reprove the weak Reaſonings of thoſe that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
minded, and by this I occaſion the true Sectarians
every where to ſpeak againſt me, <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 62. I take it for
a duty to Preach againſt Schiſm, Sedition, and Rebellion and
all Principles that tend to breed or feed them, and to uſe all
Opportunities and Intereſt in the People to promote their
Loyalty and Publick Peace, <hi>p.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
            <p>I did not vary from my moſt early Opinion concerning
theſe things, for in my Epiſtle to the <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> I gave
the ſame Admonition to my Flock at <hi>Kidderminiſter</hi> in theſe
words. I charge you in Chriſt's name, as you will anſwer
it when we ſhall meet at Judgment, that you faithfully and
conſtantly practiſe theſe Directions—Above all, ſee that ye
be followers of Peace and Vnity in the Church, and among
your ſelves. I differ from many in ſeveral things of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
moment, yet if I ſhould zealouſly preſs my judgment
on others ſo as to diſturb the Peace of the Church, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from my Brethren, I ſhould fear leaſt I ſhould prove a
Firebrand in Hell, for being a Firebrand in the Church:
And for all the intereſt I have in your Judgments and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
I charge you, that if God ſhould give me up to any
Factious Church-rendring courſe, that you forſake me, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me not a ſtep, believe not thoſe to be Friends of the
Church, who would cure her by cutting her Throat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41925:4"/>
Vpon writing my <hi>Cure of Church Diviſions,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi>
p. 152. Publiſhed other Invectives againſt me, as
that one worthy of credit told him, that the Learned and
Judicious Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> having read that Book, ſaid, That it
had been better for the Church of God, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Friends had never ſent him to School, and that Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi>
had a like opinion of that Book, and that another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as knowing in the Myſtery of Godlineſs, as either of them,
told a Friend of his, that notwithſtanding the noiſe about
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he would end in Fleſh and Blood. But Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> was well fortified againſt theſe obloquies, having been
ſurfeited, as he ſays, with humane Applauſe.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe Clamours and vexatious
Troubles, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> kept a conſtant courſe, pleading for
Concord and Vnity almoſt in every Book which he ſet forth,
and that with ſuch cogent Arguments, as the like are ſcarce
to be found on any other Subject which he hath written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as from the following Admonitions collected out of a few
of his many Treatiſes will appear to the Judicious Reader;
and many more may be obſerved in thoſe that are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in his Writings, wherein although ſome things acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
written, may ſeem to be contradictory, yet as he told
Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> he was well able to reconcile them. And by
his diſtinctions he hath reconciled many ſeeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by help whereof, as Mr. <hi>Silveſter</hi> obſerved in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his Life, as he could ſpeak what he would, ſo he
could prove what he ſpake. I am well perſwaded, that by
the following Collections, any impartial Separatiſt may find
ſufficient Arguments to reſolve all his Scruples and Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt Conformity to the Eſtabliſhed Worſhip, for which
end they are now Publiſhed by the Collector. But I foreſee
it will be neceſſary to obviate two Objections that will be
made againſt theſe Admonitions: Firſt, That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
hath written plain Contradictions to them, and the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:41925:4"/>
Brethren will adhere to his Firſt Sentiments which
lead them to their Non-conformity; to which I Anſwer, That
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gave them this Precaution in one of his first
and best Treatiſes, charging them strictly, that if God
ſhould give him over to any Church-rendring courſe, that they
would forſake him, and not follow him a ſtep. Secondly, That
what they interpret as Contradictions, were in Truth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then Confeſſions of his former miſ-apprehenſions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
heats of his intemperate Zeal; but theſe are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of his ſedate and rational Deliberation. The great
Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was not aſhamed to record in Holy Writ,
what enormities a miſgrounded Zeal had hurried him into,
while he was in an eſtate of Ignorance and Vnbelief, 1 <hi>Tim.
1.</hi> 13. and this doubtleſs was Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s practice for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon what he had ſaid, or done, to countenance the
Separating way; he ſaw it had done more hurt than good,
for which reaſon he recanted them. But theſe inſtructions of
his are like the Coeleſtial Bodies, which carry light and
benign influences with them; they are ſelf-evident, and ſpeak
home to the Judgment and Conſciences of all unprejudiced
Men, who cannot reſiſt the force of that Reaſon and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
which inſpires every part of them with ſo much
Life and Power, Beauty and Ornament, Conſiſtency and
Symmetry, as will render them highly Acceptable, Amiable,
and Beneficial to ſuch as ſhall embrace and practiſe them.
As for ſuch Diſſenters as have conceived any hard thoughts
of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or theſe his Admonitions, I intreat them
to conſider, whether they can anſwer or confute them to the
ſatisfaction of their own Conſciences, and if they cannot, then
whether it be not rational and pious to walk by theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
which tend ſo much to the eſtabliſhment of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace of this divided Church and Nation, and to their
own preſent and eternal welfare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41925:5"/>
2. <hi>Objection.</hi> It may be ſaid that theſe Amonitions are
now become unſeaſonable, there being a Toleration
granted to Men of all Perſwaſions to Worſhip God after
their ſeveral modes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſay, that Schiſm is a Sin antecedent to
all Humane Conſtitutions, as being directly forbid in the
Holy Goſpel, and conſequently will continue to be ſinful, tho'
all the Kings and Rulers of the Earth ſhould indulge, and
tolerate them; for the Laws of Men cannot make void the
Law of God, nor alter the nature of things, and juſtifie or
make that to be good which the only Lawgiver of Chriſtians
hath condemned as unlawful; and as it is ſaid of <hi>Poligamy</hi>
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> connived at it,
for the hardneſs of their hearts, ſo it is for the hardneſs
and uncharitableneſs of Mens Spirits, that Rulers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
for a time to tolerate and bear with many things
that are Offenſive and Prejudicial to the proſperity of their
Government. For Toleration far differs from the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a thing, and implieth the unlawfulneſs thereof, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Juſtification of it. Beſides, the preſent Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is far from intending or making an eſtabliſhment of
the Practiſes which are tolerated to the prejudice of the
Church, which hath for many Ages, and now doth continue
in actual poſſeſſion of all its Powers and Priviledges as in
time past. So that as the preſent Schiſm and Separations
is poſſitively condemned by the Laws of the Goſpel, ſo they
have not any approbation from the Laws of Men, but what the
corruptions of Men, and their ungovernable Tempers make
tolerable on ſome preſſing occaſions, and unhappy juncture of
Affairs.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore read the following Admonitions
without Prejudice, and judge of them by the end for which
they were first written by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and are now publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Prophetical, Prieſtly and Kingly. That is, to teach the

of Nature and lawful Art. As it is Lawful to uſe the help of
Spectacles in reading the Bible, ſo is it of Muſick to exhilerate
the Soul to God. 3. Jeſus Chriſt joyned with the <hi>Jewes</hi> that

Men to juſt Obedience, and preſerve them from any ſinful
Nonconformity to the commands of their Governours, and
the evil effects that are like to follow thereupon.</p>
               <p>§ 2. But Firſt I will lay together ſome Propoſitions for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of the Controverſie; How far we are bound to obey
Mens Precepts about Religion? Eſpecially in caſe we doubt of
the lawfulneſs of obeying them? And ſo cannot obey them in
Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41925:7"/>
§ 3. Briefly: 1. We muſt obey both Magiſtrates and Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
in all things lawful which belong to their Offices to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
2. It belongs not to their Office to make God a new
Worſhip; But to command the Mode and Circumſtances of
Worſhip belongeth to their Office: for guiding them wherein
God hath given them general Rules. 3. We muſt not take
the lawful Commands of our Governours to be unlawful.
4. If we do through weakneſs or perverſneſs take Lawful things
to be unlawful, that will not excuſe us in our diſobedience.
Our error is our Sin, and one ſin will not excuſe another Sin.
Even as on the other ſide, if we judge things unlawful to be
lawful, that will not excuſe us for our diſobedience to God in
obeying Men. 5. As I have before ſhewed, many things that
are miſcommanded, muſt be obeyed. 6. As an erroneous
judgment will not excuſe us from Obedience to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
ſo much leſs will a <hi>doubtfulneſs</hi> excuſe us. 7. As ſuch a
doubting, erring judgment cannot obey in (plenary) Faith, ſo
much leſs can he diſobey in Faith. For it is a known Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, that <hi>we obey them that have the Rule over us:</hi>
but they have no Word of God againſt the act of Obedience
now in quection. It is their own erring judgment that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth
them in a neceſſity of ſinning (till it be changed.)
7. In doubtful Caſes, it is our duty to uſe God's means for
our Information: and one means is to conſult with our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and hear their words with teachableneſs and meekneſs,
8. If upon adviſing with them we remain in doubt about the
lawfulneſs of ſome Circumſtance of order, if it be ſuch as may
be diſpenſed with, they ſhould diſpence with us: if it may
not be diſpenſed without a greater injury to the Church or
Cauſe of God, than our diſpenſation will countervail, then is
it our duty to obey our Teachers, notwithſtanding ſuch doubts:
For it being their Office to Teach us, it muſt be our duty to
believe them with a Humane Faith, in caſes where we have
no Evidences to the contrary: And the Duty of Obeying them ☞
being certain, and the ſinfulneſs of the thing commanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uncertain and unknown, and only ſuſpected, we muſt go
on the ſurer ſide. 9. Yet muſt we in great and doubtful caſes,
not take up with the ſuſpected judgment of a ſingle Paſtor, but
apply our ſelves to the unanimous Paſtors of other Churches.
10. Chriſtians ſhould not be over buſie in prying into the ☞
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41925:8"/>
work of their Governours, nor too forward to ſuſpect their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations:
But when they know that it is their Rulers
work to guide them by determining of due Circumſtances of
Worſhip, they ſhould without cauſeleſs ſcruples readily obey,
till they ſee juſt reaſon to ſtop them in their obedience; They
muſt not go out of their own places to ſearch into the Actions of
another Man's Office, to trouble themſelves without any cauſe.
No reaſon can be given, why a lawful thing ſhould become
unlawful? Becauſe a lawful Superior doth command it, elſe
Superiors may take away all our Chriſtian Liberty, and make
all things unlawful by commanding them; you would take it
ill from a Child or Servant when you bid them learn a Form
of Prayer or Catechiſm, if they ſhould ſay it was lawful for us
till you commanded it, but becauſe you bid us it is unlawful.</p>
               <p>§ 4. And now I intreat all humble Chriſtians readily to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
both Magiſtrates and Paſtors in all lawful things; and to
conſider, to that end, of theſe Reaſons following. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. If
you will not obey in Lawful things, you deny Authority, or
overthrow Government it ſelf, which is a great Ordinance of
God, eſtabliſhed in the fifth Commandment with promiſe:
And as that Commandment reſpecting Societies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, is greater than the following commands, as they
reſpect the private good of our Neighbours, or are but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
means to that Publick good, whoſe Foundation is laid in
the Fifth Commandment; ſo accordingly the ſin againſt this
Fifth Commandment muſt be greater than that againſt the reſt.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. In diſobeying the lawful commands of our
Superiors, we diſobey Chriſt, who ruleth by them as his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
Even as the diſobeying a Juſtice of Peace or Judge
is a diſobeying of the Soveraign Power; yea in ſome caſes when
their Sentence is unjuſt. Some of the Ancient Doctors thought
that the Fifth Commandment was the laſt of the Firſt Table of
the Decalogue; and that the Honouring of Governors is part of
our Honour to God, they being mentioned there as his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
with whom he himſelf is honoured or diſhonoured, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or diſobeyed: For it is God's Authority that the Magiſtrate,
Parent, and Paſtor is endued with, and empowred by to rule
thoſe that are put under them.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. What confuſion will be brought into the Church
if Paſtors be not obeyed in things lawful? For inſtance: If the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41925:8"/>
Paſtors appoint the Congregation to Aſſemble at one hour, and
the People will ſcruple the time, and ſay, it is unlawful, and ſo
will chooſe ſome of them one time, and ſome another, what
diſorder will here be? and worſe, if the Paſtors appoint a Place
of Worſhip, and any of the People ſcruple obeying them, and
will come to another place, what confuſion will here be? Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are many, and the Paſtors are few: And therefore there may
be ſome Unity if the People be ruled by the Paſtors; but there
can be none, if the Paſtors muſt be ruled by the People, for the
People will not agree among themſelves: And therefore if we
obey one part of them, we muſt diſobey and diſpleaſe the reſt.
And their ignorance makes them unfit to rule.</p>
               <p>§ 7. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Moreover, Diſobedience in matters of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
will exclude and overthrow the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Worſhip
it ſelf. God commandeth us to pray: If one part of the Church
will not joyn with a ſtinted form of Prayer, and the other part
will not joyn without it, but both Parties cannot be pleaſed, and
ſo one part muſt caſt off Prayer it ſelf, or ſeparate from the
reſt. God commandeth the Reading, and Preaching, and
Hearing of the Scripture, and the Singing of Pſalms: But he
hath left it to Man to make or chooſe the beſt Tranſlation of
Scripture, or Verſion of the Pſalms. Now if the Paſtor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
one Verſion and Tranſlation, and the Church joyn in the
uſe of it, if any Members will ſcruple joyning in this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Verſion, they muſt needs forbear the whole duty of
Hearing the Scripture, and Singing Pſalms in that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If they pretend a ſcruple againſt the appointed time or
place of Worſhip, they will thereby caſt off the Worſhip it
ſelf. For if they avoid our <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> they cannot meet
with us, nor Worſhip with us.</p>
               <p>§ 8. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. And when they are thus carried to ſeparate
from the Congregation, upon ſuch grounds as theſe, they will
be no where fixt, but may be ſtill ſubdividing, and ſeparating
from one another, till they are reſolved into individuals, and
have left no ſuch thing as a Church among them. For they
can have no aſſurance or probability, that ſome of themſelves
will not diſſent from the reſt in one Circumſtance or other, as
they did from their Paſtors and the Church that they were of
before.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. By this means the Wicked that are Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41925:9"/>
to their Teachers, and reject the Worſhip of God it ſelf,
will be hardened in their Sin, and taught by Profeſſors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Ungodlineſs: For the very ſame courſe that you
take will ſerve their turns. They need not deny any Duty in
the Subſtance, but deny the Circumſtance, and ſo put off the
Subſtance of the Duty. If a Wicked Man will not hear the
Word Preached, he may ſay <hi>[I am not againſt Preaching; but
I am unſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of your Time or Place, I am in
judgment againſt coming to your Steeple-houſe, or againſt the Lord's
Day.]</hi> And ſo he ſhall never hear, though he ſay he is for Heating.
If a Wicked Man will not be perſonally inſtructed, or admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or be accountable to the Church or Paſtors for any ſcandals
of his life, nor ſubmit to any Diſcipline, he may ſay <hi>[I am for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
I know it is my duty to be inſtructed: but I am not ſatisfied that
I am bound to come to you when you ſend for me, or to appear at ſuch
a place as you appoint: the Word of God nameth no time or place, and
you ſhall not deprive me of my Liberty.]</hi> If a Wicked Man would
not hear or read the Scripture, or ſing Pſalms, he may ſay, that
he is for the Duty, but he is only againſt this and that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
and Verſion: And ſo while every Verſion is excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Duty is as much evaded, as if it were denied it ſelf.
By this device it is that the Rebellion of unruly People is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended:
They run to the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the Duty, and ask
[Where are they bound to come to a Miniſter? or to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
by him, in order to a Baptiſm or Lord's Supper? or
to ſpeak their conſent to be Church-members, or to ſubſcribe
to a Profeſſion, or to read an Engliſh Bible, or to hear in a
Steeple-houſe, with many ſuch like.] Thus alſo it is that they
put off Family-prayer, and ask, <hi>[Where are they bound to pray
in their Family Morning and Evening?]</hi> and ſo keep no conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Family-prayer at all, under pretence of denying only
the Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. By this Diſobedience in things lawful, the
Members of the Church will be involved in contentions, and
ſo ingaged in bitter Uncharitableneſs, and Cenſures, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,
and Reproaches of one another: which ſcandalous
courſes will nouriſh Vice, diſhonour God, rejoyce the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
grieve the Godly that are Peaceable and Judicious, and
wound the Conſciences of the contenders. We ſee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſuch Fires are ſmall, but whither they tend, and what
will be the end of them, we ſee not.</p>

§ 11. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. By theſe means alſo Magiſtrates will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to take Men of tender Conſciences for factious, unruly,
and unreaſonable Men, and to turn their Enemies, and uſe
violence againſt them, to the great injury of the Church: when
they ſee them ſo ſelf-conceited, and refuſing Obedience in
lawful Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>§ 12. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. By this means alſo the Converſion and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of Souls will be much hindred, and People poſſeſſed
with Prejudice againſt the Church and Ordinances, when they
take us to be but humorous People, and ſee us in ſuch Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

them to many particular Acts belonging to their Office, that
were never named in their Commiſſion: ſo your general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

And ſo it is alſo betwixt the Paſtors and the Flock, in
Matters belonging to the Office of a Paſtor.</p>
               <p>§ 20. If a Child ſhall ask a Parent, <hi>[Where doth God's Word

So if a School-maſter command his Scholars to come to
ſuch a place to School, and to take their places in ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and to learn ſuch Books, and do ſuch Exerciſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
general Commiſſion that he hath to Teach and Govern them,
will allow him to do all this. (Though it will not allow him
to ſet his Scholars to any Artifice or Manual Operation alien
to his Profeſſion.) So if a Miniſter determine of the variable
Circumſtances of Worſhip, as what Place and People ſhall
come to, and at what time, to be Catechiſed, Examined, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Tranſlation or Verſion of <hi>Pſalms</hi> to uſe,

he is warranted for this by his <hi>General</hi> Commiſſion. And if he
miſs it in the Manner, by chooſing inconvenient Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or by unneceſſary Determination of Points that ſhould
rather be left undetermined to Liberty, thought this be his own
Sin, it will not excuſe the People from Obedience; unleſs the
Errour of his Directions be ſo great as would fruſtrate the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

Peace and Union; yea, before we ſhall ſee the Bleſſing of
Union in the Church. Wounding is a dividing, healing is a
re-uniting; a Building is of many Stones or Pieces orderly
conjoyned; a Church is an Aggregation of Individuals, an
Aſſociation of Believers: What then is it to demoliſh, but to
ſeparate and disjoyn? and what is it to diſſolve Churches, but
to break their Aſſociation, to reduce them to the Individuals,
to cut them into ſhreds?</p>
               <p>As for the Differences in way of Government, between
the moderate <hi>Presbyterians, Independants, Epiſcopal,</hi> and <hi>Eraſtian,</hi>
I make no doubt, but if Mens Spirits ſtood not at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
than their Principles, they would quickly be united.
But of all the four ſorts, there are ſome that run ſo high in
their Principles, that they run out of the hearing of Peace or
Truth.—For <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> and <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> God ſpake ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
againſt them, by thoſe wondrous Monſters in <hi>New-England;</hi>
but Wonders are over-lookt, where the heart is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and God intends to get his Juſtice a Name. The fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Deluſions, that God hath formerly given them over to,
and the horrid Confuſion which they have introduced where
they have ſprung, hath ſpoken fully againſt both theſe later
Sects. The weeping Eyes, the bleeding Sides, the lacerated
Members of theſe Churches, the reproach of the Goſpel, the
diſappointed Reformation, the hideous Doctrines, and unheard
of Wickedneſs that hath followed them, the contemned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
the reproached, ſlandered, and ejected Miniſters,
the Weak that are ſcandalized, the Profeſſors are apoſtalized,
the Wicked hardned, and the open Enemies of the Goſpel,
that now inſult; all theſe do deſcribe them more plainly to
<hi>England,</hi> than words can do, and cry loud in the Ears of
God and Man. What will be the Anſwer, time will ſhew;
but from <hi>Rev. 2. 14, 15, 16, &amp;c.</hi> we may probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>He that is not a Son of Peace, is not a Son of God. All
other Sins deſtroy the Church conſequently, but Diviſion and
Separation demoliſh it directly. Building the Church is but an
orderly joyning of the Materials, and what then is disjoyning
but pulling down? Many Doctrinal differences muſt be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
in a Church, and why, but for Unity and Peace?
therefore Diſunion and Separation is utterly intolerable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

not thoſe to be the Churches Friends, that would cure
and reform her by cutting her throat. Thoſe that ſay, no
truth muſt be concealed for Peace, have uſually as little of the
one as the other. Study <hi>Gal. 2. 22. Rom. 14. 1. Acts 21. 24,
26. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 4. &amp; 6. 4. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 8, 9. I hope, ſad experience
ſpeaks this leſſon to your very hearts, if I ſhould ſay nothing.
Do not your hearts bleed to look upon the State of <hi>England,</hi>
and to think how few Towns, or Cities there be (where is
any forwardneſs in Religion) that are not cut into ſhreds and
crumbled as to duſt, by Separations and Diviſions? To think
what a wound we have hereby given to the very Chriſtian
Name, how we have hardned the Ignorant, confirmed the
Papiſts, and are our ſelves become the ſcorn of our Enemies,
and the grief of our Friends, and how many of our deareſt

Pillars of Salt, ſee that you remember them. Though of your

not. If there be erroneous practices in the Church, keep your
ſelves innocent, with Moderation and Peace. It muſt be no
ſmall Error, that muſt force a Separation. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that if a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould keep the Ceremonial Law, ſo he

he would imbrace him, and have communion with him. <hi>Paul</hi>
would have him received, that is weak in the Faith, and not
Un-church whole Pariſhes of thoſe that we know not, nor were
ever brought to a juſt trial. I ever loved a godly peaceable
Conformiſt, better than a turbulent Non-conformiſt. I differ
from many, in ſeveral things of conſiderable moment, yet if
I ſhould zealouſly preſs my judgment on others, ſo as to diſturb

pray) that you forſake me, and follow me not a ſtep. And

for peace with one another, follow it with all your might, <hi>If

begin to break forth, in Cenſoriouſneſs, Reproaches, and hard
Speeches of others, be as ſpeedy and buſie in quenching it, as
if it were Fire in the Thatch of your Houſes. For why ſhould
your Houſes be dearer to you than the Church, which is the
Houſe of God? Or your Souls, which are the Temples of
the Holy Ghoſt? Hath God ſpoke more againſt any Sin than

Damm, and thought it injurious to be reſtrained of its liberty,
and therefore combined with the Winds, to raiſe a Tempeſt,
and ſo aſſault and beat down the Banks in their rage; And
now where is that peaceable Aſſociation of Waters? We feel
now, how thoſe are miſtaken that thought the way for the

If you take them, but as the ancient Churches did, for ſuch as

not declared what Perſon the Sponſors bear, nor any farther

may agree that the God-fathers ſhall do all this as their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

if they may do ſo in the Pſalms in Metre, there
can be no reaſon given, but they may lawfully do ſo in Pſalms
in Proſe; for ſaying them, and ſinging them, are but modes
of Utterance, and the ancient Singing was liker our Saying,

from bearing their part in the Praiſes of the Church.
The uſe of the Tongue keepeth awake the Mind, and ſtirreth
up God's Graces in his Servants. It was the decay of Zeal
in the People, that firſt ſhut out the Reſponſes: while they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41925:16"/>
kept up the Ancient Zeal, they were inclined to take their
part vocally in the Worſhip. And this was ſeconded by the
Pride and Uſurpation of the Prieſts thereupon; who thought
the People of God too prophane to ſpeak in the Aſſemblies,
and meddle ſo much with Holy things. Yet the very remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of former zeal cauſed moſt Churches to retain many
of the words of their predeceſſors, even when they loſt the
Life and Spirit which ſhould animate them; and ſo the ſame
words came into the Liturgies, and were uſed by too many,
cuſtomarily, and in formality, which their Anceſtors had uſed
in the ſervour of their Souls. And if it were not, that a

And for kneeling when the Decalogue is read: That the

and the omiſſion would be offenſive, I would uſe it, though
miſtaken Perſons were preſent, becauſe I cannot diſobey nor

Adminiſtration of the Common-Prayer-Book? Anſw.</hi> 1. That it
is not unlawful to receive according to the Adminiſtration of
the Common-Prayer-Book, becauſe it is a Form, needs no
proof to any, that is Judicious. 2. Nor yet, for any evil in
this particular Form, for in this part the Common-Prayer is
generally approved. 3. Nor yet, becauſe it is impoſed; for
a Command maketh not that unlawful to us, which is lawful
before, but it maketh many things lawful, and duties, that
elſe would have been unlawful accidentally. 4. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of the Commanders we have little to do with. And
for the conſequents, they muſt be weighed on both ſides, and
the conſequents of our refuſal will not be found light. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
I muſt here tell the People of God, in the bitter ſorrow
of my Soul, that at laſt it is time for them to diſcern that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
that hath in all Ages of the Church almoſt, made
this Sacrament of our Union, to be the grand occaſion or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Diviſions. And that, true Humility, and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with our ſelves, and Love to Chriſt, and one another,
would ſhew ſome Men, that it was but their Pride and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and Ignorance, that made them think ſo heinouſly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mens manner of Worſhip. And that, on all ſides, among
true Chriſtians, the manner of their Worſhip is not ſo odious,
as Prejudice, and Faction, and Partiality repreſenteth it. And
that God accepteth that, which they reject. And they ſhould
ſee, how the Devil hath undone the common People, by this
means, by teaching them every one to expect ſalvation for being
of that Party which he taketh to be the right Church, and for
Worſhipping in that manner which he, and his Party, thinketh
beſt. And ſo wonderful a thing is prejudice, that every Party,
by this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſt. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi> p. 48.</note> is brought to think that ridiculous and vile, which the
other Party accounteth beſt. But to magnifie any one Church
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41925:23"/>
or Party, ſo as to deny due love and communion to the reſt, is
Schiſm. To limit all the Church to your Party, and deny all,
or any of the reſt, to be Chriſtians, and parts of the Univerſal
Church, is Schiſm, by a dangerous breach of Charity. It is
Schiſm alſo, to condemn unjuſtly any particular Church, as
no Church. And it is Schiſm, to withdraw your bodily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
from a Church that you were bound to hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with, upon a falſe ſuppoſition that it is no Church, or is
not lawfully to be communicated with. And it is Schiſm, to
make Diviſions or Parties in a Church,<note place="margin">P. 49.</note> though you divide not
from that Church. The holineſs of the Party that Men adhere
to, is made a pretence to excuſe Schiſm; but this muſt make
but a gradual difference in our eſteem and love to ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
above others. If really they are moſt holy, I muſt love
them moſt, and labour to be as holy as they: But I muſt not
therefore, unjuſtly deny communion, or due reſpect to other
Chriſtians, that are leſs holy, nor cleave to them as a Sect, or
divided Party, whom I eſteem moſt holy. For the holieſt are
moſt Charitable, and moſt againſt the Diviſions among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and tendereſt of their Unity and Peace. Own the beſt,
as beſt, but none, as a divided Sect; eſpouſe not their dividing
intereſt; confine not your eſpecial love to a Party, but extend
it to all the Members of Chriſt. Deny not local Communion
when there is occaſion for it, to any Church, that hath the
Subſtance of True Worſhip, and forceth you not to ſin.
Love them as true Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Baxter <hi>of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 3.</note> and Churches, even when they
drive you from their Communion. I have found that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is to be accompliſhed more by reſtoration of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

by utter abolition.</p>

               <p>§ 1. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the 2d. page of his exceptions againſt the
Liturgy, urged an Objection of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> in theſe Words. To
load our Publick Forms with Private Fancies on which we
differ, is the moſt ſoveraign way to perpetuate Schiſm, See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<hi>p.</hi> 48. The Biſhops gave this Anſwer to the Objection;
<hi>We heartily deſire that according to this Propoſal, great care may be
taken to ſuppreſs private Conceptions of Prayer, leſt private Opinions
be made matter of Prayer, as it hath, and will be, if private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
take liberty to make publick Prayers.</hi> To this I agreed, <hi>p. 201.

               <p>Q. 74. <hi>Is it lawful to impoſe Forms on the Congregation in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip? Anſw.</hi> Yes, and more than lawful. It is the
Paſtors duty ſo to do; for whether he forethink what to pray,
or not, his Prayer is to them a Form of Words, and they are
bound to concur with him in Spirit or Deſire, and to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
So that every Miniſter by Office is daily to impoſe a Form of
Prayer on all the People; only ſome Men impoſe the ſame
Form many times over, or every day, and others impoſe every
day a new one. <hi>pag. 140. Ibid.</hi>

own judgment is, that ſomewhat of both ways joyned together
will beſt obviate the inconveniencies of both, though by this
I croſs the conceits of prejudiced Men on both extremes; I
think I croſs not the judgment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>

and concluded with the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Pag. 102. <hi>Of, Mr.</hi> Baxter'<hi>s life,</hi> Part 1. Under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the purity of their Churches, the Separatiſts ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the ſame Men, that the Drunkards and Swearers
ſet againſt, doing what they could to make them odious, and
put them down, only they did it more profanely than the
Profane, in ſaying, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified; let the Goſpel be
propagated;</hi> abuſing Sacred Scripture to their purpoſe. All this
began in unwarrantable Separations, and too much aggravating
the faults of the Churches, and Common People, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book,
and Miniſtry, which becauſe they thought
they needed amendments it required their obſtinate Separation,
and allowed them to make odious any thing that was amiſs
and if any Man had rebuked them for making it more faulty
than it was, they called him a pleader for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi>
and every eror in the mode of Worſhip was Idolatry, Popery,
Antichriſtianiſm, Superſtition, Will-worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When many
of their own Prayers were full of Carnal Paſſion, Faction,
Diſorder, vain Repetitions, unſound and loathſome Expreſſions,
and their Doctrine full of Errors and Confuſſion.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Pag. 169. Part. 3. <hi>Of</hi> B'<hi>s Life.</hi> I wrote a Book called
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> intending a third Part, to tell Diſſenters, why I
went to the Pariſh Church, and Communicated; and why
they ſhould not ſuffer as Separatiſts, leaſt they ſuffer as Evil
doers; which a <hi>Bookſeller</hi> importuned me to let him Print,
but for Reaſons then given, I delayed it; but at laſt conſented
to publiſh the Reaſons of my Communicating in the Pariſh
Churches, and againſt Separations: But a Manuſcript of Dr.
<hi>Owen</hi>'s, containing Twelve Arguments againſt joyning with
the Liturgy in Publick Churches was ſent me, which I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereupon a ſwarm of Revilers powred out their keeneſt
Cenſures whom I anſwered. Another ſaid, that my Treatiſe
of Epiſcopacy fully proved the duty of Separation; whereupon
I explained that Treatiſe, and all theſe things together I Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in a Treatiſe in defence of <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> to
which I refer ſuch as deſire farther Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>§ 7. I ſhall name but one Paſſage more on this Head, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41925:24"/>
his <hi>Defence of the Principles of Love.</hi> pag. 88. The Covenant (he
ſaith) bindeth us to Reformation according to God's Word,
and the Example of the beſt Reformed Churches: But to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no Publick Worſhip, or a worſe before the Liturgy, is
Deformation and Profaneneſs; and it is greater Reformation
to prefer the Liturgy before none, than to prefer Extemporate
Publick Worſhip before the Liturgy; for all the Reformed
Churches in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> do commonly profeſs to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Engliſh Churches in the Liturgy, if they
come among us where it is uſed, ſo that it ſeems in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Judgment a breach of the Covenant to prefer no Publick
Worſhip before the Liturgy, or to refuſe Occaſional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the uſe of the Liturgy, as if it were unlawful, when in
Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s as well as in the Judgment of all the Reformed Churches,
it is to be preferred to Extemporate Publick Worſip.</p>
               <p>My Opinion as to Liturgy in general,<note place="margin">Diſpute the 4th. of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> is, 1. That a ſtinted
Liturgy is in it ſelf lawful.<note place="margin">P. 358. P.</note> 2. That a ſtinted Liturgy in ſome
parts of Publick Service is neceſſary.<note place="margin">359.</note> 3. In the parts where in
is not neceſſary, it may not only be ſubmitted to, but deſired,
when the peace of the Church requireth it. 4. It is not of
ſuch neceſſity to take the matter, and words out of the Holy
Scriptures,<note place="margin">See <hi>Chriſt, Direct.</hi> P. 874.</note> but that we may joyn in a Liturgy, or uſe it, if
the Form of Words be not from Scripture. This is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
1. That which is not directly, or conſequentially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by God, remaineth lawful. A ſtinted Liturgy is not
directly, or conſequentially forbidden of God: Therefore it
remaineth lawful. The major is undoubted, becauſe nothing
but a prohibition can make a thing unlawful; where there is no
Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion. Yet I have heard very Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Men Anſwer this, That it is enough that it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
though not forbidden, which is plainly to deny both
Scripture and Civil Principles. Now for the Minor, That a
ſtinted Liturgy is not forbidden, we need no other proof,
than that no Prohibion can be produced.<note place="margin">P. 361.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The main Body of <hi>Non-Conformiſt</hi> Miniſters did judge, that
the Ordinary Liturgy appointed for Publick Worſhip, was ſuch
as a good Chriſtian might lawfully joyn in, <hi>Apol.</hi> p. 148.</p>
               <p>If it be lawful for the People to uſe a ſtinted form of Words,<note place="margin">P. 364.</note>
in Publick Prayer, then is it in it ſelf lawful for the <hi>Paſtors:</hi>
But it is lawful for the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Paſtors Prayer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41925:25"/>
(which they muſt pray over with him, and not only hear it)
is a ſtinted Form to them, even as much as if he had learnt it
out of a Book.</p>
               <p>It is lawful to uſe a Form in Preaching, therefore a ſtinted
Liturgy is lawful. 1. Becauſe Preaching is a part of that Liturgy.
2. Becauſe the reaſon is the ſame for Prayer as for that in the
main.</p>
               <p>That which hath been the practice of the Church in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times and down to this day, and is yet the practice of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the Churches of Chriſt on earth, is not like to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful:
But ſuch is the uſe of ſome ſtinted Forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſhewed, that it was ſo in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. That it
hath been of ancient uſe in the Church, ſince Chriſt, and at
this day in <hi>Africk, Aſia, Europe,</hi> and the Reformed Churches
in <hi>France, Holland, Geneva, &amp;c.</hi> is ſo well known, that I
need not ſtand to prove it: And thoſe few that ſeem to diſuſe
it, do yet uſe it in Pſalms and other parts of Worſhip. As for
the Common-Prayer it ſelf, I never rejected it, becauſe it was
a Form; or thought it ſimply unlawful, becauſe it was ſuch a
Form; but have made uſe of it, and would do again in the like
caſe.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But if a faulty manner of praying be preſcribed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſt. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi> p. 748.</note> 
                  <hi>and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by a Law, I know it before-hand and am guilty of it. Anſw.</hi> If
the thing be ſinful, either it is, 1. Becauſe the Prayers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
and faulty; Or, 2. Becauſe they are impoſed; Or,
3. becauſe you knew the Fault before-hand, but none of theſe
can prove your joyning with them ſinful. 1. Not becauſe
they are faulty; for you may joyn with as faulty Prayers (you
confeſs) if not impoſed. 2. Not becauſe impoſed for that is
an extenuation,<note place="margin">See Chriſt. Direct. <hi>p.</hi> 848.</note> and not an aggravation. For (1.) it proveth
the Miniſter leſs voluntary of the two, than thoſe are that do
it without any command, through the errour of their own
Judgments. (2.) Becauſe (though lawful things oft become
unlawful when Superiours forbid them, yet) no reaſon can be
given, why a lawful thing ſhould become unlawful, becauſe a
lawful Superiour doth command it; elſe Superiours might take
away all our Chriſtian Liberty, and make all things unlawful
to us, by commanding them. You would take it for a wild
Conceit in your Children or Servants, if they ſay, when you
bid them learn a Catechiſm, or uſe a Form of Prayer, It was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41925:25"/>
lawful for us to do it till you commanded us, but becauſe you
bid us do it, it is unlawful. If it be a Duty to obey Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in all lawful things, then it is not a Sin to obey them.
3. It is not your knowing before hand, that makes it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
for 1. I know in general before hand, that all imperfect
Men will do imperfectly: and though I know not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that maketh it never the lawfuller, if fore-knowledge it
ſelf did make it unlawful. 2. If you know that <hi>(e. g.)</hi> an
Antinomian, or ſome miſtaken Preacher, would conſtantly
drop ſome words for his Errour, in praying or preaching, that
will not make it unlawful in your own Judgment, for you
to joyn (if it be not a flat Hereſie.) 3. It is another Man's
Errour or Fault that you foreknow, and not your own. 4. God
himſelf doth, as an Univerſal Cauſe of Nature, concur with
Men in thoſe Acts which he foreknoweth they will ſinfully do,
yet is not the Authour or Approver of the Sin.</p>
               <p>We (the Commiſſioners 1663.)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Defence,</hi> p. 38.</note> all thought a Liturgy law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and divers Learned and Reverend Nonconformiſts of
<hi>London</hi> met to conſider how far it was their duty, or lawful to
Communicate with the Pariſh Churches, where they lived, in
the Liturgy and Sacrament, and I proved four Propoſitions:
1. That it is lawful to uſe a Form: 2. That it is lawful to
joyn with ſome Pariſh Churches in the uſe of the Liturgy:
3. That it is lawful to joyn with ſome Pariſh Churches in the
Lord's Supper: 4. That it is to ſome a duty to joyn with
ſome Pariſh Churches three times a year in the Lord's Supper:
and none of the Brethren ſeemed to diſſent, but took the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to be valid.</p>
               <p>Were I in <hi>Armenia,</hi>

                  <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> or among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I would
joyn in a much more defective Form than our Liturgy, rather
than none. And this is the judgment of many <hi>New-England</hi>
Miniſters, conform to the old Non-conformiſts, who did ſome
of them read the Common Prayer, and the moſt of them
judged it lawful to joyn in it, or elſe Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Richard Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. would not write ſo earneſtly for coming
to the beginning,<note place="margin">P. 54.</note> and preferring it before all private Duties.
And truly, I am not able to bear the thoughts of ſeparating
from almoſt all Chriſt's Churches upon Earth; but he that
ſeparates from one, or many, upon a reaſon common to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all, doth virtually ſeparate from almoſt all; and he that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41925:26"/>
ſeparates from all among us upon the account of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of our Liturgy, and the badneſs of our Miniſtry, doth
ſeparate from them upon a reaſon common to almoſt all, or
the far greateſt part, as I conceive.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Forms of Liturgy which now are moſt diſtaſted,<note place="margin">Cure of Diviſions, <hi>P.</hi> 200.</note> were
brought in by the moſt zealous religious People at the firſt:
The many ſhort Invocations, Verſicles and Reſponſes, which
the People uſe, were brought in when the Souls of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
did abound with Zeal, and in holy fervors break out in
ſuch expreſſions, and could not well endure to be bare Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and not vocally to bear their part in the praiſes of God
and prayers of the Church.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed at large,<note place="margin">P. 174.</note> How far God hath given Men pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to preſcribe, and impoſe Forms for others, and commanded
others to obey them:<note place="margin">P. 179.</note> when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our
Father, &amp;c.</hi> he bound the Diſciples in duty to do as he bid
them;<note place="margin">P. 185.</note> How Forms may be impoſed publickly on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
of Believers, and on the Miniſters, yea though the
Forms impoſed be worſe than the exerciſe of their own gifts,
(though among us no Man be forbidden to uſe his own gifts
in the Pulpit.) The Phariſees long Liturgy (it is like) was in
many things worſe than ours; yet Chriſt and his Apoſtles oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
joyned with them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Five Diſp.</hi> p. 363.</note> and never condemned them. I ſhall
now only add that the Lord's Prayer is a Form directed to
God as in the Third Perſon, and not to Man only as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
for Prayer in the Second Perſon: it is not, <hi>Pray to God
your Father in Heaven that his name may be Hallowed, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
come, &amp;c.</hi> But, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be
thy name, &amp;c.</hi> And it ſeems by the Diſciples words, that thus
<hi>John</hi> taught his Diſciples to pray, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. and we have in
the Scripture the mention of many Set Forms of Service to
God, which therefore we may well uſe. And I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
again to Note, that though Prayer was corrupted by the
Phariſees, yet Chriſt uſually joyned in their Synagogues, <hi>Luke
14.</hi> 17. and never medled with our controverſie about the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Set Forms. [This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> infers from <hi>Calvins</hi> note

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41925:26"/>
I take the Common-Prayer to be better incomparably than

tells you in the Margin of thoſe Reaſons for a larger Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
That in the Apoſtles Days there were under Chriſt in
the Univerſal Church, many general Officers that had the care
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41925:27"/>
of gathering and over-ſeeing Churches up and down, and
were fixed by ſtated Relation unto none. And moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Churches think, that though the extraordinary Gifts, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
and Officers ceaſe, yet Government being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
part of their Work, the ſame Form of Government
which Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt did ſettle in the firſt Ages,
tho' not with the ſame extraordinary Gifts and Adjuncts were
ſettled for all following Ages: 1. Becauſe we read of ſettling
that Form, <hi>(viz.)</hi> general Officers as well as Particular, but
never of any Abolition. 2. Becauſe if we affirm a Ceſſation
without Proof, we ſeem to accuſe God of Mutability, as
ſetting a Form of Government for one Age only. 3. And
we leave room for audacious Wits to queſtion other Goſpel-Inſtitutions,
as Paſtors, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. It was general Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
that Chriſt promiſed to be with to the end of the World,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. And in this Premonition he ſays, he doth not
diſpute the Lawfulneſs of Arch-Biſhops, over Parochial-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
as Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, and other general Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the firſt Age, in the ordinary continued parts of their
Office. And in his <hi>Plea for Peace, p.</hi> 263. Some of us incline
much to think, that Arch-Biſhops <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Biſhops that have
over-ſight of many Churches, with their Paſtors, are lawful
Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, in the ordinary part of their
Work. So alſo, <hi>Firſt Plea, p.</hi> 35. and of his accepting two
parts of Epiſcopacy, not varying the Species in the Preface to
the ſecond Plea.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Church-Hiſtory, p.</hi> 37. and in <hi>Plea for Peace, p.</hi> 66. the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time had the beſt ordered Churches in the
World; and the Biſhops were the moſt Godly, Faithful,
Peaceable company of Biſhops ſince the Apoſtle's times. In
Preface to the <hi>Second Plea,</hi> we offered Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher's</hi>
Model, and when his Majeſty would not grant us that, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
the Epiſcopacy of <hi>England,</hi> as it ſtood with little Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
this we joyfully and thankfully accepted, as a hopeful
means of a common Conformity and Concord.</p>

that there are in <hi>Directory, p.</hi> 832. ſuch general Officers in
the Church; as an Army, that is headed by the general him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

are allowed, firſt, ſuch as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſays were
brought into the Church for a Remedy againſt Schiſm; the
Biſhop of this Conſtitution was to preſide over Presbyters,
and without him nothing was to be done in the Church that
was of Moment. <hi>S. 58. of Church Hiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second is that which ſucceeds the Apoſtles in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
parts of Church-Government, while ſome <hi>Senior</hi> Paſtors
have the care of Superviſing many Churches, as the Viſitors
had in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and are ſo far <hi>Epiſcopi-Epiſcoporum,</hi> having
no conſtraining Power of the Sword.</p>
               <p>But a Power to admoniſh and inſtruct the Paſtors, and to
Regulate Ordinations, Synods, and all great and common
Circumſtances that belong to Churches: For if there were
one Form of Government, in which ſome Paſtors had ſuch
extenſive Work and Power, as <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi>
had, as well as Apoſtles, we muſt not change it without
Proof, that Chriſt himſelf would have it changed. Many
wiſe Men think, that the Presbyterians rejecting all Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
ſetting up unordained Elders, and National Churches
headed by National Aſſemblies, are diviſive and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as their making by the Scots Covenant, the renouncing
of Epiſcopacy, to be the teſt of National Concord was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.

                  <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hoper, Jewel, Davenant, Uſher,

<hi>Sibs, Preſton, Fenner, Bolton, Whately, Dent, Crook, Pike, Stock,

Divines of the Epiſcopal Judgment is much to be deſired, and
earneſtly endeavoured. If it be Objected, that he calls the
Biſhops their Silencers and Perſecutors, <hi>p.</hi> 104. of his <hi>Apology</hi>
he ſays, no Biſhops have Silenced us by Spiritual Government,

caſe of Appeal to himſelf; I muſt needs ſay, that this ſort of
Epiſcopacy is very ancient, and hath been for many Ages of
very common reception through a great part of the Church—
And if I lived in a place, where this government were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and managed for God, I would ſubmit thereto, and
live peaceably under it, and do nothing to the diſturbance,
diſgrace or diſcouragement of it. (You may ſee how far Mr. <hi>Vines</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did agree in the notion of a Biſhop over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Presbyters.)<note place="margin">P. 352.</note> Of which <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Commentary on the
<hi>Acts,</hi> and particularly <hi>chap.</hi> 17. ſaith, that as in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

                  </gap>, ſuch was the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Biſhop. And doubtleſs the firſt Biſhops were over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Presbyters, as Presbyters, in joynt relation to one
Church or Region; which Region being upon the increaſe
of Believers divided into more Churches, and in after-times,
thoſe Churches aſſigned to particular Men; yet he the Biſhop,
continued Biſhop over them ſtill. For that<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </note> you ſay, he had
a negative Voice, that is more then ever I ſaw proved, or I
think ever ſhall, for the firſt 200 Years; and yet I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to enquire into it. That makes him <hi>Angelus Princeps,</hi>
not <hi>Angelus Praeſes,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Reinolds</hi> ſaith. <hi>Calvin</hi> denies that,
and makes him <hi>Conſul in Senatu,</hi> or as a Speaker in the Houſe
of Parliament, which, as I have heard that <hi>D. B.</hi> did ſay,
was but to make him foreman of the Jury. As touching the
Introduction of ruling Elders, ſuch as are modelled out by
Parliament, my judgment is ſufficiently known. I am of
your Judgment in the point, There ſhould be ſuch Elders,
as have power to Preach as well as Rule. On this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
reflects, <hi>p.</hi> 353. Though Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> here yield not the negative
Voice to have been <hi>de facto,</hi> in the firſt or ſecond age, nor to
be <hi>de jure;</hi> yet he, without any queſtion yielded to the
ſtating of a Preſident, <hi>durante vitâ,</hi> if he prove not unworthy,
which was one point that I propounded to him; and I make
no doubt, but he would have yielded to a voluntary conſent
of Presbyters, <hi>de facto,</hi> not to ordain without the Preſident.
And the difficulties that are before us, <hi>de facto,</hi> in ſetting up a
Parochial Epiſcopacy, which he mentioneth, I have cleared
already in theſe Papers, ſhewing partly, that the thing is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
exiſtent, and partly how more fully to accompliſh it.</p>
               <p>The Inſtances which he gives, are in the Epiſcopacy of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41925:29"/>
Proteſtant Churches in <hi>Poland,</hi> from <hi>Adrian Regenvolſcius, Hiſt.
Eccleſ. Sclavon. l. 3. p. 424. N. B.</hi> Whereas from the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Churches in the Province of the leſſer <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi>
it hath been received by Uſe and Cuſtom, that out of
the Elders of all thoſe <hi>(Diſtrictus)</hi> Diviſions, which are 36
in Number, one Primate, or Chief, in Order, who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Superintendent of the Churches of leſſer <hi>Poland,</hi>
and doth preſide over the Provincial Synods, be choſen by
the Authority, Conſent, and Suffrage of the Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and that he be inaugurated, and declared (not by impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hands, to avoid the ſuſpicion of Primacy, and the
appearance of Authority and Power over the other Elders)
only by Benediction, and fraternal Prayers, and by reading
over the Offices which concern this Function, and the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the whole Synod, for the ſake of Government and
good Order in the Church of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other inſtance is of the Churches of the <hi>Bohemian</hi>
Confeſſion, who have among the Paſtors of the Churches,
their Conſeniors and Seniors, and one Preſident over all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the ſame <hi>Regenvolſcius, p.</hi> 315. The Elders or the
Superintendents of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> and <hi>Moravian</hi> Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
are for the moſt part choſen out of their Fellow-Elders, <hi>and
are Ordained</hi> and <hi>Conſecrated to the Office of Seigniory by Impoſition
of Hands,</hi> and <hi>Publick inauguration,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> diſlikes our Species of Dioceſan Biſhops, becauſe
of their Chancellors, which is very groundleſs for the power
of Legiſlation, the Foundation and Form of Government,
which being wholly in the Biſhops and Clergy, who in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
have the ſole Power of making Canons for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church; and there being no Cenſure to be
inflicted but according to thoſe Canons, the Lay-Chancellor
are but inferior Officers, intruſted by their Biſhops with ſome
part of the Executive Power; the Biſhops themſelves, as well
as their Chancellors, having the Canons to direct and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
them in the Execution; and if there be any extra-judicial
Proceſs, there lye Appeals from them both. Moreover, the
Chancellors being bred up to the Study and Practice of the
Canon and Civil Laws, are moſt fit for Executing the Canons,
being acquainted with the Nature of Evidences, Probations,
and judicial Proceſs, which meer Presbyters cannot be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41925:29"/>
to underſtand ſo well; and this Office of Chancellors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allowed by the Laws of the Land, they may be ſubmitted
to as they are the King's Officers, by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
This may ſatisfie the impartial Reader againſt thoſe
bitter Invectives of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> againſt the Species of <hi>Dioceſan</hi>
Biſhops, as being <hi>Anti</hi>-Chriſtian, and the Military Inſtruments
of the Devil.</p>

                     <hi>Defenſe,</hi> P. 65.</note> 1660. did yield to
ſuch an Epiſcopacy, as the old Nonconformiſts would ſcarce
generally have conſented to, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Model.</p>
               <p>Epiſcopacy is not ſuch an upſtart thing, nor defended by
ſuch contemptible Reaſons, as that the Controverſie is like to
die with this Age; undoubtedly there will be a Godly and
Learned Party for it, while the World endureth. And it is
a numerous Party: All the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, the <hi>Armenian, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
Abaſſine,</hi> and all others, but a few of the Reformed. For
<hi>Denmark, Sweden,</hi> part of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> have a
Superintendency, as high as that I plead for, <hi>p.</hi> 11. If you
know no Godly Perſons of the Epiſcopal way, I do, and as
my acquaintance increaſeth, I know more and more, and ſome
I take to be much better than my ſelf; I will ſay a greater
word, that I know thoſe of them, whom I think as Godly,
Humble Miniſters, as moſt of the Non-conformiſts, whom I
know, <hi>p.</hi> 12. And I believe there are many hundred Godly

concerning Sacriledge.</head>
               <p>As for your Queſtion about Sacriledge, I am very near you
in the preſent Opinion. The point was never ſtated nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in the <hi>Iſle of Wight;</hi> I did for my part decline the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
for I could not maintain the cauſe as on the Parliament
ſide; And becauſe, both I and others were unwilling, it was
never brought to open debate. The Commiſſioners did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
it with the King, but they went upon grounds of Law
and Polity, and it was only about Biſhops Lands; for they
then averred the continuance of Dean and Chapter Lands to
the uſe of the Church. Some deny that there is any ſin of
Sacriledge under the Goſpel, and if there be any, they agree
not in the definition. Some hold an Alienation of Church-goods,
in caſe of Neceſſity, and then make the neceſſity, what,
and as extenſive, as they pleaſe. The moſt are of Opinion, that
while the Church lies ſo unprovided for, the donations are not
alienable, <hi>ſine Sacrilegio.</hi> If there were a Surpluſage above the
competent maintenance, it were another matter. It is clear
enough, the Donors wills are fruſtrated, and that their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
intention, and the general uſe <hi>(Viz.</hi> the maintenance of
God's Worſhip, and Miniſters) ſhould ſtand, though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

               <p>The word Schiſm ſignifieth any ſinful Diviſion among
Chriſtians; there may be a Schiſm in a Church, when no
party divideth from it; as when one ſays, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> &amp;c.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. A Man may cauſe Diviſions from a Church, that
ſeparates not from it himſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſparks of Schiſm are kindled, when proud Perſons are
brainſick with a fond eſtimation of their own opinions, and
heart-ſick for propagating them.</p>

Till Church Diviſions be rightly apprehended, as Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Swearing and Drunkenneſs are, they will never be well
cured. Imprint therefore on your minds the true Character of
them, and conſider the Effects, and then you will fear this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Sin, as much as a conſuming Plague.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 63 When you are tempted to ſeparate from any
Church for defectiveneſs in its manner of Worſhip; enquire
how God is Worſhipped in all the Churches on Earth, and then
conſider if you lived among them, you would forſake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them all. Read the <hi>Church Hiſtory,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what Hereſies have been in times paſt, and what havock
Schiſms have cauſed among Chriſtians, for if this had been
known by well meaning Perſons in our days, we ſhould not
have ſeen thoſe ſame opinions appleaded as New Lights, which
were long ago exploded as Old Hereſies: Nor ſhould we have
ſeen many honeſt People taking that ſame courſe to reform the
Church now, and advance the Goſpel, which in ſo many
Ages and Nations deſtroyed the Church, and caſt out the
Goſpel. A narrow Soul that taketh all Chriſts Intereſt in the
World to lye in a few of their Separate Meetings, and ſhuts
up all the Church in a Nut-ſhell, muſt needs be guilty of the
fouleſt Schiſms. It is a Catholick Spirit and Principles loving a
Chriſtian as a Chriſtian, abhorring the very name of Sects
and Parties, as the Churches Wounds, that makes a Catholick
indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Caudry</hi> in his Book of Schiſm; againſt Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> p. 14.
ſays, that Toleration (of ſeparate Congregations) had done
more to the rooting out Religion from the hearts of many in
Seven Years, than the inforcing of Uniformity in Seventy

vented divers ſingular opinions, he was diſmiſſed, went to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
which place in a years time he filled with Principles of
rigid Separation, tending to Anabaptiſtry, as that it is not
lawful for an unregenerate Man to pray, or take an Oath, in
ſpecial not the Oath of Fidelity to the Magiſtrate. He forbad
any of his Church-members to hear the godly Miniſters of
<hi>England</hi> when occaſionally they went thither. He taught that
the Magiſtrate had nothing to do in matters of the Firſt Table;
that there ſhould be an unlimited Toleration of all Religions;
that to puniſh any Man for his Conſcience was Perſecution.
He ſeparated not only from the Churches of <hi>Old,</hi> but of <hi>New-England</hi>
alſo, as Antichriſtian. After that, he would not pray,
or give thanks with his own Wife or Family, becauſe they
went to the Church-Aſſemblies. He kept private Meetings by
way of ſeparation from, and oppoſition to the Church-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
and being baniſhed as a diſturber of the Peace, he ſat
down at a place called <hi>Providence,</hi> and there fell to Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtry,
renouncing Infant Baptiſm. And after a while he told
his People, that he was out of the way himſelf, and had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them, for he could not find that any on Earth had power
to adminiſter Baptiſm, and therefore their laſt Baptiſm was a
nullity as well as the firſt, and that they muſt wait for the
coming of new Apoſtles; and ſo they diſſolved and turned
Seekers.</p>

The caſe of the <hi>Summer Iſlands</hi> as related by Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi>
a worthy Miniſter come from thence upon diſcouragement,
would make a Chriſtians heart to bleed. To hear how ſtrict
and regular, and hopeful that Plantation once was, and how
one godly Miniſter by Separation, ſelecting a few to be his
Church, rejecting all the reſt from the Sacrament, the rejected
party were dolefully eſtranged from Religion, and the ſelected
party turned <hi>Quakers.</hi> But our own caſe is yet a more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
proof, what Separation hath done againſt Religion; ſo
that it is my wonder that any good man can over-look it.</p>

ſo long lay aſide partiality, to judge of the reaſons of their

But when many of us vent untruths, and ſlanders againſt our

Nor am I cauſeleſly afraid,<note place="margin">P. 52.</note> that if we ſuffer the Principles and
Practices, which I write againſt, to proceed without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
Popery will get by it ſo great advantage as may
hazard us all, and we may loſe that which the ſeveral Parties
do contend about.</p>
               <p>Three ways eſpecially Popery will grow out of our diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
1. By the odium and ſcorn of our diſagreements, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency,
and multiplied Sects, they will perſwade People,
that we muſt either come for unity to them, or elſe all run
mad, and crumble into duſt and individuals. Thouſands have
been drawn to Popery, or confirmed in it, by this Argument
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41925:33"/>
already: And I am perſwaded, that all the Arguments elſe in
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all other Books that ever were written, have
not done ſo much to make Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> as the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Sects among our ſelves. Some Profeſſors of Religious
ſtrictneſs and great eſteem for Godlineſs, having run from
Sect to Sect, and finding no conſiſtency turned Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>2. Who knows not how fair a game the Papiſts have to
play by our diviſions? Methinks I hear them hiſſing on both
Parties, ſaying to one ſide, Lay more upon them, and abate
them nothing: And to the other, Stand it out, and yield to
nothing: hoping that our diviſions will carry us to ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
as ſhall make us accounted Seditious, Rebellious, and
dangerous to the Publick Peace, and ſo they may paſs for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſubjects than we, or elſe, that they may get a Toleration
together with us. And ſhall they uſe our hands to do their
work? We have already ſerved them unſpeakably, both in
this, and in abating the odium of the Gunpower-Plot, and
other Treaſons.</p>
               <p>3. It is not the leaſt of our danger,<note place="margin">Key for Catholicks.</note> leſt by our Follies, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
and rigors we ſo exaſperate the common People, as to
make them readier to joyn with the Papiſts, than with us, in
in caſe of competitions, invaſions or inſurrections againſt the
King and Kingdoms peace.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts account, that if the Puritans get the day, they
ſhall make great advantage of it; for they will be unſetled,
and all in pieces, and not know how to ſettle the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Factions and Diſtractions (ſay they) give us footing
for continual attempts. To make all ſure we will ſecretly have
our party among Puritans alſo, that we may be ſure to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

the Ordinance it ſelf, or fruſtrate the ends of it, we are

when we do obey in a caſe of miſcommanding, it is not a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evil that good may come of it, as ſome do miſconceive;
but it is only a ſubmitting to that which is ill-commanded, but
not evil in him that doth ſubmit. It is the determiner that is
the cauſe of the inconvenience, and not the obeyer. Nor is
it inconvenient for me to obey, though it be worſe perhaps
to him that commandeth: while he ſinneth in commanding,
he may make it my duty to obey, <hi>Pag. 461. Sect.</hi> 6. The
reaſons of this are obvious and clear, even becauſe it is the
Office of the Governors to determine of ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
It is the Paſtor's Office to guide and overſee the
Flock, and when he determineth theſe, he is but in his
own way, and doth but his own work; and therefore
he is therein the Judge, if the caſe be controvertible. If
none ſhall obey a Magiſtrate or Paſtor in the works of
their own Office, as long as they think he did them not
the beſt way, all Governours then would be preſently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and obedience denyed. We are ſure that God hath
commanded us to <hi>obey them that are over us in the Lord, 1 Theſ.
5. 12. Heb. 13. 7. 17, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore a certain duty may
not be forborn on uncertain conjectures, or upon every miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
of them that we owe it to. This would un-church
all Churches (as they are Political Societies:) for if Paſtors
be taken down, and the work of Paſtors, the Church is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. And the things in which the Paſtor is
now ſuppoſed to err, are not of themſelves unlawful, but only
by ſuch an accident as being over-weighed by another accident
ſhall ceaſe to make them unlawful. For inſtance, <hi>p. 461.
Sect.</hi> 4. If of two Tranſlations of Scripture, or two Verſions
of the Pſalms the Paſtor uſe the worſer, (ſo it be tolerable)
we muſt obey. And <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. If the Paſtor appoint a more
imperfect Verſion of the Pſalms to be ſung in the Church (as
is commonly uſed in <hi>England)</hi> the obeying of him in the uſe
of this will not bring ſo much hurt to the Church, as the
diſobeying on that account would do. For beſides the ſin of
diſobedience it ſelf, the Church would be in a confuſion if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41925:38"/>
they forſake his conduct that preſerves the Union; and ſome
will be for this and ſome for that, and ſo the Worſhip it ſelf
will be overthrown. And let it ſtill be remembred, that we
allow both Magiſtrates and Paſtors to ſee to the execution of
God's Laws, and to determine of circumſtances in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that are neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> p. 482. <hi>Sect.</hi> 35. but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

may lawfully be uſed in the Church upon humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
