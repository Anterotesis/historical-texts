         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ TO THE SVPPOSED GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of the Church of England,
the Archbyshops, lord Byshops, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons
and the rest of
that order.</head>
            <p>MAnie and most euident haue
our declarations bin concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the truth of that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which Christ hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in his word for the ruling of
the Church; which we haue manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
vnto you, both by our writinges
&amp; speches, as occasion hath bin offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
neuer hath any one of you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in hand to saye any thing against
it, but it hath made his eyes to daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle,
as the clearest sun-shining; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath beene driuen to wander
hyther and thyther, groping for eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and yet coulde not escape, but
hath fallen into infinite most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
absurdities, and blasphemous
assertions, (as by their writinges yet
extant it may appeare) so forcible is
the trueth, to amaze the gainesayers
thereof, and so pregnant is falsehood
to beget and bring forth thousands
of absurdities, and euery one worse
<pb facs="tcp:3174:4"/>
then other. And will you still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in your damnable, and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish
course? Haue you solde your
selues vnto Sathan, to fight for him
vntill you be dampned in Hell with
him? Haue you morgaged the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your soules &amp; bodies, for the
present fruition of your pompe and
plesure, is it because you see not what
you should do? It may be so, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are so blinde, that they grope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at noone day; but me thinkes it
can hardly be so, vnlesse you be they
that haue eyes and see not, for the
cause hath bene (by the blessing of
God) so managed, that many plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
artificers, and children do see it,
and know it, &amp; are able by the worde
of God to iustifie it, and condemne
you to bee aduersaries vnto the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in resisting it. But you think that
gouernment not so needfull, &amp; your
fault but small (if it be any) in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
your course begon. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of the thing is many wayes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
both in that it hath so plentiful
warrant from Gods owne worde, (as
<pb facs="tcp:3174:4"/>
the course of this booke doeth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declare,) and also in that the
gospell can take no roote, nor haue
any free passage, for want of it: and
the greatnes of your fault appeareth
by this, that in so doing, you are the
cause, of all the ignorance, Atheisme,
schismes, treasons, poperie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines,
that is to be founde in this
land, which we challenge to prooue
to your faces, if we may indifferently
be heard, and whereof in the meane
while we will giue you a taste: for the
first it is cleere, that you are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of that damnable ignoraunce,
wherein the people are so generally
wrapped, for that you haue from time
to time stopped the streams of know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge,
in those places where the Lord
in mercie bestowed the same, and in
stead of able and painefull ministers,
haue pestered the Churche, eyther
with presumptuous proude persons,
that are esteemed learned and take
no paines to bring the people vnto
the knowledge of Iesus Christe, or
(which is the greatest nomber) such
<pb facs="tcp:3174:5"/>
ignorant asses, and filthy swine, as are
not worthy to liue in a well ordered
common-wealth: and that you are
the cause of all atheisme, it is plaine,
for one may (as in deede many doe)
professe it, and you saye nothing to
him for it. If the most filthy liuer will
fawne vpon you, and bribe your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
you will not onely fauor him,
but assiste him against any godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
or other: but if any that feare
God, refuse to come vnder the leaste
of your popish ceremonies, he shalbe
molested, till his pursse be empty, or
else by your tyrannous dealing, hee
haue made shipwrack of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And are not you the cause of
all schismes, that make a hotch-pot
of true religion and poperye, and so
giue some an occasion to fal into this
course, and others into that? And it
is as cleare, that you are so farre the
cause of all treasons, as without you
they had not bin: for if euery Church
had had hir gouernement according
to Christs institution; our yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and studentes, had not bene
<pb facs="tcp:3174:5"/>
(for want of teaching and carefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight)
made a prey vnto the sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
and consequently to those pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
which haue broght the bodies
of so manie vnto Tyborne, and their
soules into hell; and who but you be
the cause of poperye, whilest you vse
them so well, let them doe what they
list, yea, and keepe them in office and
authoritie vnder you, yea (whiche
more is) giue them such offices as
none that is not popish can execute:
I speake not of the ignorance which
by your means raigneth euery wher,
which (as they confes) is the mother
of their deuotion, and you are the
wretched fathers of that filthye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whereby you muste needes bee
grandfathers (at the least) to al kinde
of popery. And who can (without blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing)
denie you to be the cause of al
vngodlines, seeing your gouernment
is that which giueth leaue to a man
to be any thing,<note place="margin">Omnia cum si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant, non lice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For certainly it is more free in
these dayes, to be a papist, anabaptist,
of the family of loue, yea anye moste
<pb facs="tcp:3174:6"/>
wicked one whatsoeuer, then that
which we should be, and I could liue
these twentie years, any such in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(yea in a Byshopps house it may
be) and neuer be much molested for
it; so true is that which you are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with, in a <hi>Dialogue</hi> lately come
forth against you, and since burned
by you, that you care for nothinge
but the maintenaunce of your digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
be it to the damnation of your
owne soules, and infinit millions mo:
Enter therefore nowe at the last, into
the serious consideration of these
things: remember that one day, you
must be presented before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
seat of Iesus Christ, to be arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for all the soules that haue gone
to hell (seeing you will needes be the
rulers of the Church) since the gospel
first appeared in this land, then shall
you not bee excused with this; the
Queene and Councell wil haue it so:
nor with that; our state cannot beare
it. For it shalbe sayde vnto you, why
do you not infourme them better of
my will, why taught you them not to
<pb facs="tcp:3174:6"/>
worship with trembling and feare, &amp;
to kisse the sonne least he bee angry;
why did you not tell them, that all
states must be ruled by my worde, &amp;
not my word by them and their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies.
When these things shalbe laid
to your charge, your consciences shal
aunswere; that if you had done so,
you should haue lost your dignityes,
whiche you loued and sought for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially:
then shall you wishe, that
the mountains would fall vpon you,
and the hills couer you from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the lambe, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of him that sitteth vppon the
throne. And I am perswaded, that
you are in league with hell, and haue
made a couenaunt with death; yea,
you doe perswade your selues, that
there is no God, neyther shall there
be any such day of account; or it were
vnpossible, that you should giue your
eyes anye sleepe, or take anye rest in
your bedds, vntill you had vnto the
Lord by repentance, and the Church
by confession vnburdned your souls
of these hellishe wayes, wherein you
<pb facs="tcp:3174:7"/>
haue so long walked Repent, repent,
be not ashamed to amend, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue founde you out the way,
iudge your selues whyle you haue
time, least you be made fyrebrandes
of hell beyond all time. Let our chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
that wee haue made in the
name of the Lord, be hearkened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
Let vs bee disputed with before
indifferent iudges, let the holy word
of God bee the touch-stone to trye

               </gap>ntations by, and then shall it
easily appeare, who hath the Lord on
his side, and who not. The trueth wil
preuaile in spite of your teeth, and al
other aduersaries vnto it, (for God
disdaineth to be crossed, by dust and
ashes;) Therefore be not obstinate so
long, as vntill you be found fighters
with God; but preuent his wrath, lest
it breake foorth against you like fyre
that none can quench, because of the
wickednes of your inuentions. Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
your byshopprickes vpon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and wee will venture our
liues, take the challenge if you dare:
if the truth be on your side, you may
<pb facs="tcp:3174:7"/>
hereby, be restored to your dignities,
and be no more troubled by vs: but
if the trueth be against you, what shal
it profit you to win the whole world,
and afterward loose your own souls.
If you refuse still our offer, then must
you needes be guiltie eyther of this,
that you know your cause will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the tryal, or of this, that you wil
take no pains to confute vs that keep
such a sturre in the Church: do not
think that because you haue humane
authority on your side, therfore you
are safe, for he whose authoritie is on
our side, is the greatest, to whose
voice all the deuils in hell shall stoup;
much more the sillie arme of sinfull
fleshe. We haue sought to aduaunce
this cause of God, by humble suit to
the parliamente, by supplication to
your Conuocation house, by writing
in defence of it, and by challenging
to dispute for it, seeing none of these
means vsed by vs haue preuailed; If
it come in by that meanes, which wil
make all your heartes to ake, blame
your selues; for it must preuail, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
<pb facs="tcp:3174:8"/>
the mallice of all that stande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, or such a iudgement must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake
this lande, as shall cause the
cares that heare thereof to tingle, &amp;
make vs be a by-word to all that pas
by vs. The Lord open your eyes, that
you may see the confusions whereof
you are the cause, and giue you true
repentance, or confounde you in all
your purposes, that bee against him
and the regiment of his sonne Iesus
Christ. The same Lord, for the loue he
beareth to his poore people; open
the eyes of her Maiestie, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Councellers, that they may
see your godlesse practises, and in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to Gods people, rid vs from you,
and turne awaye his iudgementes,

            <p>INfinite and vnspeakeable (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Reader) are the miseries fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whiche Iesus Christe our Sauiour
hath freed vs, and the benefites
and blessings, wherewith in this life
he beginneth, and for euer will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to adorne vs. The considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof (if our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>thankfulnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Maiesty, were any way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionable,
to that which we endeuour
vnto towards men) shoulde make vs
continually to deuise, &amp; all the daies
of our life to studie howe wee might
shew our selues (at least in some sort)
carefull to glorifie his blessed name,
aboue all thinges that we desire, by
how muche as his loue towardes vs,
excelleth whatsoeuer can else (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our wish) befall vnto vs: but
if we do with equall ballance (on the
other side) looke into the course of
mans life, howe well this dutie is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
we shal see, that men declare
themselues rather bent to spit in his
face, and to defie him, then any way
to honour him as their head and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne:
<pb facs="tcp:3174:9"/>
for (to saye nothing of the
prophane life, and godlesse couersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherewith the generall number,
that professeth Iesus Christ, is wholy
defiled) wee see that many nations,
people and languages are very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to receiue Iesus Christe as their
priest to sacrifice for their sinnes, but
that he should become their king, to
prescribe lawes vnto them, whereby
they may bee ruled, is of all other
things the most vnsauory, yea (if it be
offered) the most grieuous tydinges,
and vnreasonable request: wherein,
albeit manye nations that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
that whore of Rome, are
heynously sinnefull against his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
maiestie: yet is there none in the
whole worlde so far out of square as
Englande, in reteyning that popishe
hierarchie, firste coyned in the midst
of the mistery of iniquitie, and that
filthie sinck of the Canon law, which
was inuented and patched together,
for the confirming and increasing of
the kingdome of Antichrist: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as great indignitie is offered vnto
<pb facs="tcp:3174:9"/>
Iesus Christ, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting his Church
vnto the gouernement of the same,
as can be, by meane vnderlings vnto
a king; in committing his beloued
spouse vnto the direction of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
of the Stewes, and enforcing
hir to liue after the orders of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelhouse.
For the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
while some haue written, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
according to their callinges,
carefully stoode, howe heynously it
hath beene taken, howe hardly they
haue bene vsed, and what shamefull
reproches haue beene offered (euen
vnto the course of the Gospell) for
spyte that hath beene borne vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
almost by all estates and
degrees, lamentable experience hath
taught many of vs: but our posterity
shall knowe it more particulerly, and
the Church thoroughout the world
shall discerne and iudge of it more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently,
when their bodies are rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the dust, &amp; their soules (if they
repent not) in eternall and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
torments; who haue reiected a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
so holy, profitable and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
<pb facs="tcp:3174:10"/>
yea, and handled the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for the same so cruelly, vnchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly,
and vnlawfully: but they would
gladly perswade themselues (if their
conscience would let them) that they
haue onely executed iustice vpon vs
as malefactours, and they perswade
men that we desire a thing, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the worde, not heard of in
the Church of God, vntill within this
few years, nor tollerable in any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
common-weal whatsoeuer: The
whiche monstrous slaunders, albeit
they haue bene manye wayes, and by
many men of most worthie gifts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
and made knowne in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
bookes that haue bene publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
concerning the same: yet haue
I thought it necessarie (in another
course) to write also of it. The course
of my enterprise, is first in respect of
the fauorers of the desired reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
secondly of the aduersaries of
the same, the fauourers of it, are also
of two sorts; ministers of the word, &amp;
priuate persons, &amp; both I hope, may
haue profit by it. Concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb facs="tcp:3174:10"/>
when these wofull troubles that
were renewed vpon vs (by that wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
subscription, that was euery
where vrged) did begin to increase, I
thought it meete to betake my selfe
vnto that which I had read, or might
any way by studie finde out, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the cause, and collected all into
a briefe sum, and referred euery thing
vnto some head; whiche beeing euer
present with me, might furnish me to
answere in the defence of the trueth,
though it were of a sodden, by which
(thorow the blessing of God) I found
such profite in my seuerall troubles,
that I thought it a course not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnprofitable for others also,
and vpon that occasion betooke my
selfe vnto a more serious meditation
about the matter, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the thing with diuers very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men; I found encouragement &amp;
hartening on, generally by all whom
I made acquainted therwith: so that
I trust (the iudgments, yea and wishes
also of others, so iumping with mine)
many ministers that loue the cause,
<pb facs="tcp:3174:11"/>
and haue not so thorowly studied it
as were meet they should, may reape
some profit therby. Now concerning
priuate men that loue the cause, som
haue great affaires in hand, and haue
no leasure to read the seuerall books
of this argumente: some when they
read, are not of sufficient capacity to
conceiue the force of a reason, or to
make vse of it, to enform themselues
in the grounded knowledge of the
cause thereby: some (which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
falt of our religious gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
will take no paines to read, some are
poore and not able to buie the books
which might let them see the cause,
al these (I hope) may finde helpe in
some measure hereby. Nowe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the aduersaries vnto the cause,
they are of two sortes also, they that
know it, and they that are ignoraunt
of it: the former, if they write anye
thing against it, are contented to deal
in so rouing a course as may rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
vnto great volumes, then soundly
to saye anye thing againste the cause:
Wherein D. Whitgifte, but especially
<pb facs="tcp:3174:11"/>
D. Bridges, haue giuen vs an euident
example: and these with others of
their iudgment (though non in these
latter dayes, haue written more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedly
then they, of any argument
of diuinity whatsoeuer) are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented
to make the world belieue (if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will
be so wilfully seduced) that our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be no arguments, that they be
grounded vpon false foundations, &amp;
that we are not able to conclude our
cause in any forme of reasoning. The
course that is here taken (I trust) shall
shew that they are liars: the other sort
of aduersaries be they that be meerly
ignorant of any thing, either for it or
against it; and perswading themselues
that the sway and shew of the worlde
must needs cary the truth with it, do
(like blind bayardes) boldly venture
to say any thing against it, and think
they do wel. Now of all these sorts of
people, I haue to request some thing;
I hope I shall obtaine my request (at
the least) at the hands of some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The first sort of fauorers (which be the
ministers) I intreat, that as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:3174:12"/>
the glory of God, and honour of
the cause which they stand in; so they
would diligently imploy themselues
in this, that they may be founde able
to defend the same by sounde and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
grounds out of the worde, &amp;
so muche the rather, for that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
doe greatly triumph, when
they meete with one that professeth
the cause, and is not able to defende
it, and confute the gainsayers of it.
The secoud sort of fauourers, be the
priuate persons that loue the cause,
whom I beseech to be carefull (as of
all other pointes of religion) of this,
that they growe in the knowledge of
the word of God, whereby they may
be able, vpon their owne knowledge
to defend the truth, and not giue the
enemie any occasion to think or say,
that they be of that minde, because
such and suche ministers, whom they
do affect, do thinke so. Now concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the former sort of aduersaries,
to wit, they that know it, I pray them
to looke into their owne hearts, and
they shal finde they mislike it; eyther
<pb facs="tcp:3174:12"/>
because it correcteth their excessiue
pompe and maintenaunce, or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
more trauaile in their ministery,
then they are willing to vndergo, or
at the least, controlleth that dissolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of behauior, wherin they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wallow: and if it would please god
to bring them to a serious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this, that it is the will of the
mighty God (before who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they must
be called to giue an account) whiche
they doe resist, they would (I doubt
not) more carefully looke about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And lastly for them that being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the cause, speake euill of that
they know not: let them (if they will
bee admonished) vouchsafe to reade
this little book, and wey the reasons
with an vpright iudgment, which shal
cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (at the least) to suspend their
sharpe censures, which so vsually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in their ordinary communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
&amp; concerning vs al, let vs know
(for one day we shalbe sure to feel it)
that the controuersie is not about
goats woolle (as the prouerbe sayth)
neither light &amp; trifling maters, which
<pb facs="tcp:3174:13"/>
may safely be folowed or reiected (as
in deed the enemies of this cause do
confidently affirme) but about no les
matter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, whether Iesus Christ
shalbe king or no; For if none is said
to be a king, but he that ruleth by the
scepter of his lawes, then the turning
out of these orders which christ hath
prescribed in his word, for the ruling
of the Church, is to giue him the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and denye him the authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the same, and so (in trueth)
to make him an Idol, making him to
cary a shew of that which he is not, &amp;
(with the crucifiers of him) to put a
reede in his hand, in stead of his yron
rod; and crowning him with thorns,
in stead of the crown of greatest glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which is the cause that so many
Atheists spit in his face, and so many
godles persons, do make but a iest of
him: but when he commeth to shew
him-selfe in his glorious maiestie; it
shalbe said vnto all these sorts of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries:
<hi>Those mine enemies whiche
would not that I should raigue ouer them,
bring hither, and slea them before me.</hi>

Luk. 19. 27. The which fearefull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that we may auoide, let euerye
one of vs (as may stand with our seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
callings) carefully endeuor, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
this kingdom here, which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

that we shall haue part in that glory,
which shalbe reuealed herafter. Now
concerning the order of this booke;
to direct thee (good reader) vnto thy
further instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the points ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Thou hast in euery chapter, diuers
proofs out of the holy word of God,
which must be the things wherewith
thou mayest safely informe thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
then shalt thou finde (also
arguments drawn from reson right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruled by the same word: and lastly,
(because our aduersaries charge vs,
that we desire a thing not known vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the olde writers, nor agreed vpon
among the newe) thou hast here the
witnes of them both in so plentifull
and vniforme wise, as may plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that al godly learned men of al
times, haue giuen testimony vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:3174:14"/>
trueth of it. The most of the thinges
that are here expressed, I acknowledg
to be gathered out of the books that
haue bene published, and are extant
(purposely) concerning this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;
as may appeare in the seueral points,
wherein thou art sent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now,
lest either thou shouldst be deceiued
with a diuers impression, or think me
to missealleadge the authors, I am to
shew thee what books I haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The 1. book of T. C. twise printed,
I folow the latter; of Ecclesiast. discip.
I folow the latine, printed 1574. and
the last booke of D. Whitgift, which
containeth all the former in it. The
rest (as I take it) haue bene but once
printed, and therefore cary no doubt
in them. If thou bee satisfied here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
giue God the glory: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the cause by prayer, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good meanes that thy calling
may affoord: and pray for vs, that we
may neuer shrinke, nor be ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by the strength of them that
fight against it.</p>

the Abstract page 33.</p>
            <p>The proofe of the former is the disproofe of
the latter, which is thus declared.</p>
            <p>1. These thinges write I vnto thee,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 14. 15.</note> &amp;c. out
of whiche place I reason thus. That end which
Paule respected in writing vnto Timothie, doth
the holy ghost direct al ministers vnto for euer;
for it must be kept. 1. Tim. 6. 14. But he wrote to
directe him in the establishing and building of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3174:16"/>
the Church. Therefore that word must direct
ministers for euer: and consequently they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may add to, nor take from it, but gouerne
it onely by the rules that be there prescribed.</p>
            <p>2 Euery house ought to be ruled by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the skilfull, wise, and careful househol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
onely: But the Church is the house of God,
and God is such a householder: Therefore the
Church ought to be ruled by the orders of God
onely, which are no where to be had, but in his
worde.</p>
            <p>3 That which teacheth euery good way, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
also how the Church must be gouerned:
But the word of God teacheth euery good way:<note place="margin">Prouerb. 2. 9.</note>
pro. 2. 9. therefore it teacheth how the Church
must be gouerned.</p>
            <p>4 We cannot glorifie God, but by obedience
to his word; in all that we doe, we must glorifie
God. 1. Cor. 10. 31. Therefore in all that we doe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note>
there must be obedience to the word; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in gouerning his Church.</p>
            <p>5 If meat and drinke be not sanctified vnto
vs,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 5.</note> but by the word &amp; prayer, then much lesse is
any thing holy which is done in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church besides the word: But the
former is true by the testimonie of the Apostle
1. Tim. 4. 5: therfore the latter must be true also.</p>
            <p>6 All lawfull things are of fayth. Rom. 14 23.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note>
All lawfull things that are of fayth, haue a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the word, for the word is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fayth; therefore all things lawfull, haue
their warrant from the word: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euery lawfull action in the gouernement of
the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3174:16"/>
7 Eyther hath God left a prescript forme of
gouernement for the Church, vnder the newe
testament: or he is lesse careful for it now, then
he was vnder the lawe; for his care is in guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it: But he is as careful now for his church
as he was then: Therefore hath hee left a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
forme to gouerne it.</p>
            <p>8 He that was as faythfull as Moses,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 2.</note> left as
clear instruction, both for the buylding of faith,
and gouernment of the Churche, as Moses did:
But Christ was as faythfull in Gods house. Heb.
3. 2: therefore he lefte as cleare instruction for
them both as Moses; but Moses gaue direction
euen for euery particular, as appeareth in the
buylding of the Tabernacle, and order of the
priesthood. Therefore hath Christe also giuen
particuler direction for the gouernment of the
Church.</p>
            <p>9 If the word of God haue described suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ministers and ministeries, for the buylding
of the Church, and keeping it in good order,
then is our assertion true: But it hath set downe
sufficient for doctrine,<note place="margin">Rom 12. 5. 6. 7. 1. Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

distributing, and ordering of euery particular
Churche or generall Synode: Therefore is our
assertion true.</p>
            <p>10 That gouernement which the Apostles
taught and planted, is expressed in the word of
God: But the Apostles taught and planted, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
and teachers for instruction, elders for
ouersight, and deacons to distribute, and that
vniformely in euery Churche, as appeareth by
their writinges and practises: Therefore a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
forme of gouernement is expressed in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3174:17"/>
worde.</p>
            <p>11 Euery lawfull office &amp; action in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Churche,<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 25. 26</note> is from heauen. Matth. 21.
25. 26. Euery thing that is (in the ordinarie buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
from heuen, is reueled in the word: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euerye lawfull office and action is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the worde.</p>
            <p>12 If God continued (in regarde of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
the Church administration, as wel as the
things to be administred, then is the forme of
Discipline described in the word. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true, as appeareth by the particulars; for
priests, pastours; for teaching Leuites, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the law, Teachers; for rulers of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
Elders; for Leuiticall lookers to the
treasurie, Deacons; for the Saned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rim, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershipp:
therefore the forme of gouernment
is prescribed in the word.</p>
            <p>13 Euery wise king that is careful for his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
setteth downe Lawes for the gouernment
of the same, and will haue them tyed to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But Christ is such a king vnto his church:
Therefore hath he prescribed Lawes vnto his
Church, which none therein can alter or diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey;
and consequently, the certaine forme of
gouernment of the Church is described in the
worde.</p>
            <p>14 That which the ministers must teach the
people to obserue, is set downe in the worde of
god, for they may teach nothing but that which
is there,<note place="margin">Matth. 28 20:</note> Matth. 28. 20: But they are to teache,
them to obserue, and be obedient vnto, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
forme of the Churche gouernement:
Therfore the particular forme is set downe in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3174:17"/>
the word.</p>
            <p>15 Euery gouernment consisteth in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
matter wherabout they are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and maner of doing it: But in the word
are described all these particulars, as it is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the 9. reason: Therfore the word prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
a prescript forme of gouernment.</p>
            <p>16 The Christian religion shall finde,<note place="margin">Cyprian in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone de baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Christi.</note> that

in some calling warraunted by the
worde of God, and some congregation
must haue neede of such a one, before
he be called to any function. Wherein
are these propositions.</p>
            <p>1 No calling is lawfull in the Churche,<note place="margin">The first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> but
that whiche is directly warraunted out of the

            <p>The BB. and their adherentes thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as their practize in ordeyning Archbysh.
L. Byshops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
officialls, &amp;c. doth plainly declare.</p>
            <p>2 The name and office of an Archb.<note place="margin">The second pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position.</note> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the word of God.</p>
            <p>3 No man may be ordeined vnto any office
in the Church, vntill there be such a place void
as he is fit for: <hi>T. C.</hi> 1. booke, page 61.</p>
            <p>They thinke otherwise, as their making of so
many ministers at once proueth, and as is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<hi>VVhitgist</hi> page 222.</p>
            <p>1 The first is prooued thus:<note place="margin">Reason for the first proposition Iohn. 1. 23. 25.</note> If Iohn was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
to prooue his ministerie out of the
Scriptures when the Priests accused him; then
is no calling lawfull, that hath not his warrant
in the word, for if any be priuiledged, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarye
ministers (whereof he was one) are
specially excepted: But he prooued his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
by the word, as appeareth by his aunswere
vnto them, in the 23. verse. Therfore no calling
is lawfull in the Church, that hath not his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in the word.</p>
            <p>2 The callings vnder the Gospell must haue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3174:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as good warrant as they had vnder the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the light of the Gospell is (at the least) as
cleare as that of the law: But there was neuer
any lawfull calling vnder the lawe (excepting
those that were by miraculous manner confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from heauen) whiche had not his directe
warrant out of the worde. Therefore no calling
is lawfull in the Churche, whiche is not directly
warranted in the word.</p>
            <p>3 If Corath Dathan and Abiram (though
they were Leuites) were punished for that they<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note>
had no warrant for that which they presumed
to take in hande, then is euerye lawfull calling,
both in generall warranted out of the worde, &amp;
particularly layde vppon the parties from the
Lorde: But the former is true, as the historie
teacheth vs: Therefore must the latter needes
be true also.</p>
            <p>4 That which giueth comfort vnto a man in
the time of his troubles, must haue a warraunt
out of Gods worde: But euerye lawfull calling
giueth comfort vnto a man in the time of his
troubles: Therefore euery lawfull calling hath
a warrant out of Gods word.</p>
            <p>5 That which helpeth Gods people forward
in godlines, must haue a warraunt out of Gods
word: for God hath promised a blessing to his
owne ordinance onely: But euery lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Churche, helpeth Gods people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in godlines: Therefore euerie lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
hath a warrant out of Gods word.</p>
            <p>Therefore if Iohn did prooue his calling out
of the Scriptures;<note place="margin">The conclusion</note> if euerye calling vnder the
lawe, was warraunted out of the Scriptures; if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3174:19"/>
Corath, &amp;c. were punnished for enterprising
that which they had no warrant for, out of the
Scriptures; if comfort in troubles commeth
onely from the Scriptures; and lastly, if euery
helpe to godlines is warraunted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
then, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They confesse all these reasons to be true,
but do denie that the Archbish. L. B. &amp;c. be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
ministers from others. <hi>VVhigift</hi> page
303. which we holde <hi>T. C.</hi> 1. booke page 438 &amp;
prooue it thus.</p>
            <p>1 Those thinges that haue diuers efficient
causes, are diuers: Our BB. and the ministers of
the worde haue diuers efficient causes, for the
one is the ordinance of God, the other the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of humane pollicie, as themselues doe
confesse: Therefore they are distinct ministers
from others.</p>
            <p>2 A diuers forme maketh diuers things: the
minister<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the word, and the L. Byshops haue
diuers formes: for their ordination (euen in
the Church of England) is diuers, seeing one L.
B. may ordaine a minister: But there must bee
three to ordaine one of them: Therefore they
are distinct ministers.</p>
            <p>3 Members of one diuision are distincte one
from another: the L. BB. and ordinarie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
bee members of one diuision: for vsually
the ministers be diuided into the rulers, &amp; them
that are to be ruled: therefore they are distinct
ministers.</p>
            <p>4 The things that haue diuers effects, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
in them-selues one from another: the L.
BB. and other ministers haue diuers effects; for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3174:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the one effecteth rule and gouernement, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
subiection and obedience: Therfore they
are diuers and distinct ministers.</p>
            <p>5 They that be imploied about diuers things
are diuers one from another: The L. Bb. and
the ordinary ministers, be imployed about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
things, for the one is exercised in generall
viewe of many congregations, and the other in
the particular direction of one: Therfore they
be distinct ministers.</p>
            <p>6 That which is perpetuall, and that which
may be taken away by men, are distinct one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
another: The office of the minister is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
Ephes. 4. 13. and the Bb. may be taken away
as themselues do confesse: Therefore they are
diuers, and distinct ministers.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the ministers of the worde,<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> and
L. Bb. proceed from diuers causes; if they haue
their being by diuers formes; if they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of one diuision, which (in nature) cannot
be one; if they produce diuers effectes; if they
be exercized about diuers subiectes: lastly, if
the one be perpetuall, and the other but for a
time, then must it needes followe, that they are
diuers &amp; distinct ministers one from another.

            <p>1 <hi>Obiection</hi> Clemens aloweth of those names,<note place="margin">Whitgift page 318.</note>

               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> Polydor is but the reporter, and M.
Iewell hath prooued euidently against Harding
that Clemens is countefeite, and worthy of no

            <p>2 <hi>Obiection</hi> Erasmus sayth that Titus was an

he liued: but that prooueth not that he helde
him one in deed, no more then our naming of
the Archb. of Canterburye, when we speake of
him, prooueth that we like and allow his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>

Iraeneus saith lib. 4. cap. 63. that the Apostles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned

of Archb.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Obiection</hi> The Councell of Nice Canon 6.

            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> That prooueth nothing, for it was
onely as much as to say, the Bish. of the chiefe
Citie.</p>
            <p>Secondly the reasons that prooue the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Archb.<note place="margin">That the office of Archb. is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> vnlawfull be these.</p>
            <p>1 Euery ministery that is lawful, must be of
God: The office of the Archb. is not of God,
for that he is not described in the worde, and
themselues confesse that he is of humane pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie:
Therefore the office of the Archb. is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
            <p>2 That ministery whose original is vnknown,
hath no warrant from Gods worde, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is vnlawfull: The original of the Arch.
is vnknowne as they confesse; <hi>VVhitgift</hi> page
351. Therefore it is vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>3 That office which is needles in the church
is also vnlawful to be exercised in the same: The
office of the Archb. is needlesse, for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
is perfect without it, as the Apostle proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
Ephes. 4. 13. Therefore the office of an
Archb. is vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>4 If all the giftes needful for the perfecting
of the Church, be appropriated vnto other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries,
then is his ministery vnlawful: But al
the needful gifts, are appropriated vnto pastors
doctors, elders &amp; deacons, whereof he is none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore his office is vnlawful.</p>
            <p>5 That office is vnlawful, which none may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3174:22"/>
lawfully giue: But none may lawfully bestowe
the office of an Archb. because none can giue
any newe giftes to adorne him withall: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his office is vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>This reason being vsed of all sounde diuines
against the pope, is of the same valewe against
the Archb.</p>
            <p>6 If the office of an Archb. be lawfull, then it
is eyther in respect of his excellencie aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, or the place whereof he is aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places: But neyther of these haue euer
bene, neyther hereafter can be: Therefore that
office is vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the office of the Archb.<note place="margin">The conclusion</note> be not
of God; if the original of it be vnknown; if in
the Church it be needlesse; if all the gifts that
God hath bestowed vppon his ministery be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
vnto those Church officers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is none; if none may lawfully bestow such
an office vpon any; if it can neyther bee inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
vnto any one man for his excellencie, nor
his place for preheminence: then must it needs
follow, that his office is vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>Caluin in his Institut. booke 4. cap. 11. sect. 7.
alleadgeth diuers reasons to this purpose, and
Beza in his booke of diuorcements, stretcheth
the same to all the inferiour officers vnder him
saying: Officials, proctors, promotours, and all
that swinish filth, now of long time hath wasted
the Churche. So doth Peter Martyr vppon the
Rom. 13. speaking against ciuill Iurisdiction in
Byshops, doth by the same reasons condemne
it in their substitutes.</p>
            <p>But this being the corner stone of their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3174:23"/>
they labour to support it with many props
the most special whereof are these.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Obiection</hi> Cyprian sayth, lib. 1. Epist. 3. <hi>ad

and the answere that M. Iewel and others make
to it, serueth our turne: onely let this be noted,
that Cyprian speaketh of the people at Rome,
that had receiued another bishop (besides Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius)
who was an haeretike; for all the course
of his writings, condemneth this superioritie.
It is expounded by M. Iewel, booke 1. sect. 4. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision

            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> Cyprian lib. 1. Epist. 13. sayth that

            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> From the beginning it was not so:
the sayinge of Tertull. <hi>Contra Prax.</hi> is fitt for
this: that is true whatsoeuer is firste, and that
is false whatsoeuer is latter: and Ierome sayth
in the place alleaged, that this authority is by
custome and not by any institution of God; if
it had bene the best way to take away diuisions,
the Apostles (in whose times the controuersies
did arise) would haue taken the same order.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Obiection</hi> Caluine sayth that the Apostles
had one among them to gouerne the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> That was not in superioritie, but
for order to propound the matters, gather the
voyces and such like; which is meete to be in
euery wel ordered meeting: but his authority
is no more ouer the rest, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the speaker in the
Parliament hath ouer the other knightes and
Burgesses.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>Obiection</hi> Paule was superior to Timothy
and Titus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> Paule and they had diuers offices,
whereof the Apostles office was the chiefe, the

            <p>1 As was the 12. place for Matthias, so is a

Matthias was not ordained vnto the place of
an Apostle,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 20</note> vntill Iudas by hanging himself, had
made it voyde, Act. 1. 20. Therefore may none
be ordained vnto any office in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the place where he may be imployed, be
destitute of such a one.</p>
            <p>2 As the Apostles did in planting of the
Churches, so must it bee done in the buyldinge
thereof for euer: But they ordayned neyther
pastour, teacher, elder or deacon, but to some
certaine Church that had neede therof: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may none bee ordayned vnto any office,
vntill a place be voyd that hath need of him.</p>
            <p>3 Those thinges that bee of one beginning,
continuance and ending, cannot be one, before
or after another: But a minister, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3174:24"/>
of his ministery in a lawfull standing be
so; for they be relatiues, &amp; haue reference one

be ordained before there be a ministery wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

            <p>4 If non ought to be called to be a shepherd,
that hath no flocke of sheepe to keepe: neither
any watchman, that is not allotted to som place
to watch: then may none be ordayned to any
office, before there be a place void for him: for
ministers are in this sence tearmed shepheards

            <p>5 To do contrary to the precepts and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize

               </gap>pensations for
many benefices. The reasons we alleadge to
prooue the necessitie of perpetuall residence,
and the vnlawfulnes of nonresidence be these
that follow.</p>
            <p>1 A shepheard hath a flocke to the ende to
feed it continually: The minister is a shepherd,
and his charge a flocke: Therefore he ought
to feede it continually, and consequently to be
perpetually resident, for how can he feed them
from whom he is absent.</p>
            <p>2 Where God doth place anye man, there
his continuall trauaile is needfull, for God is
most wise in disposing euery thing: But God
placeth euery right minister ouer that people,
which is his charge: Therefore his continuall
trauaile is needfull there, and consequently he
may not discontinue.</p>
            <p>3 Flockes that are in danger, are (by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
shepeards) watched night and day, Luk. 2. 8.
Euery congregation is a flocke in daunger, for
the enemie goeth about like a roaring lyon, 1.
Pet. 5. 8. and soweth tares whilest men sleepe.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3174:26"/>
Math. 13. 25. Therefore euery congregation is
to bee watched night and day by the minister
therof, and consenquently he may not be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resident.</p>
            <p>4 If his dutie to them requireth so muche
trauayle, as may continually set him on wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
then may he not be nonresident: But it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(that it doth so) to all them that eyther
know by the worde of God, what studie, prayer,
doctrine, exhortation, &amp;c. be required of him,
or maketh anye conscience of giuing account
for the souls committed to their charge: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not they be nonresident.</p>
            <p>5 If the minister cannot apply himself fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to the capacitie of his people, vnlesse hee
haue particular knowledge of their disposition,
and capacitie, then is it not lawfull for him to
be nonresident: for by continuall residence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, he may knowe them and not else:
But the former is true, as the small knowledge
that the people get by generall teaching, doth
euidently declare: Therfore it is not lawful for
him to be nonresident.</p>
            <p>6 If the ministers of the Gospell, be as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
tyed to their charges, as the priests vnder
the law, then may they not be nonresident: For
they were alwayes readie in the Temple, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
the doubts, 1. Sam. 1. 9: But it is clear that
they are, because men are now as hardly tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto godlines, and the enemie is as wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as he was then: Therefore they may not
be nonresident.</p>
            <p>7 If the minister must be an example to his
people; then must he be daily present with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3174:26"/>
that they may beholde him: But the former is
true, 1. Tim. 4. 12. Therfore is the latter true also.</p>
            <p>8 He whom the sheepe are to follow in and
out, and must knowe by the voyce, ought to bee
continually among them: A good minister of
the worde is such a one, Iohn. 10. 4. Therefore
he must be resident among them.</p>
            <p>9 None can be alwayes readie to feede his
flocke, that is absent from it: Euerye minister
must be alwayes readie to feede his flocke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it dependeth vpon him. 1. Pet. 5. 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euery minister is to bee resident with his
flocke.</p>
            <p>10 Hee that must take heede to his flocke,
watch ouer it, and feed it, must be resident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with it: Euery minister must do so, Act.
20. 28. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>11 If Satan be the cause of nonresidence, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is it vtterly vnlawfull: But Satan is the cause of

            <p>NOne is to be admitted vnto any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
office in the Church vntill he be
thorowly examined by the eldership,
both concerning his state of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,
&amp; abilitie to that place where
to he is to be called, T. C. 1. book: page 38. Disci.
Ecclesiast fol. 46: They thinke one may do it,
as appeareth by the book of ordering, &amp;c. <hi>VVhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist</hi>

               <hi>The former is prooued, and the latter disprooued thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Those that are to ordayne, must haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
knowledge of the parties to bee orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
(or else they breake the rule prescribed
them, 1. Tim. 5. 22) which cannot be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination:
But the Eldership is to ordaynee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye
Churche officer, as shall appeare in the
Chap. of Ordination: Therefore it belongeth
to the Eldership to examine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2 The matter of greatest importance in the
gouernement of the Churche, must be done by
the most able gouernours of the same: The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing
or disproouing of Churche officers, is
the matter of greatest importance, because the
consequence of ruling well is the best, or ill the
worst: and the Eldership is the Senate of most
able gouernours in the Church, as shall appear
in the Chap. of Eldership: Therefore the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is to examine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3 The way whereby a mans insufficiencie is
best espyed, and his abilitie discerned, is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to examine them that are to be admitted:
But by the eldership (consisting of diuers) his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3174:32"/>
is best espyed, and his abilitie best
discerned, for the common prouerbe telleth vs
that many eyes do see more then one: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it belongeth to the Eldership, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4 They are to examine Church officers, that
are least subiect to be blinded with partiallitie:
But the Eldership is least subiect to partiallitie,
both for that they be many, who are not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
ouer ruled by affection or fauour, as one, as
also (and that especially) for that it being the
Lords owne ordinance (as shall appeare) we are
to perswade our selues, that his spirit shal guyde
them: Therefore it belongeth to the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>5 The way that was vsed in the Apostles time
in examining, is of vs to be folowed, vnles some
reason out of the word to perswade the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
can be alleadged to the contrary, which
none haue euer yet done: But many vsed in the
Apostles time to examine, as appereth in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out one to be in the place of Iudas, Act. 1.
22. 23. and fit men for Deacons, Act. 6, 5. wherof
the gouernours especially were some, for that
they were to ordayn vpon knowledge, as is said
in the first reason: Therefore it belongeth to
the Eldership. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6 They whose testimony the people may
best credit, are to examine them that are to be
admitted: But the people may best credite the
iudgement of a company of able and sufficient
men, which the Eldershipp rightly established
must needes be: Therefore it belongeth to the
Eldership. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>7 Examination belongeth vnto them which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3174:33"/>
may most perswade the people of his sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
&amp; so procure gretest reuerence vnto him in
his place: But the examination by the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is such: Therefore it belongeth to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore if they that are to ordain, must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine:<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note>

gouernment of the Churche, &amp; they the most

must be able to teach the people, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
Christe hath commaunded. Matth. 28. 20.
Onely he that is able to teache the trueth, and
conuince the gainsayers, can teach the people
whatsoeuer Christ hath commanded: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

but such as be able to teach, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2 That which is to be done conditionally,
may not be done, if that condition be not kept:
Men are to be receiued into the ministery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,
that is, if they bee vnrepro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Tit. 1. 5. 6. Therefore if they be not such as bee

consequently, none may be receiued, but such
as be able to teach. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3 That which cannot be done without the
manifest brech of Gods commandement, may
not be done at all: To receiue any that be not
able to teach, is a manifest breach of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
1. Tim. 3. 1. Tit. 1. 9. Therefore no

that is not able to teach, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4 They whome the Lorde refuseth to be his
ministers, may not be receiued into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:
for the ministery being the Lords haruest,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3174:34"/>
we may admit none to labour therein, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such, as he hath giuen liking of, by the rules
of his worde: The Lorde refuseth to be his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
all those that cannot teach: Hosea 4. 6.
Therefore such as are not able to teache, may
not be receiued, and consequently none may
be receiued, but those that be able to teach, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5 He that may be admitted into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
must be able to deuide the word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
2. Tim. 2. 15. Onely he that is able to teach

            <p>6 He that may bee admitted into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,

such as be able to teach the trueth, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince

            <p>Many are the arguments that be alleaged to
this purpose, and many moe may be alleadged,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3174:35"/>
(for the whole course of the scriptures tende
therevnto) the testimony of all sorts of writers,
is very plentifull for this purpose: yea of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Canon law, (as the authour of the <hi>Abstracte</hi>
hath learnedly prooued) and yet doe not our
prelates rest in the same, but haue sett them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
(though in a silly maner) against it, in this
sort that followeth.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Obiection</hi> There must bee reading in the
Church, therefore a reading ministery, <hi>VVhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi>
page 252.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> By that reason we must haue an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
for euery particular action, for there must
be breaking of bread in the Church, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of water; but it followeth not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there must bee one, whose office must bee
onely to breake bread, or to powre water.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Obiection</hi> It is better to haue readers then
none, for preachers cannot be had for euerye
congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> It is not better, for if they had non,
they would seek for him that they should haue;
whereas nowe, they that haue a reader onely,
thinke themselues in case good inough: but if
there be such want of prechers, why are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the most diligent and able ones turned
out.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Obiection</hi> It is impossible to haue prechers
euery where, and suche as can be had, must bee
taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> Sometimes you say all is well: and
is it now impossible that our state shoulde obey
the Lordes ordinance; this is the greatest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to it that can be: and yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> followeth not,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3174:35"/>
for no necessitie may warrant vs, to violate the
decrees of the highest.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Obiection</hi> It were vncharitablenes to turne
them out that be bare readers, for so they, their
wiues and children might beg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> This is to sell mens souls for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of bread: shall we rather feare the begging
of 3. or 4. then the damnation of 1000. but they
may bee otherwayes prouided for; they neede
not beg, many of them may returne to their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations

            <p>So that al these obiections notwithstanding,
the conclusion remaineth sure, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>
               <hi>The Churche ought not to be gouerned by Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

            </p>
            <p>1 They which are no Elders of the Church,
haue nothing to do in the gouernement of the
same, 1. Tim 5. 17. These chauncellors, commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
&amp; officialls, are no Elders in the Church;
whether we expound Elder for a minister, and
him also, that is assistant vnto the minister in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseeing
the Churche, or for a minister onely
as they do: for none of them be ministers, and
if they be, they doe not rule in this respect, that
they are ministers: Therefore the Churche
ought not to be gouerned by them.</p>
            <p>2 They that must gouerne the Churche of
God, must haue a warraunt for their so doing,
from Iesus Christ the head of the Church: But
Chauncellors, &amp;c. haue no warraunt so to doe,
from Iesus Christe the heade of the Churche:
Therefore the Church ought not to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3174:36"/>
by them.</p>
            <p>3 Those whose names offices and practize,
be deriued from Antichrist, may haue nothing
to do in the gouernement of the Churche: for
who will suffer his wife to be gouerned by the
Master of a brothelhouse: But the names, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and practize of Chauncellors, officialls and
commissaries be such, which is playne by this,
that they haue their grounde in that filthie
dunghill the cannon law: Therefore they may
haue nothing to do in the gouernement of the
Church.</p>
            <p>4 They that being iuferiours, doe proudly
tyrannize ouer their superiours, ought not to
rule the Church of God, for it is meet it should
be ruled by modest, humble and orderly men:
But such are they (for being inferiors to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the word, as our aduersaries doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and is plaine also by the cannon lawe
they crow ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if they wer their slaues:)
and if they doe not so, they can doe nothing:
Therefore they ought not to rule the Churche
of God.</p>
            <p>5 They that liue by the faultes of men, are
not fit to rule the Church of God: for they wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
rather increase offences (that their gayne may

(also) prooueth: But suche are all Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
commissaries and officials: Therefore
they ought not to rule the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if chauncellors, commissaries &amp;
officialls be no Elders of the Churche; if they
haue no warraunt from Iesus Christe, the head
of the Church; if their names, offices and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize,

be deriued from Antichrist; if their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
compel them (being inferiors) to tyrannize
ouer their superiours; if they liue onely by the
faults and offences of men: then it must needs
followe, that the Churche of God ought not to

that haue warrant out of the worde, to

if the bishops and Elders were to laye on

Church officers are not to be ordained by one

            <p>THe ordaining of Churche officers must
be done with humble prayer of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
and the congregation, Discipl.
Ecclesiast. fol 50.</p>
            <p>Their vnreuerent beginning &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedding

this: which is condemned by the proofe of our
assertion by these reasons.</p>
            <p>1 We are to behaue our selues in these acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as they by whom we haue direction to doe
them, haue set vs an example: But the Apostles
and Elders, when they ordayned Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
did alwayes commende the action to God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3174:38"/>
by prayer, together with those congregations,
ouer which they placed them, Act. 6. 6. &amp; 14. 23.
Therefore the ordeyning of Churche officers
must be done by humble prayer of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and congregation.</p>
            <p>2 The greater the action is that is in hand,
the more carefull must they be that haue it in
hand, to humble themselues by prayer, for the
Lords assistance therein: But the ordeyning of
Churche officers, is an action of most weightie
importance: Therefore they that haue it in
hand (which be the Eldershipp to ordayne him,
&amp; congregation to receiue him) ought to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselues in earnest prayer before hand.</p>
            <p>3 They that shall haue part in the comfort
or discomfort of the action, are to ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in prayer vnto God for the better euent,
and against the worse: But the Eldershipp and
people, shall both haue part in the euent of the
action: Therefore they are to ioyne together

            <p>CHurche officers must be ordayned by
laying on of hands; in this they agree
with vs, concerning the ceremonie it
selfe, albeit neyther in the parties by
whome, nor on whome it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
The profit of this ceremonie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the reasons following.</p>
            <p>1 That which stirreth vp euerye partie, to
pray with more feruencie, is profitable to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
But such is this ceremonie, for it affecteth
the ordeyners, when they feele him for whom
they pray; and the ordeyned when he feeleth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3174:38"/>
a calling and charge from God (as it were) sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie
comming vpon him, and the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when they see him seperated from the rest,
by whome they shall reape muche comfort or
griefe: Therefore the vse of it is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>2 That which helpeth forward the party or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
in his care, to walke with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in his calling, is profitable to be vsed: Such
is the imposition of hands, for both it declareth
vnto him, that he is separated of God for that
purpose, &amp; also giueth him hope, that his hand
who allotted him therevnto, will alwayes assist
him in the course of that calling: Therefore
it is of a profitable vse.</p>
            <p>3 That which worketh a more acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods ordinance in the heartes of the
people, is profitable to be vsed: Such is the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of handes, for it declareth vnto them,
that the Lorde hath placed him in that calling
ouer them: Therefore it is profitable to bee
vsed.</p>
            <p>Therefore seeing the ceremonie of layinge
on handes is forcible,<note place="margin">The conclusio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> to increase the feruencie
of euery partie, when they pray; seeing it assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the calling to the partie ordayned, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him an argument of good hope, for the
blessing of God vppon him in the course of
the same; and seeing it procureth a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
in the people, that he is allotted vnto
them from the Lord himselfe; it is euident that
it is not a vaine and idle ceremonie (as manie
do imagine) but of good and profitable vse, in al

            <p>2 That which maketh an open entrance to

to haue mo charges then one, maketh open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
for the enemie to spoyle, for the wolffe

            <p>3 That whiche hath neither precepte, nor

            <p>4 That which declareth a minister to bee

            <p>5 All the reasons that bee alleadged in the

to this purpose, for if he may not be nonre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
he may not haue mo charges, vnlesse he

               <p>One minister may haue a soueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3174:40"/>
and Lordshipp ouer his fellowe ministers:
which is thus disprooued.</p>
               <p>1 They that haue their commission indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
giuen them, without difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
one and another, are of equall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and may not be one ouer another: But such
is the commission of all Gods ministers indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
as appeareth, Matth. 28. 19. 20. Therfore
they are of equall authoritie, and may not haue
any dominion one ouer another.</p>
               <p>2 That which Christe hath directly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that may not in any case be allowed, but is

that one minister should haue domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ouer another. Matth. 20. 25. Luk. 22. 25. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one minister may not haue superiority or
dominion ouer another.</p>
               <p>3 They that may not bee Lordes ouer the
people of God, may much lesse be Lordes ouer
the ministers, for the ministers be (in respect of
the ministery) aboue the people: But a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
may not be Lordly ouer Gods people (as is
testified by him on whome they woulde father
the greatest lordlines) 1. Pet. 5. 3. Therefore one
minister may not be Lord, or haue superiority
ouer another.</p>
               <p>4 It is ordayned,<note place="margin">Cyprian lib. 1. Epist. 3.</note> &amp; is equall and right, that
euery mans cause be heard, where the fault was
committed: and it is meete to handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there, where they may haue both the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
and witnesses of the fault; which sheweth
that euery minister had autoritie ouer his own

               <p>5 Bishopps, wheresoeuer they be in all the

one is Lorde, another is seruaunt: whatsoeuer
belongeth to the Churche, belongeth equally
to all, sauing that some are of better giftes then

               <p>9 Equall power and function is giuen to all

no one preferred himselfe before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
sauing onely that for order, some one did

               <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">The conclusion</note> if all ministers haue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

or exercise dominion ouer another.</p>
               <p>Their obiections herevnto (so many as are
worthy any answere) be these.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Obiection</hi> Christ Matth. 20. 25. forbiddeth
onely ambition, and not dominion, as Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
expoundeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ansvvere</hi> Musculus his iudgment appeareth
in the 6. &amp; 7. reasons, the place is expounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
superioritie by Caluin, Bullinger, Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,
Gualter, Hemingius, &amp;c. But let it bee so
expounded: that dominion is ambition, because
it causeth a man to aspire aboue his fellowe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Obiection</hi> The Greeke word signifieth rule
with oppression, which is the thing that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ansvvere</hi> That is not so, for Luk. 22. 25. vseth
the single verbe <hi>Keurieuem,</hi> which signifieth sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
to rule: the sonnes of Zebedeus desired
not to oppresse but to rule, which desire he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Obiection</hi> Christ sayth not, no man shalbe
so, but he that will be so, desiring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ansvvere</hi> But Luke saith, let the greatest be
as your seruant, and therefore that is but a silly
shifte.</p>
               <p>So that their assertions beeinge ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and their obiections answered,<note place="margin">A bishop should be in euery congregation.</note> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth,
that we prooue yet more directly,
that the Lorde hath ordayned, that there
should be a bishop resident ouer euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
which is thus prooued:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:3174:41"/>
1 If a bishop and minister be all one, then
must there be a bishop in euery congregation,
for euery man will confesse that euery congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
ought to haue a minister: But a bishopp
and a minister is all one, as appeareth by this
that S. Paule discribeth not one quallity for the
bishop, but it is also the quallitie of euery good
minister; and also in that hee describeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minister but the bishop: Therefore there
ought to be a bishop in euery congregation.</p>
               <p>2 S. Paules bishopps and his deacons, were
appoynted to one place, as appeareth both in
the description of them, and the practize of the
Apostles: But the deacons were in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
which appeareth Phil. 1. 1. Actes. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that office being needfull euery where; and in
that it continued so, longer then the office of

               <p>3 That which Paule enioyned to Titus, is
also to be practized alwaies in the like case: But
he commanded him to ordaine Elders in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
citie, Tit. 1. 5. which are expounded in the

where there was not to furnish both bishop and

a minister and a bishop is all one, and (vpon Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus)
a bishopp and a minister are the same: and

two or three cities, yea of a whole countrie, for
that it is contrary to the doctrin of S. Paul, who
writing to Titus, commandeth that he shoulde
ordayne a bishop in euery towne.</p>
               <p>11 It is pitie to see howe farre the office of a

            <p>FOr the further reuealing of the trueth,
God hath ordayned, that there shoulde
be in the Churche Doctors, whose office
is to be employed in teaching of doctrin,
and is an office different from that of the
Pastour.</p>
            <p>The latter part of this proposition, is the
thing which especially they doe deny, which is
thus prooued to be true.</p>
            <p>1 Those whiche the Apostle (in speaking of
distinct officers) doe distinguish one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are seuerall &amp; distinct one from another:
But the Apostle distinguishe the Pastoure and
teacher, one from another, Rom 12. 7. 8. and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.
4. 11. euen as hee distinguisheth man and
woman. Gal. 3. 28. See the Greek of them both:
Therefore the office of pastour and Doctor are
distinct one from another.</p>
            <p>2 As are the gifts that adorne offices, so are
the officers themselues, for the execution of
the office, consisteth in the employing of the
gifts: But the gifts of the pastour and Doctor
are diuers, as appeareth 1. Cor. 12. 8. and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
for some hath an excellent gift in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and not in application, and others excel
in application and exhortation, that are verye
meane, in deliuering of doctrine: Therefore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3174:43"/>
the office of a pastor &amp; teacher, are distinct one
from another.</p>
            <p>3 Those that are to take a diuers course in
teaching are diuers, and different in their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for els why should they be enioyned to
take a diuers course: But the pastor is to take
one course, &amp; the Doctor another, for the one
is to direct himselfe principally to exhort, and
the other to attend vpon doctrine: Rom. 12. 7. 8.
Therefore the office of pastour and Doctor, be
distinct offices the one from the other.</p>
            <p>4 The Ecclesiastical stories (especially spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Church of Alexandria) doe vsually
make a difference betwixt the bishopp and the
Doctor.</p>
            <p>5 Cathedrall Churches haue yet som shew
thereof left in them, who (besides the bishopp)
haue also one that readeth a Lecture in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</p>
            <p>6 If the distinguishing of them, make more
for the buylding of the Churche, then the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them; then are they to be distinguished,
and not made all one: But the former is true, as
appeareth by this, that hardly is a people broght
to a sounde knowledge of godlines, by him
that instructeth in doctrine continually, &amp; as
hardly are wee stirred vp to a zealous care of
our duetie, though we be exhorted continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
which both shoulde bee with lesse continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
if one man were to performe all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are to be esteemed distinct offices, &amp;
not parts of one office, which one is to perform.</p>
            <p>Therfore,<note place="margin">The conclusion</note> if the Apostle Paul distinguisheth
them one from another; if God do vsually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bestow

doctrine and exhortation vpon seuerall

to take one course in teaching, and the

they denie, <hi>VVhitgift</hi> p. 627. &amp; their practize in
keeping them out of the Church: but it is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be true, by these reasons following.</p>
            <p>1 That which the Apostles established in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
congregation, ought still to continue, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Churche must bee ruled by the same
lawes that it was ruled by then, and needeth as
great furtherance now, as it did then: But the
Apostles established Elders in euery congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Act 14 23. which cannot be vnderstood of
preaching Elders onely; considering that the
scarcitie of them was suche, as Paule was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
to sende Timothie and Titus to great
cities, which he could hardly spare, as he often
testifieth: Therefore there ought to be suche
Elders, as are onely to assiste in gouerrment in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3174:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
euery congregation.</p>
            <p>2 Those which God hath ordayned to help
forward the building of the Churche, ought to
be in euerye congregation, vnlesse it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that some congregation needeth not so
much helpe as Christe hath appoynted: But
Christ hath ordayned Elders in the Churche,
for the helping forwarde of the building of the
Churche. 1. Cor. 12. 28. Therefore suche Elders
ought to be in euery congregation.</p>
            <p>3 That which being wanting, the bodie can
not be entire, that same must be in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:
But the Elders cannot be wanting,
and the Church be an entire bodie, Rom. 12. 8.
which euery congregation should be, Rom. 12. 4
Therefore there ought to be such Elders in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
congregation.</p>
            <p>4 If the word of God doe describe such El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Church, then ought they to be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
congregation, which is cleare by this, that
euery congregation hath need of them, as well
as any: and that euery congregation must haue
all the other officers of the Churche: and that
euery congregation is of equall dignitie in the
bodie of Christ: But the worde of God descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
vnto vs such Elders. 1. Tim. 5. 17. Therfore
they ought to be in euery congregation.</p>

Seniors, pag. 638. Let it then appeare out of the

left out.</p>
            <p>16 If the platforme set downe to Timothie
and Titus be for all Churches, then must El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
be in all; for these Elders are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed:
But it is a platforme for all Churches,
and that to the ende of the world, 1. Tim. 6. 14.
Therefore they ought to be in euerye congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

17 That which is contained in euery mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
Matth. 28. 20. or els they ordayned El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
without warrant from Christ, which none
dare affirme: Therefore there must be Elders
in euery congregation.</p>
            <p>18 Wheresoeuer a bishoppe must be, there
must also the Elders bee, whiche appeareth by
this, that where the one is described, there is
the other also: But a bishopp must be in euery
congregation, as I haue prooued sufficiently
in the 10. Chap. Therefore there ought to be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in euery congregation.</p>
            <p>19 If the Apostles laboured for vniformitie
in the least things, and established in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
one order, then must there be Elders in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
congregation, for they were in some, as al
men do confesse: But the former is true, as not
onely the view of their practize declareth, but
also the Apostles expresse words; Thus I teach
in all Churches: Therefore the latter is true
also, that in euery congregation there must be
such Elders.</p>
            <p>Therfore,<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> if the Apostles established Elders
in euery congregation; if Christe hath estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

and be approoued by the testimonie of manie

confessed by the greatest aduersary vnto them;
if they be within the compasse of euerye mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

vniformitie, euen in the meanest thinges;
then must it needs followe, that there ought to
be such Elders in euery congregation, as are to
assiste the minister in the gouernement of the
same.</p>
            <p>They confesse it was so in the Apostles
time, but seeme to say somewhat that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be vnder a christian magistrate thus:
1 <hi>Obiection</hi> God hath giuen the soueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
ouer his Church to the Christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
which these Elders would abridge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvver</hi> No more then the eldership abridged
the soueraigntie of Dauid ouer Israell, for his
gouernment is temporall, and theirs spirituall.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Obiection</hi> Gualter vpon the 1. Cor. 5. denieth
it to be needfull vnder a christian magistrate.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> That is no truer, then to saye the

for these be thinges, that his high authoritie
must see done, but he may doe none of them
himselfe.<note place="margin">Reasons proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Elders as necessary vnder a christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, as in the Apostles time.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But there be many reasons which may bee
alleadged, to prooue that they are (at the least)
as necessary vnder a Christian magistrate in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3174:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these dayes, as they were in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
as namely these:</p>
            <p>1 The lesse able that ministers are to direct
their people in the wayes of godlines, the more
neede they haue of the assistaunce that God
hath allowed them in his word: But ministers
are now lesse able (especially vnder Christian
magistrats, when men are ouertaken with ease
and peace, which quench good things) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
were in the time of the Apostles: Therefore
there is as great (if not greater) need of Elders
now, then was in the time of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>2 If christian magistrates be to maintayne
the order that Christ hath set down for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of his Churche, then must there be
Elders in it vnder a Christian magistrate, for
Elders are approoued of Christ, 1. Cor. 12. 8. But
Christian magistrates are to mayntaine the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Christe hath set downe for the ruling
of his Church, Isai. 49. 23. Therefore there must
be Elders in the Church, vnder a christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>
            <p>3 If the rule of Christe cannot be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
obserued, tell the Church, vnlesse there be
Elders; then must there be such vnder a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
magistrate: But the former is true, for by
the Churche is there ment the Senate of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Elders, as shall be prooued in the
chapter of Excommunication: Therfore there
must be Elders vnder a Christian magistrate.</p>
            <p>4 If the whole gouernement of the Churche
described in the Epistles to Timothie &amp; Titus,
be to bee obserued vntill the ende, then must
there bee Elders vnder Christian magistrates,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3174:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for they are contayned in those Epistles: But
the former is true. 1. Tim. 6. 14. Therefore there
must be Elders vnder a christian magistrate.</p>
            <p>5 Where sinners are more outragious, and
the best most subiect to wax cold, there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
neede of all the helpes that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
to punish sinne, and to cherish well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But so it is vnder a christian magistrate, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in the peace of the Church, as <hi>VVhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi>
confesseth, page 643. Therefore there is (at
the least) as great neede of Elders (seeing they
are helpers appointed of God) vnder a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
magistrate, as at any other time.</p>
            <p>Therfore if ministers be lesse able now,<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> then
in the Apostles time; if Christian magistrates
must maintaine the order prescribed by Christ;
if els the rule of Christ, (tel the church) cannot
be still obserued; if the whole gouernment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by S. Paule, must be kept for euer; last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if there be, (at the least) as great neede of all
the helpes that can be, as euer there was: then
must it needs follow, that Elders are as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Churche vnder a christian magistrate,
as in the time of persecution.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3174:47"/>

whereof is this. The office of the Deacon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth

the poore, the liberallitie of the saints, which
they denie, <hi>VVhitgift</hi> page 582. The booke of
ordering, &amp;c. that maketh it a degree of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery:
but the proposition being prooued true,
maketh their opinion and practize appeare
false, which is thus:</p>
            <p>1 That wherein Steuen and the rest were
imployed, is the office of a Deacon: for the first
institution of them by the Apostles, is in that
example: But they were onely to attend vpon
the prouision for the poore: Act. 6. 4. &amp;c There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the office of the Deacon, is only to attend
vpon the distributing vnto the poore, from the
liberallitie of the saints.</p>
            <p>2 That which the Apostle maketh an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narye
and distincte office from others in the
Churche, must be attended vpon by them that
are in the same office, and not be mingled with
any other: But the Apostle Rom. 12. 8. maketh
distributing in simplicitie, such an office as it is
expounded by M. Caluin, Beza, Bucer, Martyr.
&amp;c. Therefore the Deacons office must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
vppon, and consequently, it consisteth
onely in distributing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3 That which the Apostles founde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
insufficient for, that can no man now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
in any tollerable measure, for they were
more adorned with gifts then any be now: But
they found themselues insufficient for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the worde, and distributing vnto the
poore also, Act. 6. 2. Therefore no man can in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3174:47"/>
tollerable measure, discharge the office of a
minister and Deacon also, &amp; consequently, the
Deacon is to attend vpon distributing onely.</p>
            <p>4 If the ministeries of the worde be perfect,
without the Deacon, then may he not meddle
in the same, for how may one lawfully labor, in
that wherein there is no need of him: But such
is the ministery of the word, where the seuerall
ministers thereof are named, Ephes. 4. 11. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Deacon is not contayned, as <hi>VVhitgifte</hi>
confesseth, page 308. &amp; 309. Therefore the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
may not meddle with the ministery of the
word, and consequently must be imployed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in distributing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5 If there bee no quallitie required in the
perfect description of the deacon, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the ministery of the word, then is not he
to medle with the same: But the former is true,
as appeareth, 1. Tim. 3. 8. Therefore the latter is
true also, and consequently, he must attend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon distributing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6 If it belong to the deacons office, to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the ministery of the worde and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
then is it greater, then that of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
for that the doing of both, requireth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
giftes then the one: But it is not a greater,
but inferiour office to the pastor, as appeareth
by all those places wherein they are described,
that the Deacon is described after the bishopp:

            <p>11 The office of Deaconship,<note place="margin">Bueer de reg. Christ. 14.</note> was religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

onely in distributing the goodes of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3174:48"/>
Church; if the Apostle maketh the Deacons
office, an ordinary &amp; distinct office fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al others
in the Churche; if the Apostles were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the ministery of the worde, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting;
if the ministeries of the worde be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
without the deacon; if in the description of
the Deacon, no quallitie bee required, that is
proper to a minister of the word; if to deale in
both would make the Deacon a greater officer
then the pastor; if the Councels, auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the sounde writers of latter times,
do declare that the Deacons were to be wholy
imployed in the distributing of the goods of the
Church; then must it needs follow, that his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is not to meddle with anye part of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the worde and sacraments, but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
onely vpon the distributing of the liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Churche, vnto them that stande in
need thereof.</p>
            <p>Their obiections herevnto, be these two
that follow.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Obiection</hi> Phillip one of the seuen deacons
did preache, Actes 8. 8. therefore Deacons may
preach the word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> Phillip was a deacon of the church
at Ierusalem, while they abode together, but
now he was not any more so, but an Euangelist,
as he is euer tearmed after, by vertue of which
office he did preach.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Obiection</hi> Steuen, beeing a Deacon, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
Act. 7. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvver</hi> He preached not; for all that is there,
was but his Apologie at the seat of iudgement,
which euery man in the like case may doe, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3174:49"/>
which many of the martyrs haue done.</p>
            <p>So that the former proposition beeing true,
vpon the groundes alleadged, notwithstanding
these obiections, we are to proceede to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which is this.</p>
            <p>There ought to be such Deacons (as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the former proposition) in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

which is thus prooued.</p>
            <p>1 That office which euerye congregation
hath need of, ought to be in euery congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But euery congregation hath need of the
Deacons office, whiche appeareth by this, that
they haue poore to prouide for, (or els they
must regarde the necessitie of others) and the
liberallitie of others to distribute: Therefore
Deacons ought to be in euery congregation.</p>
            <p>2 That which is indefinitely appointed for
the good of the Church, belongeth vnto euery
congregatton, as well as to any one: But suche
is the appointment of the Deacons. 1. Tim. 3. 8.
Therfore there must be deacons in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p>3 Euery Church ought to haue their office
of Deaconship.<note place="margin">Ignat. ad Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4 All the reasons (or the most of them) that
are alleadged chap. 10. for a bishopp in euerye
congregation, and chap. 12. for Elders in euery
congregation; are forcible here vnto.</p>
            <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> if there be the like neede of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons

they be appointed indefinitely for the good of

prooued.</p>
            <p>1 Whatsoeuer Christe hath ordayned, as a
meanes, to keepe men in obedience to the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that same must be in euery congregation,
for particuler men are in particuler congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
But Christ hath ordayned the Eldership
for that ende, as appeareth, Matth. 18. 15. &amp;c.
where Chrisost. expoundeth: <hi>Tell the Churche:</hi>
that is sayth he, the gouernors of the Churche:
Therefore the Eldershipp ought to be in euery
Church.</p>
            <p>2 Where all sortes of Elders ought to bee,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3174:50"/>
there must be also the ioyning of their offices
in one, for the good of that congregation ouer
which they are placed: But all sorts of Elders
ought to be in euery congregation, as is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the 10. chap. for bishopps, the 12. for El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp;c. Therefore there must be an Eldership
in euery congregation.</p>
            <p>3 If no perticular congregation haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
priuiledges giuen there vnto by the word of
God then others haue, then must there eyther
be no Eldership at all (which is false, in that El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are prooued to be by the worde of God in
the Church) or els it must be in euery congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
But euery congregation is of like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge,
which appeareth by this, that it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
bodie of it selfe: Therefore there must be
an Eldership in euery congregation.</p>
            <p>4 The same warrant that is in the worde of
God, for to haue an Eldership in one place, is a
warrant for it in all; for the word of God tyeth
it, not to Churches in cities, but indefinitely to
the church: But there is warraunt for it out of
the worde to be some where, as appeareth by
this, that the Apostles are sayd to establish it, &amp;
make mention of it: Therefore it must be in
euery congregation.</p>

Whatsoeuer is obiected against this, that hath
any shewe in it, is aunswered in the 12. chap. of
Elders.</p>
            <p>The office of the Eldershipp is ordayned by
Christ to be perpetuall,<note place="margin">The 2. proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ordinarie for the

by them, <hi>VVhitgift</hi> 1. and by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize
in keeping it out: but the trueth of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by these reasons that do follow.</p>
            <p>1 If the causes why Christe woulde haue an
Eldershipp in his Churche be perpetuall, then
must also the thing it selfe be perpetuall:<note place="margin">See the answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to D. Bridges page 132.</note> But
the causes are perpetuall, which be to gouerne
the Church by the rules of his worde, and that
ecclesiastically: Therefore the Eldership is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.</p>
            <p>2 If Christ be the author of the Eldership, &amp;
left it by the Apostles to bee established in the
Church, then it is perpetuall; for his commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
giuen to the Apostles, is to be obserued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the world: But Christ is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, as appereth both by his giuing of the
gifts for the perticular members thereof, &amp; the
whole bodye of it; as also in that the Apostles
did establish it in the Church, who went not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their commission, 1. cor. 11. 12. Therfore the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership
is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>3 Whatsoeuer is the commaundement of
God, once deliuered by him, is neuer repealed
againe, and to be acknowledged of euery spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
man; that same is to bee receiued by the
Churche of God to be perpetuall: But such is
the gouernment of the Church by pastors, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and Elders, and so of the whole Eldership,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3174:51"/>
as appeareth in that they are all mentioned
in the writinges of S. Paule, which are so estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
1. cor. 14. 37. Therefore the gouernment
of the Church by an Eldership is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>4 That whose seuerall parts is perpetuall, &amp;
which hath perpetuall gifts giuen, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
thereof for euer; that same must needs
be perpetuall: But the seuerall parts of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,
as pastour, doctour and Elders, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,
as is proued in the 10. &amp; 12. chap. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Eldership is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>5 Whatsoeuer is grounded vpon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
commaundements, and rules of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that same is perpetuall: But the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Church by the Eldership, is such, as
hath partly bene prooued in election and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and execution of the seuerall Churche
offices, which is the greatest part of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and shall further appeare, in the censures
of the Church hereafter: Therfore the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church by the Eldership, is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p>6 Whatsoeuer manner of gouernment hath
sufficient power, and that from God, to begin,
continue, and strengthen, both the gouernors
of the Church in their callings, and the people
in the course of obedience vnto Christe; that
same gouernment is to be perpetual: But such
is the gouernment by the Eldershipp, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by this, that the Apostles vsed no other:
Therefore the Eldership is to be perpetuall.</p>
            <p>7 That gouernment which the 12. Apostles,
and Paule, before they consulted together, did
vniformly agree in, that same must needs be of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3174:51"/>
God, and consequently perpetuall, vnlesse
the repealing of it doe appeare: but suche is
the gouernement by the Eldership, (for all the
aduersaries therevnto, confesse that it was in
the Apostles time:) Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>8 Whatsoeuer hath the same grounds, that
the preaching of the word and ministration of
the sacramentes haue, the same is perpetuall:
But such is the gouernment of the Eldershipp,
for it is grounded vpon the commaundements
of Christ, and practize of the Apostles: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>9 That which hath the like groundes to bee
perpetuall, that the Apostles, prophets, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists,
had to be for a time, the same is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall:
But suche is the gouernement of the
Church by an Eldershipp, which appeareth by
this, that they are therefore ceased, because
their gifts of imediate calling, &amp;c. be gone, and
the gifts of these, ioyntly and seuerally doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine:
Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>10 Whatsoeuer is the perpetuall and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
remedie to cure diseases of the Church, &amp;
strengthen the health of the same, that same is
perpetuall: But suche is the gouernement
by the eldershipp, as appeareth by the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
and profite of the seuerall offices thereof,
and of this, that we are still to obserue in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of extremities: <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> Matth. 18. 17.
Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>11 That gouernement whiche was in the
Church appoynted of God vnder the Law, and
continued (in respect of the substance) by christ
and his Apostles, and bettered (in respect of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3174:52"/>
accedents) by them, that same is perpetuall: But
such is the gouernment by the Eldership, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in the 12. reason of the 1. chap: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>12 If there be any reason why this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be alterable (being once set in the
Church by Christ) it is eyther in respect of the
extraordinary offices ceased, or the addition of
the magistrate: But not of the former, because
the Churche hath neuer had any neede of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
giftes, but God hath giuen them, &amp;
so will hee euer: nor of the latter, for that the
magistrates office is to defende the buylding of
the Church by that order which Christe hath
set downe, and not to alter any thing therein:
Therefore it is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>13 Eyther this gouernement is the best and
perpetuall, or els there is none, and so Christe
should be thought to haue left his Church with
out a gouernement, which is disprooued in the
7. &amp; 8. reasons in the 1. chap. for this was once
established by Christ, and so was no other: But
some gouernment must needes be the best and
and perpetuall: Therefore this is perpetuall.</p>
            <p>14 No man may iustly forbidd (speaking of
the church gouernment) to returne to the old
constitution of the churche of God,<note place="margin">Confess. Heluet. Tigur. Bern. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua, Polonia, Hungaria, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, cap. 18.</note> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

            <p>The Church must be gouerned onely by the

of the first chap. wherevnto all those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
there alleadged may be referred; there is
aduouched generally, the certayne grounds of
the whole discipline, against the imagined li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
left to the Church: here is affirmed the
perticular direction of the Churche gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the authoritie of the Eldershipp, to
proceed according to the rules of Gods reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
will, and not by that cursed and monstrous
cannon law, which is made manifest vnto vs by
these reasons.</p>
            <p>1 All gouernours are to execute their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
by the same warrant from which they
haue it: But the gouernours of the Church of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3174:54"/>
God, haue their warrant to be gouernours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the word, 1. Cor. 12. 28. Therefore they
must gouerne the Church onely by the word.</p>
            <p>2 The Churche is to be gouerned by that
which the ministers may teach vnto the same,
for they are taught to the ende that they may
obey, and so be gouerned by the same: But the
ministers may teach nothing but the worde of
God, 1. Cor. 11. 23. Therefore the Church is to
be gouerned onely by the word of God.</p>
            <p>3 That which maketh the Churche obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
vnto Christ, must be the direction whereby
it is to be gouerned: Onely the worde of God
maketh the church obedient vnto christ: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to be gouerned by the rules of Gods
worde.</p>
            <p>4 Euery kingdome or houshold, must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
onely by the lawes of the king, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the housholder: The Churche is the
kingdome and house of God, and his worde is
the onely law that he hath giuen for the same:
Therefore it must bee gouerned onely by the
worde of God.</p>
            <p>5 That which was ordayned to destroy the
Churche of God, cannot be a good rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
the same by: But such is the cannon law,
for it was ordained to strengthen the kingdom
of Antichrist: <hi>Abstract.</hi> Therefore it cannot be
a good rule to direct the church by, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it must be gouerned by the worde, for
no other rule is offered vnto vs, but the one of
these twaine.</p>
            <p>6 That which was inuented by the dragon,

is that woman: But such is the cannon law, for
it was inuented by Antichriste, which is that
dragon: Therefore it cannot bee good for the
ruling of the church, and consequently, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>7 That which strengtheneth the power of
darknes &amp; ignorance, cannot be good to guide
them, that must walke in light and knowledge:
But the cannon lawe strengtheneth the power
of darknes and ignorance, for it increaseth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
as appeareth by this, that there is scarce
an officer towardes it, in these dayes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but he is a papist: Therfore it cannot be
good to guide the church of God.</p>
            <p>8 That which destroieth the church of God
cannot be good to rule the same: But the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
law destroieth it, for it crosseth euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
minister in the discharge of his dutie, and
euery good christian, walking in the wayes of
godlines, and nippeth in the head euery good
action, as experience teacheth vs: Therefore it
cannot be a good rule to gouerne the churche
by.</p>
            <p>9 That which hath bred moe trayterous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in England, then the Seminaries at Rome
and Rhemes, that same cannot be good to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne

lawe, for it hath kept cut discipline, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
ignorance, and fostered superstition &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
in all estates of people, that neuer came
at those Seminaries: Therefore it cannot be a

But such is the cannon lawe, for it keepeth the
cages for those vncleane byrds; as Archb. and
L. BB. seas, arches, cathedral churches, &amp;c: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it cannot be a good rule for the direction
of the Church.</p>
            <p>11 That which all the Churches haue cast
off, as vnfit for the gouernment of the Church,
cannot be good for the same: But all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that haue forsaken the pope (yea they that
haue not receiued the discipline of Christ who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
haue cast of the cannon lawe: Therefore it
cannot be good for the same.</p>

by a statute made vnder Ed. 6.</p>

            <p>THe office of the Church gouernment,
is meere Ecclesiasticall, and therefore
the gouernors of the church may not
meddle, but onely in church-matters,
as for example, vocation, and abeyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
deciding of controuersies, in doctrine and
manners, so far as appertayneth to consience,
and the church censures, T. C. booke 1. pag 206
Discipl. Eccle. 126. but they thinke that church-gouernours,
may also meddle in ciuill causes:
<hi>VVhitgifte</hi> page 749: &amp; their practize, that take
vpon them to be Councellors of state, to iudge
ciuilly, as punishe with imprisonment, &amp;c. But
this is disprooued, and so the former prooued
by these reasons.</p>
            <p>1 That which our sauiour Christ refused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it belonged not vnto him, ruling &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the church, that same is not lawfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ecclesiast. person to do: But christ refused to
deuide the inheritance, Luke. 12. 14. onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he came to buylde a spirituall kingdome,
for otherwise he being God, had authoritye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all thinges: Therefore it is not lawfull for
Ecclesiasticall persons to bee iudges of ciuill
causes.</p>
            <p>2 That which was forbidden the Apostles,
is vnlawfull for euery Ecclesiasticall officer, for
they were the chiefe vnder christ, and had (after
a sort) all offices in themselues, vntil they could
plant them in others: But such dominion was
forbidden them, as the kinges of the nations, &amp;
other ciuill magistrates haue, Luk. 22. 28. which
is, to rule ciuilly: Therefore they may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3174:56"/>
any ciuill authority.</p>
            <p>3 If necessary dueties are to be lefte, rather
then our duties to the Churche shoulde not be
thorowly discharged, then may not a churche
officer deale in ciuill iurisdiction, which is lesse
necessary vnto him: But the former is true, as
appeareth by the words of Christ, to him that
woulde haue buried his father, Luke. 6. 59. 60.
Therefore they may not exercise any ciuil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>4 If he that hath an office must attend vpon
it, then may he not meddle in another, for hee
cannot attend them both at once: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true, Rom. 12. 7. Therfore may no church
officer, meddle with temporall iurisdiction.</p>
            <p>5 As the Souldiour is in his warfare, so are
church officers, in the ruling of Gods church:
But the Soldior entangleth not himselfe in the
things of this life, because they are of another
nature to his warfare; which place Cyprian
alleadgeth againste a minister, that became
an executour to his friendes will: Therefore
church-officers may not meddle with ciuill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
because they are of another nature, then
his calling.</p>
            <p>6 Those thinges that in themselues are of
contrary quallitie, cannot concurre in one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect:
But the gouernments of the church and
common wealth be such, not onely in this, that
they are the next speciall members of one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
but also, in that the one is spirituall, and
the other temporall, the one respecteth the
soule, and the other the bodie. Therefore they
cannot bee in one man together, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3174:57"/>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>7 If the gouernment of the churche, both
in euery particular mans office, and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Eldership, be a matter of great waight, &amp;
the ability of man, very small in euery good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then may not a church-officer meddle in
another calling, whereby he is made lesse able
to discharge his dutie: But the former is true,
as all men may see, that looke into the worde of
God, what is required of such men, and knowe
by the same worde, the manifolde infirmities &amp;
vntowardnes of man: Therfore the latter must
needs be true also.</p>
            <p>8 If the Apostles (who were the most able of
all others) found themselues vnfitt for two offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which were both Ecclesiasticall; then is the
best church-gouernour vnfit for two, which be
of more difference one from another, as be the
gouernment of the church and commonwelth:
But the former is true, as appeareth, Actes 6. 2.
Therefore the latter must needs be true also.</p>
            <p>9 That which we iustly reprooue in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
must needs (if we do like) be founde more
vnlawfull and intollerable in our selues: But we
iustly reprooue the papists, for hauing in their
hands both the swordes, that is, the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and ciuill iurisdiction: Therefore it is more
intollerable, being found in any of vs.</p>
            <p>10 If it be lawfull for an ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to exercise the office of the ciuill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
then (on the contrary) it is lawfull for the
ciuill magistrate, to exercise the offices of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
persons, for there is as good reason
for the one, as the other: But the latter is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3174:57"/>
for who would like of any L. Mayor, to
step into the pulpit and preach, &amp;c. Therefore
the first is vnlawfull also.</p>

            <p>THe placing and displacing of Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
appertaineth vnto the Eldership. This
is prooued in the 7. chap. and their obiections
are there aunswered for the first part, which is
the placing: but the latter part is to be cleared
by some mo reasons, because the BB. do displace
the best ministers at their plesure, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be a most wicked action, by these resons.</p>
            <p>1 Those that are called vnto the ministery
by the Lord from heauen, and outwardly by the
meanes of men, so long as they are blameles in
doctrine and conuersation, 1. Tim. 3. 10. cannot
be displaced, without hainous wikednes against
the manifest will of God: But suche are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
that the BB. do daily displace, as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
themselues, when (euen) in their sermons
they iustifie their doctrine, in saying that they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3174:59"/>
differ onely in outward rites; and as their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemies will saye, when they are asked of
such mens liues: Therefore they cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
without great wickednes.</p>
            <p>2 Those that are carefull to discharge the
dutie of Gods ministers, both in teaching, and
giuing example to their flockes, cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
without great impietie: Such are these
ministers, that are daily displaced, as appeareth
by this, that they preache more diligently then
any other, and that they followe not the course
of the worlde, in adding liuing vnto liuing, but
many of them (being as worthy for their giftes,
as the worthiest) liue poorely, rather then they
will want the comfort of a good conscience:
Therefore they cannot be put to silence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great sinne.</p>
            <p>3 To depriue Gods people of their spirituall
comfort, is a grieuous and horrible wickednes:
To put such to silence as are before mentioned
is to depriue Gods people of their spirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
which if any man will denie, all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where such a one dwelleth, shall tell him hee
lyeth: Therefore to displace such ministers, is a
haynous and horrible wickednes.</p>
            <p>4 That which giueth occasion to the weake
to stumble and fall away from the Gospell, is a
haynous and horrible sinne: But such is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
of those ministers, as appeareth by this,
that many doubt whether that which he hath
taught be true, whom the professors of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
do displace, and by this, that many who had
made good beginnings, by the discontinuance
of their teachers, doe fall away: Therefore to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3174:59"/>
displace those ministers, is a haynous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
sinne.</p>
            <p>5 Those whose labours God doth blesse, can
not be displaced without fighting against God,
and consequently great impietie: But such are
these ministers that the BB. doe dayly displace,
as all that loue the Gospell in euery countrye
can witnes: Therfore to displace them is great
impiety.</p>
            <p>6 That action which giueth the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
iust cause to reioyce, and hope to get the
victory, is a haynous and horrible offence: But
such is the displacing of those ministers, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in euery country, where such ministers
are displaced, and such enemies do dwell: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

offence.</p>
            <p>7 That action that causeth the doers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be esteemed enemies to the gospell, must
needes be a haynous sinne: But such is the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of those ministers to silence, for it maketh
the people that haue any loue to religion, think
that they are not of God in so doing, for say they
he that loueth Christ cannot crosse the course
of the Gospel as these men doe: Therefore the
displacing of them is a haynous sinne.</p>
            <p>8 That which letteth in more wickednes at
once, then the diligent preaching of the worde
could driue out in diuers yeeres, must needs be
a haynous sinne: but suche is the displacing of
these ministers: for, prophaning of the Saboth,
and all disorder, commeth into a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same day that such a minister, that hath
long labored against it is displaced, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3174:60"/>
in suche places prooueth: Therefore to
displace such ministers is a haynous sinne.</p>
            <p>9 That which interrupteth the course of the
Gospell, without warraunt eyther from Gods
word, or the lawes of the land, is a haynous and
horrible sinne: Such is the displacing of those
ministers, as is proued in al the writings on our
side; &amp; lastly, in the answere to D. Bridges: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to displace such ministers, is a haynous &amp;
horrible sinne.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the ministers that bee vsually
displaced,<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> be called of God; if they discharge the
dutie of good ministers, both in doctrine and
life; if the displacing of them, bee to depriue
Gods people of their spiritual comfort; if it giue
occasion to some to doubt of the Gospel, and to
fall away; if God giue a blessing vnto their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
if the displacing of them giue the enemy
matter to reioyce, and hope to ouercome; if it
cause the displacers to be esteemed enemies to
the Gospell; if it let in more wickednesse in one
day, then preaching can throwe out in many
yeeres; if it interrupt the course of the gospell,
without warrant eyther from the word of God,
or lawes of the land; then must it needs follow,
that the displacing of those ministers is a most
haynous, and horrible sinne against the Lord.</p>

            <p>THe Eldership is to admonishe euery one,
by whome offence appeareth vnto them
to grow in the Church: There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
between vs, about admonition it selfe; but
this they deny, that the execution of any disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3174:60"/>
(and therefore of this poynt) belongeth
vnto the Eldership; which point is prooued in
the seuerall chapters going before: so that I
need not saye any thing of this, sauing with (a
reason or twayne) to shewe the necessitie and
benefit of it in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>1 That whiche priuate men offended, are
commaunded to seeke vnto for the redresse of
the offender, is a necessarie, &amp; an ordinary way
for the amendment of them that doe offend in
the Church of God: But such is the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those that are in authoritie, and cary the
name of the Church, Matth. 18. 15. see chap. 14.
and the 1. proposition of the same: Therefore
admonition in such cases by the Eldership, is a
necessary and ordinary way, for their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that do offend.</p>
            <p>2 That which is more auaylable to bring the
offender to repentance, then priuate admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
eyther by one, or moe, that same is verye
profitable &amp; necessarie in the Church of God:
But such is the publike admonition by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of the Church, as appeareth by this,
that Christe maketh it a remedy, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two will not preuaile, Mat. 18. 15. Therfore
it is very profitable and necessary in the church
of God.</p>
            <p>3 That which maketh men more afraide to
offend, then any admonition that priuate men
can giue, is profitable &amp; necessary in the church
of God: But such is the Eldership, before whom
men know they shalbe brought if they doe not
amend: Therefore it is very profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:3174:61"/>
4 That which hath a greater promise to do
good, then priuate admonition, is very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Church of God: But such is the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
that is giuen by the Eldership, because it
preuayleth when the former doth not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is profitable in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>5 That without which, all duties of charity
cannot be exercised towards sinners, is needful
to be in the Church of God: But without admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
by the Eldershipp, all duties of charitie
cannot be exercised towards sinners: Therfore
it is needfull to be in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>6 That which woulde bridle the outragious
sinnes of some, and keepe in the derision and
mockery, that priuate admonitions do receiue,
is needful to be in the Church of God: But this
would admonition by the Eldershipp doe; for if
men knewe that they should answere vnto the
Churche for their ill demeanour, to them that
rebuke them for sinning; they woulde refraine
(at least for feare) from such kinde of outrage:
Therefore it is needful to be in the Churche of
God.</p>
            <p>Therefore seeing publike admonition before
the Eldership is to be sought,<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> by those that are
offended, and cannot be satisfied; seeing it is
more auayleable then priuate admonition; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it maketh men more afraid to offend; seing
it hath a greater promise; seeing without it all
duties of charity, cannot be exercized towards
the sinner; lastly seeing it would bridle the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
sinnes of many; Therfore it must needs
followe, that it is very profitable, and necessary
to be in the Church of God.</p>

            <p>THose that be not reclaimed from their
faultes by admonition, are by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership
to be suspended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lords

from the execution of their office, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they do eyther giue good testimony of their

betwixt them and vs, about this poynt; sauing
that (as in the former) they will denie it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to the Eldership, which is prooued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
I will therefore (for their vnderstanding
that desire direction in the trueth) firste, shewe
that it is a course that hath warrant in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures;
secondly, that it is of very profitable vse
in the Church of God: the first is thus proued.</p>
            <p>1 Whatsoeuer is enioyned,<note place="margin">Suspention war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word, being vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such grounds as the worde setteth downe.</note> as a duetie to be
done by euery christian, if he leaue it vndone,
he is to be compelled by the gouernours of the
Church to doe it, Luke. 14. 17. 23. But if a mans
brother haue any thing against him, &amp; he make
no conscience to leaue his gifte there, &amp; be first
reconciled, Matth. 5. 24. he is to be compelled to
do it: Therefore separation from the Lordes
supper, is warranted by the word.</p>
            <p>2 If that commandement of Christe, Matth.
7. 6. giue not that which is holy vnto doggs, can
neyther be properly vnderstood of them, that
were neuer of the Churche, nor them that be
excommunicated; then is it a warraunt for such
separation of the vnworthy, and consequently,
that separation is warranted in the word: But
the former is true, as appeareth by this, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3174:62"/>
the meanest of the Iewes did knowe, that holy
things belonged to neyther of them, and so the
commandement had beene needlesse: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suspention is warranted by the word.</p>
            <p>3 If there be sinners that are not to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
and yet it were offensiue to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Lords supper, then is this course warranted
by the word, for els should Christ haue left his
Church destitute of direction, in common and
vsuall difficulties, which is prooued in the first
chap. to be otherwise: But such sinners there are
as the notorious sinner repenting; men mainly
suspected of notorious transgressions, &amp;c. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suspention hath his warrant in the worde.</p>
            <p>4 The course that God prescribed in the
shadow, for corporal purifyings, must in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(in respect of the substaunce) be obserued in
the spirituall clensing of euery member of the
Church: But many were separated from the
publike sacrifices for a season, by reason of their
corporall vncleanes, who, yet were not worthy
to be excommunicated: Therefore must also
some be kept from the Lordes supper for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who yet appeare not so haynously to haue
sinned, as to deserue excommunication.</p>
            <p>5 The church cannot without great offence,
suffer one that hath fallen into some open sin,
or that is vehemently suspected, to haue hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously
offended, continue in the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any publike function: But the Churche
cannot iustly displace suche a man at the first,
making shew of repentaunce, or standing vpon
his purgation: Therefore he must be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:3174:62"/>
6 That which was commaunded vnder the
law to be done to the priest, that was vncleane
in body, or suspected to be a leaper; that same
must much more vnder the Gospell, be done
vnto the minister, or other Church officer, that
hath sinned, or is suspected to haue committed
a great sinne: But such a priest was to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from offring of sacrifices for a certaine

yet deserue not excommunication; if for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
vncleannes vnder the law, they were to
abstaine a certaine time; and if the Church can
not without great offence, suffer him that hath
committed an open sinne (though he repent)
or that is vehemently suspected of a notorious
sinne, continue in the execution of his office,
vntil the congregation be satisfied; Lastly, if the
priest that was vncleane, or suspected of lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,

that both the separation of some men from the

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3174:63"/>
that they breake not out, is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Church of God: But such is the vse
of the separation from the Lordes supper, and
from executing publike function in the church:
Therefore it is profitable in the church of God.</p>
            <p>2 That which remooueth (euen) the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

very profitable for the same: But such is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
Therefore it is profitable for the
Church of God.</p>
            <p>3 That which declareth vnto the world, that
the Church of God is carefull to practize that

            <p>4 That which giueth occasion to the church,

            <p>1 That which Christ hath ordayned for the<note place="margin">The proofe of the 1. proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>

last remedie against sinne, and onely to be vsed
when neyther admonition, reprehension, nor
separation from the externall communion of
the saynts for a time will serue; that same is not
to be vsed, but vpon great extremitie: But such
is excommunication, as appeareth, Math. 18. 15.
Therefore it may not be vsed, but vppon most
wayghtie occasion, that is in the case (onely) of
extremitie, when no other meanes will serue
the turne.</p>
            <p>2 That whiche cutteth a man of from the
Church of God, and giueth him ouer vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,

is excommunication, being vsed according as
God hath left it vnto his Churche, 1. Cor. 5. 5.
Therefore it may not bee vsed, but in greatest
extremitie.</p>
            <p>3 That which a man will doe in the cutting
off, of his hand or his foote, that same must the
Church doe, in excommunication; for it is the
cutting off, of a member: But a man will trie all
other wayes, and will neuer cut of his hande or

            <p>The latter poynt (which is, that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

            <p>2 That which Paule enioyned the Churche,

            <p>14 It is very dangerous to permit so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>15 Hee sheweth that it pertayneth not to

take the authoritie to himselfe,<note place="margin">Caluin Institut. lib. 4. cap. 11. sect. 6.</note> that is common
to others; that it openeth a way to tyrannie; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

16 The byshops,<note place="margin">Chap. 12. sect. 6.</note> when they excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of themselues alone, did it ambitiously, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the decrees of godly cannons: See Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
against Groppet, and vpon Ephes. 4. <hi>De ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
Cura,</hi> also Zuinglius in Ecclesiast.</p>
            <p>17 It is plentifully forbidden (euen) by that
filthie puddle,<note place="margin">See Abstract page 165.</note> the cannon law, and therefore it
must needs be a haynous sinne, when it findeth
fault with it.</p>
            <p>Therefore if excommunication be to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
(by the commaundement of Christe) of
the Churche;<note place="margin">The Conclusion</note> if S. Paule enioyned it vnto the
Church; if it haue need of greatest aduice and
authoritie; if it belong to them that may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the other partes of Discipline; if it was so
executed among the Iewes; if to absolue, be as
well in the Elders power, as the Byshops; if Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
durst not do it alone; if it was the action
(in Tertulians time) of the most approoued El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
if to be by the whole Churche, helpeth
much to make the partie more ashamed; if the
whole Churche haue interest in it; if the whole
Church at Corinth was reprooued, for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; if it be too weighty a matter for one man;
if the executing of it by one, ouerturneth the
order appoynted by Christ; bringeth in tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
maintayneth ambition; and lastly, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the cannon law it selfe. Then must it
needes followe, that it belongeth not vnto one
man to excommunicate, but vnto the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp,
and that with the consent of the whole
Church.</p>
            <p>Their obiections herevnto in defence of
their owne practize be these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:3174:66"/>
1 <hi>Obiection</hi> The right of excommunication,
was in S. Paule and not in the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> He gaue onely direction in that, as
in all other matters, whiche hee wrote of vnto
them, but if they had not throwne out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous
person, he had remayned still vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
for all that which S. Paule had
sayd vnto them.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Obiection</hi> Christ gaue Peter and euery A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
power to binde, and lose in earth and in
heauen, which interpreters expound by Matth.
18. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> That power was of denouncinge
Gods iudgements, or pronouncing his mercie
in preaching, and not of this action: they are
expounded one by another, because of the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of them both in heauen alike.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Obiection</hi> Paule did excommunicate Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus
and Philetus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvvere</hi> That is, beeing moderator of the
action, he pronounced it, not that he did it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
The same answere, is to be made vnto the
fathers, as Ambrose, &amp;c. who are said to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
            <p>Therefore vpon these grounds of Scriptures,<note place="margin">The Conclusion of the whole booke.</note>
Fathers, Councels, Emperours, Lawes, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
newe writers, and cleare light of reason. I
conclude, that<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> Christ hath prescribed vnto vs
an exacte, and perfect platforme of gouerning
his church at all times, and in all places; which
is this,<note n="b" place="margin">Chap. 10. &amp; 11</note> that there ought to be no ministers of
the the word, but pastors and teachers, whiche
are to be<note n="c" place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> called by the people, and<note n="d" place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> ordained
by the Eldership, are of<note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> equall authoritie in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3174:67"/>
their seuerall congregations, muste<note n="f" place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> with all
faythfull diligence imploye themselues, in the
ministery of the worde and sacramentes,<note n="g" place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> that
there are to be in euery congregation certaine
elders, whose office is to ouersee the behauiour
of the people, and assist their pastour, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of the church;<note n="h" place="margin">Chap. 13.</note> also Deacons, who
are to be imployed onely in receiuing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
the liberallity and goods of the church
to the reliefe of the poore, and other necessary
vses:<note n="i" place="margin">Chap. 14</note> Lastly, that there must be in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
an eldershipp of pastour, teacher (if
they can haue any) and elders, who are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
to see that the church be well gouerned,
not onely in maintayning the profession and
practize of the worde in generall,<note n="k" place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> but also in
admonishing, reprehending, or<note n="l" place="margin">Chap. 18.</note> seperating fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Lords supper, them that walke offensiuely,
and<note n="m" place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> lastly in excommunicating them, that by
no other meanes can be reclaimed. So that all
and euery gouernement, contrary or besides
this, whether in part or in whol, swarueth
from that order, which Christ hath
set downe in his word, and
therefore is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
