            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Nothing doubt (right honourable) but that it will ſeeme great raſhnes vnto ſome, and no ſmal folly, to offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo ſimple and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a booke as this is, vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: for what doth it ſeeme to bring with it worthie the perſon of a Noble man? There is no pompe in the manner of ſpeech, for it is rude and country like: the matter it ſelfe is not handled as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation betweene deepe diuines, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of plough men and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars:
<pb facs="tcp:150477:3"/>
a great abſurditie therefore appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, that an honourable perſon of great dignitie ſhould be called for, as it were to ſtand by and hear ſuch ſpeak. Good cauſe there is therfore that I ſhold render ſom reaſon of this my boldenes, which I will willingly doe, to vſe that which the heathen Poet ſaith:</p>
            <q>Si canimus ſyluas, ſyluae ſunt conſule dignae.</q>
            <p>Will not ſuffice: for although reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the things which I handle, becauſe they belong to the trees that are planted in the Lords Orchard, they doe as farre excel the woods and groues, as the vine doth the bramble buſh, yet neuertheleſſe he hath ſo richly decked his baſe &amp; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly matter, hee hath ſo clothed it in ſilkes from top to toe, and hath hanged ſo many iewels vpon it: that it ſhal finde entertainement, and be thought meete for the courts of princes, where as mine being very porely clad, wil be reiected. I wil expreſſe therefore a better reaſon of my doing, which is this. As thoſe which haue corne fieldes, think it not a

thing vnmecte to be told by their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of thiſtles &amp; weedes, which would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; mar the corn, if they prouide not to haue them plucked vp: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo I know that it is not an vnworthy thing to ſhew vnto thoſe which are of highe calling, the hurtful &amp; dangerous weedes which would ouergrow and choke the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed of the goſpel, ſowen in the Lords field. When as our church therefore &amp; common wealth, being the Lords huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, is ouergrowne with weedes &amp; almoſt laide waſte, I ſee no cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may iuſtly be blamed, for giuing notice thereof in ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e part vnto your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.

Among which the want of a ſincere miniſterie of the woorde is the greateſt through abſence of which, there is a flood of ignorance and darknes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing the moſt part of the land: the feare of God is baniſhed from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

parte: the woonderfull heapes and piles of ſinne, which ſhould bee waſhed and cleanſed away by the word, do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly with one voice cry alowd in the eares of the Lord, for vengeance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole realme. The papiſtes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conuerted, but hardened &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the way, there is ſo foule diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and ſo many ſtumbling blockes caſt in the way. The Diuell hath elbowe roome to ſpread abroad, to plant &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all kinde of errours, ſo fewe there be to withſtand him. But to come to that particular which I ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle in this treatiſe: there are the moſt in number, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Poperie taken from them and not taught throughly and ſufficiently in the Goſpel, doe ſtand as men indifferent, ſo that they may quietly inioye the world, they care not what religion come: they are like naked men fitte and readie for any coate almoſt that may bee put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The life of theſe is exceeding prophane they haue hardened the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their ſinnes, by reaſon which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:150477:4"/>
partly out of their owne braine, &amp; partly out of ſome ſayings in the word, by which they cloke &amp; defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their own corrupt wayes. I haue therefore gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the moſt commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> principles of their faith and religion, by which they arme themſelues, againſt true repentance, and right vnderſtanding: I haue not noted all, neither haue I medled with thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall groſſe abſurdities, whiche eache hath proper to himſelf, for that ſhould be infinite. I truſt your Lordeſhip will rightly conſtrue my good meaning, and take in good worth this ſimple treatiſe: pitying the caſe of the poore church of Chriſt, which is ſo ful of greeuous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and ſores, that vnleſſe ſhe be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and cured, ſhe wil ſcarce be able to continue life.

The holy Ghoſt doth ſharpely reprooue the Hebrewes as wee may ſee, in the latter end of the 5. chap. of that Epiſtle: becauſe they were yet children to be taught, when for the time they ſhoulde haue been teachers.

               <p>It is a meruellous thing for to ſee, how the Diuell doth dazle mens eies, and howe he doth bewitch them. Theſe thinges which you vtter, and ſuche like, are euen like a vaile before your eyes, ſo that yee are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for to haue any ſight into Gods woorde. Howe groſſe and doltiſhe ſoeuer the matter bee, if yee can ſay thus, our forefathers did it, will ye condemne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then all is ſafe enough. But ſee howe yee are ouer ſeene, all our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did not fall from God by idolatrie, for euen in the pride of the reigne of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, there were ſome ſtood vp againſt him, in diuers countreis. There were alwaies ſome who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God lightened to ſee the abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the man of ſin, &amp; ſo to repent &amp; take hold of Chriſt: &amp; God who is alwaies like himſelfe receiued them to mercie. And doubtles God is more now diſpleaſed with ſuch as do now wilfully kicke and ſpurne againſt the trueth, and ſeeke for to quench the glorious light of the Goſpel, then he was with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God was taken away, and being blinde, they were made for to beleeue euery lye, and therefore nowe when God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his grace, and ſeeketh by his worde to expell that groſſe darkenes, it were good for ſuch as you, not to ſtande in your owne

light, and obſtinatelie to refuſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD. Our forefathers had that great plague came vpon them, which S. Paul did foretell. 2. Theſe. 2. Namely, that there ſhoulde bee a falling away, that Antichriſt ſhoulde deceaue the worlde, and bring them to damnation: for GOD (he ſaith) ſhould ſende them ſtrong deluſion, euen for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue lies, becauſe they receaued not the loue of the trueth, that they might be ſaued: and now when God offereth his worde agayne, men do not ioyfully and thankfully embrace it, and therefore God doth ſende them ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards euen after their heartes deſire: not to feede them (for they cannot) but to fleeſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that they can skill off: not to bee ſalt for to ſeaſon them, but to bee euen like doung caſt vppon them for to corrupt them: not to giue them light, ſeeing themſelues are blind. The greateſt number of you are as farre from God, as they were euen in the blindeſt time of Poperie, and that is confeſſed by your owne mouth, when ye ſay yee woulde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our forefathers: For ye meane not thoſe Forefathers which did know and woorſhipp God aright, but thoſe which were ſeduced, and fell from him by Idolatrie.

Firſt, marke this, the worde came not from man, neither can a man teache it ye, vnleſſe God reueale it by his ſpirite: if it were the wiſedome of the worlde, or of the fleſh, then the ſpirit of the world which is in man and knoweth the ſecretes of man, could teache it: but becauſe it is the myſterie of GOD, none can make yee learne it, but the holy Ghoſte, which ſearcheth euen the deepe
<pb facs="tcp:150477:63"/>
things of God, as S. Paul teacheth. 1. Cor. 2. 10 S. Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. the ſeconde, hauing told them that there were euen then many Antichriſts, he comforteth them with this. You ſaith he, haue receiued an annointing from the holy one, &amp; know all things. Like as therefore none of thoſe can learne, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God doth not inlighten with his ſpirite: ſo on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part all thoſe which are taught with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the ſpirit, doe feele when the doctrine which the ſame ſpirit hath taught, is vttered: he knoweth his owne, and he ſealeth it vp in their hearts and conſciences, which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by him, muſt needes conſent thereto fully. For this cauſe there is great difference betweene ſuch as ſet all vpon the authorities of men, and ſuch as preach, as S. Paul ſaith he did with the plaine euidence of the ſpirit, and of power, 1.

And when they are alleadged, for men to builde their faith vpon, or to make men thinke that there can be no certaintie in the interpretation of the worde, but where as they are made for to ſpeake: When as in deed the Preacher in his Sermon muſt come with ſuch euidence and make his proofe ſo plaine and ſo ſtrong, that it muſt needes conuince the conſcience of the hearers, in ſuch wiſe that of neceſſitie he ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be forced for to ſay, vndoubtedly that which this man vttereth, is that which God himſelf ſpeaketh: for ſo ſaith the Apoſt. 1. Cor. 14. 24 If, ſaith he, all doe propheſie, and there come in an infidel, or one vnlearned, he is reproued of all, he is iudged of all: and ſo the ſecrets of his hearte are made manifeſt, and falling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his face, he will worſhip God, confesſing that God is verily among you. This teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doth ſhew that the force of Gods worde vttered nakedly is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch, that it conuicteth the hart of the infidel, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelleth him for to confeſſe that God is with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſpeak it.</p>

               <p>I tolde yee before that it is not ſimply vnlawfull for to cite or alleadge a ſentence out of a Doctour. But the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ende of the dooyng of it is all: I ſay likewiſe that a man may in ſome ſorte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge a ſaying out of any Heathen or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Writer: for wee haue the example of Saint Paule Actes. 17. 1. Corinth. 15. Titus 1. Alleadging the ſayinges of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Poets. But wee muſt ſee to what end: doth hee reaſon thus, the Poet ſaith it, therefore are yee to giue credite vnto it: no man woulde bee ſo fooliſhe as to make their wordes being Heathen men, to bee of ſuch authoritie: but he ſheweth that euen their owne Doctors conſented with him in thoſe things. And therefore a ſhame, and foule reproche for them too bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ſame. When the Papiſtes doe charge vs to be gone from the faith of the olde Fathers, although we are to confute them this way, namely, by ſhewing their treacherie and lying, when we are able to prooue by the writinges of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that in the chiefe pointes they fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs: yet this is not the way which God hath appointed and ſanctified for the
<pb facs="tcp:150477:65"/>
conuerſion and education of his people: this engine is ouer weake to reare vp the Temple of the Lorde: we muſt take heede we leaue not the mightie worde it ſelfe, and leane vnto a tottering piller: Saint Paule ſheweth the power of the worde. 2. Corinth. 10. where hee ſaith, although we walke in the fleſhe, yet wee warre not after the fleſhe: for the weapons of our warrefare are not carnall, but mightie in God for to throwe downe holdes: which he expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the verſe which followeth, to be the imaginations and euery high thing which is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and euery thought, which (hee ſaith) they leade captiue vnto the obedience of Chriſt. There is no power nor anye authoritie can doe theſe thinges, but that which is in the word of God it ſelfe. Which is to be made ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Preacher, that it may bring this thing to paſſe.</p>
               <p>The miſerable experience in our time of ſuche as flie from the ſtrong power of the woorde, and fight with the weapons of menne, maye reache vs, becauſe it doeth manifeſtly appeare vnto all whiche haue eyes too ſee, that they are not
<pb facs="tcp:150477:66"/>
ſtrong enough to throwe downe holdes, and to leade captiue vnto the obedience of Chriſt the rebellious thoughtes and imaginations of mens mindes: they cannot ſhew a man by them conuerted ſincerely &amp; throughly from errours and euill maners: by alleadging the authorities of men. It was not the practiſe of the auncient and godly fathers in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for to leaue the teſtimonies of the mightie word, which is able to rent the ſtony rocke in peeces, and to cleaue to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of weake men, which were gone before them. But what ſhould a man ſay? The worde is thought to bee of no power vnleſſe it bee ſtrengthened otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But let vs leaue this and come backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to ſome of your other matters. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ye did lay this as a great accuſation againſt the preachers that they medled with predeſtination.</p>

And this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, that thoſe whom God hath predeſtinate to bee heires of glory, hee hath ſealed them with the holy Spirite, as yee maye reade in the ſame Chapter. They are freed from the bondage of ſinne by the ſpirite, they walke in the ſpirite, they are led by the ſpirite, they ſhewe forth by the fruites of the ſpirite, that the fleſh with the luſtes and concupiſcences thereof is crucified in them, and that they are regenerate and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Read the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſeconde Epiſtle of Peter, and there yee ſhall ſee how a man ſhall knowe certainely that he is elected, and that hee ſhall neuer fall. For if a man feele that GOD teacheth him by his ſpirite, and reneweth him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, he is ſure (becauſe God ſayth ſo) that he is choſen to eternall life: if at any time hee feele the grace of GOD weake in him, then doeth hee doubt and ſtagger, but yet his fayth getteth the vpper hande. On the other ſide, when a man liueth in ſinne, and obeyeth vnrighteouſneſſe: God telleth him plainely that he is in the way to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

If they doubt of Gods fauour then doe they doubt whether God heareth their prayers, &amp; therefore they ſhall not receyue any thing at the handes of GOD, as ye may learne in the Epiſtle of Saint Iames.

As for the wicked they know of no ſuch faith, that a man may atraine to aſſurance of his election: they labour not about anie ſuch matter, but continue ſtill in their blinde doubtes, ſetting all vpon hazzard: and as for their doing what they can, it is nothing, they cannot but ſinne, and therefore be damned, howeſoeuer they ſeeme for to do good workes, yet before God they are no good workes, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not of faith, but from the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are not grafted into the true vine, Chriſt, and for that cauſe can bring forth no fruite.

               <p>Repentance is a returning home vnto God from all euill vices and corrupte deſires which are in the fleſh and in the heart. To be renued by repentaunce, cannot be but where a man is renued in knowledge, for that is one part of the image of GOD which muſt be reſtored in vs: Reade in the 4. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Ephe. from the 17. verſe forwarde. If a man continue in darkeneſſe, he doth not repent: He which committeth his foule ſinns ſtill, although it bee but in the deſire of his heart, hath not repented. He which doth not feele ſorrowe and griefe, and hath not a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite heart, and a ſorowfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, hath not repented: hee which doth not eſchue euill and doe good, hath not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: All theſe are taught by the worde, for that is it by whiche wee muſt clenſe, our wayes: and therefore yee may boldly ſay, that he which learneth not out of Gods woorde to repent, cannot repent: for although if it were poſſible hee coulde repent for all other ſinnes, yet this one ſinne, to ſet light by the inſtruction of the Goſpell, will make ſtill worſe then they of Sodome, as our Sauiour doth tell vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Math. 11.</p>

               <p>Ye might be a counſellour for your graue wiſedome, who is able to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare you in this matter: when yee daſh forth ſo ſtrong an argument grounded vpon ſo great reaſon, and infallible principles: but I pray ye what woulde ye haue done if ye had liued in the time of Ieremie the prophet, and alſo of other Prophets, when there were the Prieſtes and the rulers in the temple, with many which tooke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be prophets, and to ſpeake in the name of the Lord, ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a few of Gods meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers? What would yee haue doone when Chriſt preached, and the Phariſees and Prieſtes, and all the learned againſt him? Would yee not haue hearde Paule, becauſe he diſagreed with the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? The Scriptures haue foretolde that there ſhall be hereſies, ſectes, and falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the Churche euen to the worldes ende. Your great skill hath taught yee to make ſo good a choyce of the time when yee wil heare, and to take ſo long a day, for I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant yee it will not be two weekes before

the day of doome. Ye ſhoulde ſpeake plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſay. Yee neuer meane for to heare, and that ye woulde wiſhe all other for to bee of the ſame minde: and then ye ſhoulde be little troubled with Gods woord. Crie out againſt the preachers, but let your meaning be againſt preaching it ſelfe. The Diuel is a very skilfull woorkeman, he doth not teach his ſchollers to ſay, fie vpon Gods woorde: but to finde excuſes how to ſhift themſelues from hearing the ſame.</p>

They are nowe ſaide to preach nothing but the Lawe, which in deede can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conuert a man from vngodlyneſſe, but of it ſelfe is the ſtrength of ſinne: they are
<pb facs="tcp:150477:84"/>
ſaide to be murtherers, becauſe they preache but the dead letter whiche doeth kill. No doubt whoſoeuer doth preache no more but the Lawe, and ſo damnation, is no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt. But here lyeth all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, men woulde be flattered and ſoothed in their ſinnes, they are loth for to here of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iudgement of God againſt wickedneſſe: and as they bee like vnto the people of the Iewes when the Prophetes were ſent vnto them, corrupt and corrupting themſelues, and grudging againſte the Meſſengers of God when they threatened vengeance, and willing them not to preache ſo, but to preache pleaſunt thinges: euen ſo are there nowe whiche lay pillowes vnder their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes and preache peace, peace, when all is corrupt in their liues, and therefore there can bee no peace. Hee whiche ſhall reade the Prophetes, ſhall finde the ſtate of the Churche then, and ours nowe, in all theſe thinges verie like: Firſt, all foule vices ouer ſlowing, as among vs: Secondly, the people preſuming vppon their blinde faith, and counterfet repentaunce, and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prayers, as they doe nowe: Thirdely, the Prophetes ſent of God exceeding ſharpely
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150477:84"/>
reproouing them, and denouncing the iudgementes of God againſt them: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the people repining there at, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſelues hardely dealte withall: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to bee more tenderly handeled as to heare pleaſaunt thinges, and to haue them propheſie of wine and ſtrong drinke: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, certaine Preachers ſit for the turne, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp, and ſmoothing vp all with ſweete woordes, and telling them all is well, all is well.

The reaſon is this, Chriſte was not crucified for to ſlay ſinne in him ſelf, (for he had none) but in his members, which are ioyned and knit vnto him by faith, in them the force &amp; power of his death doth ſhew it ſelfe: nowe he which hath not this worke of the death of Chriſt in him, that hee feeleth
<pb facs="tcp:150477:89"/>
himſelfe crucified concerning the body of ſinne, his faith in the pasſion of Chriſt is but a dead faith, and cannot ſaue him. This is the cauſe why S. Paule faith, Rom. 8. That thoſe which are in Chriſt, walke not after the fleſhe, but after the ſpirite. S. Iohn ſaith, 1. Epiſtle, cha. 3.

Paule coupleth both theſe things together in himſelfe, which you iudge to bee ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that by no meanes they may be founde in one man together at one time. He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that there was a lawe in his members, rebelling againſt the law of his mind, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him captiue to the law of ſinne. And yet a litle before in the ſame Chapter hee ſaieth, That he did not commit the euill, but ſinne which dwelt in him. The reaſon which he maketh is, that hee did conſent vnto the law, and would haue doone the good, but he did the euill which he hated. To make the matter plaine, thus it is. Saint Paule was rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, but yet not in full perfection, for the remnaunt of ſinne did abide in him: that which the part regenerate did, or coueted to doe, or conſented vnto, that he ſaith he did: and that which the corruption which did ſtill remaine in him, forced him for to doe, that he ſaith he did not, but ſinne which dwelled in him. Hee doth eſteeme himſelfe in the part regenerate, he counteth the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts of the old man, to be but as excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or as a dead carion, which did abide
<pb facs="tcp:150477:90"/>
in him, and anoy him. His delight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was vppon the good, he hated the euill, and therefore when he did ſinne, becauſe it was againſt his conſent, and againſt his will, it was no obedience which hee gaue vnto it: he did not therefore ſerue ſinne, neyther did ſin raygne ouer him, but exerciſe a certayne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yee may very eaſily perſwade me to beleeue that ye know not what I meane: If your fiue wits were fifteene, they woulde helpe nothing in this caſe. Becauſe ye know not what this meaneth, yee know not what faith in Chriſt crucifyed meaneth, ye know not what repentaunce meaneth, yee can ſee no difference of ſinners: all are ſinners ſay you, and the death of Chriſt is that whiche ſaueth, not conſidering that the death of Chriſt firſt killeth thoſe whom it maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. For this cauſe men are greatlye ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot oftentimes, when they come vnto a ſicke man, they thinke if he ſay, I beleeue Chriſte died for my ſinnes, and ſhed his blood for me, that then all is aſwell as may be. If it were
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150477:90"/>
faith in deed in the blood of Chriſt, they muſt needes be in good caſe: for al that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, ſhalbe ſaued. But they ſtay vpon a bare fantaſie, which is a dead &amp; weak faith, not making them to feele the power of the death of Chriſte. Ignoraunce is ſo deepely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in mens mindes, that let a man be neuer ſo wicked, neuer ſo far from true knowledge of God, if he can make but ſome general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they neuer looke further. And becauſe they ſee almoſt all, (howeſoeuer they liue) find this, it maketh them alſo to be careleſſe, and neuer for to thinke of the newe birth, of which Chriſte ſpeaketh, when he ſayeth vnto Nicodemus: except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God: This newe byrth is ſhut out at the doores, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt God doth ſhutte them out of his kingdome which make no account of it.</p>

               <p>It is not the will of God, that wee ſhould take vpon vs for to pronounce vppon any man, and to ſay he is damned: becauſe we muſt leaue the ſecrete counſell of God vnto himſelfe, who is not bounde vnto vs, to giue any account of his doings. But I pray yee let
<pb facs="tcp:150477:91"/>
vs a litle conſider howe this headleſſe bolte of yours is ſhotte foorth againſt true godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus you reaſon, no man can tell who are ſaued, and who are damned, therefore we are not for to care for tryall of our faith and repentance: and that therfore the rules which are giuen in the word of God in theſe points are nothing worth. Euery man may ſearche and know in him ſelfe, whether he be in good caſe or not: and we ought euery one for to trie our ſelues by that whiche the woord tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſo plentifully. I woulde wiſhe yee to conſider what the cauſe is why the greateſt multitude goe to deſtruction: euen becauſe they knowe not theſe thinges, &amp; therefore ſee not the great danger which they be in, but can boldly beare themſelues in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that they ſhall doe well enough. Manye doe laugh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the middeſt of deſtruction, I meane that they can ſport them ſelues euen in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe thinges which are their bane: and all becauſe they truſt to this beliefe whiche you bragge of. For as on the one ſide true faith &amp; true repentance, and conuerſion vnto God, doe ſalue all the ſores and ſickneſſes of the ſoule: euen ſo the common dead faith &amp; counterfet repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may be called the diuels

It is great pitie that the woorde of God is not laide open in all places, that the people might come to the vnderſtanding of Chriſt and his power, in tranſlating them out of the power of darkeneſſe, into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of light: which is wrought with great and diligent teaching, becauſe men are made of a dull metall, and hard to conceiue ſpiritual and heauenly things.</p>

But this hath euer bin the readie way which the diuell hath vſed for too bring thoſe which feare God into hatred: by his inſtrumentes to charge them for too be enemies vnto Princes.

               <p>What if it ſhould fall out, as it doth fall out ſome times, that godly Princes command ſome thing which is contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods word, ſhould we obey God or men?
