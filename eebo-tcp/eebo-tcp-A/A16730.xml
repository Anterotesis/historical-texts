            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Heauens shake, and the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
tremble at thy presence, and
yet I see the Elements giue theyr
natures: The Sunne his heate, the
water hir coolenesse, the Aire hir
moisture, and the Earth hir dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
The trees theyr fruicts, the
flowers their sweets, the Sea
hir fishes, the Earth hir gemmes,
the Ayre hir comfort, the Fyre hir
light, &amp; the world hir welth in the
<pb facs="tcp:10208:31"/>
seruice of hir Creatures in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to thy holy will, to Glorify
thy holy name; and shall I of all
the world most bound to thee in
the whole world, that haue tasted
so much of thy goodnesse, so much
forget thy Greatnesse, as, in no
work of thy Grace, to humble my
soule to thy Glory? God forbid:
no, my sweet God, I humbly bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee giue mee the patience
of thy saincts, the faith of thy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
the ioy of thine Angells, and
the wisedome of thy holy Spirit,
that I may suffer all things for thy
loue, I may die in thy seruice, and
so sing of thy goodnesse, that in
ringing out thy praises, the heuens
may reioyce to heere thy glory in
the world: oh my sweet CHRIST,
help mee to honour thee: Inspire
my heart with thy Loue, tell mee
what to thincke of thee, teach mee
what I shall say of thee, learne mee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10208:31"/>
how I shall praie vnto thee; that in
my Soule, I may neuer cease to
prayse thee: O glory in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
heauens, highest glory of the
heauens, onely glory beefore the
heauens, bee thou glorified aboue
the heuens: oh that my hrat could
dissolue into teares, to wash the
feete of thy fauour, or that my
soule in sighes, could ascend a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to thy mercy, that in Soule
and body, I might shew some ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of my loue, which am worse
then nothing, till I bee something
in thee: but thou hast made mee,
as it hath pleased thee, and canst
make mee what it pleaseth thee,
let it therefore please thee, I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, to make mee onely to
please thee: I am a creature of thy
will, worke mee onely to thy will:
draw mee to thee, by thy holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
hold mee to thee, by thy holy
Loue, and inspire mee with thy
<pb facs="tcp:10208:32"/>
holy wisedome, that loathing the
worlde with the vanities thereof,
in thy onely mercy, I may see the
paradise of my soule: that hauing
with patience passed my purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in this life, &amp; in the merit of thy
mercy, receiuing the comfort of
my Saluation, where the Angells
of thy loue, doe sing in Glory of
thy grace, my poore humble
Soule may sing Amen
to their Musique.</p>
