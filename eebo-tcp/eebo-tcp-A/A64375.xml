            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>â€”That you may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words spake St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and he spake them with special regard to it. During that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he recommended to Christians a single Estate. He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it, but did not enjoyn it, nor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63301:3"/>
make a matter of discretion, a necessary Duty. He gave not (therefore) this Counsel to all, but to those who <hi>could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi> And upon this account it was that he then advis'd to that state of life<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> He consider'd that the Gospel was to be Preach'd in many Countries, with great Pains, and amidst equal Perils. And he well understood, that the less the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of it were intangled in the Affairs of this Life, the more they would be at liberty to promote their holy Faith: The freer they would be from perplexity of Mind, and upon that account, the better dispos'd to <hi>Attend upon the</hi> [Service of the] <hi>Lord</hi> [Jesus] <hi>without distraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon occasion of these Words I shall (by God's help)</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> Enquire into the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, or <hi>wandring</hi> of the Mind. Next to that,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63301:3"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> May be consider'd the great <hi>Evil</hi> of it, especially where it is indulg'd; and more especially when it is affected in the Worship of God. That Consideration will fitly introduce (in the</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d Place</hi>) <hi>A Persuasive to Attention</hi> and fixedness of Thought in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; that the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> which is, in it self, of so inestimable a Value, may not by us be <hi>receiv'd in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>General nature of the Wandring of the Mind,</hi> consisteth <hi>neither</hi> in its musing upon many things, which increaseth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, <hi>nor</hi> in <hi>ballancing</hi> one thing against another, which helpeth us to make a right judgment of them; <hi>nor</hi> yet in its passing from one matter to another, tho the objects are at a great distance; for they may have a Connexion in reason, tho they have it not in time or place; so it is (for example) with those great Objects, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ, Canaan</hi> and <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63301:4"/>But then the Mind may be said to wander, when the Attention is removed from the matter which was properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, to something foreign, even then when the Meditation on that matter was fitly and usefully to be continued. So <hi>Pilate</hi> asked <hi>what was Truth?</hi> But he pursued not the Enquiry, neither staid he for the Answer of our Saviour, who was the only Oracle that could have given him a Resolution which would have left no doubt behind it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>distraction</hi> of the Thought is sometimes a <hi>Natural Infirmity,</hi> and <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> a wilful and affected Practice.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the temper of the Brain is either over-hot and volatile, or cloudy, and heavy, and slow, in the Original frame of it; sometimes Afflictions and Diseases and throngs of Worldly Affairs shatter that Temper which was at first an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63301:4"/>
apt instrument of Sobriety and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Mind. And generally the Mind is apt, instead of maintaining an orderly connexion of the Images of it, which requireth Pains and Judgment, to rove from one to another, by a kind of casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al coherence. As, <hi>for Example,</hi> when there is mention made in Scripture of Christ and his Doctrine, as the true <hi>Bread</hi> which came down from Heaven; the Imagination of the Reader or Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who has not had his Senses orderly exercis'd and fix'd, is very apt to wander from that <hi>Evangelical Food,</hi> to the thought of the <hi>Manna</hi> of the <hi>Israelites</hi>; and from the <hi>Manna,</hi> to the <hi>Wilderness</hi> in which it fell, and from thence to the <hi>Rock</hi> in the Desart, which God <hi>turned into a springing Well</hi>; and then peradventure he thinks of the Impatience of Thirst, and the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water; and after that, the Fancy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63301:5"/>
is led into as many windings and turnings of musing, as the <hi>Jews</hi> say there were in that <hi>River which followed them.</hi> Thus the Mind is carried to such a distance from the <hi>first thought,</hi> as not to be able to tell, of a sudden, where the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began, and in what manner it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>We see and hear a great deal of this in the <hi>Digressions</hi> which are continually made both in Books and in Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and may, to our great grief, feel the Byas of it in our selves when we appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in his holy House; where there is little need of our interrupting of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by late coming, by Talk, or by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent Gesture, seeing our own Minds give themselves too much diversion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>natural Infirmity</hi> which I have been speaking of, is, in some Persons carried on with such <hi>Indulgence,</hi> that it becomes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63301:5"/>
a <hi>Presumption.</hi> Such way is given to it, such content is taken in it, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Man's own Act.</p>
            <p>I shall not here discourse of all the kinds of this wilful Wandring; but only of the removing of the Attention, in part or in whole, from the Worship of God, and the carrying of it to something that is <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>indifferent</hi>; or if <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>improper</hi> at that time, as would have been the practice of the Impotent man at <hi>Bethesday,</hi> if he had desired to have been carried afar off to a Physician, in that juncture when the Angel had been just moving the Waters, or when Christ himself was by the Porch.</p>
            <p>This is the manner of those who in God's House are <hi>present</hi> in <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> in <hi>spirit</hi>; who with cold Formality, repeat religious Words, not minding the important sense of them; who <hi>hear</hi> as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63301:6"/>
if they <hi>heard</hi> not; who <hi>read</hi> with such Negligence, as not to <hi>understand,</hi> even where the matter is not beyond a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity which has not much depth; who see the <hi>Holy Elements,</hi> and think of <hi>common Tables,</hi> and wander with their <hi>Appetite,</hi> as well as their <hi>Thought:</hi> Who <hi>draw nigh to God with their lips,</hi> whilst <hi>their hearts are far from him</hi>; or possibly their Hearts are elsewhere so perfectly engaged, that they neither cause the <hi>lip to move,</hi> nor the <hi>knee to bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The distemper of <hi>wandring,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>acquir'd,</hi> is no small Evil, especially when we should draw nigh to God in Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Even there where it is <hi>a natural
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63301:6"/>
infirmity,</hi> it is attended with great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
            <p>It hinders us in the search of such <hi>Truths,</hi> as depend upon any number of Consequences. Where there is not Attention, such Truths will not be found: It is from the same <hi>Root,</hi> that both <hi>Credulity</hi> and <hi>Scepticism</hi> spring. It is from want of closeness of Thought, that some believe any thing, and others nothing. Hence also is prevented <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Will,</hi> so necessary in a good matter, and attain'd only by such a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as, being fixed it self, fixeth the <hi>Purpose.</hi> And, for the utmost degree of Inconsistency of Thought, 'tis no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Madness. From lower degrees of it, proceed great defects in a Man's <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> his Neighbour, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whilst the mind starts from that which is before it, and leaves it unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,

                  <hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</hi>
               </q> So serviceable to all Business, Civil or Sacred, is the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of the mind.</p>
            <p>It is true, that very devout Persons are subject to the <hi>Infirmity of Wandring</hi>; it being difficult, amidst such a variety of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> in the head, to keep one certain line of them straight and continued; and our great Adversary, in the midst of our best Thoughts, is busie in darting in such Suggestions, as by their suddenness, their incoherence, their contrariety, both to our present Thoughts and Affections, and Prayers; their Black and Diabolical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shew that they are <hi>of their Father the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho it is in <hi>Divinity</hi> as in the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law,</hi> by which the Trees planted in another Man's Ground, are not, till they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63301:7"/>
take root, judged the Property of the Owner of the Soil; tho evil Suggestions, till by our consent they are rooted in our hearts, are not our proper thoughts, but either the Devil's Temptations, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Infirmities, which the Merciful God, who considers our Frame, will not impute to such in whom <hi>the spirit is willing, and the flesh weak</hi>; yet it is an unhappy and uncomfortable Circumstance which they ought to pray and strive against, and to the utmost of their Skill and Power abate, bearing with Patience the Weakness they cannot conquer, till God Almighty in his good time shall work the blessed Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> When Men allow and indulge themselves in this roving of Imagination, and when they do so even in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God,</p>

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>root</hi> of this practice, <hi>the want of the love of God,</hi> being so evil, the <hi>practice</hi> cannot but partake of the irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature of it.</p>
            <p>Wilful Wandring in God's service is a kind of <hi>Contempt of God,</hi> and a coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Presence to slight him; to affront him to his face; and it gives him just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to complain, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.11. <hi>In my House I have found wickedness.</hi> It is a <hi>preferring</hi> of our own <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> before his: nay, 'tis the preferring of the <hi>Injections</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to whom we <hi>give place,</hi> by receiving of them into the room of <hi>pious meditations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63301:9"/>It is likewise a disobedient <hi>refusal of his call,</hi> when he says with Importunity as well as Authority,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.26.</note> 
               <hi>My son give me thine heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It disappoints the <hi>Ends</hi> designed by God's wisdom in his <hi>Service, his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the <hi>edification of the Worshippers</hi>; for, by such hypocrisie which withdraws the best part of Man's Service (that which is inward, judicious, hearty) and substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes that which is scarce a shew of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, God is rather <hi>mock'd</hi> than <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd:</hi> and those who are present in his House with thoughts <hi>ranging</hi> in the world, can neither improve in <hi>Knowledge</hi> nor <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Devotion,</hi> nor <hi>Morality</hi>; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they attend not to the means and exercises of them: For our <hi>Spiritual</hi> is not like our <hi>Natural</hi> Stature, which grows up, whether we think or <hi>think not</hi> of it. Observable are the words of the Apostle.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63301:9"/>
               <hi>Consider what I say, and the Lord give you understanding in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Add to this,</hi> the great aggravation of <hi>ingratitude</hi> in Sinners of this kind, who stand in such need of the <hi>especial grace</hi> of God, and whom God's extraordinary Goodness hath obliged with the means of it; for after all this they despise <hi>his</hi> and their <hi>own</hi> mercies, and use the Grace of God (as they ought to do the World) with an indifferency, and <hi>as if they used it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This undervaluing of the Riches of God's Love, instead of giving him thanks; this neglect of means, instead of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and using them for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our very imperfect nature; this spending of good hours to such ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is not only <hi>wicked,</hi> but</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly. Exceeding perillous,</hi> as indeed all wickedness is; for how pleasant soever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63301:10"/>
vain Thoughts are, and how charming soever this Paradise in which the Fool wanders, may for a season seem to him; yet the immediate consequence is evil, and the end of these things are shame and death.</p>
            <p>Distraction abateth the <hi>zeal</hi> of the Heart, as the scattering of the Rays does the heat of the Sun; and when Men are either cold or luke-warm in their <hi>duty,</hi> they are robb'd of the <hi>Comfort</hi> of it: they cannot take <hi>delight</hi> in that which they mind not.</p>
            <p>The service of God is a weariness to <hi>those</hi> whose Thoughts and Affections are elsewhere entangled. So it was to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who groan'd even under their Priviledge,<note place="margin">Amos 8.5.</note> and said, <q>When will the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be over that we <hi>may set forth wheat?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63301:10"/>And for <hi>Almighty God,</hi> how can we imagine that <hi>he</hi> will mind those Services of ours, which <hi>we</hi> our selves do not; He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe them, but it is with the Animadversion of a Judge, and in order to punishment: and <hi>it is a fearful thing,</hi> (in such a manner, and in so ill a cause) <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> He will make good his threatning in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.19. <hi>I will bring upon this people</hi> the <hi>fruit of their thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Considerations of the <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> and the <hi>Peril</hi> of wilful and affected wandring in the Service of God, do fitly prepare the way to the Third Part of this <hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>persuasive</hi> to <hi>Attention,</hi> without which we cannot be either innocent, or safe, or useful.</p>
            <p>Give, therefore, to God not a <hi>mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> but a <hi>reasonable</hi> service. Let him have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63301:11"/>
more than the bodily Engine, and the natural spring of it, by which the Eyes, and Hands, and Lips, and Knees, are mov'd. Consider that when all the Forces of Soul and Body are united, They are still an imperfect Oblation; how much more when they are divided and weak'ned by the Thoughts and Affections running in many and in crooked Channels.</p>
            <p>Offer, then, to him what is his due, and that which pleaseth him best, and that which becomes a Man, the Soul, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the inward reverence; give him it with <hi>judgment</hi>; not repeating (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake) the <hi>Ministers proper parts,</hi> such as <hi>Absolution</hi> and <hi>Benediction,</hi> as the manner of some is. Give him it in its place and in its season; perform that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely which you come to do: If any other thing be then thought of, tho' in its general nature, <hi>indifferent,</hi> nay <hi>tho'
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63301:11"/>
good,</hi> it is <hi>improper,</hi> and takes us away from our particular duty at a time when we should solemnly perform it. He (for instance) do's ill in God's Cause who reads the very <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the Time of the <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is in Honour and hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it, he that considers how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Creature Man is as God made him, such a one will not be easie in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing <hi>unseasonably</hi> and <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi>; much less will he forgive himself for thinking with pleasure on <hi>God's Day</hi> only on his own <hi>six days Labours,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 2.14.</note> or (which are much worse) his <hi>Vanities</hi> and <hi>loosnesses of Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17.24.</note> 
               <hi>The wise man's Eyes are in his Head,</hi> but <hi>a fools Eyes are at the ends of the Earth</hi>: Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, therefore, to <hi>attend</hi> on the Lord; <hi>not as fools but as wise,</hi> saying in this sense, <hi>our hearts are fixed, O God, our hearts are fixed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63301:12"/>Now because we are subject to the Infirmity of giddiness and misattention, and to an indulgence of infirm Nature; and, likewise to the Insults of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, who studies to give the greatest interruption to us when we are most religiously imploy'd; a meer <hi>dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> from wandring is not sufficient for us, unless we also understand and use fit <hi>Helps</hi> against <hi>Distraction of thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Helps,</hi> some are but <hi>pretended</hi> ones, and will deceive us.</p>
            <p>Others are <hi>real,</hi> and will, at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent much of our Distemper, if they cannot wholly cure it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Amongst the <hi>pretended Helps</hi> which will deceive us, I shall mention two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63301:12"/>The <hi>First</hi> is that of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who prescribe <hi>the use of an Image,</hi> as a proper Instrument for the fixing the Mind by the Assistance of Sense. Whereas, by this means the Eye draws down the Mind from the Prototype to the Type, from the Creator to the Creature; and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is turn'd into an Idol, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Phantasm (which is made by the sight of it) is that which is most thought of and ador'd. So that this second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject distracts the Mind, instead of fixing it where it should be truly plac'd; and gives it a diversion by those Bodily Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances which do not at all appertain to the most high God whom we worship, and <hi>whom only we should serve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A second pretended</hi> Help against wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of Mind, is <hi>unpremeditated Prayer.</hi> For the <hi>Novelty</hi> of it will, they presume, engage the Attention, whilst that to which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63301:13"/>
Men are accustom'd will be formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>To which it may be said, that such as come in good earnest to serve God, will attend much more to an ancient Service, which is judicious and grave, than to any new one which is raw and undigested.</p>
            <p>That those who officiate (being not inspir'd) unless great Ability and long Use have given them an extraordinary Talent, are <hi>distracted</hi> betwixt <hi>Invention</hi> and <hi>Elocution</hi>; they are forc'd <hi>not so much to mind what they say, as to study</hi> what they <hi>shall say:</hi> and those who <hi>hear</hi> are distracted also, betwixt <hi>Assenting</hi> and saying <hi>Amen,</hi> and considering, <hi>in a new Matter,</hi> whether they can say <hi>Amen</hi> to it or not.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be imagin'd that the <hi>Hearers</hi> should not <hi>rove</hi> if the Speakers <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, not trusting to <hi>pretended</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63301:13"/>
Helps, let us (2<hi>dly</hi>) make use of those which are <hi>real.</hi> And they are many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Infirmity of thought is help'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By some <hi>Order</hi> in thinking, tho' it be not nice and Philosophical, but such as we may learn even from common Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms, and Sums of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By freeing our selves, as much as may be, from <hi>worldly Incumbrance</hi>; and by banishing Care, which perplexeth the Mind, and choaketh the good thoughts of it.</p>
            <p>By <hi>preserving the Temper</hi> from being broken with Adversity, through that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venness which proceedeth from Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God.</p>
            <p>By keeping the <hi>Affairs of the other days of the Week</hi> from intrenching too much upon those of the <hi>first</hi>; so the <hi>Jews</hi> began their Sabbath about Midnight; and how (for Example sake) is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63301:14"/>
for those to be undistracted in God's Service, who come into a Church on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Day,</hi> full of the Images of a <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> frequented on the <hi>Eve</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>Further our <hi>Infirmity is help'd,</hi> by a <hi>particular Application</hi> to God against wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in his Service, when we are just en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon it.</p>
            <p>By our <hi>immediate</hi> checking and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>our Thoughts,</hi> as soon as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be stepping aside; and by taking a holy Revenge upon our selves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in private, in repeating that to which we less attended, till we are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our attention to it.</p>
            <p>It is further assisted, by the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Majesty</hi> of him we worship; by laying to Heart the <hi>moment of the Service</hi> it self, and making it case of Life and Death eternal, which will almost force us to attend to it</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63301:14"/>By the <hi>Time</hi> consider'd, as separated from common Use and servile Labour.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Place,</hi> thought upon as <hi>dreadful,</hi> or as God's especial Presence.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>decency</hi> of the <hi>Place</hi> fitted for a Religious Assembly, without <hi>variety of superstitious Figures,</hi> such especially as we see in many Romish Churches, where they serve for Pomp, rather than Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and for the refreshing of those to whom the unedifying sound of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Language would else be very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Images,</hi> and such-like <hi>Ornaments,</hi> amuse the Fancy, and draw away the Attention from the Service of God, which is the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness for which such Buildings are erected, and where it sufficeth if they be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, clean and decent.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, our Infirmity is help'd by <hi>Scriptures</hi> and Services in a <hi>known Tongue</hi>;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63301:15"/>
for how shall a Man attend to that which he does not understand?</p>
            <p>Also by the <hi>good Method</hi> and Order of that which is deliver'd; and by <hi>liturgical</hi> Words, well chosen, and ready prepar'd. For a Service, which is well weigh'd, and generally approv'd of, and at hand for use, leaves the Mind at more freedom for the exercise of its Devotion: It hath nothing then to do, but to add to <hi>good Words</hi>; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fervour of Mind, which by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenseness of it, will keep off Foreign Ideas; The Birds will not light upon the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice whilst it is flaming.</p>
            <p>Nor are those frequent <hi>breaks</hi> in Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy inconsiderable Helps to the common People, who are lost in a long-continued Service; whilst they are able to attend to that which is short, and after a small pause, to renew their Attention to a following <hi>Ejaculation</hi> or <hi>Collect:</hi> and to them those
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63301:15"/>
short <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> which the ignorant revile as <hi>shreds of Prayer,</hi> are real <hi>Helps of Devotion</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Last of all; God, <hi>by his Spirit,</hi> helps the Spirit of Man in the use of good Means, when, with profound Humility, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Devotion, he prays for it.</p>
            <p>After all this, let no Man excuse himself upon the <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>perfect steadiness of Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Motions to wandring can scarcely be, at all times, prevented; but the continuance of them is our own Act and Choice. In <hi>Waters,</hi> a small Circle, made by any thing cast in, is enlarg'd into a greater, and so multiplied, till at last the whole Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face becomes uneven; but it needs not be so in the <hi>deep</hi> of the Heart which is a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Agent.</hi> That which cannot be help'd, shall not be answer'd for: but much may be help'd; and if it be not, such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63301:16"/>

is beyond Apology. All vain, all wicked Thoughts which we delight in, are our own; and proceed not so much from the Frailty of Nature, as the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Heart.</p>
            <p>And happier, much happier is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Ideot, who cannot think with any tolerable consistence; or the <hi>sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> whose Fever rageth, and not himself, than a Man who has a good Capacity, and is a Master of Method; yet, when he is upon the great Business of saving his Soul, takes up all his thoughts with his Farms and his Oxen, his Trade and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, his Politicks or secular Studies.</p>
            <p>And for those pious Worshippers, whose minds are weak, and memories frail, and by Age, or other Causes, past the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the soundness of them, let them not be so discouraged as to forbear God's Worship, because they do it with such
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63301:17"/>
imperfection. The Paralitic must move on, tho' they shake every step, they make way, tho' slowly; and they will, at last <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their Course with joy.</hi> That which the Apostle saith of <hi>Charity,</hi> is true of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; If <hi>there be a willing mind it is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to what a man has, and not according to what he has not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is confess'd, that one end of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in Religious Assemblies, is the giving a <hi>publick Sign</hi> of our Communion with God's Church, which is done by <hi>our presence,</hi> and our decent behaviour there. But there is something more requir'd; the paying of our <hi>actual Homage</hi> to God, by the Dedication of Soul and Body to him, and the attending to the <hi>holy Offices,</hi> as means appointed by God for our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reproof, encouragement, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and the conveying to us his especial Grace and Blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63301:18"/>It is true, the <hi>Liturgy</hi> is a settled Form, and gives not daily new entertainment to Mens Fancies; but it is such, as being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, may yet please and benefit the <hi>Devout.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures are always the same, but they are a great deep of <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi>; and every time a Man attends to them, he may possibly find something instructive and useful, which before he observ'd not.</p>
            <p>It is certain that we cannot hear <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets in Person: But God's good Providence hath convey'd their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings down to us, and we must read and hear them.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>Solomon,</hi> whose Wisdom drew Hearers from the Ends of the Earth, do's not now <hi>speak himself,</hi> but his <hi>Works do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is confess'd, that <hi>Christ</hi> who <hi>spake as never man spake,</hi> is in the Heavens, but his <hi>written word</hi> is in his Church, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63301:18"/>
Power goes along with it wheresoever there is a teachable and attentive Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>It is also humbly acknowledg'd, that there are great Imperfections in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church; yet Christ hath been pleas'd in <hi>earthen Vessels,</hi> to convey to the World the rich <hi>Treasure</hi> of his Gospel.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore receive the Gift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out despising the meanness of the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and mind not so much who the Person is that speaks, as that <hi>which is said,</hi> and the Divine Authority, from whence he has Commission to preach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Let us make devout supplication to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who hath caused all Holy Scriptures to be written for our Learning</hi>; praying him to grant, <hi>That we may in such wise read, hear, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and comfort of his Holy Word, we may embrace, and ever hold fast the blessed Hope of everlasting Life, which he hath given us in Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>
