            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Presume, but with that profound Respect which is due to such
an August Assembly, humbly to implore your Protection to
this rude and indigested, yet real Effort of true Love to my
Country, and to you <hi>Worthy Patriots</hi> in particular, whom all
honest-hearted Scotsmen look upon as <hi>the Healers of our Breaches,
and Restorers of our Paths to dwell in:</hi> And therefore it is not possible
for any Man who has a drop of true <hi>Scots</hi> Blood in his Veins, to
hear your Authority impugned, and your Wisdom called in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without resenting it to the utmost of his Ability: And if, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to make them boil over. Hence it is, that in a former Endeavour
I could not forbear to besprinkle, <hi>Scotico aceto,</hi> some degenerate
Monsters of our Country, who exposed to contempt, as much as
in them lay, whatever Scotsmen account dear in things Civil and
Sacred.</p>
            <p>Had it been only a particular Party, or some such pack'd Clubs
as disgraced the Name of Parliaments in former Reigns, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
such Laws as their present Majesties, with your Advice, have
declared to be impious; had it, I say been thus, the Matter might
have been the more easily digested; but to have a lawful and a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
elected Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> charged in a Neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with a deliberate and malicious Lie, in an Act so unanimously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

the Nation's being first reformed by Presbyters; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Presbyterian Government is most sutable to the Inclinations of
our People; I say, to have a Lie of that Nature charged upon you,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:44963:3"/>
is a Piece of Impudence that none but the Party culpable could be
guilty of. And yet, as if they had a mind to exhaust all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the bottomless Pit at once, and to bankrupt the Malice and
Falshood of Hell for ever after, they go on to charge you further,
with lodging the Government of the Church, in the Hands of such
blasphemous ignorant and immoral Beasts, as <hi>Asrica</hi> never produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the like; and to aggravate your Guilt, would make our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nation believe, that at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thus those common Incendiaries, in their printed Libels,
treat the Parliament of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which for the Antiquity of its
Standing, and fulness of its Power, gives place to none in <hi>Europe.</hi>
But it is not to be wondred at, most Noble Patriots, that that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should treat you thus, seeing they hate your being any otherwise
than <hi>to serve as their Drudges, and devour the best and most industrious
Part of the Subjects;</hi> by which both you, and that Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which you represent, were well-nigh entomb'd in Oblivion
and Disgrace. It was that Party who changed a well-limited and
regular Monarchy, into an absolute and uncontroulable Tyranny;
that durst arrogate, a Power to cass and annul your firmest Laws,
and treat you with Contempt as perfect Slaves<note n="a" place="bottom">K. <hi>James</hi>'s Proclamation.</note>. It was that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

rendred K. <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth so much a Prelatical Bigot, as to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
both of Church and State, and contrary to his Oath, to
obtrude Bishops upon the Nation, and persecute the sincerest Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
while at the same time he indulged the Papists; and in fine,
had such an aversion for his Native Country, that instead of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it once in three Years, for administring Justice according to his
Promise, he never came to it but once after his Succession to the
Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and instead of favouring his Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:44963:3"/>
which he pretended once so much to admire, he persecuted
those who declin'd a Conformity with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It
was that Party who influenced <hi>Charles</hi> the First, though a Native
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to put such an intolerable Affront upon the Nation, as
to demand their Crown to be sent to <hi>England;</hi> and afterwards to
invade us with a formidable Army, designing an absolute Conquest,
and in an unnatural manner to subject that Nation to his newly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Crown; which his Ancestors did so much disdain, that they
maintain'd 300 Years War upon that Head with no small Glory.
And how the Faction prevail'd with <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to requite
our Nation for making themselves a Field of Blood in Defence of
his Title, is so fresh, that it needs not be recapitulated; and it is
yet much more recent, how well K. <hi>Iames</hi> the Seventh rewarded us
for owning his Right of Succession, when <hi>England</hi> had in a manner
spued him out by the Bill of Exclusion; he, I say, rewarded us,
by publishing such despotical Proclamations, as with an unparallel'd
audacity, declared us Slaves to the perpetual Infamy of that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scotsmen, who were so tamely bereft of their Liberty, which
our Noble Progenitors maintained against <hi>Romans, Picts, Britains,
Danes, Saxons, Normans</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> for twenty preceeding Ages.
So that I say, considering how the Prelatical Faction in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>luenced those
four Monarchs to treat our Nation, though they derived their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Honour from it; and were otherwise in many respects,
<hi>tantorum haud quaquam indigni avorum.</hi> The Resolve of your August
Assembly, that Prelacy was an insupportable Grievance to that
Kingdom, deserves to be engraven in Pillars of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass;
and that all Scotsmen (as no doubt many thousands will) should
not only whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> their Pens, but their Swords, in defence of it. It
is that Party, who in this Reign, impugn your Authority, by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Letters from Court to command such things to the Assembly as
by Law they are not obliged to comply with; and if they should have
done it, could neither have been answerable to God nor <hi>your Honours</hi>
for it, to pull down with their own Hands, that Hedg which he in
his Providence, by your Act, hath set about the Church, in lodging
the Government upon themselves, which no doubt the Wisdom of
your August Assembly judged to be the best Expedient to secure the
Peace of the Church; and yet for noncompliance, how did they
procure the Dissolution and Reproach of that Assembly, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
violation of your Authority; and that by the Advice of some
English Courtiers and Prelats, as if they had a mind to homologate
the Ancient Pretensions of that Crown and Church over yours,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:44963:4"/>
and in the view of the World declare our Parliament and General
Assembly not able to give Advice in our own Affairs, but fit to be
over-ruled by a pack'd Club of another Nation: and shall they act
thus <hi>impune</hi> to affront a Parliament, which Malice it self cannot say,
as their Party did formerly of the English Parliament, That it is but
a superfluous Tumour or Wen: for all who know our History, are
sensible of the share which the Scots Parliaments have, from the first
Constitution of our Government, been possest of, not only in the
Legislative, but the Executive Power: and, if our Historians may be
believed, laid the Foundation, and have often-times since regulated
and limited the Power of our Monarchy; and to the eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of all those who would insinuate the danger thereof to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government, have, notwithstanding, preserved our Monarchy in
a longer and more uninterrupted Succession than any Nation of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not unknown to your August Assembly what Convulsions
the Prelatical Party have thrown the Kingdom into, since the first
Intrusion of their Prelacy; and how near the Ruine both of our
Religious and Civil Liberties were effected, by their Concurrence
with the Tyranny of the late Reigns, represented in your <hi>Claim of
Right;</hi> and therefore the World cannot but justify your Conduct
in depriving them of any share of the Government of the Church,
which they only seek, that they may undermine; and tho they
should comply with the Terms required in Law, yet their former
Perjuries and contradictory Tests are but too shrew'd Causes to
suspect their future Levity, which, together with the Disaffected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they have generally evidenced to the present Government, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates
how dangerous it is to entrust them with the Conduct
of Peoples Consciences. And what may justly render them hateful
to all honest Scots-men, is the Obloquy and Reproach they have
thrown here upon the whole Nation; and their under-hand deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the high-flown Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Party, who have a
Heart-hatred at our Country and Religion; and have treated you
with so much Contempt, that tho you mov'd for an Union, and
his Majesty was graciously pleased to back it, they disdain'd to give
him any Answer, as thinking you unworthy of a Politick or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Union; and yet they would be at forcing you to an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
and Spiritual Union, which if they could effectuate, the World
must allow that they ought, in the next place, to beg us for Fools,
who could believe that they have a Kindness for our Souls, who
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>one for our Bodies. Yet this is the Party that our Prelatical
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:44963:4"/>
Country-men do so much court and make Application to, while
they slight Scots-men who are authoriz'd to represent our Affairs:
So much have they divested themselves of all natural Respect to
their Country, that if their Prelacy live, they care not tho the Name
and Fame of <hi>Scotland</hi> die: and that they may effectuate their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
there's no doubt but they will be forming Parties in your
August Assembly, and make many fair Pretences of desiring Liberty
only to exercise what belongs to their pretended indelible Character
of Pastors, and promise to undertake nothing to the Disturbance
of the publick Tranquillity: But their worming themselves in by
degrees in King <hi>Iames</hi> the VIth's time under fair Pretences, and
then overturning all when they had opportunity, is a sufficient
Caveat to beware of them, as inwardly ravening Wolves, tho out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they appear in Sheeps Cloathing. Your August Assembly
cannot so soon have forgot that the Nation was almost totally ruined,
your Counties invaded by savage Highlanders, your Tenants
murdered, and Families impoverish'd, your Houses plundered, your
Wives, Daughters, and Relations ravish'd, your selves and tender
Infants exposed to Wandring, Hunger, Nakedness and Cold, and
all the Miseries and Oppressions which you groan'd under in the
late Reigns, both as to Soul and Body. I say your Honours cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have forgot these things, so far as to be prevail'd upon by any
Insinuations whatever, again to deliver up your bleeding Church
and Country into the Hands of that Faction, lest the latter end be
worse than the first.</p>
            <p>There's no cause to fear a Rupture with <hi>England</hi> on that account.
The good Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Laity, and not a few of their Clergy,
have incurred danger enough from their high-flown Tantivies, and
have smarted sufficiently under their Doctrine of Passive Obedience,
to make them cautious and willing to secure themselves from their
Fury, so far will they be from concurring with them against you.</p>
            <p>The chief Arguments used here for re-admitting the Prelatical
Clergy are, That it will contribute to his Majesty's Interest, and
please the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and supply the vacant Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As to the first, How it can promote his Majesty's Interest
to disoblige the greatest part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all the Dissenters in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is beyond the reach of Mankind to determine.
2. How it can be supposed that a Party, who have hitherto witnessed
so much Rancour against his Majesty's Person, Family and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Scots Episcopal Clergy have done, is only to be answered
by those who can swear contradictory Oaths, as our Curats did in

               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:44963:6"/>
their infamous Tests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the second, That it will please
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it may easily be answered, that we do
not ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> them so much Kindness; and if we did, we must first
know what that Church of <hi>England</hi> is that we must oblige; for
hitherto she hath been an <hi>individuum Vagum,</hi> that no body knows
where to find, it being as difficult to define her, as to make a
Coat for the Moon. Her Doctrinal Articles are own'd by us, and
all good Protestants; but that is not the Characteristick of
the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for in the late Reigns Passive Obedience
and Nonresistance were her <hi>Shibboleth;</hi> but now she hath renounced
those Doctrines, by acting diametrically opposite to them. And for
a Character of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Reign, we cannot
certainly have it better than from a Vote of the last House of
Commons, who resolved on an Address of Thanks to his Majesty
for the Care he had taken of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was then made in the Lieutenancy of <hi>London;</hi> and that
was, because by the ill Advice of a certain Prelate and others, the
Military Power of the City was lodg'd in those who had surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her Charter, and dipp'd their Hands in the Blood of my
Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Alderman <hi>Cornish, &amp;c.</hi> and contributed
to the Arbitrary Methods of the late Reigns: And because this
is but one half of the Parliament, let's look into the higher House,
and there you will find, that according to the opinion of none of
the least Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, when the Act pass'd for depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Nonjurant Bishops, it was look'd upon as a fatal Blow
to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So that in plain terms, the Jacobite
Party is what that Faction means by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And
as a Commentary upon the Text, let's but consider the main En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
which they have made use of to quash the Discovery of all Plots
against the Government, and we shall find that it was by giving
out those Discoveries as the Efforts of Republicans and Dislenters
against the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and if we look nearer home, and
consider how it comes to pass that such Men are advanced to the
highest Places in the Scots Government, who were the Contrivers,
Enacters, and bloody Executioners of those Laws which your
August Assembly hath declared to be impious, we shall find it to be
done by the Interest of that Party in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If we
consider further, whence it is that those who betray'd our Army,
murder'd our People, and plotted the Destruction of your Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
escape unpunish'd, you will fin'd it to be by the Procurement of the
aforesaid Party. Now all these things being considered, it will easily
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:44963:6"/>
appear, whether it be your Interest to oblige this Church or not.
Or, if we take her according to the general Acceptation of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> the Vote of your August Assembly concerning
Prelacy, your Act establishing Presbytery as most agreeable to the
Word of God, and the Opposition made to the Ceremonies by our
Country in <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, will speedily determine the case.
And it will yet appear less reasonable to oblige that Church, so
taken, if we consider, that those of her own Communion, and the
best of them too, look upon both Bishops and Ceremonies to be
indifferent, and not of Divine Institution, as may be seen by the
Writings of Mr. <hi>Hickeringil,</hi> Counsellor <hi>Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s
<hi>Irenicum.</hi> So that in effect, the best of the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Communion
are embark'd in the same Bottom with your selves,
and the common Enemies of both call them Presbyterians as well
as you, and treated them accordingly in the late Reigns: So that
from that worthy part of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are Men of
good Lives, and keep firm to the Doctrine of their Church, you
need fear no Opposition; for to do them Justice, they are as zealous
for the Protestant Religion as any, and never join'd in persecuting
their Brethren of a different Opinion.</p>
            <p>To what they pretend of supplying the vacant Churches, may
speedily be replied; The Assembly hath declared their Willingness
to employ such of them as are Godly and Orthodox. And as for
others, the good old way of our Church in the Reformation (when
Ministers were scarcer than now) of appointing Men to preach by
turns to those vacant Congregations till they can be otherwise sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
is the much safer and better Expedient, than to entrust such Men
with the Charge of other Peoples Souls, who have discovered so little
care of their own, and whom in your Wisdom you objected against
as the great and insupportable Grievance of the Nation. Nor
have you any such Encouragement from their former Success to
imploy them again: and if it shall seem good in your Eyes to go
on as you begun, and encourage a Reformation, such of our
Country-men as are abroad, will be the sooner prevail'd with to
come home; and others to prosecute their Studies, to adapt them
for the Ministry, and fill up the Vacancies; for it cannot be hid
from your Illustrious Assembly, that the intrusting the chief Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Presbyterians in the Government, is a great Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to all that wish well to our Church or Country<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>; and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:44963:7"/>
administers but too just cause of Suspicion, that we must either be
imbroil'd in a Civil War, or return to our former Bondage, which
nothing but your Care, with his Majesty's Assistance and God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
is able to prevent.</p>
            <p>Your Honours may perhaps be inclin'd to think, that there is
too much Gall in my Pen against our Prelatical Clergy; but such of
your Number as have been lately at <hi>London,</hi> cannot but know what
an Odium they have endeavoured to bring upon the Country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and your August Assembly in particular; insinuating, <hi>That
you are neither the True nor full Representatives of the Nation, and but
a meer surreptitious Faction got together by the Opportunity of tum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Times; and that you neither acted from a Principle of Honour
nor Conscience, but did only what you thought would be pleasing to the
Prince of</hi> Orange. And hence they have used their utmost Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to have you Dissolv'd, by the Interest of the high-slown Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
English Courtiers, to whom they represent you in the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Colours, which their Malice or Wit can invent: And not only
so, but they make use of your Name, as the Turkish Slaves do
those of their Barbarous Masters from whom they have escaped, to
move those of the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Communion to open their
Purses, pretending that you have turn'd them out in a barbarous
and illegal manner, or that they have had such and such Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Affronts put upon them. And thus they beg from one Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man
to another, and spend what they get at Taverns and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,
or sitting up whole Nights at Cards, particularly at <hi>Mills</hi>
in <hi>Westminster,</hi> or <hi>Hutchinsons</hi> in the <hi>Hay-Market:</hi> and when their
Stock is spent, renew the begging Trade, or else troop about the
Country, and with their stol'n Sermons, or railing Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both in Church and State, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
themselves into the Adorers of Bishops and Ceremonies;
for the latter of which, though they exclaim'd against them at
Home, they profess themselves to be mighty Zealots Abroad: and thus
they disseminate their Poison in our Neighbouring Nation, by their
lying Tongues and blasphemous Pamphlets. So that hence your
August Assembly may have a sufficient view, whether it be safe to
reintroduce such Men into the Church, who have given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to all manner of Villanies, and are become Devotoes to
those unscriptural Ceremonies, which occasion'd the fatal War in
<hi>Charle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> the First's Time; and have moreover evidenced such Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:44963:7"/>
and Unsted fastness both in imbracing &amp; rejecting them at Home,
since the Revolution, that it's visible they are not acted by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but Interest; and that their Interest has been always contrary
to what your August Assembly hath now espoused, both as to Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Religion, is so evident, that whoever casts but an Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the History ever since they were obtruded upon the Nation,
may soon be convinc'd of it: Or by a shorter view, if they please
but to read the Grievances which you desired to be redressed by
their present Majesties, of which the Bishops and Clergy were for
the most part Contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ers, Promoters and Actors. And we may the
better be satisfied what those Men who now sollicite for a Share in
the Government of the Church, do chiefly aim at, both as to that
and the State, if we do but consider that their principal Converse
is with the Jacobites in <hi>England,</hi> and that the chiefest of their
Friends are none of the best Williamites in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's not unlike that your Honours may be accosted with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other Arguments, that admitting those Men to a share of
Church-Government, will gratify the King to whom you are so much
obliged, which of it self is an impeachment of your Wisdom; for
none can so well know the Interest of <hi>Scotland</hi> as a free chosen Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who are consequently fittest to give the King Advice:
And seeing the Interest of all good Kings, and their People, is one
and the same, that ought to be most grateful to the King which is
so to the People, and what that is you have already declared. It is
obvious to those that know our History, that ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath claim'd a Right of Calling and
Adjourning her own Assemblies, <hi>pro re nata;</hi> and what dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
the Invasion of that Privilege hath been attended with,
to those Kings and Grandees who have attempted it, is so well
known, that it cannot easily be forgot. And whether King <hi>Iames</hi>
the Sixth's Curse hath not taken place upon those of his Successors
who invaded the Church, the Revolutions of the Crown have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
witnessed: and if the Hand of God hath not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
seen in punishing those Great Ones who were their
Tools, let the Ruin of their Families from time to time declare.
Nor hath the Nation escap'd punishment for the Treachery of their
Representatives, God having been justly provok'd to give them
and their Liberties to be swallowed up by those very Men whom
they would needs set upon his Throne, and into whose Hands they
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:44963:8"/>
betray'd the Liberties of the Church, of which your own Claim
of Right is a speaking Monument: and seeing there is no doubt
but your August Assembly had valuable Reasons for abolishing the
Supremacy, it's an Affront to your Authority to demand its Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
Its being possess'd by the Church, can bring no Damage
to the Crown; for Presbyterians are known to have as good, if not
a better Opinion of his present Majesty, than any other of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and all Men of Sense must needs take it for a Proof of it, that
they sollicite for such good Laws in his Reign, as may secure them
from the danger of others. And seeing our Church-men are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Laws, and never did refuse to assemble at the Call of
their Kings, and to give an Account of their Affairs, it's but equal
to leave them in the Possession of that Liberty of calling Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
concerning their own Matters, which the Church was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of before ever there was a Christian Magistrate, if the <hi>15th</hi>
of the <hi>Acts</hi> be the Word of God. And certainly he who promised
that Kings should be Nursing-Fathers, did never intend that they
should be Step-Fathers, to rob the Children of what is their
due.</p>
            <p>As for the Calumnies of your Church of-<hi>England</hi>-Enemies, it is
easy to stop their Mouth with <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem;</hi> their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to K. <hi>Iames</hi> the Seventh, proclaims their unshaken Loyalty.
And for your own Episcopal Party, all the World knows that they
and their Kings together, did so tyrannize over your Bodies and
Souls, that you durst scarcely plead a Property in either. And if
the Church of <hi>England</hi> must be pleased, which is the <hi>Achillean</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
used by the Party, we can justly answer the peevish Lady,
as the young Crab did the old One, <hi>I prae Mater &amp; ego sequar.</hi>
Let's see how careful she will be to testify her Gratitude to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
in taking off the Test, and taking in Dissenters to the
Church, which will but just make them even with us; and then, and
time enough then, because we are the oldest Nation, we may think
which way to make the next Advance: for as we have got the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency,
it's but reasonable we should keep it; for I know so much
by my self, that Scotsmen love to go, but neither to be driven nor
dragg'd.</p>
            <p>I cannot but acquaint your Honours, that since the writing of
what is above, the Jacobites here are mightily elevated, and big
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:44963:8"/>
with hopes of seeing you all in Confusion, and the Nation in a
Flame, by the Designs which they give out to be on foot amongst
you, of lodging the Power of Calling and Dissolving Church-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in the Magistrate alone, and depriving the People of the
Right of chusing Ministers, by which means they are so bold as to
say, That they hope not only to see Prelacy gradually reintroduced,
but their late Monarch reinthroned: And that they may accomplish
these Designs, will insinuate themselves into both Parties; and are
very confident, that the Result will answer their Expectation for a
speedy Reestablishment, of Prelacy at least; these Measures, as they
give out, being concerted with English Prelats, who have form'd a
Party among you for their Designs. But as they have hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
your Proceedings, there's no doubt but this is a Calumny
from the same Forge, by which they would Ridicule your Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and represent you to the World as Men of no Principle nor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
but such as will make your self Transgressors, in building
again what you have already destroy'd. But may the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord Jesus Christ direct your Counsels, so as to issue in
the Comfort of his Church, Peace of the Nation, and Confusion of
those your black-mouth'd Enemies, who are engaged in an Interest,
not only distinct from, but altogether destructive of yours: Of which
there's no room to doubt, if we consider the following Address of
the Representatives of their Church, which they have endeavour'd
to perform on all Occasions; and as they have never yet revok'd it,
we need not doubt but that the Party are still of the same mind.</p>

            <head>A FURTHER
ANSWER
TO THE
Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,
By way of Animadversion on Dr. M.â€”
As Postscript in Answer to the first.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I take the Doctor to task, I think it necessary to
answer the Objections made by Friends against my first
Essay; which are, That the Stile is too Satyrical, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
at the latter end too Fulsome; and that their Book
deserved no Answer, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>arrying its Confutation in its Forehead.
I reply, That as to the sharpness of the Stile, none who read, or
consider what they wrote, can think they ought to be otherwise
treated: So that I shall for once make use of the Tinker's Apology
to a Farmer, who quarrelled him for striking his Dog with the sharp
End of his Staff, alledging that it had been sufficient to have beat
him with the Blunt. <hi>Yes,</hi> says the Tinker, <hi>when your Dog runs at
me with his blunt End, I shall use the blunt End of my Stick; but when
he runs at me with his sharp End, give me leave to be as sharp with him.</hi>
Not that I would justify the rendring of Railing for Railing, which
I acknowledg to be contrary to our Saviour's Command, but I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to the Judgment of Divines, Whether answering Lies with
Truth, and making the real Infamy of him appear, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
by forg'd Accusations, to take away my good Name, be a
Breach of that Divine Precept? So that while the Matters of Fact
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44963:11"/>
wherewith they are charged, hold true, the Reflections upon them,
and Epithets given them, can never be justly quarrelled; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I would entreat my Friends to be sparing of their Censures:
for while the Memory of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, or K. <hi>Iames</hi> the
Seventh endures; and till Time, the consumer of all things, hath
eat up their Parliament-Rolls, it will hold an undeniable Truth,
That the Prelatical Party of <hi>Scotland</hi> are Persecutors; and that in
denying the same, they have made themselves notorious Liars.</p>
            <p>2. So long as it appears by the same Acts, that they imposed and
took a contradictory Test, so long will it hold that they are perjur'd
themselves, and chargeable with the Perjury of others.</p>
            <p>3. So long as it remains in the Records of Council, that they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Men to be killed, without any Trial or colour of Law; or so
much as with an Exception, Whether they resisted or not resisted;
so long will it hold that they are bloody Murderers.</p>
            <p>4. So long as the Records of the last General Assembly of the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> remain, it will appear, by their Evasions, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
and disingenuous Refusals, to declare their abhorrence of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism,
Socinianism and Popery, that they are Fire-brands in
the Church, and Incendiaries in the State.</p>
            <p>5. So long as any of their villanous Libels, called <hi>The Scotch
Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> exist, wherein they charge Holiness with
Deformity, God with horrid Decrees, and mock at Seriousness
and Piety, so long will it be evident that they they are Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
            <p>6. So long as that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>urrilous Address of their Bishops against the
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> their opposing him in Parliament; their refusing
to pray for him, or swear to him now he is King, and the legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
against them on the said accounts are on Record, so long will
it appear that they are Rebels.</p>
            <p>7. So long as their bloody Acts of Parliament, and barbarous
Execution of those Acts against us, and our gentle Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and moderate Execution of those Acts against them are
upon Record, so long it will appear that they are infamous Liars,
in asserting, that we treat them more barbarously than they trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us.</p>
            <p>8. So long as the West of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which was the principal
Scene of those bloody Tragedies) has a Being, so long will it appear
that they were barbarous.</p>
            <p>So that I hope all Men of common Sense, perceive that there's no
denying the <hi>Consequence,</hi> without denying the <hi>Precedent;</hi> which they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44963:11"/>
can never do so long as any Records have a Being in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and
therefore I refer it to the impartial Reader, whether they do not
deserve to be sharply treated.</p>
            <p>To the fulsomness of the Instances I reply, That indeed such
things are not sit to be named amongst Christians as a Subject of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
but seeing they charge our Ministers with Impurity of
Life and Doctrine, I hope it may be allowed in such a case to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their really vitious Practices, in opposition to what they have
forged against us; and seeing the thing is in a manner juridical, and
they the first Aggressors, it was but necessary for our own Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to display them in their own Colours. However, if any
thing either in this Particular, or others, be offensive, let the Blame
rest upon me alone; for I solemnly declare, that I neither had the
Commission nor Connivance of my Party to write what I did, only
some particular Persons and Laicks like my self, gave me most of
the Passages now found fault with. But e're I leave this Subject, let
me add, that I humbly conceive my Foundation to be very solid,
whatever Blemish there may be in the Superstructure, seeing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when a Convention, passed such a Vote,
That their Bishops and Clergy were the great and insupportable
Grievance of the Nation, for which no better ground can be assigned
than their Profanity, Persecution and want of Piety. So that I have
only made out by Particulars, what they charged them with in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
and therefore seeing I only spoke the truth, to vindicate those
who were falsly accused, and not to gratify the profane Palat of
the Age, I hope I may have some grains of Allowance, it never
being reckoned a fault in any Evidence, to repeat the Blasphemies of
the Atheist, or the Treason of the Traitor: nor can Religion be a
Sufferer by the exposing of those Men, any more than it was by stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing
of the Scribes and Pharisees as Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>As to the last Objection, That it deserved no Answer because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by it self; I reply, That in <hi>Scotland</hi> it's true, but here we are
not known: and being represented as the worst of Men and greatest
of Barbarians to those of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Vomit was greedily lick'd up, and by many believed; so that
their Pamphlets spread, and were mightily hugg'd by such as are
enraged at our abolishing Prelacy, and by the Jacobites who thence
took occasion to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lect upon his Majesty for setling such a monstrous
Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they might render him odious to the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> I cannot mention it without Concern, that those
who are able to defend our Church and Country, are so unwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ing to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44963:12"/>
write; and when they do, that they let the Adversary triumph so
long before they reply. If it must be so, I wish that they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
some of their Friends here with Hand-Granadoes, to keep tho
Enemy in play till they come up with their Mortar-pieces.</p>
            <p>Before I take the <hi>Postscript</hi> in hand, I find it needful to make it
evident to the World, that Presbytery cannot be over-turn'd in
<hi>Scotland</hi> without the Subversion of our Religious and Civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and consequently that our Scots Episcopalians are Enemies to
the present Government, and French Incendiaries, or at least such
a Crew as would sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ice all that is dear to us, as Men and Christians,
to their own private Resentments.</p>
            <p>1. It is very well known, and too lately transacted to be forgotten,
that the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their <hi>Claim of Right</hi> did demand the
Abolition of Prelacy, as contrary to the Inclination of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the People; on which Condition, amongst others, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
accepted that Crown; and in pursuance of their Promise have
by Act of Parliament, abolished Prelacy since, and established Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as most agreeable to the World of God, as well
as the Peoples Inclinations. Then if their Majesties should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon (which blessed be God there is no cause to fear) to act
contrary to their solemn Oaths, and the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> they must
needs see that the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> would have ground enough to
plead a Breach of the Original Contract; nor could the Church
of <hi>England</hi> for shame condemn them, seeing they made use of the
same Plea in their Convention and Parliament against King <hi>Iames.</hi>
And in the next place, let them but consider, that upon the same
ground this, or any other King may as well break with them, and
invade the Constitution of their Church, which by the Coronation-Oath
they have bound him to maintain: And whether <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, after he was by them perswaded to break his Oath to the
Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> made any greater Conscience of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Civil and Religious Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> appeal to
themselves. And therefore seeing by that excessive Power which
they gave their Kings in things sacred, meerly to destroy the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
they found at last that they had put a Rod in their Hands
to whip themselves; I think they should be cautious how they
play that Game over again. I do not write this, as having any
suspicion that their Majesties are so weak as to be prevailed upon
to alter the Church-Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but meerly to let the
World see, that they who sollicite them to it, are their greatest
Enemies, and design to shake their Throne; and that it is not the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44963:12"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Interest to countenance our Scots Prelatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>,
nor to importune their Majesties on that Head.</p>
            <p>If what is already said be not enough, I would earnestly intreat
all sober Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men to consider what were the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of their meddling in our Affairs, and incensing King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First against the Presbyterians, in favour of our Runnagate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and their Hirelings. And seeing like Causes may have the like
Effects, they would do well to beware. It is not unknown that
<hi>Scotland</hi> is a distinct Nation, and ought to be govern'd by their own
Laws and Councils; and therefore it must needs be an Invasion of
the Rights of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for English Ministers of State, and Prelates
to meddle, or give Counsel in Scotish Affairs when not call'd to it.
And I cannot but think that all reasonable Men will easily grant, that
the Parliament, and General Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
are better Judges of what is expedient for that Nation, than
a few English Ministers of State, or Prelates; and that both of
them have reason to reject what Directions or Injunctions come
from such a Mint. And I would put it to the Consciences of all
judicious Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, how they would take it if the
King were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that any of the Dissenting Ministers who
are really injured, as those who preached at St. <hi>Hellin</hi> and <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ley</hi>
Chappels in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> or the whole of them, because denied a
Comprehension, should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ly thither, and by their Interest with Scots
Presbyterian Ministers of State and Preachers, importune his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to have the Constitution of the Church of <hi>England</hi> overturned,
and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ure Orders to have such and such Ministers planted in
Churches, tho they refuse to satisfy the Law. I say, in such a case
I appeal to their own Consciences how they would take it, whether
they would reckon themselves obliged to obey, or if they would
not complain that their Rights were invaded, and demand Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of such Ministers of State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Incendiaries and Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Harmony between King and Subjects? I believe verily
they would, and that not without good reason, tho I am sure the
case is much stronger on our side still: for the Dissenting Ministers
of <hi>England</hi> are all of them Loyal to his Majesty, willing to swear
Allegiance, and pray for him; but so are not our Scots Prelatists.
And besides, his Majesty is really the Head and Fountain of all
Power in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have not only their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Baronies and Honours from him, but are nominated to their
Bishopricks by him: but so it is not in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
himself of the Supremacy, and neither bestows Lands nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44963:13"/>
Honours upon Church-Men. Then the case being so, the Golden
Rule, which commands us to do as we would be done by, should
oblige English-Men not to meddle with our Church, no more than
they would have us to meddle with theirs; and if the Parliament
of <hi>Scotland</hi> do pass over what of that Nature is already done,
it's not to be supposed that the Red Rampant Lion is become so
much a Calf as not to roar sometime or other, and make the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and proudest of the Beasts in the Field to tremble, as ers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> of
old; but I hope and pray that God will avert both the Cause
and the Effect. The English Bishops did not gain so much by the
the last <hi>Bellum Episcopale</hi> against us, that they need to be fond of
another; and we doubt not to find as much Justice from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> now as we found then, and have no reason to doubt
but King <hi>William</hi> would be as ready as <hi>Charles</hi> the First, to deliver up
his Ministers to the Law, if it should be made appear against them
that they have been meddling too much in our Affairs.</p>
            <p>I know that our Scots Prelatists possess the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
we think our selves obliged to endeavour the Extirpation of their
Hierarchy, and upon that account prevail with them to endeavour
our Subversion.</p>
            <p>But I would earnestly beg all moderate Men to weigh the following
Answers.</p>
            <p>1. That the reason of entring into that solemn League and
Covenant, was the Fury which the English Prelates evidenced at
that time against the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having excommunicated
the same in all the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> forced a Service-Book
upon us more exceptionable than their own; and in Conjunction
with Papists, enabled <hi>Charles</hi> the First to raise 30000 Men against
us, when the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> refus'd to concur with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that that Expedition was called <hi>the Bishops War.</hi> But
blessed be God his present Majesty is far from any such Attempt,
and the English Bishops, the chief of them at least, are Men of
more Moderation: So that there is no such cause for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the Overthrow of their Hierarchy.</p>
            <p>2. That the Scots Presbyterians do not at all think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
by that Covenant, to endeavour a forcible extirpation of
the English Prelacy, but in Concurrence with the Parliament of
<hi>England:</hi> and therefore so long as they have not their Call to the
Work, the English Prelacy is in no Hazard; and the best way to
keep so, is for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to carry modestly, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to meddle with us, nor give their own Parliament occasion to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44963:13"/>
make such a Vote against them, as the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> made
against our Bishops, <hi>That they were the great and insupportable
Grievance of the Nation:</hi> so that they have their Safety in their
own Hand. But if they should be so infatuated to proceed as they
began, in relation to the late General Assembly of the Church of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> or if they be such Fools, as to concur to the sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ling of
all Plots against his Majesty as hitherto, because so many of their
own Communion are concerned in them, let them blame themselves
for what will be the unavoidable Consequences, soon or late: for
the Church-of-<hi>England</hi> Laity are too good Protestants and English-men,
to be always led by the Clergy, or continually hood-wink'd,
and not discover the Plots carried on against the State, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Zeal to the Church; of which me-thinks the Hot-headed
Clergy should take warning, seeing they may easily perceive how
little Ground their Passive Obedience had gain'd, when the honest
Church-of-<hi>England</hi> Laicks found themselves in hazard by K. <hi>Iames,</hi>
as to their Liberties and Religion.</p>
            <p>Next I would earnestly beg, that they would consider how the
Faction, under a pretence of Zeal for the Church, and against Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
screw'd up the Prerogative to such a height, that English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had very near lost their Liberty and Property. It was this
mistaken Zeal that threw out the Bill of Exclusion, surrendred the
Charters of Corporations, enabled the King to pack Parliaments,
pick Juries, and cut off whomsoever he pleased, under pretence
of Law. It was this mistaken Zeal, that brought the late Reign,
and all the direful Effects of it, which we have already felt, or are
still impending upon us. It was this mistaken Zeal which delay'd
his present Majesty's Access to the Throne; gave the Enemies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ruin <hi>Ireland,</hi> raise a Rebellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Plot, as
they do still, in <hi>England;</hi> And shall we never be aware of it? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
that if the Church of <hi>England</hi> compared Things past and
present, She might easily perceive that this intemperate Heat against
Presbytery, doth naturally issue in Popery and Slavery; and that she
has much more reason to unite, for Defence of the Protestant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and her own Doctrinal Articles, with the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
than by espousing the Cause of a few pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>igate or traiterous Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men,
because Episcopal, run her self into unavoidable Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>Is it possible that a Harmony in Discipline should have more Power
to unite distinct Interests, than a Harmony in Doctrine and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44963:14"/>
under one Civil Head, hath to cement those who drive the
same Interest? It cannot be unknown to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if
she believes either their Majesties Proclamations, or considers the
procedure of his Parliament, and other Courts in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
the Prelatical Party there drive at a Design to restore K. <hi>Iames.</hi>
And with she yet entertain such Vipers in her Bosom as their outed
Clergy; and not only so, but for their sakes entertain Suspicions of
his Majesty, and sollicite him against the Church of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Can
she say that we have ever made any Address to him against the
Church of <hi>England?</hi> and why should they be more zealous against
us than we against them? Does she not know that Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi>
and some of the greatest of her Fathers, thought Episcopacy and
Presbytery reconcileable, and the other things in Controversy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different?
How is it then that she thinks her Differences with King
<hi>Iames</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more reconcileable, as she must needs
do if she fall in with her own high-flown Tantivees and our Scots Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists?
But I hope, if no Religious Considerations will prevail, that
the danger of their running the same Risk with us may, they seeing
both they and we have the same Security, <hi>viz.</hi> the King's accepting
of the Crown on such and such Conditions, and consenting to Acts
of Parliament accordingly: if he should break to one, he may
do the same to both; and though they may think that he will not
overthrow their Hierarchy, because the Bishops depending on him,
may be use<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ul to him in the Parliament-House; yet at the same time
he may, as <hi>Charles</hi> the Second did, invade their Civil Liberties,
and then their Religion, nor nothing else, can ever be secure. I must
again beg the Reader not to mistake me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> as designing to create any
Suspicion of his Majesty following such an unhallowed Pattern, but
meerly to set this as a Beacon before the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
they may beware of being Shipwrack'd twice upon the same Rock;
which will be unavoidable, if they should prevail wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h any of their
Kings to break the Original Contracts, or call in K. <hi>Iames,</hi> or set up
any other Pretender against his present Majesty, and prosper: which,
blessed be God, there's no probability that ever they will, for never
was King better beloved by Subjects; and let them try it when
they please, they'll <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ind he has in <hi>Scotland</hi> Twenty to One firm
in his Interest: And whatever Noise they make (to blind their
own Designs) of our hazard from a Republican Faction; if they
will assure the Nation of such Governours as are now at Helm,
those whom they call Republicans, will as cordially submit to them
as any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44963:14"/>But I foresee an Objection as to Scots Affairs, That they only sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
his Majesty to dissolve the present Parliament, and call ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which will restore Episcopacy, and recognize his Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. His Majesty hath had too many Proofs of the Loyalty
of Presbyterians, and the Treachery of Episcopalians, to venture
such an Experiment; or if he should, and they happen to recognize
his Title, he can never think that they submit from Affection, but
meerly from Interest, when they see they can do no better: And in
truth, whatever Pretences of Loyalty they make, it's demonstrable
enough, that as the Country-man, when the <hi>London</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>Drawers baul'd
out, <hi>Welcome, Sir,</hi> laid his Hand on his Pob, and said, <hi>I thank you
my Friend;</hi> so may his Majesty, when our Scots Prelatists pretend
Loyalty, put his Hand to his Side, and say, <hi>I thank you, my Sword<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
for no longer will they be his Friend, than he is able to cudgel them.
Whereas it's very well known, that the Scots Presbyterians decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for him before Providence had determined their Crown in his
Favour, and have beat into the Prelatists whatever Loyalty they
pretend to have. Nor is it to be thought, a Prince so Good and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
as his present Majesty, will ever be so ungrateful to his
Friends, or act so much contrary to Reason, and his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as to shake the present Title he has to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to buy the Consent of the Scots Prelatists, who could not desend
their Darling K. <hi>Iames,</hi> nor make any other Effort to re-establish
him, but by hectoring among the inaccessible Hills, stealing Cows
and Sheep, plundring the Country, murdering the People by
Treachery and Surprize; and at last seising the insignificant Rock,
called the <hi>Bass,</hi> where, if they please, they may send for him to
govern the <hi>Solon</hi> Geese, and themselves, the greater of the two<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
But,</p>
            <p>2. They will find themselves mistaken, if his Majesty should gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
them so far as to dissolve this, and call another Parliament; the
Presbyterians have not lost but gain'd Ground since the Revolution,
and they have smarted too severely under the Prelates, to suffer
themselves either to be hectored or kick'd out of their present Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
by any more pack'd Clubs; and knowing that Instruments of
Cruelty are in the Habitations of the Prelats, will rather quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like Men, for the Ark and People of their God, than be
brought again under the Philistin Slavery. This is only to undeceive
our Prelatists, who promise themselves such an easy Conquest: not
that we can suspect a Prince of our King's Prudence, Generosity
and Conscience, capable of so much Weakness, as to disoblige the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44963:15"/>
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> those who preserved him the Crown of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and such as are his steady and useful Friends in <hi>England,</hi> as
he must needs do if he gratify the Scots Prelatists. They have
not now an effeminate and luxurious Prince to deal with, who,
provided he might wallow in impure Pleasures, was content to
abandon all Care of his Subjects; but one who knows his Friends
from his Foes; has been accustomed to Government from his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
outbrav'd the Hector of <hi>France</hi> in his Youth; and therefore
is not to be frighted by our Scots Prelatists, and the English Tories,
into such mean Compliances, for fear of Prelatical Insurrections
and Tantivy Grumblings; he stis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ed greater Serpents than those in
his Cradle, and carries a Sword to cut off the <hi>Hydras</hi> Heads as fast
as they multiply.</p>
            <p>But now to come to the <hi>Postscript,</hi> or pretended Answer to
my Last.</p>
            <p>One would have thought that our Prelatists had bankrupt their
Treasure of Lies, Malice and Blasphemy, in their late Pamphlet,
call'd, <hi>The Scots Presbyterian Eloqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nce:</hi> But the Apologist and
Post-scribler demonstrate the contrary, and evidence, That their
Magazines are still full, and running over; and I confess there is
no cause to wonder at it, when we consider, that the Bottomless
Pit, whence they are furnish'd, is an unfathomable Source, and
that the Father of Lies is not yet so superannuated, but that he can
beget more of the Breed. But to come to our Author; he tells you,
in his very first Page, That he could not read two Lines of Dr.
<hi>Rule</hi>'s Book, without being provok'd unto the Undecencies of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and therefore it is no marvel that the reading of mine put
him stark mad, seeing I treat the Faction with some more roughness
than the Doctor did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 1. After a very super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>icial Division of my Book, he gives a
sutable Answer; and that you may know he was blinded with
Passion, he begins with downright Nonsense, and a notorious Lie.
I suppose there is scarcely any body but knows that the Faction did
brag of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's peaceable Restoration, as a Miracle and
Demonstration that God own'd his Title, (nay, Sir <hi>Geo. Macken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie,</hi>
Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 5. owns he was restored almost by universal Consent;)
and yet the Scribler alledges that he, and our subordinate Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
were forced to make Laws against the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi>
in their own Defence. Now it is certain that none have any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44963:15"/>
Power in <hi>Scotland</hi> but the King and Parliament; and by
subordinate Governours, he must therefore, if he understands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
mean the latter; and if so, it is plain that the Presbyterians
at that time attack'd neither, but had sufficiently smarted under the
Usurper for maintaining the Right of King and Parliament by the
Sword, and refusing to abjure <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> and the Lords, who
are a constituent part of our Parliament; so that neither of them
being attack'd, nor threatned to be attack'd, in Authority nor Person,
but on the contrary the Presbyterians being sworn to maintain
them, the pretence of a necessity to make Laws in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is a false excuse. But if our Author would speak Truth, he
should say, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Second having a Mind to break his Oath,
which he had taken solemnly, to maintain Presbytery and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Parliaments, and being secured, as he thought, <hi>in foro divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
by the Dispensation first of his Popish and then of his Episcopal
Priests, he must find some pretence to salve his Credit <hi>in foro huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
and so with his pack'd Parliament formed Iniquity into a Law.
Whether the said Laws were gentle, as our Author says, I leave it
to the Consideration of all thinking Men, who please to peruse them
as exhibited in my other Book. It seems indeed that the Prelates
thought them too gentle, and not extensive enough for them, when
they pressed Conformity in so barbarous a manner beyond the extent
of the said Laws, in so much that they were forced to extort Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
from the People that they had been civilly used, because they
knew they had exceeded the Law, and were liable to be called to an
account for it. One of the first Laws they made, was an unlimited
Oath of Allegiance, which swallowed up the Privileges of the People,
took away all the Suffrage of Parliaments as to the Succession of the
Crown, and establish'd a Despotical T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ranny, which this Author
calls the King's Hereditary Right: so infallibly true is it, that Tyranny
and our Scots Prelacy are inseparably connected, and such Brethren in
Iniquity, that the one is always productive of the other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as soon as he had deprived the People of their Native Rights, he
made bold to invade their Consciences, and contrary to his own Oath
and the Peoples Inclinations, brought in the abjured Prelates, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well that Tyranny could not subsist without them; and so
he supported them in their Lording it over the Peoples Consciences:
and they to requite their Creator, preach'd up his Divine
Right to Tyrannize over their Purses and Persons. And thus did
Tyranny and Prelacy, like two scabbed Jades, nab one another, till
they were both sent a packing by his present Majesty. Nor can I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44963:16"/>
omit to take notice of the natural Aversion which Prelacy has to a
lawful Government, it being visibly seen that not only our Scots
Prelates who were his Majesty's personal Enemies, but even the
English Prelates, most of whom pretended to be his Friends, were
and are jealous that the Destiny of their Hierarchy is at hand; for
every one knows how soll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>citous the Pillars of Prelacy were to club
at the Devil-Tavern to contrive means for the maintaining their
Hierarchy, and how to fetter his Majesty with Oaths not to touch
it: and after they had got this Assurance once, they were not satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ied,
but dunn'd his Majesty as if he had been their Debtor, for a Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Promises, till he took notice of it, and told them he was
very willing to lay hold on every opportunity of renewing his Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to maintain the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or words to that Effect.
So that it is evident beyond Exception, that Prelacy is afraid when
they see Popery touch'd; and that they are jealous that our Dread
Soveraign, whom God has raised to break the Horns of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Carpenters, should also prove the Bane of the Pope's
Journey-men, the Prelates; and hence it is that they behold his
Majesty's glorious Success with Jealousy, which all the rest of the
Protestant World looks upon with Joy.</p>
            <p>So that their Convocation when assembled, were very loth to give
his Majesty Thanks; and when they did, could hardly be brought to
thank him for what he had done for the Protestant Interest in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but only for playing the Bugbear to frighten away K. <hi>Iames,</hi>
who began to bring in their elder Brethren the Papists to be sharers
of the Fat with themselves; and lest we should doubt what this
Church of <hi>England</hi> is, which they are so mightily tender of, they
informed us in an Address of Thanks to the King for the Care he
had taken of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Alteration which was
then made in the Lieutenancy of <hi>London,</hi> and that was for putting
in some of the Bloody Juries, and those who had betrayed
the Charter of the City, and were the Tools to promote Tyranny.
Now this being matter of Fact and undeniable, the moderate Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men
see what they must expect if that Faction
get the Ascendant once more: it's not their Agreement in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Ceremonies that will give them a true Title to be Sons of
the Church; <hi>Gibellins</hi> they are, and as <hi>Gibellins</hi> they must die. The
Murder of my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Alderman <hi>Cornish,</hi> and many others,
are sad Proofs of what I assert; and seeing the moderate Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men
and the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> were fellow-Sufferers
in the late Reigns, now that we have Men advanced to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44963:16"/>
the highest Dignity of the Church, whose Repute for Moderation did not
a little contribute towards it, methinks it is but what their Brethren in
<hi>Scotland</hi> might expect, that they should be so far from countenancing our
runnagate Episcopal Clergy in their malicious Clamours at Court, that
they ought to oppose them, especially considering that they were such
Implements as the late Reigns found very subservient to their Designs of
bringing Slavery upon us, under which they themselves smarted either in
Person or Sympathy. And now that I am upon it, I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
with regret, that notwithstanding of the almost indispensable nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ssi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, the sober Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men in their Ecclesiastical Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
have never given any publick conjunct Testimony against the Tyranny
of the last Reigns, nor those of their Communion, who were Abettors
of it, and at this day labour to re-introduce it. Let them think what
they will, their Silence in this Affair is no small incouragement to the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite
Party, who have hitherto baffled the discovery of all their Plots, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of Zeal for the Church, which together with the ill Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Nonjurant Bishops and Clergy, hath been of more use to the
French King, than an Army of 60000 Men: From this Source it is that
his Majesty's Affairs meet with so many Rubs; his Friends are so far from
being rewarded, that they are endangered and discouraged; and yet our
moderate Ecclesiasticks have never made open and conjunct Protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. It was the Saying of the God of Truth, <hi>That the Children of
this Generation are wiser than the Children of Light;</hi> and our Times fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us with many sad Instances of its undeniable Verity. Did not the
Pulpits in the late Reigns thunder against all Attempts of recovering our
Liberties, either in the Parliament or in the Field? Did not the Church
concur with her Excommunications, to render Dissenters uncapable of so
much as chusing or giving Votes for a sober Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Man,
who would stand by the Liberties of his Country to represent them in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?
Did not some of their Bishops press the Execution of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws against Dissenters, to keep them under Hatches for that very
reason? And did not the Clergy spend their consecrated Lungs in bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out Presbyterian Plots to drown the Popish ones? And yet now they
don't excommunicate their Jacobites, notwithstanding of their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
and distinct Form of Worship; their clubbing to chuse Enemies to
the Government to represent them in Parliament, even those who were
violent Enemies to the Abdication; as Sir <hi>R. S. &amp;c.</hi> who was chosen by
by the University of <hi>Câ€”ge.</hi> Nor do the Pulpits now sound with Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
Plots in this Reign, as they did with Presbyterian and Whiggish
Plots in the late Reigns; which, together with the tenderness that hath
been shewed towards their Nonjurant Bishops and Clergy, and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44963:17"/>
they make to abjuring the late K. <hi>Iames,</hi> are sufficient Evidences
that it is his Majesty's Interest to keep up the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi>
as a Ballance, lest the Scale turn on the side of K. <hi>Iames,</hi> or his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Son: And as for our Scots Episcopalians, their Loyalty was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
discovered after the Defeat of the French by Sea; for none
were so industrious as they to lessen our Victory, when God had given
it us. Nor was their Carriage less remarkable for disaffection upon the
taking of <hi>Namur,</hi> the first News from <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> and when the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
came that <hi>Charleroy</hi> was besieged; which so elevated the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Dr. <hi>Mâ€”,</hi> the Apologist, and <hi>Sheelds</hi> the Jacobite Parson,
(lately in <hi>Newgate</hi> for a Conventicle) that they were overheard to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
one another, in the <hi>Park,</hi> with no less Titles than that of <hi>My Lord
Bishop</hi> of such and such a Place, so big were they with hopes of the French
Conquests.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 86. Our Author not having time enough to recover himself
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rom the Undecencies of his Passion, continues his Nonsense, and
tells you very gravely, That <hi>if the Presbyterian Delusions did not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Turns prompt them to overturn the Government, they might live
in</hi> Scotland <hi>in all Peace, as other Dissenters did.</hi> I suppose our Author
to be speaking of the Time past; and if so, then he should have said,
<hi>might have lived:</hi> And whether this Blunder of Grammar, in his
own Mother-Tongue, be not as unpardonable in him, as are the
Blunders in Latin which he falsly chargeth upon Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> let any
Man judg; and that he meant of the Time past, needs no other
Demonstration, than to consider that the Presbyterians do and can
live at Peace in <hi>Scotland</hi> now, without being obliged to the Prelatists.
But Nonsense is one of our Author's least Indecencies of Passion; for
they who know him, inform me, that in his Heat he cannot forbear
Swearing, notwithstanding of his Doctoral Scarf: And it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on him, that when talking to a certain Minister about the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> one of the good-natur'd Doctor's commendable Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were, That <hi>if the Episcopal Party had it not, he car'd not if the Devil
had it.</hi> Well, but to proceed, the Doctor acknowledges, that
other Dissenters liv'd peaceably in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now other Dissenters
we had none, but <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papists;</hi> and that they liv'd peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
we very well knew, and used to ask why they persecuted us
more than them, seeing their Difference in Principles was much
greater, if our Episcopalians had been (as they pretended to be)
good Protestants. Now I think every one knows the Principles and
Practices of the Papists to be dangerous in all Protestant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that Quakerism has too great affinity with Popery: so
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44963:17"/>
that their kind Treatment, while we were barbarously persecuted,
is none of the best Arguments to prove our Episcopalians good
Protestants. And pray let our Author in his next, give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
Why Popish Recusants (for denying the King's Ecclesiasli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Supremacy) were not dragoon'd to come to Church, plundred,
hunted, and hanged, as we were. But seeing I know he will not
tell the Truth, I'le venture to tell it for him, in Bishop <hi>Carnerosse</hi>'s
words, <hi>The Papists were their necessary Friends:</hi> A King of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was dropping ripe to fall into the Throne; and every one
knows, that under Popery, Bishops may grow Cardinals and Popes;
but under Presbytery they cannot exist: and this is the Rope which
draws the Inclinations of our Hierarchical Men so much towards
<hi>Rome,</hi> instead of drawing <hi>Rome</hi> so much to them. If I be mistaken,
let the Advances which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made upon us, and the
Interest they obtain'd in Court and else-where, under the warm
Wings of Prelacy, in the Reigns of both the <hi>Charles</hi>'s, and the last
of the <hi>Iames</hi>'s bear witness. Nay, our good-natur'd Doctor was
even so kind to Mother-Church, as to impose on his Scholars an
Oath in K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Time, to maintain the blank Christian Religion,
and to hinder the publishing of Mr. <hi>Iamison</hi>'s Book against Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism;
yet his Rancor against Presbytery was so great, though
the Malice of the Court seem'd to be asswaged, that when the
Presbyterians desired they might have the Common Hall of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
(of which he was then Principal) to meet in, he answered,
like a scurrilous and spightful Villain, That <hi>his Hall should never be
a groping Office.</hi> Indeed, Doctor, I am very well satisfied, that if
any such things had been practis'd at our Meetings, the Episcopal
Clergy would never have been their Enemies; for very sure I am,
that the greatest Swearers, Drunkards and Whoremasters of the
Parish, were generally the greatest Friends to the Curats: And
Arch-bishop <hi>Paterson,</hi> whose Champion you are, may for ever stop
your Mouth, seeing <hi>Megg Patterson,</hi> with whom he had been base,
own'd it before the Court upon Examination. And your other
good Friend, Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> whom you are so careful to vindicate,
would certainly have been a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>requenter of such groping Offices, had
there been any, seeing he was not ashamed, upon a certain Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to declare, That he hated all words which ended in <hi>ism,</hi> except
<hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Priapism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor having dropt out a feeble and a faint Lie, to justify
the making of the Laws against us, <hi>Vices acquirit eundo;</hi> and, <hi>ibid.</hi>
tells you boldly, That <hi>the Scheme of the Presbyterian Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44963:18"/>
they differ from the Episcopalians, is nothing but ungovernable Humour
and Rebellion.</hi> Well said, good-natur'd Doctor, who is a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
from good Nature and the Christian Church now? Modest Sir,
I must b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>g your pardon to say, that you are either an ungovernable
passionate Prelate, or the King and Parliament are stark Fools and
Knaves to have abolished Episcopacy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, according
to you, they must have establish'd nothing but ungovernable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Rebellion. Certainly his Majesty and the Parliament are
more concerned to preserve the Soveraignty, than such Fellows as
you; and if they had not been satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ied that the Presbyterians
were better Friends to it than the Prelatists, they would never have
establish'd them, and ejected the other.</p>
            <p>Pray, Sir, if your Eyes be not blinded with Passion, look upon
the Harmony of Confessions, and see whether ours or yours (if
you know where to find your own) be most agreeable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Christian Church; and then, if you please, look a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into their Discipline, and if it do not provoke you to Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Passion, read <hi>1 Tim. 4. 14. 2 Tim. 3. Acts 20. 28, 29. Acts 15.
Titus 1. Phil.</hi> 1. 1. and see which of us are the greatest Separatists
from the Christian Church, and whether those Texts be chargeable
with ungovernable Humour and Rebellion; and so long as those
Texts make it evident that Bishop and Presbyter are the same in
Name and Office, not so much as <hi>Ordinatione excepta,</hi> if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable
Humour and Rebellion to believe so, we will be ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
and rebellious still. As for your citing the <hi>Hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing particular in any of them, especially the <hi>Hind let loose,</hi> which
was writ against Presbyterians as well as Prelatists, none but one
of your own Kidney can charge them upon the Presbyterians in
general. But further, it's mighty strange that this Principle should
be so Criminal in us, and yet Venial in the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men.
Wherefore do not you cite <hi>Iulian the Apostate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hickeringil,</hi> or
Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
And pray let us know why the Presbyterians are more

with those?</p>
            <p>The Author will not take notice of what has been so often told
him and his Party, that the horrid Cruelties exercis'd upon the
Presbyterians in the West, as dragging them to hear the Curates
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44963:18"/>
               <hi>per</hi> Force; plundering them of all they had; ravishing their Wives,
Daughters and Maids; chasing them to the Woods and Mountains
in the extremity of Winter; denying the poor Children left at
home, any other subsistance than what was left by the surfeited
Dogs; the tying of Gentlemen Neck and Heels, and rosting them
before Fires, without so much as allowing them a draught of Water
to quench their insupportable Thirst; forcing of Bonds from them
for such and such Sums; and extorting Certificates, after all this,
under their Hands, that they had been civilly used. I say, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
will not hear, when we tell them, that all this was done before
they could charge us with any Insurrection; and yet are so disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
as to instance our pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>eriour Efforts for Self-defence, as the
Occasion of all severe Laws: Than which nothing can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just;
and by the Doctor's own confession, <hi>Pag.</hi> 87. That <hi>the King
and his Ministers of State, might more plausibly be accused of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if they made severe Laws against the Consequences of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Opinions.</hi> We have reason to charge the King and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
with Cruelty: for such Laws as were made before 1666, were
directly against the supposed Consequences of our Opinions, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for we made no opposition by Arms at that time against
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second. Nay, it is expresly own'd, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5, and 6, by
Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie,</hi> That <hi>the Laws were made against the Consequences
which they pretend to charge upon our Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return again, <hi>P.</hi> 86. he alledges, That <hi>the Presbyterians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
open War against the King in his own Dominions; preach'd to their
Hearers, that they ought to kill his Servants; that he had no right to the
Crown, because he had broken the Covenant:</hi> Than which nothing can be
more false. It was but a small number of the Presbyterians that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in Arms in 1666; and they were so far from declaring
War against the King, that they only desired a Redress of those
Grievances which the Episcopal Souldiers had committed beyond
Law. Nor would they have done it in Arms, if it had been possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have had access to the Council otherwise: For those who
appeared at <hi>Bothwel-Bridg,</hi> they were so far from declaring against
the King, that they took his Interest into their Declaration; and
the Party who oppos'd it, were so much di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>relish'd, that Multitudes
deserted because they were concerned. Nay, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second
was so much convinc'd, that Mr. <hi>Iohn Welch,</hi> and the majority of
the Presbyterians, were so far from disputing his Title, that he
granted an Indulgence immediately after the suppressing of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
and to my certain knowledg, offer'd a particular
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44963:19"/>
Licence to the said Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> to live and preach in any part of his
Dominions; though our Episcopalians had formerly incens'd him so
much against him, that Proclamations were issued, offering 500 <hi>l.</hi> to
any that would bring him in dead or alive.</p>
            <p>So that the Doctor has no Foundation for his Charge but the
Practice of a few <hi>Cameronians,</hi> one of whose Preachers excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
the King, and about twenty of the Faction declared War
against him at <hi>Sanqhuar;</hi> and such a little number did afterwards
pretend to dethrone him: which will appear to all Men but such as
our Author, to be contrary to Presbyterian Principles, seeing we
allow not so much as Excommunication of a private Person without
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>udicial Probation, Admonition, Suspension, and the Consent of
the Presbytery. And, by the Covenant which they reproach us with
as our only Rule, we swear to maintain the Privilege of Parliaments,
and the King's just Powerand Greatness; to which nothing can be
more diametrically opposite, than for a few Persons, without the
Consent and Commission of the whole, to take upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctorate
Magistrates. And whatsoever this Libeller may suggest,
it's known that Mr. <hi>Castares,</hi> sen. Mr. <hi>Blare,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iamison,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Riddel,</hi> and other grave Presbyterian Ministers, fell under the
Obloquy of the <hi>Cameronians</hi> for protesting publickly against the
Principles which they were driven unto by the furious Tyranny of
the late Reigns.</p>
            <p>But if the Doctor be not yet satisfied, I'll give him <hi>Argumentum ad
Hominem,</hi> thus. The Viscount of <hi>Dundee</hi> and his Party declared
War against King <hi>William,</hi> and all the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> oppos'd
his Title to the Crown: <hi>Ergo,</hi> All the Episcopalians in <hi>Scotland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
War against him, and that he had no right to the Crown;
and therefore by their own Concession, the present Government
would be justified to enact as severe Laws against them, as the late
Government did against the Presbyterians. The Premisses being
undeniable, the Conclusion cannot be avoided, if our Author's way
of arguing hold good.</p>
            <p>But supposing it true that all the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> had
declared King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>orfeited his Right to the
Crown because he broke the Covenant, it had been no more than
what the Church of <hi>England</hi> have declared against King <hi>Iames,</hi>
because of his breaking the Original Contract: and I would desire
our Gentleman to look upon the <hi>Claim of Right</hi> by both Nations,
and he will find that most of the Infractions upon that Contract
were made by King <hi>Charles;</hi> so that if this be a Crime, <hi>Aethiopem
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44963:19"/>
albus, Loripidem rectus derideat.</hi> But as for that malicious Lie, that
any of them preach'd that his Servants ought to be killed, it's so
gross, that none but the Author could invent it, nor any but his
Party believe it: for tho some of them did kill A. Bp <hi>Sharp,</hi> and others
who were hunting for their Lives, and took the same advantage
of them that they did of others; it will not so much as follow,
that any of their Ministers preach'd this as their Duty, and much
less that it was so to kill the King's Servants as such.</p>
            <p>Well, but this Methodical Doctor, who would sain perswade the
World that he and his Party have engrossed all Reason and Logick
to themselves, comes with a <hi>Hysteron Proteron,</hi> and tells you of the
Presbyterians Cruelty toward the Episcopalians after the Year 1637,
which (mark the good-natur'd calm Expression) he says were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd
in History, as they were diabolical in their Nature.
This is Scots Episcopal Veracity. The Doctor thinks he is dictating
to his Scholars; and truly I must tell his Doctorship, that if he
ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ght them no better Philosophy, than he teaches us History, they
had but a poor Bargain on't. But now, good Doctor, did you never
read of the Massacres at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi>
Butchery in the <hi>Netherlands?</hi> We shall not go so high as the ten
Persecutions, or those against the <hi>Wicklevites, Waldenses,</hi> &amp;c. And
tell me if what Cruelties were exercised upon you about 1637, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
them as much as you can do in any measure, come near
them; and if they do, as I am sure they cannot, I would know
whether the Modest, Rational and Religious Doctor be not guilty
of an Immodest, Irrational and Irreligious Lie? And in the next
place, seeing we must go back to 1637, pray what did your Party
then suffer answerable to the Persecution of the Presbyterians by
your <hi>High Commission-Court</hi> before that time? Or, did your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
come any thing near the horrid Cruelty which <hi>Montross</hi> with
his <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, who join'd him after they had
massacred the Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> committed upon the Country
in Defence of your Prelacy? But further, if your Party did suffer
any thing at that time, as it was impossible but they should when
the exasperated People had taken Arms against their Invasions both
of Church and State, and the Quarrel came to be decided by the
Sword, who was to blame for it? They drew it upon themselves,
they would not be satisfied that they had obtruded their domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prelacy, but they must also impose a new form of Worship, for
opposing of which they incensed the King to raise an Army of
30000 Men to force it upon us. So that here was Precedent enough
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44963:20"/>
according to the <hi>Talion Law,</hi> to force the Covenant upon them,
which yet we never did in that manner, tho the honest Doctor has
the Confidence to assert, that we imposed it with greater Tyranny,
Malice and Violence, than the Fathers of the Inquisition ever
practised. Good Mr. Doctor, (for you were very angry that I did
not call you so in my last) Did your Doctorship ever hear that we
put the Prelatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s in Dungeons to be eaten up with Toads and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents?
Did we ever put any of them upon the Rack? Did we ever
thrust pieces of Cloth down their Throats to their very Stomachs,
and pull them up again? Did we ever burn them in Habits painted
with Devils? Did we ever twist the Muscles of their Arms and
Legs with Cords, which your Fathers of the Inquisition are known
to have practised? Or, did we ever torture them with the Boot,
Thummikins, or burning Matches (as your Brethren of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
Inquisition did us) to make them take the Covenant? I am
confident your Conscience, tho pros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ituted to a Prodigy, flies in your
Face, and gives you the Lie. Well, but the Doctor has not done
yet, he tells you the Covenant was imposed upon the Children at
Schools. Truly Mr. Doctor, to do you Justice, I believe it was
required of the little Children that offered to take Degrees of
Master of Arts: and tho your Doctorship was never nearer <hi>Rome</hi>
than 480 Miles, as you say in your <hi>Postscript,</hi> you have learn'd the
Art of equivocating as well as if you had been there; for every
one knows that Men of thirty Years old may truly enough be called
Children, and Universities may as well be called Schools: But if
that was unlawful, how came your Party to follow the Example,
and even your own Doctorship to offer a blank Oath to your
Scholars? And why does the Church of <hi>England</hi> impose Oaths upon
Children at Schools in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridg?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 87. He says there's nothing in the first part of the <hi>Answer</hi> to
the <hi>Scotch Eloquence,</hi> but an ill-contriv'd Abstract of the <hi>Hind

that you and others of your Party are notorious Liars, in
asserting that our Proceedings against you are more barbarous and
cruel than yours against us, and that by Authentick Proofs, <hi>viz.</hi>
your own Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Next the Doctor tells us that the Episcopalians publish'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium

and was writ in the height of a Schism, and never own'd

the true Presbyterian Principles, though I have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
that the excommunicating and exauctorating the King was
contrary to our Discipline and Covenant. But to answer the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenous
Man with <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> I argue thus: There
can be no better Defence of the Proceedings of the Presbyterians
against the Prelatists, than <hi>Dundee</hi>'s Declaration, their refusing to
swear Allegiance, and pray for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
seeing those who do so, act more consequentially to the Prelatical
Principles of Passive Obedience and Nonresistance, than those who
comply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> He tells us, That if the Ministers of State under K. <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second in <hi>Scotland,</hi> have done nothing but what all wise, great and
good Men have done in the like Cases, then the Clamours of this
Party are rather an Honour than an Accusation. This is poor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,
Doctor; we deny your Assumption, and by course your
Consequence must fall, which is an Answer sufficient; but to be
plainer with you, If King <hi>Charles</hi> and his Ministers of State did
nothing but what all wise, great and good Men have done in the
like cases; then his present Majesty and the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>
must, by this Argument, be foolish, little and ill Men, to disapprove
their Methods: so that we see how superlatively loyal and modest
the Doctor is. But yet further: We would have his Doctorship
to know that there was never such a Case under Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Doctor will be at a loss to find good, great and wise Men
for Precedents. Ay, let him turn over all the Histories of <hi>Europe,</hi>
give us a Parallel, that any Protestant Prince should solemnly before
God and the People, swear with his Hands lifted up to Heaven,
that he would govern according to the Terms on which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> The Preservation of the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Privileges of Parliament; declaring that he was
under no Constraint to take the said Oath, but that he did the
same voluntarily and without Mental Reservation; acknowledging
the Sins of his Family, and promising a Redress of Grievances:
I say, let him give us an Instance of any Protestant Prince that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44963:21"/>
ever perjur'd himself in such a manner, and requited Subjects
as he did us, tho we own'd his Title, defended him against the
Usurper who had cut off his Father's Head, and exposed our selves
to ruine for his sake: for reward of which, immediately after his
Restauration, he overturn'd our Civil and Religious Liberty, cut
off the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>'s Head, who had set the Crown upon his;
and afterwards enacted Laws to make the People own the abjur'd
Prelates, and involve them in the same Perjury with himself, and
because they could not not in Conscience do it, sent Forces to take
free Quarter upon them, drive or drag them to Church, destroy
their Substance, and treat their Persons in that barbarous manner
as before related, tho many of them advanced, and none of them
opposed his Restauration, nor threatned any Disturbance to his
Government. But the truth of the Case was, he and his Ministers
of State knew well enough that he had forfeited his Right to the
Crown, and that the Presbyterians could not but in Heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
his Perjury; and therefore they were resolved to put them out
of condition to demand the Forfeiture, if ever they should happen
to be so minded: which that poor People were so far from, that
not one of those whom mere Necessity had constrained to take
Arms at <hi>Pentland,</hi> or <hi>Bothwell-Bridg,</hi> denied his Title; but on the
contrary, still own'd him. And for that small inconsiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that acted otherwise at <hi>Sanqhuar,</hi> &amp;c. it's already demonstrated,
that they neither proceeded according to our Principles, nor with
our Consent: And therefore, so long as there are any Records in our
Nation, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's unparallell'd Perjury, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to his Subjects, and Tyrannical Government can never be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
And as for the Rebellions he charges us with under King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First, let any body peruse <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Collections, or
even Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Chronicle; and tho all the Truth be not
written there, it will be easy to perceive that the Innovations made
upon the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Invasions on the Liberties of
<hi>England,</hi> were the cause of that Prince's Misfortunes, who was
misled by a Popish Wife, and misinformed by Popish and Prelatical
Ministers to his Ruine. That unfortunate King put one Affront
on our Nation<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> mentioned by Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> that was enough
of it self to have made them shake off his Government, <hi>viz.</hi> the
demanding of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be brought hither for him
to be crowned with, which argued such a Degeneracy of Spirit,
and so much of an alienated Mind from his Native Country, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a wonder how ever Scots-Men should have own'd him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44963:21"/>
the greatest Monarch that ever sat upon the English Throne;
would have gone as far as <hi>Scoon,</hi> and thank'd us too, to have had the
Honour of it; and for a Scots-Man so far to undervalue his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, as to demand the poor, and almost the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Badg of their Honour, Antiquity and Independency, to be
brought into another Nation, <hi>Quis talia fando temperet aâ€”Ne
quid aspersus dicam.</hi> Certainly nothing but an exuberant Loyalty
and Esteem for their natural Prince, whom doubtless they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as over-ruled by pernicious Counsel, could ever have made
that Kingdom put up the Affront. And therefore when he persisted
to oppress and persecute them upon the account of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
it was no wonder that they re-assum'd the Spirit of their
Ancestors; and let him know that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were never
allowed an Arbitrary Power, nor did ever any of them usurp it,
but it prov'd fatal to them or theirs: Nor never was the Nation
so much degenerate but since the Reign of our Protestant Prelacy,
who were the Creatures and Supporters of Tyranny; for in the
times of Popery we had more Grandees than we have now, that
could tell how to put the Bell about the Cat's Neck on occasion, as
<hi>Archbald Douglas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> did to King <hi>Iames</hi> the Third; but
since the Union of the Crowns, the fall of our Grandees, and the
Combination of the English and Scots Mitres, Scots-Men durst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
say their Head was their own but when they had the Sword in
their Hand, except it be under this present Government. And
therefore the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> is mightily obliged to Prelacy.</p>

<hi>pouring in,</hi> and in this sense I'll maintain it, that it's more
proper to be applied to our Drunken Prelatists, than in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

who pretended to other Revelations than the written Word for
their Rule, such as our <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the old German <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> or
<hi>absit verbo invidia,</hi> our Prelatists, who build more upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and superstitious Writings ascribed to some of the Fathers,
than on the Writings of the Apostles, who are the Grandfathers;
or on the <hi>Rationale</hi> of a <hi>Durandus,</hi> or the Poetical Whims of any

Revelation, which orders us to worship God as he commands,
and not as we think good in our own Eyes. Then seeing the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytÃ©rians
do plead for a strict Conformity to the Scripture as the
Rule of Faith and Manners; and that our Prelatists admit of By-Rules,
for which no Reason can be assigned, but the <hi>Capricio</hi> of some
fanciful Bigot, or corrupted Father; let the World judg which
Party is most chargeable with Enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> He says, That <hi>the Acts of our General Assemblies do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vindicate</hi> Charles <hi>the Second, and his Ministers of State, from any
shadow of Rigour or Cruelty.</hi> It were easy to answer the Doctor in
his own Coin, that the knavish Address of the Scots Bishops against
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> their opposing him in Parliament, and the
Barbarities committed upon the Presbyterians by the Prelatists, as
above related, are sufficient to vindicate us from any shadow of
Rigour or Cruelty, which must, by all Men who have not forfeited
Sense and Reason, be allowed more than a sufficient Answer. But
further, the Doctor would have done well to have cited those Acts,
and then a more particular Answer could have been given: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I'le guess at his meaning, and suppose them to be such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
against imploying Malignants in Places of Power and Trust;
which was the Opinion of those called <hi>Remonstrators:</hi> And if so,
pray, good Doctor, why is this more culpable than your Church-of-<hi>England.</hi>
Test, which excludes all Dissenters from Places of Power
and Trust; and that also against his Majesty's Desire, in his Speech
to the Parliament, wherein he did rationally insinuate, that the
taking off of the same, would unite his Subjects in his Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Common Enemy? If the Copy was bad, why does the
Church of <hi>England</hi> follow it? Or, do you not think that we had
as much reason to keep out Prelatists from Places of Power and
Trust, as you have to keep out Presbyterians? Nay, I do verily
believe, there is no true English-man, or Protestant, who does not
see the Mischief which happens daily by the continuance of this
Test, which obliges his Majesty to make use of such as do betray
him continually. And whether the Scots Presbyterians were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in their Conjectures, that our Prelatists, when admitted into
Trust, would betray our Religion and Liberties, let the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and the Causes of it, testify. Or, if there was any such
Act made or intended, by any Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
as disown'd <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> the Head of the Malignants, because of
his breach of Covenant, and designs to enslave the Nation; it must
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be own'd, that they were too clear-sighted, and that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44963:22"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi> do the same in relation to K. <hi>Iames,</hi> who had as
good a Right to the Crown, according to the Prelatical Principles,
as ever his Brother had; and, if Passive Obedience be a true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
ought as little to have been opposed as he. Then suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it true, that the Remonstrators were against owning of him on
the Accounts aforesaid; yet seeing they were not the majority of
the Presbyterians, and were willing to submit to his Legal Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
swear Allegiance, and live peaceably under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

neither Reason nor Conscience will justify his Proceedings
against the Presbyterians in general on that Account; or the making
of Laws on purpose to fret their Consciences, and press the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in such a barbarous manner as must unavoidably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Insurrections, when they submitted to him without the least
Opposition. Sure I am, the Church of <hi>England</hi> are more moderate
to the Jacobites, when they won't so much as admit of an Oath of

impartially, I would wish them to consider, that there is a Woe

            <p>I confess I do not at all wonder that Sir <hi>G. M.</hi> should defend a

Ketch</hi>'s) Journyman, or as he call'd himself, <hi>Calumniator publicus,</hi>
and the common Libeller of the Presbyterians; so that of necessity
he must represent them as Monsters, else he must own himself a
bloody Butcher in prosecuting them at such a rate as he did.</p>
            <p>But further, Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Arguments are all built upon a false Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of Matter of Fact; nor could a truer Relation be expected
from a Man of his Kidney, who prostituted his Conscience, not
only to different Parties in the Church, but contrary Factions in
the State: Let not the Scribler tax me as not generous for saying
so, seeing it is true; for it can be no more a Crime in me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
Sir <hi>G.</hi> after his Death, than for him to attaque Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
and others, who are also in their Graves. His Subornation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> and Sir <hi>Geo. Campbel,</hi> was charged on him to his
Face in open Court, by the Persons whom he had suborned. And
in like manner it can be proved, that he suborned others against
<hi>Halside;</hi> and did actually prosecute <hi>Blackwood,</hi> for a pretended
Crime, whereof he himself was guilty, <hi>viz.</hi> conversing with Mr.
<hi>Wilson</hi> a <hi>Bothwel-Bridg</hi>-Man, for which he aim'd at the Gentleman's
Life and Estate: so that no Reason will allow the Testimony of
one who was so much a Party, and notoriously unjust, no more
than we could allow the Calumnies of Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> against the
Protestants, whose Blood he shed and thirsted after.</p>
            <p>Nor are the <hi>Presbyterian Nurslings,</hi> as he calls them, so much gauled
by Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Book as he supposes; and the unwary Doctor himself
owns what I asserted, that the Reasonings in the Treatise relate to
the Papers publish'd by the <hi>Cameronians,</hi> which shows how unfair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sir <hi>George</hi> argued, to instance Actions of Men rendred mad by a
barbarous execution of <hi>Cannibal</hi> Laws, to defend the making of
those very Laws.</p>
            <p>As for the Honour he alledges I do the Faction, in mentioning
some Great Men as Persecutors, much good may it do them: for if,
according to the Learned Doctor's Argument, Quality, Sense and
Interest cast the Ballance, then certainly <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
were too heavy for the Apostles and Primitive Christians;
and that great Monster, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. has much the better of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Subjects. Well, but the Doctor says afterward, <hi>They have
reason to glory in their Parts, Honour and Integrity;</hi> which is none of
my Business to question. But the Instances they are charged with,
will come under none of those Heads, and therefore the Doctor's
Panegyrick is foreign to the purpose. But we can easily answer,
that their Majesties and present Parliament, have declared the very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44963:24"/>
Laws, which were yet more torelable than their barbarous Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Wicked and Impious; and I hope the modest Doctor will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that they have Quality, Sense and Interest enough to cast the
Ballance. I shall only add, that Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie,</hi> by a Concession,
<hi>Pag. 17.</hi> destroys his own Hypothesis; for there he owns that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Ministers, who were sent to reclaim these Criminals,
and Presbyterian Jurors who were summoned to their Trial, seldom
failed of condemning them: so that <hi>from his own Mouth he gives
himself and the Doctor both the Lie, when they charge those Principles
upon the Presbyterians in general, and consequently discover the falshood
of that Necessity, which they pretend the Government was under, to make
such Laws against us in their own Defence.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. Sir <hi>George</hi> says, That <hi>the Heretable Iudges,</hi> i. e. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Sheriffs, refused to put the Laws in execution against Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
by which they became formidable.</hi> Which destroys two more of
his and the Faction's Assertions, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Presbyterianism: was not
popular, and that none but the Rabble were their Friends;</hi> for those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Sheriffs are the best and most ancient Families generally
in every County: So that Sir <hi>George</hi> wrongs his Cause exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by that Concession, seeing those Hereditary Judges living upon
the Place, and being acquainted with the Industry and Honesty of
the persecuted Party, would not abandon their Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to become Hangmen to their Neighbours and Tenants. And
therefore the Court being resolved to ruin the Country, imployed
bloody cut-throat Papists, as the Earl of <hi>Airly</hi> and Laird of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum,</hi>
and their barbarous Savages the Popish Highlanders. But
according to the natural disingenuity of his Faction, he takes no
notice, that those Military Judges pull'd the Hereditary Sheriffs
from off their Benches, and would not let them proceed against
the Presbyterians according to the Statute-Law, because that
was too mild in their Opinion. One remarkable Instance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was at <hi>Selkirk,</hi> where <hi>Meldrum</hi> pull'd <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> who is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Sheriff of the Forest (now a Lord of the Session) out
of his Chair, when holding his Court.</p>
            <p>Another of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Defences are, the alledged Severity to
the Cavaliers in <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Time: Which if true, though
there's no reason to take his Word for Proof, he could not but
know the truth of that Maxim, <hi>Inter Arma silent Leges;</hi> and that
this could not justify the Dragooning of People to Church, and
taking free Quarter in time of Peace. But Sir <hi>George,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Kingdom with bloody Murders and barbarous Villanies.</p>
            <p>I have neither time, nor is it consistent with my present Design,
to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>madvert any further upon his pretended unanswerable Book;
but I think any honest Reader will be satisfied that it needs no worse
Character, than to be stigmatiz'd as a flat Contradiction to their
Majesties and the present Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being a sophistical
and unfair Relation of Matters of Fact, to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that all those Grievances have been false, which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
complain'd of, his Majesty declared against, and founded the
Justice of his Expedition upon their Redress: So that it will issue
in this, either that Sir <hi>George Mackenzy</hi> is a Liar, or that his Majesty
and the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> are such; and therefore, good
Mr. Doctor, I am not afraid to appeal to the Judgment of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested
Persons, whether it be you or I that are most void of
Generosity, Honour, Modesty and common Sense, of all which you
deprive me in the <hi>89<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> Page of your Libel. So that tho the Ass may
vapour a while in the Lion's Skin, the Ears of the dull Brute will
discover him at last. And thus our Doctor has wounded his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to Loyalty, by defending Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <p>But allowing all to be true that Sir <hi>George</hi> alledges as the Cause of
our Persecution by <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; I say still, that the Faction
deserves to be more severely treated by this Government upon the
very Parallel, <hi>viz.</hi> thus; They own Passive Obedience to be true
Doctrine, and were as much sworn to that as we were to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
so that if they believe that Doctrine, they must needs look
upon their present Majesties to have no just Title, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged to rebel. Now Malice it self could never fasten any
such Consequence upon the Covenant as to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
Title: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Passive Obedience must be more dangerous to this,
than the Covenant was to that Government. But the Doctor turns
his back, and takes no notice of this Argument, only magisterially
tells you, that if there be no more in the case than Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the Government needs not be afraid: Tho every body but
the Faction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hose Interest it is to dissemble the Consequences of their
Principles, sees the contrary by Demonstration from the Practices
of the Nonjurant Bishops, the high Church-of-<hi>England</hi> Zealots, and the
Scots Rebellions. 2. The Episcopal Party disown the Presbyterian
Ministers, and won't hear them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> by Sir <hi>George Mackenzy</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44963:25"/>
they should be dragoon'd to Church, and with much more
reason than they dragoon'd us; for there's nothing in our way of
Worship but what they practis'd themselves; nor can they object
against our Form of Government, for they had it in conjunction
with their own Episcopacy. Then seeing we neither do nor desire
that they should be persecuted on account of their Dissent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they or we most moderate? All the difference is, that there
are no Laws against their Nonconformity as there were against ours:
which I grant to be true; and hence we can demonstrate Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Moderation, that the Parliament did not make any Laws against
the Consequences of Prelatical and Passive-Obedience-Principles,
tho the Prelatists made Laws against ours; and sure I am, we had
much more reason to have made Laws against them, who did actually
oppose and rebel against his present Majesty while the Parliament
was sitting, and yet no such thing was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Allegation, that our Moderation proceeds from the opposite Biass of
the Nobility and Gentry; it shows his Ingratitude: but all Men of
sense must needs be convinced that the Parliament, who settled
Presbyteria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 91. He owns that the Author of the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
has perhaps been unwary as to some Stories, which need Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
Well said, Doctor, <hi>perhaps unwary,</hi> when I have made
it evident from his own words that he contradicts himself; but the
Inconsistencies I charge him with, you say you have no Inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ination
to examine; and truly I believe it, because you know they are true.
And whereas you say there is not one good Consequence in my
Book: pray let's hear what you can say in your next to avoid the
dint of the Consequences there deduced, and here repeated, to
prove your Party in general, Liars, Persecuters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd
Doctor being sorry that he has done us so much fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>our as
to grant that his Friend was unwary as to some Stories, retracts
immediately, and tells you, <hi>there are multitudes of true Stories against
us of that nature, and believes that there was no Injury done us in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
that Book.</hi> Well argued, <hi>wary Doctor;</hi> you own that your
Friend was <hi>unwary</hi> in publishing Stories which needed Confirmation,
tho he delivered them all as positive Proofs, and yet say he did
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44963:25"/>
us no Wrong. So that I perceive, according to your Episcopal
Conscience, a Breach of the Ninth Commandment is no Injury.
But Doctor, seeing you have given your Friend the Lie, e'en box
it among you till you box one another's Ears. But in truth,
Doctor, he has no reason to be angry with you, seeing you give your
self the Lie as well as him: for <hi>Pag.</hi> 91. you say that you believe
the Presbyterians had no Injury done them by publishing that Book.
And yet <hi>Pag.</hi> 93. you say, you do not believe those Stories of
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> publish'd in that Book; so that the wary Doctor must
either grant himself a Liar, or that to publish Lies against a Man
is no Injury, which makes him a Blasphemer. Now, good Doctor,
<hi>Vtrum mavis elige,</hi> take your choice.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on, and proves his Argument thus: The printed
Accounts cited from their Books are equal to the unprinted Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Sermons and Prayers: but takes no notice of the
perverted Propositions and false Citations, which I have proved
upon his Friend from our printed Books, nor of what I said in
Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Defence, but goes on to revile him, tho his Works
praise him, and make his Memory precious. Good Doctor! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your own beloved Apology of the Kites, Crows and Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws,
and pray take in the Cuckows, solemnizing a Jubilee over
the dead Falcon; and apply the other Fable to your self, that the
Ass, amongst other Beasts, kick'd and insulted over the dead Lion.
For sure I am, if Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> were alive, he would disdain to
enter the Lists with such an Episcopal Hawker as you, but would
content himself to say, <hi>Etiams<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to foul his Fingers with you.</p>
            <p>Well, the Doctor knows not whether to believe, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and mark his Civility to Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> for you must know he
will not allow him the Title of Doctor, that's too much for a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian:
He tells you he has given you a couple of Instances of
greater Ignorance and Nonsense in Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s Book than any that's
to be found in the Scotch Eloquence; and yet in the beginning
of the <hi>93<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> Page, he tells you he does not believe the Instances in
that Book against Mr. <hi>Rule;</hi> why, good Doctor, it would seem
you think them not Nonsense great enough for Mr. <hi>Rule:</hi> But
should not you believe your Brother, the Author of the <hi>Presbyterian
Eloquence,</hi> as well as you would have him to believe you? Truly in
his next Pamphlet he had e'en best be quit with you, and use your
own words, <hi>viz.</hi> That he will not believe what you say unless he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44963:26"/>
have better Authority. And last of all, Doctor, seeing you own
that his Authority is not good; pray, why are you angry with me
for writing against him? Poor Doctor! remember that the false
Witnesses against Jesus Christ could not agree in their Evidence: and
seeing you and your Comrade are at giving one another the Lie, be
not angry if I call you both Liars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> The Doctor tells us, that the most blasphemou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Story in
the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> can be proved by the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Evidence, particularly those against Mr. <hi>Vrqhuart</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Kirton:</hi> But he would do well to remember that he himself has
already belied one of his Evidence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, and we have no great reason
to think that the rest are of any better Credit. But further, I am
sufficiently satisfied by those who have lately made an Enquiry into
the Affair, that the whole is a malicious Calumny.</p>
            <p>Well, after a little more Vomit, he tells you, That the absurd
ludicrous Sect metamorphose Religion and its solemn Exercises into
Theatrical Scenes. Commend me to the wary Doctor! what, not
one Page without contradicting your self, or your Brother the
Author of the <hi>Presbyterian Eloquence?</hi> He said that our Preachers
were whining Fellows that drivell'd at Eyes and Mouth, and now
your Doctorship tells us that they are Merry-Andrews. Well,
Doctor<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who's the Liar? he says it's you, and you say it's he, and
I say it's both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 94. The Doctor seems content that he and his Party be
reckoned Publicans and Sinners, so he can but perswade the World
that we are Scribes and Pharisees. Pray, good Doctor, dignify and
distinguish your self and your Party by what Title soever you please,
and observe the wise Man's Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>; but be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to your Neighbours, and before you charge us with acting
Comedies, consider how you'll reconcile your self to your Brother,
Author of the <hi>Scots Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> who chose rather to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
us as personating Tragedies; and you and he both seem so very
well acquainted with the Customs of the Play-house, that you had
e'en best petition their Majesties for <hi>Mumford</hi>'s place, and the other
(what do you call 'em) that's lately dead, and then we may not only
sing but swear, <hi>That the Pulpit and Stage have corrupted the Age.</hi>
But one word more, Doctor, and that's this; Take your Brother
<hi>Foster</hi> along with you, for he'll make a special Bully, and then you
may sport your selves in your Theatrical Scenes, I had almost said
Obscenities, and act Comedies, Tragi-comedies and Farces altogether;
and take my word for it, you need not doubt of Visits from the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44963:26"/>
same Angels and Ladies who are so kind to you now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 94. The Doctor breaths out such venomous Reflections, and so
remote from Truth, that they must needs be inspired by Hell it self:
so that his Doctorship may very well pass for a black Enthusiast. But
it is very strange the Presbyterians should be such <hi>foolish and Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Preachers, as to make all Religion ridiculous,</hi> and yet be preferred
by King, Parliament and Country, when the Episcopalians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 95. He comes to invalidate my Instances of the vitious
Lives, and ridiculous Sayings of the Prelatical Clergy; and truly,
Doctor, I agree, that it's neither decent nor generous to wrestle
with a Scavinger, but it's much less to attempt it and be foild.
Well, Doctor, to your first Topick, that this way of Libelling is
the true Characteristick of our Party. Good Sir, let's join Hands
then, for really I did not know before that yours and ours were
the same; as they must of necessity be, if Libelling be our
Characteristick: for that your Party are Libellers, needs no other
proof than the Catalogue in the Frontice-piece of your Apology;
<hi>The Scots Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> your Apology it self, and the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
<hi>Iam cuncti Gens una sumus;</hi> and pray, seeing it is so, don't
disturb the Repose of your Prelatical Friends at Court any more,
to patch up an Union by Force or Fraud. But now I think on't,
there are a sort of <hi>Literae Mutabiles,</hi> which run from one side to
another; and I believe that's the Reason why Characteristicks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so easily distinguished; For who can tell where to find a Man
that's sometimes a Protestant, sometimes a Papist; turns Protestant
again; and from a Cadee, become a Curat; then Head of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
and at last leaves his Country for Schism and Disloyalty?</p>
            <p>As for your Story about <hi>Spotswood,</hi> you would have done well to
have cited your Author; for since, as I told you not long ago, you
gave your self the Lie, we have no reason to believe you. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
it's but very natural for a Cadee of <hi>Dunbarton</hi>'s Regiment,
which us'd to plunder People of their Goods, and make no scruple
to rob Men of their good Names, not to be believed.</p>
            <p>For your <hi>Encomium</hi> on Arch-bishop <hi>Sharp,</hi> it's no surprizal to me,
his Villany was so universally known, that no Man but those of his
Gang will defend him; and that's no more than <hi>Whitney,</hi> lately
hang'd for Robbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, may expect, and without doubt has from his
<hi>quondam</hi> Underlings. As for your charging the Arch-bishop's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on the Presbyterian Principles, 'tis like your Philosophy: Mr.
<hi>Shields</hi> says it, <hi>Ergo</hi> it's true. It were a sufficient Answer to tell you,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44963:27"/>
another denies, <hi>Ergo</hi> it's false. And I tell you, again and again,
That <hi>the Hind let loose,</hi> was never the Standard of our Principles, nor
approved by our Party; and I dare venture to say, Mr. <hi>Shields</hi> will
not now own every thing in it himself: Nor is it his Disgrace, but
Honour, to retract what upon second thoughts he finds will not
hold. And as for your Allegiance, that there's <hi>nothing worse in the
Morals of the Iesuits:</hi> You do well to defend your <hi>Friend,</hi> but I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
you before, where you might find as bad, nay worse, among
our Scots <hi>Prelatists,</hi> who gave publick Commissions to murder Men
without Form of Law; which is more than a sudden intemperate
fit of Rage in a few Men, who accidentally rencountring the Prelat,
who was actually pursuing them for <hi>their Live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> by his booted Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
did inconsiderately deprive him of <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what I say against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it's what many
of her Sons own to be true: and whether the Passive-Obedience-Men
deserve any better treatment, I refer to the incomparable <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi>
lately published by Mr. <hi>Iohnson.</hi> So that if there be any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it's yours and not mine, for I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
whom I mean, and apply it to all in gross.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 101. He charges me with attaquing all our Kings since the
Reformation. This is unwarily argued, Doctor; then I perceive,
that according to you, King <hi>William</hi> is none of <hi>our</hi> Kings, <hi>for sure I
am I do not attaque him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Doctorship may please to know, that I accused none of
your Kings, but what the Parliaments have accused before me, and
I think their Copy may be writ after: nor do I know any reason
why we should be more sparing of late, than former Kings, if their
Male-administrations be alike, and that it may be done with equal
safety. All Histories, Sacred and Prophane, abound with the wicked
Lives of Kings; so that this Prelatical Maxim, of burying their
publick Faults in Silence, never yet found, nor never will find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
from God or Man; and their contrary practice flows
not from Principle, but Interest: nor do they spare Kings more
than others, when they thwart that; witness <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Reflections
upon pious K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; and the Carriages of the whole
Party toward K. <hi>Iames,</hi> when he granted the Indulgence; and to
this we may add their continual Invectives and rebellious Practices
against their present Majesties. So that they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ve forgot the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
wrested Text, which condemns speaking Evil of Dignities,
they being the guiltiest of all Men alive in that respect, as may be
demonstrated from their Clamours against all but Monarchical
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44963:27"/>
Government, though all Powers that be are ordained of God;
and to which according to the Divine Command, we should always
chearfully submit, whether to the King as Supream, or other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
Magistracy in this respect being also called <hi>the Ordinance
of Man;</hi> because, though the <hi>Genus</hi> be determined by God, yet
the <hi>Species</hi> is left to the determination of Men; else were it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unlawful for the Subjects of Republicks to own their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
which no Man, <hi>sanae mentis,</hi> will affirm. And herein God
has evidenced his Love to Mankind, that he hath bounded all sorts
of Governments with one Commission, which is, to encourage
the Good, and punish Evil-doers: So far may they go, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> He says, That I charge them with such as were deposed for

whereas I only charge them with having protected those Men from
the Punishment due to their Impieties, and baffling their Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
So that if those Men were depos'd at last, it confirms my
Charge of Injustice in the Administration, which punish'd Men
for accusing those, whose Guilt at last they themselves were forced

            <p>As for your Apology for Arch-bishop <hi>Paterson;</hi> It is not much

in Folio; for I cannot think they were guilty of a more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Blunder than this, to call Preachers, who comply'd with our

may still call the Doctor a Papist, for such I am informed he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

            <p>As to Dr. <hi>Canaries,</hi> your Testimony is not of validity enough to
clear him of that Accusation which I say still is upon Record: And
suppose it true that these Presbyterian Ministers and Judicatories
declared, they could make nothing of it, that will not amount to
prove it false; every one knows that Crimes of that Nature are
very difficult to prove, especially when all the Parties concern'd are
link'd together in Interest, and think it behoves them to retract
what they formerly said, as I am very well assured by them, whose
Reputation is fairer than the Doctor's and yours both, that there
is unexceptionable Evidence of the Woman's having declared the
thing her self: And we have a very pregnant Instance of a Person
of no mean Note, whose Accusation most in <hi>England</hi> are satisfied
is true, and yet we see nothing can be made out, neither before the
Judges, nor the Lords.</p>
            <p>As for your Appeal to Mr. <hi>Spalding,</hi> that he should say, nothing
could be made of it, it is absolutely false; he only said it as to the
baptizing part; which yet, as I have already hinted, is far from
proving it a Lie.</p>
            <p>So that this Topick, that nothing can be made appear of it that
may justify the Decrees of a Court after so many Years time, is not
sufficient to acquit Dr. <hi>Canari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> But suppose the thing to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
false, it argues a very great want of cleanly Men amongst
the Episcopalians, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t they should chuse such a Man for Agent,
who lay under a flagrant Scandal. The Apostle's Rule is clear, that
a <hi>Bishop ought to be blameless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44963:28"/>The Doctor's next Apology is for himself, and very angry he is
that I said, <hi>[commonly called Doctor]</hi> which now I hope I have
made him amends for. But heark you, Doctor, I had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to tell you of another Lie you have given your self, and your
Brother-Libellers, the Authors of the Scotch Eloquence: for you
all said, <hi>Nemine contradicent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> before, that the Presbyterians were
a proud, sowre, unconversible Tribe, and that there was nothing like
Justice among them; and now you own that the Presbyterian
Privy-Council, and a Presbyterian Synod, treated Dr. <hi>Canaries</hi> with
special Honour, acquitted him, and reproved his Accusers. Really
Doctor, this is somewhat odd: Can any good thing come out of
<hi>Nazareth?</hi> Is it possible, that notwithstanding of all your Clamours,
that you have at last drop'd out a Commendation of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Procedure? Truly, Doctor, this is not warily done, pray
reconcile this with what you advanced before, that we had no Injury
done us in the former Book, tho therein we were said to be Enemies
to all good Morals? But, Doctor, I beg your Pardon, perhaps you
intend our Civility to Dr. <hi>Canaries</hi> as a Proof of it; for truly he
was accused for no good Morals.</p>
            <p>Well, but what did I say of Dr. <hi>Mâ€”o?</hi> truly that it's well
known he rid in the Pope's Guards, and the Doctor denies it, and
says it's known to none but Presbyterians, who can discover Plots
in the Moon. Doctor, I wish it were as sure that there are none in
your Prelatical Church. But give me leave, Doctor, this impudent
hint of denying the late Prelatical Plots against the Government,
shews you have need of a better Purgation from the Charge that
you rode in the Pope's Guards than you own: For really, if that
were as true, as that there have been and are Plots amongst the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists,
it's true enough. But to satisfy your Doctorship that it's none
of my Invention, I tell you truly that I can bring you twenty who
heard it of you before ever your <hi>Eloquence</hi> or my <hi>Answer</hi> was
publish'd; and if our Friends make use of Stories now and then
which want Confirmation, it's no more than what you accused your
Brethren of just now, then <hi>Veniam damus petimus<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> vicissim.</hi> And
indeed, Doctor, to be serious with you, I wish that the Falshoods
which have been mutually charged on one another, may oblige both
to be more tender of publishing Reports upon trust; but seeing you
are the first Aggressors, blame your self for the Consequences; and
I think that your Doctorship particularly ought to have been a
little tenderer of justifying such self-Contradictions as the <hi>Scots
Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> seeing I understand that when you were your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44963:29"/>
self Parson inâ€”you were your self accused of Villany
with a Woman among the Corn; truly, or otherwise, is not mine to
determine: But seeing you publish'd random Reports against us, we
cannot be blamed to answer with what we have heard concerning
you; and truly, Doctor, I am so far from being guilty of Forgery,
with which you charge me so often, that were I to speak my
last, I can freely declare, that I do not know one Syllable of what
I write to be false, tho I know a great deal of it to be true, yet I
never avouch'd all those Instances of the Follies and Vices of your
Clergy as undeniable Truths, as you and your vapouring Brethren
did yours in the <hi>Scots Presbyterian Eloquence.</hi> For I scarce think it
possible that at such a distance, so many Stories can be transmitted
on such a Subject, and in so great haste, without Mistakes: And
yet I think there is no such great odds betwixt riding in the Pope's
Guards, and being a Cadee in <hi>Dumbarton</hi>'s Reglment which guarded
Popery, and contributed so much to enslave <hi>Europe:</hi> so that it was
but an auspicious Omen of being a good Country-man, much less a
pious Protestant Preacher, to be a Volunteer in that Regiment; not
that I would detract from the Honour of their gallant Colonel, who
tho he was so unhappy as to be a Papist, yet did truly inherit the
Noble Soul of his Family. Nor yet would I derogate from the
Valour of that Regiment, but I think these Nations are pretty well
satisfied how little we are obliged to them either for our Civil or
Religious Liberty: And I make bold to say it, they are as little
obliged to their Cadee.</p>
            <p>The feeble Defence which in the next place you make for <hi>Gray,
Hendry, Hannan,</hi> &amp;c. deserves no Thanks from them, nor Answer
from me; and for your abominable Charge of a prostituted Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
lodg your Accusation nearer home; and tho you have prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
yours to Churches and Princes who drive distinct Interests, I
never did so with mine. And to conclude with your pitiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to prove me a Liar, because in the Title Page it's said, Printed
by <hi>Tho. Anderson</hi> near <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> 1693. It shews your Cause
was sinking, when you lay hold on the first thing comes to hand;
but to satisfy you further, I tell you 'tis no Lie, and charge you upon
Credit to prove it one, for <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio.</hi> You have
not scribled so much, but you must know that Booksellers often put
the Date of the following Year to Books printed in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
Term, which was the only apparent Falsity; and for the rest it
surpasses your Skill to prove it a Lie.</p>

with any that had Converse with them, HIGH TREASON.</hi> The
Marquiss having good part of his Estate about <hi>Douglas</hi> in the West,
where a great many of his Tenants were concerned in the Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
at <hi>Bothwell-Bridg;</hi> they thought that <hi>Blackwood</hi> must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
converse with some of them upon the Marquiss's account,
and so of necessity be catch'd; hereupon they indicted him, and
found it a hard matter however to prove any such thing upon him.
But getting notice that there was one Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> an Inhabitant of
<hi>Douglas,</hi> a Man of considerable dealing with many of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Chamberlains of the West, that had also dealt with <hi>Blackwood;</hi>
and the said <hi>Wilson</hi> was reputed a grand Rebel, because one of those
who had been forc'd to take Arms by the Tyranny of the then
Government. They set a great many of their Implements at work
to take him, which was no hard matter to effect, because he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
most Markets in that part of the Country, and was often
at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> so having taken him, they brought him to Sir <hi>George
Mackenzy,</hi> who threatned him terribly, and accused him with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Rebellious Practices, which had rendred him obnoxious
to the Law, and liable to Death; and having, as he thought,

sent in quest of Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> before his day, but he could not be
found. However, they proceed to Trial, and, which was easy
for them to effectuate, who were so dexterous at suborning of
Witnesses and packing Juries, got <hi>Blackwood</hi> condemned, which
his Advocates (or Counsel) particularly Sir <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> were
so angry at, that they offered publickly in Court to prove Sir <hi>George</hi>
to be as guilty as he, <hi>viz.</hi> in conversing with Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> who not
being able to deny, tho fain he would, he confessed it, and told
them that he would go to his Majesty and get a Remission: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
all cry'd out Shame upon him! to prosecute a Gentleman to
Death, for that whereof he was guilty himself. And <hi>Blackwood</hi>'s
Counsel insisted that he ought to have the Benefit of a Remission
also. Notwithstanding, <hi>Qâ€”ry</hi> and Sir <hi>George</hi> hurried on toward
Execution, nor could they allow the Gentleman time to prepare for
Eternity, but call'd for his Accounts of the Marquiss's Estate, which
the Noblemen and others appointed to take, finding so just, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gentleman so grave and composed, they became Intercessors
for a Remission, which was obtain'd, and the Greed and Malice
of his Enemies frustrated. However, we see by this Instance the
Vertue, Religion and Morality of the grand Pillars of our Scots
Prelacy, which our Pamphleteers do so much boast of. But this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

where Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> could stretch the Law, and make

in <hi>England;</hi> those Gentlemen happened to come hither when
the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> &amp;c. were committed on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Plot; and Scots-men, because oppressed, being generally
look'd upon as Disatisfied, the said Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> and Sir <hi>George Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
were illegally taken up, without a Warrant; and having been
divers times examined by the King and Council, there could not
the least ground of Suspicion be found against them, saving what
<hi>Atterbury</hi> the Messenger did falsly Swear: And being made sensible
of his Perjury by the said Gentlemen, he told them, that his Oath
could not harm them. Which my Lord <hi>Melford</hi> and Sir <hi>George
Mackenzie</hi> being aware of, they went to the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> And
my Lord having a Prospect of the Gentlemens Estates, they dealt
with the Duke to procure a Warrant from the King to send them
for <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they would do their Business. This was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
granted; and then Sir <hi>George</hi> set about suborning of Witnesses
against them; and the Evidence was managed and instructed by Sir

shut up, return'd in a little time, and brought the Prisoner in, <hi>Not
Guilty.</hi> His Council pleaded, That according to Law he might be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44963:31"/>
discharged at the Bar: Which my Lord-Chief-Justice and Sir <hi>George
Mackenzie</hi> refused, the latter being the King's Advocate, or Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General;
and alledging, that he should find both Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the
Father, and Sir <hi>George</hi> the Son, guilty of High-Treason in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Whereupon Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> was remanded to Prison, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
exhibited against both Father and Son, to appear before
the Parliament; wherein the Duke of <hi>Queensbury</hi> was to be Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner,
who was as zealous for pursuing the Prisoners as any. The
next Thing which the Prosecutors took in hand, was, to bring
down some of the English Evidence, who pretended to discover
the Plot at <hi>London;</hi> and accordingly they were sent down in one
of the King's Yachts. And by the Artifice of the Prosecutors
brought into the Company of the Prisoners, who neither knew
them nor their Design. The Evidence being examined before the
Secret Council, and not being able to say any thing against the two
Gentlemen, they were sent for <hi>London</hi> again in the Yacht. After
this the Duke of <hi>Queensbury,</hi> Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi>
and others of the Faction, tampered with the Prisoners own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
to advise them to cast themselves upon the King's Mercy, using
for Argument, <hi>That the Parliament would condemn them, though In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;</hi>
and that they knew there was no Appeal from their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
and therefore if they would cast themselves on the King's
Mercy, they would be sure to procure a Remission, and a good
part of their Estate. But Sir <hi>George Campbel</hi> absolutely refused to
cast himself on the Mercy of either King or Parliament, because he
knew it was sought for only to be an Evidence of a Plot, whereof
they were altogether Innocent. After which they separated Sir
<hi>George</hi> from his Father, and shut him up without Pen, Ink, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and so kept him in close Prison for ten Days: But finding they
could not prevail, they dealt with his Father to perswade him;
and so returned him again to his Father's Room; where being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
dealt with, by Persons of Quality, who were loth to see
the Family ruin'd, and did urge, that he would certainly bring his
Father, and himself both, to the Block; he answered, That he
was willing to sacrifice his own Life, so his Father might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.
And finding that that could not be done, without casting
himself on the King's Mercy, he was prevail'd with to do it. And
though their Lives were saved, yet most, if not all their Estates were

            <p>I cannot omit one Particular more, <hi>viz.</hi> That the said Sir <hi>G. Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

three times (on their Knees) in his Chamber, that they should
Swear what they were taught against his Father; and hop'd God
would forgive him.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to the Reader, whether ever a Piece of blacker In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
was transacted, for the Kind, on this side Hell; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Prelatical Adversaries have reason to boast of those Mens
Vertue, Worth, and Piety, who were principally concerned? And
whether any Credit can be deservedly given to Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi>'s
Relation of Matters of Fact, from which he deduces Arguments to
justify the Severity of the late Reigns against us, wherein he himself
was the Prosecutor, and so deeply engaged, as appears by his own
Confession. Now, I say, whether his Defence of <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's
Government, writ since the Acknowledgment aforesaid; or
the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who in their Claim of Right complain
of those things which he defends, ought to be best believ'd, let
those who are unbyass'd judg. And seeing those two Instances of
his notorious Injustice are Matters of Record, let the Reader bear
Witness if I have not fairly disarm'd the Scots Prelatical Party of
their best Weapon; seeing to all which was told them of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
to the Presbyterians, they constantly oppos'd Sir <hi>George Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzies</hi>
Defence, as a Buckler that could not be pierced.</p>
            <p>I have but one word more, and then I have done: I would have
any moderate Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-man, answer from his Conscience,
Whether he thinks those of his Communion were faithful to his
Majesty, who constantly sollicited him, till he was prevailed with,
to imploy some of those principally concern'd in the black Acts of
Injustice above-mention'd, in the chief Places of the Government
in <hi>Scotland;</hi> being moreover of the number of those Evil Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
whom he declared against at his first coming over. And seeing
his Majesty, who has been but a little while among us, and often
called Abroad, must needs in a great measure be a Stranger to Men
and Things: May the Great God of Heaven preserve his Person
and Government, from such dangerous Enemies as thus impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, out of a pretended Zeal for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and
in the mean time they have no reason to be offended at us and our
Parliament, if we witness as much true Zeal for the Church of

uncharitable and injurious Reflections, tending rather to
kindle Contentions, than compose Divisions; and therefore the
said Paper was denied reading.</hi> And yet what is so heavily char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in that Paper, is far short of those Principles which the disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous

            <p>By their Act of <hi>Oct.</hi> 28. they recommend to the Presbytery, to <hi>take
notice of all Ministers within their Bounds, the late CONFORMIST
Incumbents or OTHERS, who shall not observe Fasts and Thanksgivings,
indicted by the Church, or shall be guilty of any other irregular Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi>
&amp;c. So that they are no severer upon the Episcopal Clergy,
than their own, for all the Clamours of the malicious Faction.</p>

Communion with them in Church-Government, be obliged to subscribe the
Confession of Faith, ratified in the second Session of the Parliament.</hi>
There it's plain that they arrogate no more Power than what is
given them by Law; and it's obvious, that by this Act, they neither
exclude the Prelatists <hi>ab officio,</hi> nor <hi>beneficio:</hi> So that the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men
have no reason to complain, that their Brethren are
severely treated, for they have made no such steps towards a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
with the English Dissenters, though his Majesty desired
it. And yet what a racket do they keep, because the Scots Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Clergy are only denied a share in the Government of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44963:32"/>
Church, which they designedly seek that they may undermine it,
and are not ashamed to own it.</p>
            <p>In their Letter to his Majesty, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 13. 1690. at the Close of
that Assembly, they acquaint him with the Instructions which they
had given to those appointed for Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itation, concerning the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
<hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That none of them shall be removed from their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but such as are either Insufficient, Scandalous, Erroneous,
or supinely negligent; and that those of them be admitted to
Ministerial Communion, who upon due trial shall be found Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
Able, Godly, Peaceable and Loyal; and that such who
shall be found to have received Wrong in any Inferior Judicatory
of the Church, should be duly redressed.</q> Yet what Clamour,
what Lies, what Obloquy and Reproach have the poor Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of <hi>Scotland</hi> been loaded with, in blasphemous and virulent
Pamphlets, publish'd in <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Hindmarsh,</hi> the late King's Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
and promoted and disseminated by that ungovernable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And what a clutter did the high-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lown Courtiers keep about
the Scots General-Assembly; how industrious to misrepresent them
to the King; and how restless, till they had them dissolved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws, and at such a time as we were threatned with a
Rebellion at Home, and an Invasion from Abroad; that so his
Majesty having disobliged his only Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> might be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deprived of any Assistance from thence: but, blessed be God,
who disappointed their Designs: And I hope, that moderate and
truly Religious Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, will henceforth be more
cautious in listening to the Calumnies of our Episcopal Clergy, when
they consider the Moderation of the above-mentioned Acts of the
Presbyterian General-Assembly; which they have no reason to think
of such dangerous Consequence as our Pamphleteers would have
them believe; and as <hi>Dâ€”Mâ€”ro,</hi> in his Papers lately
seized by Authority, would have further insinuated.</p>
            <p>And that they may have yet a further proof of their Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I would pray them to read the seventh Instruction given by
the said Assembly, to the Commissioners appointed for Visitation,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That they be very cautious of receiving Informations against
the late Conformists, and that they proceed in the matter of
Censure very deliberately, so as none may have just cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of their Rigidity; yet so as to omit no means of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that they shall not proceed to Censure, but upon suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Probation.</q> And that the World may be farther satisfied
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44963:33"/>
in their Impartiality, in the fourth Instruction they declared that the
<hi>Power of the Visiters shall reach Presbyterians as well as others:</hi> and in
the second Instruction, they gave them Power to stop the <hi>precipitant
or unwarrantable Procedure of Presbyteries in Processes.</hi> If any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
can be more mild or regular, let the World judg: So that
whether Dr. <hi>Mâ€”<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and his Fellow Libellers, who impudently
assert, that there is nothing like Order, Moderation, or Justice
among the Presbyterians, be Liars or not, let these Acts determine.
And if there were no other thing to stop the Mouths of all Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
the Assembly's Declaration, <hi>That they would depose no Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents
simply for their Iudgment concerning Church-Government, nor yet
urge Reordination upon them,</hi> were sufficient; and if there be any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
in the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, it may for ever silence them
as to their Complaints against our Administration, seeing those of
their Communion have been, and continue still to be so much guilty of
a contrary Practice towards Dissenters. And further, this Assembly,
whom they branded as void of all Moderation or Humanity, made
an Act in favour of Mr. <hi>Couper,</hi> Curat of <hi>Humby,</hi> and recommended
Mr. <hi>Cameron,</hi> one of the late Conformists, to the Privy-Council for
Charity, which is more than ever was done by any Episcopal Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in favour of Presbyterian Ministers.</p>
            <p>Having proved the Falshood of the Episcopal Calumnies against
our Church as void of Moderation, it remains that I do the same
as to the State; and tho it be already sufficiently done in my first
Answer, it will not be amiss to insist on it in this: And because

            <p>But the Scripture telling us, that Christ is Head of his Church, and
that other Foundations can no Man lay, than what is already laid
on the Prophets and Apostles: and Common Reason must needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me, that for any Man, or Party of Men, to take upon them any
other than a Declarative Power in Church-Matters, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Word of God, must needs be an invading of Christ's
Prerogative. And seeing he himself declar'd, that his Kingdom is
not of this World, that it should be govern'd by Worldly Monarchs,
is <hi>humano capiti cervicem jungere equinam.</hi> And I cannot but wonder,
that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s late Experience should not convince
them of the Unreasonableness of this Doctrine: For I believe they
were sensible under the late King, that a Popish Head was altogether
inconsistent with the Safety of a Protestant Church. And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
the Christians in <hi>Turky</hi> never dream'd that the Grand Signior
was the Head of the Christian Church: and this being a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it cannot belong to the Chief Magistrate, as such, he can
lay claim to it no other way. Especially, if we consider that the
Church, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. did meet and declare the Mind of God in
Church-Matters, without either the Call or Consent of the Heathen
<pb facs="tcp:44963:36"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
and we have never yet had any Divine Revelation to recal it. Then as for
abolishing Patronages, which occasions a further Clamour: It's plain that
the Parliament have made a very rational Act on that Head; and it's but
equal that every one who has a Soul, and evidences any real Concern about
it, should have a Vote in choosing his Minister, and not wholly rely on the
Choice of a Patron, who perhaps is so wicked, that he takes no care of his
own, and is very unfit to choose a Minister for the Souls of a whole Parish.
And as for the other Acts, they are so plain, that any who will but take
care to compare them with those of the late Reigns, if they be not blinded,
as our Doctor was, with the Indecencies of Passion, we dare refer to them
which are the most moderate; or, whether the Scots Prelatists be not guilty
of an audacious Lie, in asserting, that they are more severely treated than
ever we were? And I would pray the Reader to take this along with him;
That their Laws, tho barbarous to a Prodigy in themselves, were yet more
barbarously put in Execution beyond their Extent: and that our Laws, tho
moderate in themselves, are yet more moderately put in Execution. Yea,
and besides those Acts of Parliament, their Council took upon them a
Parliamentary Power, and made Acts more bloody than those of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
enabling Souldiers to examine any Man they met, and to kill him
without any further Trial, if he did not give them satisfying Answers to
their Questions; of which any that pleases may be fully satisfied in my
first Answer. I had almost omitted taking notice of one remarkable thing
which past in the Convention of States after the Revolution. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themselves a free and lawful Meeting, whatever might be contain'd
in the Letter from <hi>Iames</hi> the VIIth to dissolve them, or impede their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure;
in which Archbishop <hi>Paterson</hi> and six other Bishops, and the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Dundee</hi> concurr'd. Now if this was not a manifest disowning of
K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Authority, let any Man judg; and yet these Men did afterwards
exclaim against the Convention and Parliament as unlawfully called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wanting K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Authority, and opposed K. <hi>William</hi>'s coming to
the Crown. So that it's evident, our Scots Episcopalians are Men of the
same Kidney with those Jacobite Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> who join'd in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and yet afterwards turn'd his Enemies out
of a pretended Loyalty to K. <hi>Iames.</hi> The Faction have lately drawn up
and dispersed amongst their Friends a sort of <hi>Manifesto</hi> from those of the
Episcopal Perswasion in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> full of Invectives against
the Government, which, together with other Monuments of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
