            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>OUR Play's a Parallel: The Holy League</l>
            <l>Begot our Cov'nant: Guiſards got the Whigg:</l>
            <l>Whate'er our hot-brain'd Sheriffs did advance,</l>
            <l>Was, like our Faſhions, firſt produc'd in <hi>France:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And, when worn out, well ſcourg'd, and baniſh'd there,</l>
            <l>Sent over, like their godly Beggars here.</l>
            <l>Cou'd the ſame Trick, twice play'd, our Nation gull?</l>
            <l>It looks as if the Devil were grown dull;</l>
            <l>Or ſerv'd us up, in ſcorn, his broken Meat,</l>
            <l>And thought we were not worth a better Cheat.</l>
            <l>The fulſome Cov'nant, one wou'd think in reaſon,</l>
            <l>Had giv'n us all our Bellys-full of Treaſon:</l>
            <l>And yet, the Name but chang'd, our naſty Nation</l>
            <l>Chaws its own Excrement, th'Aſſociation.</l>
            <l>'Tis true we have not learn'd their pois'ning way,</l>
            <l>For that's a mode but newly come in play;</l>
            <l>Beſides, your Drug's uncertain to prevail;</l>
            <l>But your true Proteſtant can never fail,</l>

            <l>Go on; and bite, ev'n though the Hook lies bare;</l>
            <l>Twice in one Age expell the lawfull Heir:</l>
            <l>Once more decide Religion by the Sword;</l>
            <l>And purchaſe for us a new Tyrant Lord.</l>
            <l>Pray for your King; but yet your Purſes ſpare;</l>
            <l>Make him not two-Pence richer by your Prayer.</l>
            <l>To ſhow you love him much, chaſtiſe him more;</l>
            <l>And make him very Great, and very Poor.</l>
            <l>Puſh him to Wars, but ſtill no Pence advance;</l>
            <l>Let him loſe <hi>England</hi> to recover <hi>France.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Cry Freedom up with Popular noiſy Votes:</l>
            <l>And get enough to cut each others Throats,</l>
            <l>

Lop all the Rights that fence your Monarch's Throne;</l>
            <l>For fear of too much Pow'r, pray leave him none.</l>
            <l>A noiſe was made of Arbitrary Sway;</l>
            <l>But in Revenge, you Whiggs, have found a way,</l>
            <l>An Arbitrary Duty now to pay.</l>
            <l>Let his own Servants turn, to ſave their ſtake;</l>
            <l>Glean from his plenty, and his wants forſake.</l>
            <l>But let ſome <hi>Judas</hi> near his Perſon ſtay,</l>
            <l>To ſwallow the laſt Sop, and then betray.</l>
            <l>Make <hi>London</hi> independant of the Crown:</l>
            <l>A Realm apart; the Kingdom of the Town.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Juries find no Traitors:</l>
            <l>And <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Poets ſcribble Satyres.</l>

            <l>MUCH Time and Trouble this poor Play has coſt;</l>
            <l>And, faith, I doubted once the Cauſe was loſt.</l>
            <l>Yet no one Man was meant; nor Great nor Small;</l>
            <l>Our Poets, like frank Gameſters, threw at all.</l>
            <l>They took no ſingle Aim:—</l>
            <l>But, like bold Boys, true to their Prince and hearty,</l>
            <l>Huzza'd, and fir'd Broad-ſides at the whole Party.</l>
            <l>Duells are Crimes; but when the Cauſe is right,</l>
            <l>In Battel, every Man is bound to fight.</l>
            <l>For what ſhou'd hinder Me to ſell my Skin</l>
            <l>Dear as I cou'd, if once my hand were in?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Se defendendo</hi> never was a Sin.</l>
            <l>'Tis a fine World, my Maſters, right or wrong,</l>
            <l>The Whiggs muſt talk, and Tories hold their tongue.</l>
            <l>They muſt doe all they can—</l>
            <l>But We, forſooth, muſt bear a Chriſtian mind;</l>
            <l>And fight, like Boys, with one Hand ty'd behind;</l>
            <l>Nay, and when one Boy's down, 'twere wondrous wiſe,</l>
