            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:44923:7"/>branded with the moſt ſhameful and blemiſhing Titles; ſome do ſo illy reſent what favours of it, that one would imagine that they had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Antipathy to it, lurking in the very frame of their Natures: Some damn it as Irreligious and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and deem it wholly inconſiſtent with Goſpel Simplicity; becauſe it ſometimes diſcovers the Darkneſs of that Light that they fancifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. Its wonderful to ſee how many are continually puffing at this Light; ſome with the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment blaſts of Rage anf Fury, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with the gentle ones of Scoff and Deriſion, but each equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning its Final and Fatal Extinction.

Either of thoſe Lights are much too Glorious for the vitiated Optics of ſuch Brutiſh Senſualiſts. Nothing grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb facs="tcp:44923:7"/>them but what accords with their Humerous Diſpoſitions, and is tempered into a ſutableneſs to their Corrupted Phancies: Its ſtrange Men ſhould ſo much oppoſe their own Happineſs, diſown their cleareſt Faculties, and without the leaſt ſhadow of Provocation, be content to place themſelves in a lower Rank than God and Nature has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. To talk of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Humane Soul, to vindicate its Difference from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Subſtances, to aſſert its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Origin and Production, is now become ſufficient to entitle a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Malignant Scoffs of ſome Prophaner Wits: For Senſuality is ſo much their Element, that they are not eaſily perſwaded to be Wiſe beyond it, neither can they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think thoſe things to have a proper Exiſtence, which are not capable of being confined to that Praedicament. So that what-ever is
<pb facs="tcp:44923:8"/>declared of things Spiritual (things of a more Noble and Sublime Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction than what's Corporeal) is by ſuch no otherwiſe eſteemed than impertinent Babling. All that we hear from them of theſe Matters, is only that conſtant Clamour, that to aſſert Immaterial, and Spiritual Beings is unintelligible Nonſenſe. But it were unworthy any Perſon of Ingenuity to be concerned, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Purity of our Faculties, and a ſerious Reflection on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Nature, is Argument enough to convince any of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious unreaſonableneſs of ſuch Frantic Surmiſes: Should we to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſome perverſe Humoriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all our Knowledge into Senſe, we muſt be forced to confeſs that we underſtood ſcarcely any thing of our owu Natures; that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted Actions, which we could no more, nay leſs account for, than the Flux and Reflux of the Ocean;
<pb facs="tcp:44923:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>and whoſe Fountain and Original would be as undeterminable as that of <hi>Nibe,</hi> As for the reducing thoſe Acts of Will and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or thoſe ſiner Reflex ones, to the Arietations and Fortuious Jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of inſenſible Atomes, is a Notion exceedingly groſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd: For the moſt exquiſite Motion of the ſmootheſt and ſmalleſt parts of Matter is utterly incompatible with the ſubtle and refined Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of a Spirits Faculties: So ridiculous does the Hypotheſis of the Atheiſts ſeem to be, that I cannot imagine any ſhould adopt it, unleſs he were ſwayed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or byaſſed by ſome ſecret thoughts of his being capacitated to maintain any thing againſt the moſt violent Aſſaults of his well accompliſhed Adverſaries. Let the Atheiſtic Tribe brave it with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much Confidence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yet any Reaſonable
<pb facs="tcp:44923:9"/>Perſon may at an eaſie rate be informed of its groundleſneſs, and the Weakneſs of its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Strong Confidence ought to be built on weighty Reaſons and confirmed Truths, or the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure will become the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Mens Scorn and Deriſion: And whether the Confidence of ſome Atheiſts be any better founded, I think the following Diſcourſe may in part evidence to any impartial and diſ-intereſted Mind: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this piece will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to any to whom Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is dear and delightful, but I judge it will be far otherwiſe to thoſe that affect Ignorance, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their own Blindneſs and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that like the <hi>Negro's</hi> think nothing Beautiful but what diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf in their own Native Blackneſs: But it were apparent Folly to manifeſt any Reſentment of their Cenſures, who endeavour
<pb facs="tcp:44923:9"/>to leſſen the diſtance between Man and Brutes, as is evidently viſible by their earneſt and vehement At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to caſheir that Knowledge that makes the difference the more wide and conſpicuous. The Subject, of the enſuing Diſcourſe (as the Title Page aſſures us) is Man, the Compendium of the Univerſe, and a brief ſummary of all Natures Works; ſo that indeed a Treatiſe on this Subject, is as it were a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the whole Book of Nature: For that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing In Man Analogic to all the Parts of the Harmonious Structure of the World, is that which the Treatiſe in its very Entrance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents by a very curious and exact Delenation: It deſcribes Man in almoſt all his Poſtures and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, diſcovers the Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Origin of his Diviner Part; clearly manifeſts the ſublime Nature of the Properties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb facs="tcp:44923:10"/>of that Incorporeal Being; gives ſome probable Conjectures of its Condition, both Antecedent and Conſequent, to its ſtate of Union: Opens the Nature of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhews the Difference occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Terminations of the Iraſcible and Concupiſcible Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites on the Variety of Objects. Then it evidences to us the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and detects the Vanity of Atheiſtic Cavils againſt ſo famous and irrefragable a Truth: It alſo preſents us with a delightful View of the curious Frame of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, and thence raiſes us to the Contemplation of the Ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Goodneſs and Admiration of the Stupendious Wiſdom of the Deity, viſible in the erecting ſo Amiable and Harmonious a Fabric. Then MAN in the differing circumſtances of Age, Sex, and Complexion, is offered us as the Object of our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation: So that the Author has
<pb facs="tcp:44923:10"/>traverſed all the various Regions of the Microcoſm, and has nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſcribed the moſt remarkable Occurrences in that intellectual Syſtem. The Deſign of which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Controverſie, is no other than to guide us in the practice of, and ſhew us the Comprehenſiveneſs of that Ancient Sentence, <hi>Know thy Self.</hi> The Diſcourſe aims at the Knowledge of our Selves, at clear and diſtinct Apprehenſions of our own Natures, at a view of our whole Frame and Module: And altho nakedly conſidered it be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, yet it is directly levelled at Practice, namely, to aſſiſt us in the regular Ordering and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lives and Actions: it were then undeniable madneſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs, to frown at, or ſhew a diſlike of the Endeavours of others advantaging us in a larger Proſpect of our own Beings: If we blame others, and diſparage their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb facs="tcp:44923:11"/>deſigned for our Benefit, it is an apparent Demonſtration we maintain an over-winning Fondneſs of our own Abilities; what others may object againſt this Treatiſe, I am not able to conjecture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I be ſolicitous to enquire; but this I dare promiſe my ſelf, that ſuch as are acted with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ingenuous Souls, will be candid and favourable: But as for ſuch as applaud themſelves for their admirable Faculty in Obtrecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Raylery, and ſuch like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious Foolery, it were abſurd to regard them. It is uſually ſaid, and I wiſh it were more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That its much eaſier to quarrel at Mens Diſcourſes, than to frame one of a more even and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic Compoſure. To cenſure Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of ſquable with them is no deſperate difficulty, but to write o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ſhall in all reſpects won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſurmount them, is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:44923:11"/>of no great Facility. I confeſs a compleat meaſure of Conſidence may accompliſh a Man for Drollery and Invectives; but there muſt be other Ingredients to make him deſerve the Denomination of truly Learned: And to ſuch as ſhall look on what the Author here Expoſes to the Public, with an Eye of Diſdain and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, its my humble Requeſt they would recommend to us ſomething of their own on the ſame Subject, more worthy our Inſpection and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal, by which thing I am perſwaded, they will highly gratifie the Author and pleaſe others. If Reader, the Authors Judgment and thine, may interfer (as its highly probable they may) let not that be cogent with thee to move thee to a diſlike of what he offers thee. Thou perhaps judgeſt thy Opinions to be founded on the plaineſt and cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when-as on the contrary, the Author preſumes, and that it
<pb facs="tcp:44923:12"/>may be not raſhly, that his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are enforced with as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Demonſtrations as any. It were therefore unbecoming to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate thy Sentence of the Treatiſe, either in a way of Commendation or Detraction, till thou haſt deliberately weighed and conſidered the Deſign, Matter, and Method of it. Let it be but admitted to plead at the Bar of Reaſon, and I am confident the Author will be content to ſubmit to any thing, that ſhall certainly be determined by that High Court of <hi>Judicature.</hi> What remains is only to recommend the following Diſcourſe to thy Candid Peruſal, hoping it may be of ſome Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to thee. <hi>Vale</hi>

                  </gap>plendid, and Effulgent Glittering of the Day was preſent. But when theſe Rays, which are certain tenuious ſtreams of igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles, in a continued Fluor, and ineffable pernicity, ſucceeding each other in direct Lines, either immediately from their Fountain, or mediately from ſolid Bodies, reflecting towards the eye, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affecting the ſame; I ſay when theſe are obſtructed by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any Opace Body between us and their Fountain; that Light that is between us and the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing, doth preſently fall down to the Earth, tending thereto by its own gravity, juſt like a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, or Water-cock ſending forth a ſtream of Water; when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our hand to the Orifice, the Water falling down towards the Earth doth diſappear: Thus the Earth whoſe groſs Body canot be permeated by the ſubtile beams of Light, when it intervenes between us and the Sun, it cauſes the obum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Shadows of the Night to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44923:21"/>appear.

                  </gap>anſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated, and turned into an Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial Subſtance; then thoſe oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Orbs were wheeled about by the hand of Providence, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their regular Circumgyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the end of the World. The next thing that was done, was the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44923:22"/>gathering together the Liquid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water into its proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle the Sea;<note place="margin">Of Water.</note> it was then, the Water was incorporated with thoſe Saline Particles,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the Salineſs of Sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and impregnated with a Salt, which is Congenite and Concreate with it; but when this Water is Percolated or Cribrated thro the Sandy,<note place="margin">How it is made fresh.</note> Nitrous, and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Glebes of the Earth, or rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and evaporated by the warmth of the Subterranean Fire, it relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſheth the Salt, which is nothing but the thicker and longer Particles of the Water, and ſo hereby is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to that ſubdulcid Sapor, whereof our Fountain Waters do reliſh.</p>
               <p>It was then that thoſe Limpid Waves began to fluctuate, then the flux and reflux of the Sea had its firſt beginning, not being cauſed by the Attractive Virtue of the Sun, nor by the Magnetic Influence of the Moon,<note place="margin">Of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea.</note> as ſome imagine; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Eſtuation of the Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Fire, cauſing in it an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, like the Boiling of a Pot, as others fictitiouſly conjecture; but

               <p>After this he commanded the Earth to fructifie and to yield its Vegetables: then the Prolific Sperm,<note place="margin">Of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Plants.</note> contained within the Clods of the Earth, began to ferment; and hence Plunts began to germinate. Now the creeping Mouſe-ear ſhoots forth its hairy Leaves; now the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Crow foot begins to ſpread its Claws; now the flouriſhing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimilla, or Ladies Mantle, adorns the Mountains of the Seprentrional Regions, and now the wild Tanſie expands its Stems, beautified with Silver Leaves; now the Shepherds Purſe dilates its Pouches; now the Scurvey-graſs abounds with its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbutic Leaves; and now the refrigerating Hounds Tongue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to blab; now the Dandelyon exhibits its crooked Teeth, and Horſe-tail extends its Knotty Briſſles; and the ſoporiferous Poppy is repleniſhed with its narcotic
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44923:23"/>Juice; now the Fields are every where inveſted with their verdent Apparel, for Botaniſts to recreate themſelves with: and now the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologiſts may write Volumes of Botanology. I ſhall not here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Reader with a Catalogue of Plants, it being too great a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from our preſent buſineſs, but refer him to thoſe Learned Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanic Authors, who have already ſufficiently done it, as <hi>Johan Bauhin, Caſper Bauhin, Gerard, Parkinſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> in his late Elaborate Compendious Catalogue; neither ſhall I here deſcend into the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Vegetables, nor penetrate into the Bowels of Plants, nor yet delineate the curious Contexture of their parts, it being a work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our preſent deſign, and ſocing it is already ſo elaborately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Ingenious Dr. <hi>Grew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come therefore now to the next Operation,<note place="margin">Of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Celeſtial Luminaries.</note> performed by God in Building the Fabric of this World, and that is, the Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, thoſe Celeſtial Luminaries, thoſe fixed and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44923:23"/>Erratic Lights, then thoſe tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Chriſtal Spheres, in which the fixed Stars are faſtned, were whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about by the <hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> or rather thoſe Lucid Bodies, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Flames began to ſwim in the Fluid Aether: The Sun performing its Annual courſe, moving round the Eclyptic in the ſpace of a Year, and the Lunar Globe in its Monthly Circuit, performing the ſame in a little more than Twenty ſeven days; while the Earth, the Center of the Univerſe, where the more feculent and droſſy parts do reſide,<note place="margin">Of the Suns Motion, with the Motion of the Earth.</note> is turned about upon its Axis in the ſpace of Twenty four hours, a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Natural day.</p>
               <p>After theſe things were fin ſhed,<note place="margin">Of Living Creatures.</note> he Created the Living Creatures; thoſe Machins curiouſly Fabricated by the chief Opifex of Nature, the Fiſhes of the Sea, the Fouls of the Air, the Beaſts of the Field, and every creeping Vermine, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Inſect.</p>
               <p>Now God having thus repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World with all its materials,<note place="margin">Of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of clan.</note> beautified and adorned it with all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44923:24"/>its requiſites; the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy, while he was making Man a Creature not much inferiour to them: Here he Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized thoſe Mighty Volumes he before had elaborately wrought; this is that little World, wherein all the parts of the Macrocoſm did concenter; this is the Compendium of the Univerſe, the Wonder and Miracle of Nature, the Mirrour of Divine Wiſdom, a Heavenly Coal blown up by the Divine Sparks of Infinite Prudence. What a perſpicuous Analogy, what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous Parrellelliſm, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Similitude hath Man with the whole World,<note place="margin">Mans Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goly with the great World.</note> both in his Angellic, Heavenly, and Sublunary parts? The Soul, that Queen Regent in the Palace of the Brain, is the <hi>Anima Munduli,</hi> and repreſents the Soul of the World; the Spirits repreſent the Heavens, the Subtle and Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts of the Univerſe; the Four Humours bear a great Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with the Four Elements, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that hot Sulphureous and Raging
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44923:24"/>Humour, is like the furious Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire, the calmneſs of the Blood is compared to the Serenity of Air, the dulneſs of Flegm, to the Hebetude of Water, and the Aduſt Melancholy is like the Fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Earth: Hairs repreſent the verdent Vegetables; Bones and Stones in the Reins and Bladder, repreſent Rocks, Stones and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; the Veins and Arteries, the Rivers and Caverns of the Earth; the Circulation of the Sanguine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is a repreſentative of the Motion of the Marine Waters, and of the Waters in the profound A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſes of the Terreſtrial Globe: Dew is repreſented by Tears, Hail By Concocted Flegm, Rain by the Humours that fall into the Throat,<note place="margin">See <hi>Crook's</hi> Body of Man.</note> Thunder by Fury, Heat, Rumbling, Belching, and Winds by exhaled Crudities, Hiſſing, Singing and Ringing Noiſes in the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Now if the conſonant Order, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Structure, and regular Compoſure of the greater World, be not enough to confute an Atheiſt, here is enough to aſtoniſh him; if

               <p>Others will affirm that the Soul being the Ruling part,<note place="margin">The Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</note> ſits like a Queen in the Palace of the Brain upon her Throne the <hi>Conarion,</hi> which is a little Glans<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But how well the Authors or Abetters
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44923:35"/>of theſe Two Opinions have hit the Mark. I leave to the Credulous Reader to determine; concerning the Firſt, I ſhall only Query a few things;<note place="margin">That the Soul is not United by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioc of the Corporeal Soul evinced by ſeveral Queries.</note>
                  <list>

                     <item>(3) Whether Body and Spirit be not things of a quite different Nature?</item>
                     <item>(4) Whether Rarefaction or Subtilization make a Body to be leſs a Body, or more a Spirit, than it was before?</item>
                     <item>(5) Whether a Red-hot Iron have any nearer Approximation to Life than it had before, or the Flame of a Candle, than the Extinguiſht Snuff or Tallow of it?</item>
                     <item>(6) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Corporeal Spirit be Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal and Semi-ſpiritual? As for the Second Opinion, let me Query:<note place="margin">Neither is it only Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Glandula pinealis,</hi> and thence Influences the Body.</note>
                     </item>
                  </list>
Firſt, why the Soul ſhould ſit upon the <hi>Glandula pinealis</hi> more than upon any other part of the Body, and whence it appears that it doth? (2) Whether or no it be extended thro every part of the Conarion, or is only one point
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44923:35"/>of it? If extended thro every part, then why not as well thro the whole Body? If in a point how it Acts and Inſluenceth the Body? (3) Whether this Virtue which the Soul doth Exert and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in its Operations, be the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Soul or no? Now theſe Two Opinions ſeeming to diſagree with the Canons of Reaſon and True Philoſophy; it will not I hope be unkindly reſented, if I exhibit another to the deliberate peruſal of the unprejudiced, which altho at the firſt it may ſeem a little Uncouth; yet I am perſwaded after ſome Conſideration, it will appear to be attended with leſſer Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make any Wiſe Man In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of its verity than either of the former,<note place="margin">But by its Extenſion thro the the Body, it Actuates all its parts.</note> and that is this, that the Soul is United to the Body by its Extenſion thro every one of its parts; that the Soul is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is not my buſienſs here to Demonſtrate, having deſigned a particular Chapter for it, to which I ſhall refer the Reader, and where I ſhall endeavour to remove the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44923:36"/>difficulties wherewith this Truth may ſeem to be burthened: If this then be proved, how eaſily may we Imagine an Union of the Soul with the Body, to reſult from its Extenſion, and Diffuſion thro the parts thereof?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Immateriality of the Soul.</head>
               <p>THe Immateriality of the Soul is a Truth ſo Undubitably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſo generally believed, that thoſe who have arrived to that height of Audacity as to deny it, are juſtly looked upon to be no better than Atheiſts; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is become ſo groſly erroneous, as to believe his own Soul to be material, is conſequently redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (may I ſay Blaſphemouſly) to Averr the Nullity of A Deity.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44923:36"/>O Incredulity not to be parallelled! O Atheiſme, abſurd and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable! the Immateriality of the Soul may be evinced, Firſt from its Activity, In-activity is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pertinent to Matter, for Matter can exert no action of it ſelf, no not ſo much as Local Motion, unleſs it be agitated by ſome Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe, there being no ſuch thing as Natural Motion, Matter being a Thing Naturally Inert and Paſſive, but a Spirit which is of a Nature far tranſcending Matter, is always Active, and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> called. it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſelf-moving, it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prevaricable Law with all Bodies, that nothing whatſoever can move, unleſs it be moved by another; and hence it followeth that the Soul that moveth without being excited by any thing elſe; Acting and Operating from its own Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic Power and Faculty, is of a higher Race than they,<note place="margin">From its large Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Diſcurſive Faculty.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Incorporeal. (2) The large Capacity and Diſcourſive Faculty of the Soul Demonſtrates its Spirituality, when we conſider the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44923:37"/>multitude of things that are at once contained in the Soul; as likewiſe its Power of Exerting thoſe Notions and Apprehenſions, which it had Imbibed in Diſcourſe, how can we Conceive any otherwiſe than that ſhe is Spiritual in her Eſſence. (3) Its Simplicity, Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Immortality, Self-reflection and Perfection, are Infallible Manifeſto's of its Incorporeity; we may alſo add Cogitation, a Property only Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a Spiritual Being;<note place="margin">From Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> for as we ſaid before, Matter cannot move it ſelf; how much leſs then is it able to perform that excellent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of deeming and thinking? I am not Inſenſible how ſome do endeavour to evade this Argument, for a Late Author doth pretend to Solve the manner of Cogitation,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Evaſion.</note> without recourſe to an Incorporeal Principle; for faith he, the very Motion of Reaction of one part of Matter on another, or at leaſt the Continuation of this Reaction, can eaſily effect this; for we find by experience, when we are Occupied in ſerious Meditations, or diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44923:37"/>incumbent upon our Studies, a great Commotion in our Heads, and a kind of Confuſion in the Parts of the Brain, which would not happen, except Perception and Cogitation did depend on Matter, and were made by the Motion and Agitation of the Particles of the Brain.</p>
               <p>There might be ſome probability in this,<note place="margin">Its Solution.</note> if the Author could drive us to believe that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Matter in the whole Univerſe; but ſeeing this is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the other as falſe and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; for if this were true, why may not alſo the Bodies of Men, when defunct, be endued with the ſame Power of Cogitation? For they are then no leſs capable of Reaction, or Suſceptive of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Impreſſions; beſides if we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Matter into Monads, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Phyſic Particles; I Query, whether theſe Monads being ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from another, may be capable of Perception and Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or only the Compoſitum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44923:38"/>there-from? Now I think there is no one ſo a Friend to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that he ſhould think them to have Intelligence; for who can believe that the ſmalleſt Particle of Matter is indued with Senſe and Perception? But if it be the whole Compoſitum, what can be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that out of Inſenſible Things, ſhould Emerge Things capable of Senſe and Apprehenſion? How is it poſſible that from the various Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of Atoms, which are Senſeleſs and Incogitant, ſhould be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Cogitant Animal?</p>
               <p>Having thus proved the Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality of the Soul,<note place="margin">A Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul of Brutes.</note> I muſt crave leave here to make a little Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion concerning the Souls of Brutes, whether their Souls be Immaterial or no? Concerning which, I ſhall Nominate Three Opinions, all which have been very plauſibly received by many:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The Opinion of the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who who do thus Philoſophize; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Brutes have a Corporeal
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44923:38"/>Soul, which being of an Ignite and Fiery Nature doth move the Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized Bodies of theſe Animals: For this See <hi>Willis de Anima Brutorum, Du. Hamel, de Corpore Animato:</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's <hi>Natural Hiſtory, and Learned. Mr.</hi> Gales <hi>Philoſophia Generalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <p>Secondly, The Hypotheſis of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Des Cartes, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Brutes are nothing elſe but Machins curiouſly Fabricated by the chief Opifex of Nature; being Acted and Moved by no other than a Mechanic Motion, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſe nor Perception in them; and this Opinion, ſaith Monſieur <hi>Fernelius,</hi> ſeems to be taken from the Philoſophy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where the Blood is ſaid to be the Life of Brutes. <hi>Le-Grand</hi> alſo in his Book, <hi>De Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia ſenſus &amp; cognitionis in Brutis,</hi> hath endeavoured to defend <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and prove that Brutes are nothing but Natural Horologies, or Organs of Clock-work, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as void of Senſe, as Clocks performing their Motion the ſame way.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44923:39"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <p>The Third is the Hypotheſis of Famous <hi>Derodon,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth, viz.</hi> That Brutes are Acted by an Incorporeal Soul, not differing in kind from Mans, but only in degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That <hi>Bruits</hi> have not Material Souls.</note> From the Firſt of theſe I muſt needs acknowledge my Diſſent, or contradict my ſelf in what I ſaid before; (yet ſtill retaining that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Adoration I bear to the Learning of its Authors.) For I have already declared that there is contrariety between Matter and Spirit; ſo that a <hi>Material, or Corporeal Spirit,</hi> is a contradiction, and I have already ſaid, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it ſelf is Inactive Senſeleſs and Inert: <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of the Univerſe.</note>
                  <q>Neither can the Souls of Brutes, ſaith a late Learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, be imagined to be Flame and Fire; for Flame and Fire is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſuch a Motion of the Inſenſible Parts of a Body, as whereby they are violently agitated, and many times diſſipated for begetting thoſe Flames of Light and Heat in the Animals:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44923:39"/>Now there is no difficulty at all in conceiving that Inſenſible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of a Body which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Quieſcent, may be put into Montion; this being nothing but a new Modification of them, and no Entity really diſtinct from the Subſtance of the Body; as Life, Senſe, and Cogitation are; and therefore it is but a crude Conceit of Atheiſts and Corporealiſts, That Souls are nothing but Fiery and Flammeous Bodies; for tho Heat in the Bodies of Animals, be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inſtrument for the Life and Soul to act by in them, yet it is a thing really diſtinct from Life. We might alſo add, That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Hypotheſis the Souls of Animals could not be Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ſame thro the whole ſpace of their Lives, ſince that Fire, that needs a Pabulum to prey on, doth not always continue one and the ſame Numeric Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the Soul of a new-born Animal could no more be the ſame with the Sould of that Animal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years after, than the Flame
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44923:40"/>of a new-lighted Candle is the ſame with that which twinkles in the Socket; which indeed are no more the ſame, than a River or Stream is the ſame at ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time: Which Reaſon may be farther extended to prove the Soul to be no Body at all, ſince the Bodies of Animals are in a perpetual Flux.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Neither are they Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins.</note> Concerning the Second Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, which is the <hi>Carteſian,</hi> give me leave to ſay with an Ingenous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Nec demum negaverim, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, animalium corpora eſſe Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas miro artificio coagmentatas, ſed nihil eſſe quam Machinas, qua nihil ſentiant, nihil agant ac pulſu tantum agitentur alieno, id vero adduci non poſſum ut credam; at que eos qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicunt appello, an nullam in cane Venatico cum per compendia viarum leporem inſequitur nullam in lepori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus cum per varios flexus canes inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentes cludunt, nullam in beſtiis quae predâ vivunt, aut cognitionem immo &amp; caliditatem &amp; varios ut it a dicam ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes animadverterunt?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44923:40"/>
               <p>
                  <q>I will not deny, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> but that the Bodies of Animals are Machins by admirable Artifice compacted together, but that they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Machins without Senſe and Action, and only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Extern Impulſe, is a thing I can never be reduced to believe; and I challenge thoſe that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict me, to tell me, Whether in a Hungting Dog that follows the Hare the ſhorteſt way, or in a Hare indeavoring to delude the Dogs by her various turnings, or in thoſe Beaſts that live upon the Prey, they have not obſerved ſome Cognition, Sagacity, yea may I ſay Various Arts?</q> What do theſe Mechanics intend; who do not only deprive Brutes of Cognition, but alſo of Senſe? O abſurdity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common Experience! Do we not daily ſee Brutes (I mean the more perfect ones) to receive Sounds in their Ears, and thereby excited to Labour, Meat, Drink, and divers Actions? And who will deny that a Dog, a Cat, or an Ape, do diſcern their Food by Smells?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44923:41"/>And certainly this Hypotheſis was not dreamt on when this Diſtic was made:
<q>
                     <l>Nos Aper auditu, Linx viſu, ſimia guſtu,</l>
                     <l>Vultur odoratu: praeceelit Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea tactu.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That Brutes are Senſeleſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate things can no way be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; how then could Spiders ſo Geometrically weave their Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, and Bees ſo exactly form their Cellula's of an Hexagonic or Sexangular Figure? How could Foxes by that craft and cunning catch Birds, and deceive the Dogs that purſure them? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">But that Brutes alſo have Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Souls.</note> The Third Hypotheſis then is that which ſeems to be moſt Genuine and Rational: <hi rend="margQuotes">For if the Soul of Brutes be not Incorporeal, the Soul of Man can never be proved to be Incorporeal; for either all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious or Cogitative Beings are Incorporeal, or elſe nothing can be evinced to be Incorporeal</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44923:41"/>Thoſe very things which we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioned before to prove the Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality of the Soul of Man, are apparently to be ſeen in Brutes, as Activity, Diſcourſive Faculty, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, Cogitation, Cognition, and Sagacity, and the Actions we daily ſee performed by them, ſeem more like the Actions of Rational Souls than of Dead and Senſeleſs Matter; as Doubting, Reſolving, Inventing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is evident in Hawks, Dogs, Jaccals, Foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then by the Docility of them, and certain Continuate Actions of a long Tract of Time, ſo orderly performed by them, that they ſeem to argue Knowledge in them, rather than to proceed from Brutiſh Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Nay more, in ſome Beaſts there is Preſcience of Future Events and Providences, the Knowing of Things never ſeen before, and ſuch other Actions obſerved in ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, which ſeem to be even above the Reaſon that is in Man himſelf.<label type="milestone">

                  </label> Neither indeed is the Objection of any conſequence, which our Adverſaries would retort
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44923:42"/>upon us, <hi>That this Hypotheſis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo the Souls of Brutes to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; which is a Notion dangerous and deſtructive</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to the Rules of Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="Answ."/>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That there ſeems to be no great Reaſon why it ſhould be thought abſurd to grant Perpetuity of Duration, to the Souls of Brutes, any more than to every Atome of Matter or Particle of Duſt in the whole World; ſo that this Objection hath nothing of validity in it; for they are Durable, whether Corporeal or Incorporeal: For Heaven and Earth, and all the parts conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, will never be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but metamorphized and changed: And ſo the innumerable Company of Souls that were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, may very well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſurvive their ſeparation from the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44923:42"/>to be capable of that Felicity or Miſery the Souls of Men are; but we may either ſuppoſe them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> or Soul of the World; which may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be ſuppoſed to be Immaterial, and ſo return to it at the Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or rather, that when they are diveſted of their Bodies, they take to themſelves Aereal ones. Some there are that will not admit, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode Aereal Vehicles; who ſuppoſe, That the Souls of them ſurviving Death, doth ſo continue in a State of Inactivity, Inſenſibility, Sleep, Silence, and Stupor, until by a Tranſmigration they re-aſſume new Bodies to act in: for while Spirits are diveſted of Bodies, they cannot exert any Action. But this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition would deſtroy our own Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion alrady laid down concerning the Active and Cogitant Nature of the Soul.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44923:54"/>to us; it preſently excites in us the Paſſion or Affection of Love to it,<note place="margin">Cartes.</note> that we proſecute it with a deſire, that it may either be united to us, or remain with us; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when any evil or noxious thing is expoſed to us, it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtimulates us to Hatred the oppoſite Affection: to Love as it is an Affection of Union with preſent Good is often joyned Joy, and to Hatred Sadneſs; and when there is a full and perfect poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this deſired Good, then there is pure Love, and ſolid and ſincere Rejoycing; but when there is not a perfect Fruition of the thing beloved, then Deſire is joyned with Love, and Sadneſs is mixed with Rejoycing. Likewiſe, with a deſire of Abſent good there is mixed Hope and Fear, according to the probability of a good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Event, Iſſue, Effect, or Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the matter; which Hope, if it be very great, is called Faith and Confidence; but when ſmall or no hope is mixed with abundance of fear, it degenerates into thoſe ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44923:54"/>Affections of Unbelief and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Theſe Affections, eſpecially Love and Deſire, do vary and differ much, according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we have of the value of the Object; for when the intrinſic or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perfection and pulchritude of the Object is only look'd upon, then there is a Love of Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Object is properly ſaid to pleaſe; to this is oppoſed an Averſion from an Object, by the conſideration of the contrary Imperfection and Deformity, but when we conſider of this Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as convenient for our ſelves, and ſee it agreeable with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;<note place="margin">How Love is cauſed, its ſeveral kinds.</note> this Love of Complacency is turned into a Love of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, which is another Affection of the Soul, and properly another kind of Love. Again, When the Lover hath a leſs eſteem of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than of Himſelf, there thence ariſeth a ſimple Propenſion, which is called Benevolence. Thus we love a Flower or Bird, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When we love an Object equally with our ſelves, thence ſprings Friendſhip
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44923:55"/>and Charity, and ſuch is the Love of Parents to Children, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Relations one to another; but when there is a higher Valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Object than of our Selves, as we all ought to have of God, our Prince, City, Countrey, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Friends, that are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

There is no Affection of the Soul but Love hath it at command; the Will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all inferiour Faculties of the Soul; but ſhe is governed by Love. <hi>Plato</hi> makes Love to be the great <hi>Hero</hi> that governs the World, ſo univerſal is its Empire and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. If the Object beloved be abſent, then Love fixes the Will with ardent deſires after it; if the Abſence be attended with Difficulties or Affronts, than Love goes forth by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44923:55"/>Anger and Fear, to conflict there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and Hope with Courage, for the attaining the Object beloved. If the Good be preſent, then Love embraceth it with Complacence and Delight; if loſt, then it bewails its loſs with Sorrow, and according to the Nature and Meaſure of the Love, ſuch will be the Nature and Meaſure of the other Affections that iſſue from it: But we will ſay no more of the Affections.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the Subtile and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latle part of it, whoſe Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always expanded, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take their flight, do agitate the groſs Corpuſcles of the other Principles, wherein they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>involved, and ſo keep them in that continual Motion of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is a Principle of a Conſiſtence ſomewhat more craſs than Spirit, and next to it moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; from this Principle ariſeth the variety of Colours and Smells, the pulchritude and deformity of Bodies, and the diverſity of Taſtes in a great meaſure; that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is copious in the Blood, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from this, that we are for the moſt part fed with Fat and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious Things: From the ſolution of this it is very probable that the Crimſon Tincture of the Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, for ſulphureous Bodies do above all others tinge their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Menſtruums with a red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and when, by reaſon of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44923:95"/>the Sulphur is not diſſolved, the Blood becomes pale and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and will ſcarce make red a Linnen Cloth that is dipt in it. The Maſs of Blood thus impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, with a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Sulphur, together with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Spirits, becomes very fermenteſcible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salt</hi> (which is a principle of a Nature, more fixt than either Spirit or Sulphur, neither ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Volatility) is that which makes Bodies compact and ſolid, alſo ponderous and durable; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the coagulation of Bodies and Retards their Diſſolutions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts Corruptions and Inflamability, and becauſe Spirit and Sulphur are too Volatile, it fixeth them by its embracing them; that this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is in the Blood is manifeſt by its Guſto; when the ſaline Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Blood, are not enough exalted, by reaſon of a bad Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but remain crude, and for the moſt part fixt, the Blood hence becomes thick and unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its due circulation; ſo that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44923:95"/>from hence ariſe Obſtructions in the Bowels and ſolid parts, and hence Serous Crudities are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandantly generated; but if by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Deficience and Depreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, the Salt be too much exalted and reduced to a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, a ſharp auſtere Diatheſis doth then accoſt the Blood, ſuch as is obſerved in Scorbutic Perſons, and in thoſe that are attended with Quartian Agues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phlegm</hi> or Water, which is the Vehicle of Sulphur and Spirit, and the Medium to unite them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Salt; for the other Principles being diſſolved, or at leaſt diluted in this, are kept in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but without it they become ſtiff and congealed; it is upon this Principle that the Fluidity of the blood depends; hereby alſo its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration and Aduſtion is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and its Heat tempered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Earth,</hi> is that which gives Conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Magnitude to Bodies, by this the too great Volatilization of the Blood and its Accenſion is hindered.</p>
               <p>Now tho theſe Principles are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44923:96"/>thoſe whereof the Maſs of Blood be compoſed, yet this doth not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our former Aſſertion of the four Humours; for while the Blood is circulating in its containing Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſome of its Parts do continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wax old, and new ones do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Deficience; hence, either by Crudity, or too much Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſomething of neceſſity muſt become uſeleſs and Excrementici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which by the Fermentation and Efferveſcence of the Blood (as in the Efferveſcence and Depuration of Wine) it is ſecerned and ſeperated from its Maſs: Thus that watery Humour that is percolated in the Cavities of the Stomach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, is called Phlegm; thoſe Particles of Salt and Sulphur, and and ſome other aduſt ones ſecerned in the Liver, and received by the <hi>Vaſa Choledocha,</hi> is that which they call Bile or Choler; and the Earthy Feculencies, ſometimes in the Spleen, is that we call Melancholy.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44923:103"/>the Fluid do obtund their points and edges; thus the corroding ſharpneſs of the Spirit of Vitriol is taken away by Salt of Tartar or Wormood; and ſaith <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> 
                  <q>Salt of Tartar hath a great power in allaying the turbulent Acrimony of Melancholic Humours; for by an intrinſic property in attracts all their ſharpneſs: Thus if we diſtil an Ounce of Tartar with two quarts of the ſtrongeſt Vinegar, a Water will ariſe without any Acidity.</q> And truly it is very probable that the reaſon why Melancholy Perſons find ſo much benefit from Medicines of Tartar, is that by ſweetning the Blood and Juice in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that dulcifies Vineger; the Tartar frees the Body from thoſe inconveniences which are cauſed by their pungency and acrimony; The way and manner how the Blood doth degenerate from a ſweet and balſamic Conſtitution into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor altogether ſharp, harſh, and unpleaſant; and how this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is effected, ought a little to be enquired into.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Ages of Man.</head>
               <p>HAving curſolarily ſailed over the wide Seas of this Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſm, both as to the Soul, and as to the Parts, Temperments, and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body, and alſo in reſpect of the difference of the Sexes: We come now to enter upon our laſt, Voyage, which when we have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, we ſhall draw in our Lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sails, and enter into our laſt Port and Haven, where we hope to find a ſucceſsful Harbour. Here then it is incumbent on us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Man being a Creature not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Simple, Homogeneous, and Elementary Matter, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeveral diſtinct and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what contrary Principles, and that not in equal proportion, but one alwayes having predominance over
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44923:120"/>another, it cannot be expected he ſhould always continue in ſuch a State and <hi>Craſis</hi> of Body as he was born with; for the Natural Heat making uſe of the Primogenial Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, cannot but by degrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and waſte it, it ſelf alſo by its continual motion and the reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſome Principles hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible, is very much debilitated and diminiſhed; hence the habit of Bodies is render'd fluxible, and Man paſſes in a ſhort time, as it were out of one <hi>Craſis</hi> and Conſtitution of Body into another, ſo that the ſpace in which ſuch like mutations as theſe are made, is properly termed an Age:<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ages of Man.</note>The Ages of Man (not to divide them according to the Rules of Lawyers and Aſtrologers, but as is moſt conſiſtent to the Canons of Phyſic, and moſt redounds to the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44923:120"/>uſe of Phyſicians) are Four; <hi>Pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia,</hi> Childhood, <hi>Juventus,</hi> Youth, <hi>Conſiſtens Aetas,</hi> Middle-Age; <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> Old-Age: Before I particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handle each of theſe, I will only take notice how Nature takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in her Quaternary changes. The Conſtitutions of Men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht by Four Humours and Temperaments, every Diſeaſe by its Four Parts, the Beginning, the Increment, the State, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion. A Year is divided by its four-fold Mutation into ſo many Quarters, and the Ages of Man neither exceed not fall ſhort of this number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pueritia,</hi> or Child-hood,<note place="margin">Child-hood.</note> is from the Birth (or very <hi>Exit</hi> of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> from the confining Cubicle of its Mothers Womb, into the ample Pavilion of a capacious World) to the 25th year of its Age. This Age is, for the moſt part, hot and moiſt; it is again diſtributed into Four Parts, the firſt is Infancy, which is extended to the Fourth, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others to the Seventh
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44923:121"/>Year. The Second <hi>Pueritia,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called to the Fourteenth. The Third <hi>Pubertas</hi> to the Eighteenth. The Fourth <hi>Adoleſcentia,</hi> to the Twenty fifth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an Infant.</note>When the feeble Infant firſt enters upon the Stage of this World, how exactly doth it act the Part of a bewildred ſtranger, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſome wandring Pilgrim, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſome ſtrange and unknown Haven, or one that is baniſh'd out of a comfortable Region, where he could indulge himſelf in what moſt of all delighted him, into ſome exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and deſtitute Countrey; or like a Perſon very well cloathed, who in an inſtant, he knows not how, is ſtript Naked, and ſo expoſed to the Eyes of them whom he never ſaw before: Thus the Infant, after its excluſion from the Womb, looks on this ſide and on that ſide, and in the mid'ſt of Friends ſees no Friend, and then by its Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſeems to expreſs (or at leaſt it is legible in its Face) what <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when among his Friends,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44923:121"/>vocally pronounced, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>O Friends no Friend!</hi> and becauſe it cannot expreſs its own Sentiments, or manifeſt its wants in the unknown Language of that ſtrange Land, which it is now by force and compulſe reduced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, it begins to utter its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in its own proper Tongue; and bewails its forlorn Condition with <hi>Ehu's;</hi> and ſuch like deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interjections; but at laſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neceſſity of its abiding here, it endeavours to acquaint it ſelf with the Modes and Faſhions of the place wherein it is, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Cuſtoms and Practices; it is pleas'd with Toys and Baubles, and the Rattles of Infancy then arride it; and thus he ſpends the two former parts of his Age in Folly and Vanity, and truly the third little better; but when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at the Fourth, which is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleſcentia,</hi> he diveſts himſelf not only of the Swadling Cloaths of his Infancy, but alſo of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood Apparel, and then puts on his Manly Gown; he abjures the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44923:122"/>Trifles he ſo long retained, and throws away all ſuch ſilly Buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and betakes himſelf to thoſe things that have more Solidity in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Youth his Character.</note>The next Age to this is <hi>Youth,</hi> which is Hot, and ſomewhat Dryer than the Age before deſcribed; now the Heat becomes Vigorous and Intenſe, and precipitates the Blood adapted for Motion, into a more than ordinary Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it excites the Appetites to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the things they deſire with a ſtrange kind of Impetuoſity, and hurries them to ſatiate thoſe Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and Concupiſcible Appetites. Now the Body is moſt robuſt, and the vigorous Spirits are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable; now Paſſions are on every ſide ready to accoſt the Man, and ſometimes the violent Impulſes, excited in his Body, make a great impreſſion on his united Mind, and cauſe ſuch a ſtrange influence upon his Soul, that he finds it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to abſtract his Thoughts from thoſe aſſaulting Repreſentations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44923:122"/>into his extravagant, or too inordinate Phantaſie; and thus the Mind doth too often conſent to thoſe Peccaminoſities, to which Youth is too much addicted: And hence it is very requiſite and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Youth, for them to uſe a Bridle to all thoſe unruly Paſſions, that they fly not out into a career of thoſe (whch they think Heroic) Pranks that their Juvenile Age is ſo inclinable unto; or ſo far tranſcend their Sphere or exceed their Limits, as to indulge themſelves in ſuch Helliſh Debaucheries, as always inhanſe a future ſhame.</p>
               <p>I do not conclude but Paſſions are lawful, and where they are regular, none can malign them; the forbidden Object, or the undue meaſure of the Paſſions themſelves, is that which makes them ſinful; for ſuch is the Contexture of a Humane Body, and ſuch is the brisk fluctuating Motion of the Sanguine Liquor, that Man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſpoſed for one Paſſion or other. For when an Object obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44923:123"/>preſented to the Mind, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by it to be of a Nature Evil and Noxious, the Soul is thereby preſently ſtimulated to the Paſſion of Hatred, and thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to an ireful Revenge; but when a pleaſing and delectable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is repreſented, the Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately careſſes it: Hence ariſeth the Paſſion of Love, the Body in the mean time finding a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity between it ſelf and the object beloved, complies to embrace it; and thus it is alſo in reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſions of Youth. This Age continues to the thirty firſt Year, ſome will have it laſt to the Fortieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Age.</note>The Third is <hi>Aetas Conſiſtens,</hi> which begins where the other ends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to the Forty-fifth or Fiftieth Year, it is called the Conſiſtent Age, becauſe thoſe that are in this age do ſeem to ſtay, ſtop, continue, or conſiſt in the ſame ſtate; for tho the ſtrength in this Age doth begin ſomething to be diminiſht, yet this mutation is not evident or percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in the habit or actions of the Body. This Age is commonly cold
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44923:123"/>and dry, and hence more inclinable to <hi>Melancholy</hi> than any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Old Age.</note>The laſt is <hi>Senectus</hi> or <hi>Old-age,</hi> which continues to the very extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Life; this is ſubdivided into three parts. <hi>Prima Senectus</hi> from the Fiftieth Year to the Sixtieth, <hi>Aetas Ingraveſcens</hi> from the Sixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year to the Seventieth, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitude</hi> from the Seventieth Year to the end of Life.
