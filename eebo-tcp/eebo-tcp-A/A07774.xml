         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

let vs make much of it: stoppe it
too soone, it spoiles vs: stay it

therefore exhort you to exclude

Should you become obdurate,

the Lords punishments are to

vnder the <hi>Graue Maurice,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Citty of <hi>Geldre,</hi> hauing
broken open the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

struck through the brest, and fel;
leauing behind him the reward

honorable hopes of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13220:6"/>
Hee was borne at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in his

            <p>Nature hath wept out the

and piety weepe their
partes, for they haue their
springs of sorrow as well as the
other: though not so fluent, not
so abundant; yet more pure,
more excellent, more eternall.
When Nature hath drain'd the
source of her teares dry, then
come these two, and supplie
sorrowes current.</p>
            <p>What, shall I then speake
out my woes, or shall I entombe
them in silence? I had but one
<pb facs="tcp:13220:7"/>
one onely sonne, perhaps I shall
neuer haue more. This sonne,
our God bestowed bountifully
vpon our vowes: and this same
sonne (our God) our vowes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
dutifully vnto thee, and
that instantly after. Hee was but

giuen him vs, when wee gaue

Grace hir selfe was the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
the Midwife that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him from his Mother, gaue

houre of birthe: so did Piety

contention of the corporall and

neither did his strength make
him decline vnto pride, his good
shape to loosenesse, his learning
to vanitie, his valour to cruelty,
or his loue of vprightnesse vnto
any sowrenesse of manners: his
towardnesse so happily preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his education, his fruite
stept in before his flower, and
true grauitie tooke place in his
heart, ere any little downe had
spred it selfe on his face. So gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
were these contraries ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

            <p>My sonne, when as yet his
child-hood swayed his estate in
nature, bent his full endeuour to
the attaining perfection in the
principall tongues, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and honourable disciplines:
hee neuer wanted instigation,
but rather inhibition, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
was so toward, and
his towardnesse so forward: and
still as his growth enabled him,
<pb facs="tcp:13220:9"/>
so hee enured himselfe to all il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
exercises, sharing his
time betweene the splendor and
light of learning, and the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and lightning of warre: that
<hi>Mars</hi> did seeme to grudge that
<hi>Minerua</hi> had so great a part in
his perfections. His youth saw
him a traueler in most countries
Christian, extracting what euer
made for vertue, where euer he
found it, and expelling vicious

he met it.</p>
            <p>The industry, and ornament
of each peculiar, was in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
(as in a store-house)
carefully reposed for practise:
the defects and exorbitance of

with the carefullest auoydance
<pb facs="tcp:13220:10"/>
of their least touch, or tainte.</p>

Why, let mee goe meete with

perills, nay now the losse of
mine owne bowells, and nerues,
and yet liue to record the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of mine owne heart-stringes,
nay my heart it selfe?
Thou hadest a King (LORD)
and Israell had a light, who
when hee heard of the death
of his Sonne, albeit hee was
a rebell and would haue beene
a parricide, yet burst out in
a full presence,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18</note> and cried: <hi>O Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salon

               <hi>O</hi> Absalon <hi>my son.</hi>
Thus turned hee the safety of
his people into teares and
mourning, and shamed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of all his seruants, beeing
so loath to leaue the dust hee
layd in, that <hi>Ioab</hi> was faine to
threaten him with the sedition
and departure of the people
from him. What then shal I do?
ah what shall I not doe? hauing

a kinsman, a brother the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>! whom,
(choose which of these you can)
neuer man had a better! what
life is worth loue, nay what
death is not worth life to mee in
this helplesse extremity!</p>
            <p>Oh but, my soule, my soule,

mans waies, nor his life thou

            <p>Therefore say rather to thy

so.</p>
            <p>I am dumbe,<note place="margin">Psa. 39. 1.</note> and doe not open

            <p>But thou (LORD) keepe a

(Lord) that thou see, that my lips

            <p>Ah! but (my gracious Lord)
I am full of (dolorous) matter:
my spirit swells within me, and
compells mee! Behold, my bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is as the wine that hath no
vent: &amp; wanting vent, resembles
the embotteled aire that
breakes through all that bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>Therefore I wil speake (I thinke
it bee best) that I may take
some breath, against this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
excesse of sorrowe. Thou
knowest (LORD of all mine,
and all others life) what I ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at, in my Sonne, my scope
in him was not excluded from
thy supereminent vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Had I any thought, any

intent but to imploy his lustre
wholy to the illustration of thy
glory, the Churches good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and his Kings &amp; countries
grace? no, no, I consecrated his
yeeres in their fullest maturity,
his vnderstanding, in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
perfection, wholy and soly
to those sacred employments.
At that, all my vowes leuelled;
vnto that, all my prayers ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
with that, all mine instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concluded; &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi>, all mine
endeuours were bounded: that,
ah! nothing but that, was the
center from which all my cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were drawne, and the

it was thy pleasure (Lord) in
the meane space, to make mee
the point, the marke, where-at
thou wouldest shoote, so that I
<pb facs="tcp:13220:14"/>
am now become mine owne

thorow, &amp; that through the sides
of mine onely sonne: striking
Father and childe starke dead
both at one stroke. Alas, thou

become deafe? is thine heart
growne obdurate also: is that
that eternall, neuer-dried foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

Therefore are thy iudgements
deep, &amp; thy mercies a boundles,
a soundlesse depth: thou giuest
these, as Cauterismes in Phisick,
not as hurtes in hostilitie. Wee
thoght thou hadst not heard our

whome thou hadst but shewen

wee might (vnto our more

him swallowed, and haue swum
after that Funerall in a Sea of

            <p>Once againe, here Lord, seale
vp my lippes: once more, here
binde mine organs of speech:
for the flesh rebels, and compels
<pb facs="tcp:13220:15"/>
me, nor see I meanes to bridle
it, it is growne so head-strong,
and so impatient of suppression.
It bids mee say, why tookest
thou him away ere his time?
thou inexorable creditor that
wouldest not stay thy day, but
catche him vp ere his fate was
ready to call him.</p>
            <p>True, thou fraile flesh and
bloud: why was it not his time
to take him, that was Times
Creator? and what is fate, but
the will of GOD the Father?
And what better limite hath
life in any of vs all, then the rest
from all our labour? And what
matter is it whether the ship of
our mortality bee brought to
the hauen by a sterne tempest,
or a gentle gale? by winde, or
by tide? had not hee that from

all eternitye predestinated the
moment of his birthe, the same
power to decree the houre of
his death by? If thou haue any

to stagger for want of stayes
from their loynes, and to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

bathing their barrennesse in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of teares. And what hast
thou foregone that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
so grieue at? a modell of
vertue, whom all men respected
more then hee in whom it was
resident: a patterne of honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honesty, forcing praise from
others, and following nature in
himselfe: Ah fixe thy fickle
heart and giue the Deity his due
praise! How often are the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the wicked, shiuered in
sunder with the winde. Nay let
vs grant them (that which God
seldome granteth,) their full
growth: the fruite they bring, is
vnprofitable, not relishing any
taste, nor befitting any vse. But
<pb facs="tcp:13220:18"/>
call thy thoughts home to thine
owne issue: why in him, his
sweetnesse of fruite thrust his
sweete blossome from the stalke,
his vnparalleld vertue pressed
out the delicious iuice of his
sweete fruite, and left it to bee
casked vp by all succeeding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.
And now the tents of
the godly are perfumed with
his rare, and redolent fragrancie:
his heate, nay and that in the
height, his ardor, armes, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
them all to emulation of
vertue. Time ranked many with
him in respect of age, and gaue
his fore-lock into diuerse hands
assoone as his, yet were there not
any of his time that knit that
lock into so many knots of vertue
as he did: what canst thou grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
further at? yet mee thinkes
<pb facs="tcp:13220:18"/>
thou art not satisfied: oh thou
wouldst faine haue had him, as
thou thoughtst thou hadst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
him, to beene the heire

and haue suruiued to haue inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited

            <p>I pray thee now looke after
him once for mee, that hast
longed so for him in thy selfe.
Now, blind man, hath he not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
his heritage himselfe, and
is he not now seized of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
inheritance where thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
share with him with all
thine heart? hath hee not left
thee, his countrie, and the church
possessed with as plentifull and
as pleasant fruit, as such a greene
stock as his could possibly bring
<pb facs="tcp:13220:19"/>
to perfection? yes: and GOD
himselfe hath layde it vp in his
<hi>Granary:</hi> &amp; that I thinke makes
thee most melancholie, because
thou thinkest that God hath lost
the more absolute vse that thy
sonnes farther yeares might
haue affoorded him.</p>
            <p>Goe to, keepe thy selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and let Gods losses lye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne hand: it is in his
power out of this heape of
stones, to rayse himselfe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
the country souldiers, and
the Church supporters: cannot
he fill the heauens with legions
of Saints, the earth with hoasts
of Protectors, and his Church

hee must bee faine to take a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible

stand drawing out the life of this

man or that, longer then his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity

            <p>Why so then, I am satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
giue mee leaue, I will now
take the bitte out of my mouth
my selfe, and plead the cause of

bench, or in that celestiall starre-chamber,
and remooue them
from possession by a bill of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
but few such suites go
forward: the world comes with

&amp; either too easily (GOD

therein? What hold hath any
one that is once ouer the shooes
in iniquity, vpon any thing that
may saue him from slipping in
ouer the shoulders? &amp; what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
had the court of heauen
granted our sonne more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
had he a lease of his soules
life letten him? none.</p>
            <p>And wee see, (and might learne
<pb facs="tcp:13220:21"/>
by sight of it) that vertue when
it is exalted, and eleuate, if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
once to drawe damnation
in, it becometh graduate in the
most extreame degree of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.
Yes. yes, when good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
once misseth the true tract,
and lights into the broade way
of blacke destruction, it will
hardlye heare of any reclaime,
but maketh the more speede to
mischiefe, and runnes headlong
to euident ruine.</p>
            <p>So then, was it not better for
our sonne to haue taken paye
for a little space in the Campe
of Vertue, then to haue beene
enranked as an olde attendant
in the Court of vice? and had
hee not better haue beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to an houres sharpe
toyle, then to a yeares subtle
<pb facs="tcp:13220:21"/>
temptation? Thinke but of him
as hee was indeed. A youth of
an egregious alacritye, a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
spirit, and an vnbounded
ayme. His vigorous vertue
would enter vpon any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
and generally the effect
would answere his endeauour:
his valour found no obstacle so
obstinate but it would through
it, and bring glorie through
it againe? breaking the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of the most sollid opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and mounting his honor
vpon the rubbish of their ruined
forces.</p>
            <p>Now beeing such an one (and
such hee was indeed!) his heart
lay open to all the assaults of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
of glory: desire of renowne
(you know) might soone haue
put him out of the pace that
<pb facs="tcp:13220:22"/>
vertue had taught him: ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a great fowler, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
cunning in her baytes:
why might not hee haue start
out, and haue slipt into one of
her sprindges? might not that
(holy) hunger after honor haue
turned his wrong side outward
and haue led him cleere out of
the sight of sobriety in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
yes, and this hunger is most
commonly an vtter enemie to
the temperate diet of vertue,
and cannot endure to eate any
thing that moderation prouid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Besides, lofty spirits (if they
bee really eleuate) can neuer
brooke the horrible decay of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
worth in these decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
times, and this Sunne-set
of the world, but will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:13220:22"/>
flie out, and aduance their
spirit in his ful freedome against
these ages neglect of the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
worthie, and then comes
porte and power, together
with their appendants or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
and treades out the light
of their most glorious lustre: Ah
this is too true, and thus might
our sonne haue beene lost, had
hee liued any longer.</p>
            <p>But indeede true sorrowe
will alwaies build vpon false
grounds to augment it selfe, if
it bee not taken vppe in time,
and if it once gette heade, it
will haue a reason to shewe
for any vnreasonable passion
that it shall entertaine. In truth
it is true.</p>
            <p>For hee that greeueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedlie,
greeueth also that
<pb facs="tcp:13220:23"/>
any one should hold his griefes
cause not sufficient to procure
a greater affect of sorrow then
hee endureth. But tell mee
now I pray thee (louing wife)
wouldst thou not haue lost thy
sonne? no, wouldst thou not
haue had him transported from
this ruined state that earth stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in, vnto that excellence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternity
that heauen affordeth?
yes. Why, now then, seeing that
thou seest hee hath preuented
thine expectation, and is gotten
vp thether long before thou
thoughtst hee should, why hast
not thou reason to say with the
wise man:<note place="margin">Wis. 4. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He pleased God, and was
beloued of him, so that where as hee
liued amongst sinners, hee trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
him:</hi> This was <hi>Henock</hi> (wife)
a man that was full of the feare
<pb facs="tcp:13220:23"/>
of God. <hi>And hee was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
least wickednesse should alter
his vnderstanding, and least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
should haue beguiled his
minde.</hi> And thus, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
but thus, hath our glorious
GOD taken away our Sonne,
like a good Father, who seeing
his Sonne placed in the broadest
beeach of peruersenesse, takes
him out of danger in time, least
hee should bee drawne into too
euident danger, and bee strucke
downe by one shot or other
from the assaylant enemy: The
deluge of wickednesse, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
couered the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Godlinesse, and good
manners; and therefore blessed
be God that hath set our son in a
place of so blessed security.</p>
            <p>The sonnes of men growe
<pb facs="tcp:13220:24"/>
more and more peremptory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the prescriptions of the

goodnesse are so weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that iniquity and antiquity
hath almost left no character
thereof vndefaced: the rust of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiousnes
hath eaten into the
most steely tempers of our age:
&amp; had our son (thinkest thou) any
especiall protection promised
him? no, effect in others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
this to vs. Wipe away
those teares once more that gush
out in such abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dance (seeming
as if hee were not dead already,
to drowne him in his graue:) and
consider but this: How inumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and almost ineuitable trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
are set in the tract of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
in all her walkes? Here you
shall haue one that will kisse the
<pb facs="tcp:13220:24"/>
visar of vertue: but shew them
her true face, and you turne all
their kisses vnto curses.</p>
            <p>You shall haue other some
that while shee is vnderfoote,
will lend her a hand to helpe her
vp: but when shee is vppe and
hath gotten wing, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
then they either suspect
hir themselues, or buzze
suspicions of her into the heads
of others.</p>
            <p>Affording hir all their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
culture while shee is a
springing, but growing once
aloft, they make haie of
her ere shee come to her
hight, and rend her vp by the

            <p>And then there is that
pestilence reigning euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men of equallity, in
<pb facs="tcp:13220:25"/>
what ranke soeuer, I meane <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vye:</hi>

vpon the ruine of that glorie
which shee cannot reach: it is

is the source of all the grudges,

            <p>But what comfort canst thou
haue of this, or I, that share
with thee in this sorrow if wee
stand shaking our hands, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
our hearts against GOD,
who is the onely consolation in

of misery.</p>
            <p>Why? but God might haue
shielded him from all these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
of vicious extreames.
You neede not tell mee that:
I know hee might: but had hee
not made him a fraile mortall?
<pb facs="tcp:13220:27"/>
nay, and had hee not appointed
him a place in warres, and instil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Military vigor into him?
Being euery day betweene the

not be catcht at length? is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to stand in a shower of hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
&amp; haue not one to touch

            <p>GOD had made him valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:

in daring of death, and so
ouer-taken in his too much heat,
and too little dread. God had
made him with an heart that
put forth his rigour in all the
endeuoures of masculine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</p>
            <p>Alas, what was hee in this,

to shake downe into ruine?</p>
            <p>Didst thou looke to haue him

What warrant hath GOD

            <p>How much more com fort
should we finde, and how much
more easily should wee settle
the rebellious affects that keepe
this coyle in our bosomes, if
wee would steppe a little out of

suffer our imaginations to bee
<pb facs="tcp:13220:28"/>
guided vnto Truth by the sette

            <p>Death ending man in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

            <p>And now tell mee true (<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratis

<pb facs="tcp:13220:29"/>
to see our beloued sonne
deliuered from those complete

that enuironed him on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

and that thou hast afflicted me, for

God is</hi> (euer) <hi>good vnto Israel, and

            <p>He is so, and when his wrath

<pb facs="tcp:13220:29"/>
and on him will I build my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
            <p>And now shall my mouth bee
shutte no more: but I will turne
it into a Trumpet, in the cause

This will I resound, and of this
shall all the world returne an
Eccho, <hi>Thou hast done it O Lord,
and well hast thou done it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well hast thou done it: for
thou canst doe nothing but well:
being thy selfe the neuer dryed
Well of goodnesse. Vnto the
good, nothing befalls but good:
come it in neuer so horred a
shape of mischiefe; in a forme
neuer so fearefull.</p>
            <p>Well hast thou done vnto our

perillous conflicts where-into
<pb facs="tcp:13220:30"/>
hee had nowe set foote (and
that was all, if hee had done
that) and bestowing his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<hi>gratis</hi> vpon him nay and
besides, crowned him with a
Garland of such glory. Had hee
liued longer, hee might haue
runne astray the more, the larger
weight of worldly experience
might haue bent him downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and haue fixed his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vpon fading glories. For
there was <hi>Salomon,</hi> whose emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of wisdome is by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity
of wisdome it selfe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
vnto all after ages, as also
his fall is, beeing the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazefull

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13220:30"/>
Oh what a goodly haruest of
glory had fallen to him, had hee
fallen sooner himselfe. What a
lasting disgrace be-rusted his
lustre by his liues lasting so
long? The world seeth it, and
sighes to see it.</p>
            <p>Well hast thou done also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

vnknowne to thee, what an
anxiety, and restlesse disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of thought possessed mee,
concerning his passage out of

like a feuer still hung at mine
heart-strings, in doubt of his
deliuerance from these dangers,
<pb facs="tcp:13220:31"/>
which now I see effected, now
is hee, after all my cares, after

It is the Lord God of hoastes that

            <p>LORD giue vs grace, O
LORD giue thy seruant and

Let our life be in thy

<pb facs="tcp:13220:35"/>
vs haue the end of al our labours.
For wee are sure, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
liueth and that hee shall
stand the last vpon earth.</p>
            <p>That is thy Christ (O Lord)
euen our onely Sauiour and
supporter. And though that
wormes turne all our one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
into themselues, yet shall
wee resume the selfe same flesh,
and behold the blessed in his
Maiesty with these selfe same
eyes.</p>
            <p>And there and then shall wee
see our Sonne againe (deere
wife): yes assuredly, in these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bodies, wee our selues and no
other for vs, shall see him in that
selfe same house of flesh that hee
held on earth, and in no other.
O thou incomprehensible, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,

vnbounded, indiuidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

            </p>
            <p>IN these teares (beloued wife) and
in this manner of sorrow, it is no

graduates: Wee may weepe
lawfully thus, as long as the
streames that raine from our eyes,
do not make the riuer of our griefes
ouer flowe their bankes, so then,
keeping this channell, let them
droppe from our cheekes eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
Let vs make vs pearles of
them, which no bloud, no vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
may euer dissolue. Wee
<pb facs="tcp:13220:36"/>
must say, adieu the worldes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
needes must wee then lay

Adieu then <hi>Philip</hi> our sonne,
for a while, and welcome
<hi>Iesus</hi> our Sauiour
