            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SEeing you are pleas'd to think fit that these Papers
should come into the publick, which were at first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to live only in a Desk, or some private friends
hands; I humbly take the boldness to commit them
to the Security which your name and protection will
give them with the most knowing part of the world. There
are two things especially in which they stand in need of your
defence. One is, that they fall so infinitely below the full
and lofty Genius of that excellent Poet, who made this way
of writing free of our Nation: The other, that they are so
little proportion'd and equal to the renown of that Prince
on whom they were written. Such great Actions and Lives
deserving rather to be the Subjects of the Noblest Pens and
<pb facs="tcp:50677:7"/>
most Divine Phansies, than of such small beginners and
weak essayers in Poetry, as my self. Against these dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Prejudices, there remains no other  shield than the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Esteem and Authority, which your judgment and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
carries with it. The right you have to them, Sir,
is not only upon the account of the Relation you had to this
great Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of the General favour which all Arts  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from you; but more peculiarly by reason of that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and zeal with which I am bound to dedicate my self to
your service. For, having been a long time the object of
your care and Indulgence towards the advantage of my studies
and fortune, having been moulded, (as it were) by your
own hands, and form'd under your Government; not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
you to any thing which my meaness produces, would not
only be injustice, but sacrilege. So that if there be any thing
here tolerably said, and which deserves Pardon, it is yours,
Sir, as well as he, who is</p>

               <signed>Your most Devoted and
Obliged Servant.</signed>

               <l>Thy Fame, like men, the elder it doth grow,</l>
               <l>Will of it self turn whiter too</l>
               <l>Without what needless Art can do;</l>
               <l>Will live beyond thy breath, beyond thy Hearse,</l>

               <l>Their weaker sparks with thy Illustrious light,</l>
               <l>Will lose themselves in that ambitious thought,</l>

               <l>We know, blest Spirit, thy mighty name</l>
               <l>Wants not Addition of another's Beam;</l>
               <l>It's for our Pens too high and full of Theam.</l>
               <l>The Muses are made great by thee, not thou by them.</l>
               <l>Thy Fames eternal Lamp will live</l>
               <l>And in thy Sacred Urn survive,</l>
               <l>Without the food or Oyl, which we can give.</l>

               <l>Shall pay unto thy Fame, as much as we;</l>
               <l>They too, are made by thee.</l>
               <l>When Fate did call thee to a higher Throne,</l>
               <l>And when thy Mortal work was done,</l>
               <l>When Heaven did say it, and thou must be gon:</l>
               <l>Thou him to bear thy burthen chose,</l>
               <l>Who might (if any could) make us forget thy loss:</l>
               <l>Nor hadst thou him design'd,</l>
               <l>Had he not been</l>
               <l>Not only to thy Blood, but Vertue Kin;</l>
               <l>Not only Heir unto thy Throne, but Mind.</l>
               <l>'Tis He shall perfect all thy Cures</l>
               <l>And, with as sine a Thread, weave out thy Loom.</l>
               <l>So, One did bring the Chosen people from</l>
               <l>Their Slavery and Fears,</l>
               <l>Led them through their Pathless Road,</l>
               <l>Guided himself by God,</l>
               <l>He brought them to the Borders: but a Second hand</l>
               <l>Did settle and Secure them, in the Promis'd Land.</l>

            <l>WE must resign; Heav'n His great Soul do's claim</l>
            <l>In storms as loud, as His <hi>Immortal Fame:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His dying <hi>groans,</hi> his last <hi>Breath</hi> shakes our Isle,</l>
            <l>And Trees uncut fall for His <hi>Funeral Pile,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>About His palace their broad Roots are tost</l>
            <l>Into the Air; So <hi>Romulus</hi> was lost:</l>
            <l>New <hi>Rome</hi> in such a Tempest mis't their King,</l>
            <l>And from <hi>Obeying</hi> fell to <hi>Worshipping.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50677:15"/>
On <hi>Oeta</hi>'s top thus <hi>Hercules</hi> lay dead,</l>
            <l>VVith ruin'd Okes and Pines about him spread:</l>
            <l>The Poplar too, whose bough he wont to wear</l>
            <l>On his Victorious Head, lay prostrate there.</l>
            <l>Those his last fury from the <hi>Mountain</hi> rent,</l>
            <l>Our dying <hi>Hero,</hi> from the <hi>Continent,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Ravish'd whole <hi>Towns;</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> from <hi>Spaniards</hi> rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>As his last Legacy to <hi>Britain</hi> left.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Ocean</hi> which so long our hopes confin'd,</l>
            <l>Could give no limits to His <hi>vaster mind;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Our Bounds <hi>inlargement</hi> was his latest toyl;</l>
            <l>Nor hath he left us <hi>Prisoners</hi> to our <hi>Isle;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Under the <hi>Tropick</hi> is our language spoke,</l>
            <l>And part of <hi>Flanders</hi> hath receiv'd our yoke.</l>
            <l>From Civil Broils he did us disingage,</l>
            <l>Found nobler objects for our Martial rage;</l>
            <l>And with wise <hi>Conduct</hi> to his Country show'd</l>
            <l>Their Ancient way of conquering <hi>abroad.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Ungrateful then, if we no Tears allow</l>
            <l>To him that gave us Peace and Empire too.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Princes</hi> that fear'd him, <hi>grieve,</hi> concern'd to see</l>
            <l>No pitch of glory from the Grave is free.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nature</hi> her self took notice of his death,</l>
            <l>And <hi>sighing</hi> swel'd the Sea with such a breath</l>
            <l>That to remotest Shores her Billows rold,</l>
            <l>Th' approaching Fate of her <hi>great-Ruler</hi> told.</l>
