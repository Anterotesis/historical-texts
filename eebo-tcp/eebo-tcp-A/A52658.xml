            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Impartiall Narrative, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHereas it is probable the late Impriſonment and publick Triall, will be by ſome miſreported of our Brethren and Friends unto the Nation: And very many no doubt do deſire to have the paſſages of the buſines truly related. I have thought it neceſſary (howſoever briefly) to ſet forth an impartial &amp; faithful <hi>Narrative</hi> of it; without any ſtretching of things, either for our ſelves, or againſt our Perſecutors. Neither ſhall I ſay more (our Enemies themſelves being Judges) than the plain Truth ſoberly and modeſtly, leaving every man to make his own Application.</p>
            <p>Upon the firſt day of the ſecond moneth commonly called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> 1658. Many of the Lords People being Aſſembled together in <hi>Swan Alley</hi> in <hi>Coleman ſtreet</hi> (a publick place where Saints have met many years) As they were there waiting upon the Lord in Prayer and other holy duties, on a ſudden the <hi>Marſhall of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> with ſeverall other Officers, ruſhed in with great violence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The which ſight for the ſuddenneſſe and ſtrangneſſe of it, occaſioned ſome amazement among the people; who were there peaceably worſhipping God in ſpirit and Truth: having no other weapons but Faith and Prayer.</p>
            <p>Old Brother <hi>Cann</hi> was then in the Pulpit, and had read a place of Scripture but ſpoken nothing to it, the Scripture was <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Now he perceiving that they came in at both doores with their Halberts, Pikes, Staves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fearing leaſt there might be ſome hurt done to the Lords poor and naked people: He deſired the Brethren and Siſters to be all quiet, and to make no ſtir: for his part he feared them not, but was aſſured the Lord would eminently ſtand by them.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was thus ſpeaking to the people, exhorting them to patience, one of the Officers (breaking through the croud) came furiouſly upon him, and with great violence pluckt him out of the Pulpit, and when he had ſo done, hurled him over the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Forms, in a very barbarous manner. Some Brethren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100102:3"/>
nigh endeavoured to have ſaved Brother <hi>Cann</hi> from falling, but the rage of the Officers was ſuch, as they fell in upon him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though through mercy he had not much hurt by it.</p>
            <p>Having thus a while pull'd and halled him, at laſt they brought him to the <hi>Mayor of the City,</hi> who was without the doore (with one of the Sheriffs on horſe-back) waiting for the Brethren to be taken and brought to him. The Brother asked the Mayor, <hi>What he had againſt him, telling him,</hi> withall, for his part, <hi>he deſired no more favour at his hands, than was allowed to Thieves and Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that is, to know what they had to charge him with, and who were his accuſers.</hi> To which the Mayor Anſwered, Mr. <hi>Cann</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have nothing againſt you, neither do I know any evill you have done; but think you are an honeſt man, onely you muſt appear before his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I will ſend you thither preſently. No ſaith the Sheriff, keep him till tomorrow morning, and then ſend him.</hi> And ſo the Mayor bid one of his Officers to carry our brother to the Counter. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they brought ſeven more to the <hi>Mayor,</hi> of which number, five had never ſpoken in that Meeting place, but came onely to hear: Now that which occaſioned their apprehending and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to priſon, it was becauſe they ſpake againſt the cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane dealing exerciſed upon Brother <hi>Cann,</hi> ſaying, aloud, <hi>He is an old man and do not uſe him ſo barbarouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having brought eight of them to the <hi>Counter</hi> with Halberts, Staves: here preſently begun a new trouble, for the Keeper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither a Warrant for their Commitment, nor knowing who they were; comes to enquire for their Names, all refuſed to tell him their names except Brother <hi>Cann</hi> (whoſe name they knew before) whereupon they were all ſeven thruſt into the <hi>cold ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hole,</hi> and would not allow them any Beds to lie on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any other place in the priſon, though they offered them any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able content. In this noiſome place, they were kept all night, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffered the next day to come forth (though the reſt of the Priſoners did) till they were all ſent for by the <hi>Mayor</hi> to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which was about 3, or 4. of the clock in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100102:3"/>When they came to the <hi>Mayors</hi> houſe, he ſent for them one by one into a private room; ſome of the Brethren deſired that they might be heard openly, and that their freinds might be witneſſes to what was ſpoke: But this would not be granted. The firſt that they called, was Brother <hi>Cann;</hi> The <hi>Mayor</hi> asked him, <hi>What he thought of the preſent Government?</hi> his Anſwer was: <hi>For the preſent Goverment, I am not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſatisfied with it.</hi> But <hi>this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not you:</hi> Neither <hi>ſhall I ſpeak now any thing to you about it: but if you ſend me to the Protector, I ſhall tell him what I think concerning this Government. For I have a great deal to ſay to his face, if in ſuch a way as this, I may be brought before him. But for you Sir, this is not our buſineſſe now.</hi> Many words paſſed too and fro, not worth the mentioning here: onely I ſhall note a little, concerning the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall.</hi> He had been a little before in <hi>Coleman ſtreet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and having heard brother <hi>Cann</hi> exerciſe there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave him thanks before the people, <hi>for his good Sermon:</hi> He being now with the <hi>Mayor,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cann</hi> told him what he had ſaid, his Anſwer was, <hi>I confeſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was a good Sermon, but I knew who you meant, even the Lord Protector:</hi> thus he acknowledged the matter to be good, onely the meaning of the brother, that he preſumed to know, and could tell how to apply it.</p>
            <p>Having nothing to lay to the charge of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt Priſoner, nor could enſuare him in his words, they deſired him to withdraw, and ſo he was brought into another room. Then Brother <hi>Day</hi> was called in, and the ſame queſtion put to him, <hi>viz. What he thought of the preſent Government?</hi> Many words paſſed between the <hi>Mayor</hi> and him, but nothing could they draw from him to ſerve their turn, till he told them, that he would give it under his hand, <hi>To prove</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>a Jugler by his own Confeſſion:</hi> and ſo much he did leave with the <hi>Mayor</hi> in a piece of Paper; which was the great Charge that he was afterward Arraigned for.</p>
            <p>Having done with two, and putting them both aſide, Brother <hi>Clark</hi> is called; who is asked (as the former were) <hi>What he thought of the preſent Government?</hi> He told them plainly, <hi>He thought it</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100102:4"/>
               <hi>was not of God,</hi> and gave ſome ſcriptures why he thought o, as <hi>Hoſ. 8. 3, 4, I Sam. 8. 6, 7. Am.</hi> 6. 13. He did acknowledge this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was of God permiſſive, but not by approbation. Theſe words were written down, and made the ground of his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afterward: for till now though they had impriſoned him, yet they had not ſo much as any ſhew of matter againſt him. This being done, they were all three brought before the <hi>Mayor,</hi> who demanded Baile for their appearance at the next <hi>Seſſions;</hi> they told him they were not free to give him any Baile: Then he told them, they muſt go back from whence they came, and ſo ſent them again to the <hi>Counter,</hi> not charging them with any guilt or crime. For the other five, they were likewiſe called one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the ſame queſtion put to them, <hi>viz. What they thought of the preſent Government?</hi> But our Freinds ſaid little to it: But askt the Mayor what he had againſt them, and wherefore he had Committed them to priſon? To which he gave no Anſwer, but that <hi>they had been at the meeting in</hi> Coleman ſtreet. In ſhort, he askt whether they would give Baile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They refuſing it, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent back to the Counter, after the other three. Onely bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ricard</hi> was baild by his Maſter, not that he deſired it, but his Maſter did it of his own accord.</p>
            <p>Among other Brethren which accompanied the priſoners to the Mayors houſe, brother <hi>Belcher</hi> was one, now as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, <hi>the City Marſhall</hi> met him, and askt him if he were not one of their company; yes, ſaith he (bleſſed be God for it) I am one of them: Then ſaid he, you muſt go with me, and ſo brought him to the Mayor, who preſently askt him, <hi>What he thought of the preſent Government?</hi> I am not (ſaid he, bound to accuſe my ſelf, yet I do confeſſe to be one that holds forth a publick Teſtimony againſt the preſent Apoſtacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and came hither to ſtand with the Priſoners <hi>at their firſt Anſwer:</hi> Do you ſo ſaith the Mayor, then you ſhall keep them company in Priſon, and ſo committed him to the Counter with the reſt; no Cauſe or Crime objected to him, nor had he any thing to accuſe him off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100102:4"/>Having kept them about three weeks in priſon, upon the 22. of the <hi>ſecond moneth</hi> towards evening, Brother <hi>Day</hi> was ſent for, and brought to their <hi>Seſſions,</hi> coming before them, with his Hat on, they cauſed it to be pulled off, and commanded him to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goale among the Thieves and Murtherers: But the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was more civill to him, and allowed him a better place: A little while after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was brought again to the Bar, and keeping his Hat on (as before) they took it off: whereupon he told them, he was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> but could very well give them civill reſpect: And therefore what he did now, in refuſing to put off his Hat, it was to ſhew he could not own their Authority, and that they had baſely and unworthily betrayed a moſt glorious and noble Cauſe; yea and the Rights and Liberties of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken, they Read his Charge, which was to this effect; <hi>Having no fear of God before his eyes, nor in his heart, he had maliciouſly and devilliſhly with an open mouth, ſaid that the</hi> Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>was a Jugler, and that he would prove it: And that the</hi> Protector <hi>was a Traitor, and no lawfull Magiſtrate either by God or man, unleſſe by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then they asked him, Guilty, or not guilty?</hi>

            <p>His Anſwer was that he did not well underſtand the quirts and punctilio's of their Law; and in that reſpect being ignorant of their tricks, he knew not how to Anſwer them; but by that light and grace which the Lord had given him in his holy Word, he would Anſwer them; which Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he muſt judge both you and me: You pretend your ſelves to be Chriſtians, and will yee deny me that which Heathens did grant unto <hi>Paul;</hi> then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 35.

For if you were, you would not have betrayed ſo noble a Cauſe: for which thouſands of Gods children have laid down their lives, beſides many thouſands of our dear country-men have ſpilt their blood. And in this regard, he told them, that it was more fit that they ſhould come down from the Bench and ſtand at the Bar where he was; and he and ſuch as had been faithfull to the Intereſt of Chriſt and his People, ſit there and Judge them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he told them, that he was not their match, being a very ignorant creature as to the knowledge of their Laws; but Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> who is known to be an able Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer (as moſt men in the Nation) hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">

            <p>The next day in the morning called <hi>Friday,</hi> our Brother <hi>Day</hi> was brought again to the Bar, the Charge being read, they askt him <hi>Guilty or not?</hi> He told them (as before) he underſtood not their Punctilios in the law; and therefore knew not whether it might be ſafe for him to Anſwer them in their way, becauſe it was ſo contrary to the Scriptures? Some of them replied, It was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and cuſtome of the Court to proceed in ſuch away. To which he made anſwer, that Cuſtoms and wayes, contrary to the holy Scriptures, among Chriſtians ought not to ſtand: And I would rather (ſaid he) looſe my life, than own any of your proceedings or laws, that are againſt the word of God; If the Lord ſtand by me. Now when he perceived the Court to act ſo contrary and oppoſite to the Laws of God; and ſeeing Alderman <hi>Titchbourn</hi> upon the Bench, he called him by name and ſpake to him; you are (ſaith he) a Church member and one of the Bench, how durſt you deny me the way of Scriptures?

               </hi> Further he told him of his <hi>new upſtart Lordſhip,</hi> and what a fearfull Apoſtacy he and others were fallen into: <hi>Titchbourn</hi> told him there were fifteen ſworn men to do him right. Then, ſaid he, I require that my Accuſers may come face to face, and I will Anſwer to my Charge, that is, <hi>prove</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>a Jugler by his own confeſſion.</hi> But they preſt him ſtill to ſay <hi>guilty or not?</hi> and then he ſhould plead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100102:6"/>When he ſaw they would not bring forth any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Witneſſes againſt him, he told them he had much to ſay againſt the <hi>Mayor,</hi> for falſe impriſoning him; and how he fetcht him away from a Meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Bils and Staves, being peaceably together in worſhipping the Lord; and ſo broke the Peace of the Nation, and not he, nor the Brethren with him; for which he expected ſatisfaction.

Whereupon he told them that they proceeded not onely againſt him contrary to the Scriptures, but alſo againſt the poore Priſoners, and that they ſate there not like Judges, but rather as Murtherers; and to prove this, he deſired that he might read ſome Scriptures to them; For by the ſtrength of God (ſaid he) I will make this, which I affirm moſt clear, by the word of God: But they would not ſuffer him to read that Scripture in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3. When he ſaw they would not indure to have any thing mentioned to them from the Scriptures; he told them, he deſired to have nothing to do with them, ſeeing they would not take the word of God for their rule and guide: And did wonder for what end they ſate there? It was Anſwered by ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſate there to maintain the Laws of the Nation, and to do Juſtice. If it be ſo, ſaid he, will ye give me under your hands, if I prove Oliver Cromwell <hi>a Jugler by ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Witneſſes, will ye bring him here to the Bar, and do Juſtice upon him.</hi> He told them withall, he did wonder they were not aſhamed to read ſuch a pack of lies againſt him: Then they bid take him away.</p>

            <p>His Anſwer was, he knew not what they meant: They asked him again, <hi>Guilty or not guilty?</hi> Then he replyed, if I ſhould ſay I am guilty, I ſhould tell you a lye: Again, if I ſhould ſay I am not guilty (that is, have not ſpoken ſome words which are in the Charge) I ſhould alſo tell a lye: And therefore told them plainly, if they would take out ſomething, which was in the Indictment; for the reſt he would own, namely, <hi>That this preſent Power was not of God, and that he is called of God to witneſſe againſt it.</hi> Having ſo ſaid, it was read, for that time, apart from the reſt; whereupon he tels them preſently: Now ſaith he I will prove by Scripture what I have affirmed: Here the <hi>Recorder</hi> ſtops him, and tels him he will ſave him that labor, unto which the priſoner replies, <hi>what I ſay, you in your conſciences know to be ſo?</hi> Then they bid him to ſtand by.

I do confeſſe when I was brought before the Mayor, he asking me what I thought of the preſent Government? I told him I might chuſe whether I would anſwer him in this particular or no: yet this I would ſay to him, what their own Declarations do ſpeak out to the world, and their two Engagements do ſay, and what their Acts of Parliaments do ſay, which I have here in my hands, that do I ſay and Witneſſe for. And further I told the Mayor, that this Power was not of Gods approbation, and gave theſe ſcriptures for it,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 2, 4. 1 Sam. 8. 6, 7. Am. 6. 13. After this he began to touch upon the riſe of their Government, how their Inſtrument was drawn up by 5. or 6. perſons, and was he proclamed <hi>Protector</hi> unknown to the Nation; neither had the Army or people of God knowledge of it, or conſented to it. And for thoſe which went to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> hall at the ſame time, moſt of them knew nothing of the matter till they came thither: Beſides what was there done, was contrary to their own Oaths, Declarations and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. At this the <hi>Recorder</hi> ſtartled, and was much troubled, that he touched upon the riſe of their Government; but he went on mentioning the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who wiſhed that <hi>all the Lords</hi>

               <hi>people were Prophets:</hi> Now howſoever, ſaid he, you are pleaſed to ſay, that I have not the fear of God, yet through mercy I know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; to wit, that I have in ſome meaſure the Spirit of God in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which Spirit I am both allowed, and enabled to bear my Witneſſe againſt the great Wickedneſs and Abominations of this Apoſtatiſing Generation.</p>
            <p>Thus far he ſpake without much interruption: Then begun the <hi>Recorder</hi> to ſpeak to the Jury, and told them howſoever the Priſoner had ſpoken ſo and ſo for himſelf; yet they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that under a pretence of Conſcience, a great deal of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is committed: To which the Priſoner replied, <hi>Let Baal ſpeak for himſelf:</hi> What do you ſay, ſaid the <hi>Recorder?</hi> I ſay (ſaid he) <hi>let Baal pleade for himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Jury went aſide, and in a very little time returned again, and brought in their Verdict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was, <hi>That they found not the Priſoner guilty of the Indictment, but for two or three words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had ſpoken and brought ſcripture for it, that they did not quit him off, for he had confeſt them, and ſtood to the juſtification of them.</hi> The Bench at this were much diſſatisfied, and a great ſtir there was, but the Jury ſtood to it; and ſome of them openly ſaid, <hi>If ye like not this Verdict, then looke ſome where elſe, for we have no more to ſay to you, nor any thing more againſt the Priſoner;</hi> &amp; ſo broke up: the <hi>Bench-men</hi> and the <hi>Jury</hi> ſeeming very much diſpleaſed each with other.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 24 of the ſame moneth, he was brought again to the Bar: And howſoever the night before he was quitted by the <hi>Jury,</hi> as to the <hi>Indictment;</hi> yet the <hi>Recorder</hi> pronounced this Sentence againſt him, <hi>viz.

            <p>The other ſix remained all <hi>Satturday</hi> in <hi>Newgate</hi> till about eight or nine of the Clock at Night, and then they were all ſent for to the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> Brother <hi>Feake,</hi> brother <hi>Goodgroom</hi> and ſeverall more

of their Chriſtian Friends, went with the priſoners to the Court: Being there, they made <hi>Proclamation,</hi> that if any man in City or Country had any thing againſt <hi>John Cann,</hi> and others then named as either Treaſon, Murther, Fellony (and ſeverall other things) ſhould appear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No ſooner had they read it, but preſently, they cryed out, ye are diſcharged of the Court. Mr. <hi>Cann</hi> deſired that he might have liberty to ſpeak a few words. The <hi>Mayor</hi> told him, he was quitted, and deſired him to forbear. I pray you Sir, ſaid he, give me the liberty which the Heathen gave <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was before them. But by no means would they ſuffer him to ſpeak, though he earneſtly entreated them three or foure ſeverall tunes: But ſtill told him the Court had diſcharged them; and ſo there was nothing more to be ſaid.</p>
            <p>One of the Priſoners ſeeing they would not ſuffer Mr. <hi>Cann</hi> to ſpeak, asked of the <hi>Mayor</hi> wherefore they had impriſoned them above three weeks, and now told them they had nothing againſt them: <hi>If ye were men</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>fearing God, and hating Coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you would not have dealt ſo with us; but I ſee you are corrupt and your courſes too:</hi> For ſpeaking thus, the <hi>Mayor</hi> commanded that he ſhould be ſtayed, and to carry him to the <hi>Baledock,</hi> where he was kept a while, and having ſome of the <hi>Armies Declarations</hi> about him, (publiſhed at <hi>Muſcleborrow</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>) he diſperſed them as he ſtood there: With this Alderman <hi>Titchbourn</hi> was preſently made acquainted, and calls for the Priſoner, asking him how he durſt diſperſe ſuch <hi>Seditious Books?</hi> The other replyed, how Seditious! I am ſure your ſelf did once own them: but that is nothing now; they are Seditious, and to priſon he muſt go; and indeed was carried to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he is kept a priſoner to this day.</p>
            <p>I had ended here the <hi>Narrative,</hi> but that the <hi>Weekly Pamphleteer</hi> occaſions me to ſpeak a little more. In his <hi>Seſſions News,</hi> he tells us of <hi>eight men which were brought from the Counter, called</hi> Fift Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy men: <hi>the chief of which Faction were</hi> Wentworth Day <hi>and</hi> John Clarke, <hi>both which were Indicted for ſpeaking reproachfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and ſcandalous words againſt his Highneſs the Lord</hi> Protector
<pb facs="tcp:100102:9"/>
               <hi>upon which they were found guilty, &amp;c.</hi> Had there been any Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or honeſty in the man, he would not have abuſed the Nation as he hath done; but given a true <hi>Intelligence:</hi> As 1. have told us where they were taken and how? but this he durſt not do. 2. How they were caſt into priſon without any offence or crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 3. Why had he not ſet down what their Reproachfull and Malitious words were, and where they were ſpoken? 4. How durſt he ſay, they were found guilty, ſeeing the one was quitted by the <hi>Jury,</hi> and the other had no <hi>Jury</hi> paſſed upon him, nor any witneſſes produced? 5. Why had he not put it into his News, how the Lord Mayor came with Halberts and Staves and pluckt a Miniſter out of the Pulpit, as he was in the worſhip of God, and having kept him more than three weeks in priſon, diſmiſſeth him by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in open Court, telling him that he had nothing againſt him.</p>
            <p>But for this <hi>Needham</hi> Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> hath given a ſufficient Character of him. He is (ſaith he) <hi>Faex hominum &amp; faex Cauſarum, an infamous and unclean perſon, next to the</hi>

How the <hi>Mayor</hi> to excuſe himſelf, told ſome of our friends, he was threatened to do it, and could not be at reſt till he had done it: beſides, whereas they were kept twenty four hours in Priſon without any Warrant, afterward they ſent a Warrant to the <hi>Counter,</hi> and dated it a day before it was made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All that they pretended in the Warrant was, <hi>The Priſoners were diſaffected to the preſent Government, and had reviled the ſame, and wanted ſecurity for their good Behaviour.</hi> So likewiſe, I have forborn to ſpeak any thing of Alderman <hi>Titchbourn,</hi> who was (as we have good ground to report it) the greateſt ſtickler to have this Perſecution raiſed againſt the Saints: And was one of the three (for there were but the Mayor and he, and Alderman <hi>Atkins</hi> then on the Bench) which would not ſuffer <hi>old Father Cann</hi> to ſpeak a word at the Bar. But there is enough ſaid to ſatisfie all ſuch as deſire to know the Truth in the love of it. For others, who are malicious and deviſe lies and falſhood, <hi>The Lord rebuke them.</hi>
