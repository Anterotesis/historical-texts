            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But to excuse them from that Crime,</l>
               <l>(If an Excuse may be in Rhyme)</l>
               <l>I will assure you there may be</l>
               <l>Found 'mongst you as great <hi>Rogues</hi> as we,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For</hi> Whoring, Swearing, Drinking <hi>too;</hi>

               <l>For <hi>Lying</hi> we have nought to do,</l>
               <l>Nor <hi>Shamming,</hi> 'tis your constant Trade,</l>
               <l>And will be till the <hi>Earth</hi> be made</l>
               <l>A general fire, and it is true,</l>
               <l>As I said Hypocrite take thy due,</l>
               <l>And that I certainly thee tell,</l>
               <l>Thy portion's th'hottest place in Hell.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Whig</hi> Damns <hi>Whig,</hi> and yet they all</l>
               <l>Are Innocent, both great and small,</l>
               <l>But I must tell you that's a Lye,</l>
               <l>(<hi>Whig,</hi> I'm asham'd of you) and why.</l>
               <l>For tho' through ignorance of late,</l>
               <l>It has been <hi>Tom's</hi> unlucky Fate</l>
               <l>To be abus'd, I'le undeceive</l>
               <l>The Vulgar (if they will believe)</l>
               <l>'Twas whipping <hi>Zac</hi>—not whipping <hi>Tom,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That first discover'd <hi>Maidens Bumb,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And flogg'd it; though he, Pious Soul,</l>
               <l>Design'd the opposite Port-hole</l>
               <l>To enter, but he first wou'd see</l>
               <l>How fair Posteriours might be,</l>
               <l>And then he rationally guest,</l>
               <l>The thing before was like the rest;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62841:20"/>
A pretty way in truth to try,</l>
               <l>Whether a Maid with man wou'd ly;</l>
               <l>Next the <hi>Clare-Market</hi> Priest comes in,</l>
               <l>Who never counted it a Sin</l>
               <l>To lye with Woman, Wife, Maid, Whore,</l>
               <l>And has (they say) bored many a score;</l>
               <l>But that the worst was when he tried</l>
               <l>To bless before he occupied;</l>
               <l>Who caught the Maid in private room,</l>
               <l>With Benediction of the Womb,</l>
               <l>Where he upon the very place,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Wanton Priest'</hi> gat <hi>Babe of Grace,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But 'twas not ill to ly with her,</l>
               <l>Because a true <hi>Jack Presbyter.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Now give me leave for to desine,</l>
               <l>The Son o'th' <hi>Handkercherd Divine;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who swills until the Noon of Night,</l>
               <l>And gorges still his Appetite</l>
               <l>With Viands and Liquors; but yet then</l>
               <l>For to avoid the sight of Men,</l>
               <l>Sleeps where his Drunkenness he got,</l>
               <l>Like, <hi>Holy Presbyterian Sot;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And then at last away he goes</l>
               <l>Upon his Feet, (I think with Toes,)</l>
               <l>But first 'tis possibly he may</l>
               <l>For's Lodging in the morning pray,</l>
               <l>And that is all; welcome, well gone,</l>

               <l>Yes he has been a <hi>Statist</hi> too,</l>
               <l>Yes certainly with much ado;</l>
               <l>A Man of great Integrity,</l>
               <l>That will not pay, nor tell you why,</l>

               <l>Is this your Honesty, pox on't.</l>
               <l>One that shall sip from place to place,</l>

               <l>His Worship and his Manhood too,</l>
               <l>And yet shall rail at me, or you,</l>

               <l>Unpard'nable, a Fault sublime;</l>
