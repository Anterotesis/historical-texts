            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
HIS REVEREND AND MUCH
Reſpected Good Friend,
Mr. JOHN GOODWJN:
Be theſe I pray preſented.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>REVEREND SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately received from you, by the hands of
my loving Neighbour and Friend, Mrs. <hi>Ducker,</hi>
a both undeſerved and unexpected favour, one of
your laſt Books, intituled, <hi>Innocencie and Truth
triumphing together;</hi> I acknowledge it a juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of obliged gratitude, and therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
I do here return you deſerved and moſt
humble thanks for the ſame, by the ſame friendly
hand. And becauſe (worthy Sir) I conceived and
conſidered with my ſelf, that you ſent it by way of
love and deſire to give me (who am, as I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
a poor and unworthy <hi>Presbyterian)</hi> ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
if it might be, touching your Independent
Church-way: I having now peruſed it all over,
even <hi>à capite ad calcem</hi> (and I hope with that pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and impartialitie, as my God hath enabled me,
which becomes a Chriſtian and fellow ſervant to the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt with
you) I therefore hope you will, not ſo much pardon (which I pray not) as accept
(which I heartily deſire) with Chriſtian Candor, mine ingenuitie and plain dealing
with you, in now giving you an account, briefly, as I thought it moſt fit, of what
light or content and ſatisfaction I have received from it. Truly Sir, I having read your
<hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> found therein very full and fair promiſe of your ingenuous aym
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123483:2"/>
and intention in the ſubſequent diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that you projected four things therein,
<hi>Brevitie, Perſpicuitie, Moderation,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> But having, I ſay, peruſed your
Book, truly Sir, (if I am not miſtaken, as I believe I am not) you have come ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
ſhort of your promiſed project, in every of the four branches thereof. For firſt,
if I found you <hi>ſhort,</hi> I am ſure I found you <hi>ſharp and tart;</hi> For <hi>Perſpicuitie,</hi> I aſſure
you I found much <hi>cloudie obſcuritie; Veri ſimilitudinem multam, non ipſam veritatem;
ſatisfaction,</hi> therefore none at all. But eſpecially, in that of projected <hi>moderation,</hi> and
promiſed temperature in writing, (the great defect, and foul fault, ſo cried out upon
by Independents againſt all <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers or Speakers) in ſtead of <hi>moderation</hi>
I found abundance of <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> and <hi>unſavourie jerkes and jeeres</hi> (the light iſſues me
thought, rather of a youthfull <hi>green-head,</hi> then the ſolid expreſſions of ſuch a <hi>grave
heart)</hi> ſprinkled, almoſt, over all your whole diſcourſe; which I muſt confeſſe much
troubled and affected me with wonder to meet with, after ſuch a ſeeming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of <hi>moderation:</hi> Some few of very many whereof (becauſe I knew, <hi>Doloſus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatur
in generalibus)</hi> J have here particularized with their pages where they are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and eaſily to be ſeen. As firſt (to omit your <hi>Via Sanguinea,</hi> with all its moſt
bitter and biting, yea ſorely wounding expoſitions of that term, in your <hi>Theoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,
&amp;c.) pag.</hi> 13. you compare Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> in his Reply, to <hi>the two falſe witneſſes,</hi>
who falſly accuſed our bleſſed Saviour. And in the ſame Page you tell the Reader,
<hi>Here Mr. Prynn vapours</hi> in his Reply; immediatly after, in the ſame page how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
do you jeer and ſcoffe him about <hi>three Tabernacles?</hi> And with what an <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſpirit</hi> do you anſwer him, page 16. line 4. together with <hi>a down-right jeer about a
Nationall Church,</hi> ſome 12 lines after? You alſo <hi>groſſely taxe him with errors,</hi> Page
17. Sect. 21. And Page 18. and 19. you frequently jeer him, and amongſt thoſe
jeers you tell him, <hi>that Acts 15. is onely Mr. Prynns Goſpell;</hi> what <hi>a bitter and
unchristian cenſure</hi> lay you upon him, and all Presbyterians, Page 24. Sect. 26. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of it? And O how you <hi>jeer him with his quotations,</hi> Page 37. towards
the bottome; as alſo Page 49. and Page 51. <hi>you ſlander him with want of Reaſon and
Truth</hi> too; and Page 52. you tell him, <hi>his pen ſpits black reproches in the face of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents.</hi>
You alſo accuſe him Page 65. <hi>of much untruth;</hi> and <hi>the ſame alſo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
moſt fouly, Page 84. Together with a <hi>Notable jeer, exalting your ſelfe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
Mr. Prynn,</hi> which I have noted at large in your book, page 85. Together
with very many other ſuch like expreſſions, too tedious to be here recited; And yet
(ſtrange to conſider) you conclude them all (with the concluſion of your book) page
99. <hi>in a hortatorie way to Mr. Prynn</hi> in theſe words: <hi>That he would put leſſe Vineger
and Gall into his inke and more Wooll and Cotten.</hi> And in the Apoſtles words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
4. 31. <hi>That all bitterneſſe and evill ſpeaking be put away, as becomes brethren.</hi> And
now any impartiall perſon may judge, whether you your ſelf have followed this <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
exhortation;</hi> Nay, whether contrariwiſe, you have not with <hi>unbrotherly aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
indeavored to <hi>beſmear the face</hi> of that precious Gentleman, moſt worthy ever to
be honoured both by <hi>you all</hi> and <hi>us all?</hi> Truly Sir, you Independent Gentlemen have
dealt with this moſt worthy ſervant of the Lord, juſt as the people of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> did with
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> whom at firſt they ſo honoured and admired, as that they were
ready to deifie him and make him a god; but ſhortly after, they furiouſly indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſtone him to death: So ye, at the firſt, in the time of <hi>Mr. Prynns</hi> firſt moſt
elaborate and learned <hi>divine writings,</hi> yea and for his moſt glorious and <hi>Saint-like
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123483:2"/>
ſufferiugs;</hi> O then, how ye all (with us) moſt highly (and that moſt juſtly too) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
him, and brought him home from bauiſhment, as it were in the triumphing
Chariot of your love and praiſes! But now, ſince he hath piouſly and faithfully writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt your Independent way, and onely for this, O how have <hi>you</hi> and almoſt
<hi>all of your way,</hi> indeavoured as much as in you is, to ſtone to death his illuſtrious
reputation, by moſt unworthy and unchriſtian <hi>reviling</hi> and <hi>vilipending</hi> of him, both
in <hi>words</hi> and <hi>writings!</hi> Even him I ſay, who for his pietie, humilitie, incomparable
conſtancie, fortitude and magnanimitie in ſuffering for <hi>Goſpell Truths,</hi> was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to any of his moſt faithfull fellow-ſufferers yea, whoſe ſoundneſſe and ſinceritie,
whoſe profound learning and indefatigable labours in writing upon deepeſt points of
Divinity and controverted <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> (witneſſe his <hi>Perpetuity of the eſtate of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man;</hi> his <hi>Anti-Arminianiſme, Vnbiſboping of Timothy and Titus,</hi> his <hi>Hiſtri-Maſtix;</hi>
and many other his later, moſt learned, orthodox and <hi>precious peeces)</hi> have
made his never-dying name and fame moſt worthily renowned both in England and
other parts of the world, beyond the Seas. And yet this noble Gentleman to be thus,
I ſay, <hi>beſmeared</hi> and <hi>beſpattred</hi> with your <hi>unjuſt accuſations,</hi> onely I ſay again, for
writing the truth againſt <hi>Independent novelties;</hi> O! it is moſt ſad and bad to conſider.
Truly Sir, you muſt here give me leave to be yet more plain with you, I profeſſe in
the ſinceritie of my ſoul, that I do moſt groundedly beleeve, that (had <hi>Mr. Prynn</hi>
been ſuch a <hi>Non-ſenſe, Conſcienceleſſe, irrationall, falſe</hi> and <hi>frivolous writer,</hi> as <hi>you</hi> and
<hi>others</hi> of your way only have ſtrugled (but all in vain) to make and demonſtrate him
by your <hi>laviſh tongues</hi> and <hi>pens)</hi> that yet, I ſay certainly, <hi>Mr. Iohn Goodwin,</hi> was the
moſt unfit man of all I know in <hi>London,</hi> to lay thoſe undeſerved <hi>criminations</hi> to <hi>Mr.
Prynns</hi> charge. For, you know good Sir, that <hi>Qui in alterum paratus eſt dicere, ipſum
vitio carere opertet.</hi> For you therefore, Reverend Sir, to take upon you to tax <hi>Mr.
Pryn</hi> of <hi>errours, untruths,</hi> and <hi>ſuch like,</hi> as you have done, how deeply you your ſelf,
(before ever this moſt <hi>unhappy</hi> and <hi>unhol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> difference of <hi>Independency</hi> with <hi>Presbitery</hi>
was dreamed of) have been ceuſured both of <hi>Socinianiſme;</hi> (and how juſtly too others
have moſt learnedly in publike declared) and more lately alſo how you have been
diſcovered to hold a moſt Dangerous, yea a moſt Damnable opinion (as a learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Brother of yours termed it in my hearing, and who then ſaid, he would
juſtifie it againſt you) touching juſtifying Faith by Chriſt. And now alſo, how
fiercely you are faln on this unhappily diſturbant new way of Independencie. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you therefore, Reverend Sir, ſeriouſly to conſider theſe things, to muſter up
your ſaddeſt thoughts, and to ſee into what a Labyrinth you are ſtrangely and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intricated. Sir, I do not, I cannot denie, but ingenuouſly confeſſe that God hath
given you much learning and eminent parts, but truly Sir, if I be not, miſtaken, I
greatly fear your Independent Proſelites do too much magnifie, if not (almoſt) dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you for them, and as it was with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Shollars, an <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> is enough,
I, feare for many, if not moſt of your diſciples, <hi>jurare in verba Magiſtri;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I pray God, your great parts and gifts bee not (thus) a great Snare to your

Self-deniall, and Holy Humilitie in your ſelfe, being more <hi>kindely affectioned
with brotherly love, and in honour preferring others before your ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom.</hi> 12. 10. And
thus, Reverend Sir, I have made humbly bold, by your own occaſion, lovingly
and, I hope, fairly and friendly as a true Chriſtian Brother ought, <hi>(Levit.</hi> 19. 17)

ſent to Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> I cannot eaſily determine: for though all manner
of knowledge, either of perſons or things, be in ſome kinde or other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall;
it being an undoubted <hi>Maxime,</hi> that <hi>Verum &amp; Bonum convertuntur:</hi> yet
ſome knowledge may be ſo circumſtantiated, that it may prove more burdenſome and
offenſive to the party knowing, then commodious. I confeſſe from the reading of your
Lines I have gained thus much, to ſay I know you: but this gain hath occaſioned ſuch
a conſiderable loſſe in the things of my joy, that I doe even wiſh for my former ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
and could be well contented, to have met with no other deſcription of
your frame and temper, then what the promiſe of your countenance, and the report
of your friends have made of you: Indeed it cannot but deduct ſomewhat from
the comfort of a reaſonable man, to ſee one, whom (one would thinke) gray haires
ſhould have taught the language of ſoberneſſe, ſhooting with his tongue at rovers,
and ſpeaking ſharpe and devouring words againſt perſons and things, which hee
knowes not. Sorry I am, that Mr. <hi>Vicars</hi> ſhould break the fair face of his reputation
upon this ſtone, againſt which this beſotted world is daſhing it ſelfe in peeces from
day to day. I have ſome hope that though your zeale to Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> glory, did caſt
you into ſuch an extaſie of paſſion, that you ſcarce knew what you writ; yet by
this time you have pretty well recovered your ſelfe again: and leſt the ſenſe of your
miſcarriage ſhould too much oppreſſe you, I give you to know that you are falne into
ſoft and tender hands, and have diſcovered your nakedneſſe to ſuch onely, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pittie, then deride it. For my part, I love not to diſport my ſelfe at the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of any man, or to turne his folly into laughter; for what were this, but to
reflect diſhonour upon the ſame nature, wherein he partakes with my ſelfe. Rather,
I could mourn over the vanities of your Pen, and weep to ſee you ſo farre intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as to call the moſt injurious dealing one ſhall lightly meet with, by the name
of candor and ingenuitie. The truth is, you have ſo fouly berayed your paper with
bold and untrue aſſertions, imputations, exprobations, and ſuch like excrements, that
I thought even for modeſtie ſake to have drawne over them the veile of ſilence, and
to have conteſted with that ſpirit that breathes in them no further, then by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it in a ſecret wiſh, the <hi>Lord rebuke thee.</hi> But I conſidered with my ſelfe,
that perhaps you might communicate in the nature of ſuch perſons who (as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 5.) are apt (being unanſwered) to be wiſe in their own
conceits: and if I ſhall hereby demoliſh or at leaſt weaken this conceit of yours, I
preſume I ſhall do you herein a very charitable and Chriſtian peece of ſervice. Think
not I am become your enemeie, becauſe I tell you the truth: you have injured
me no other waies then by treſpaſſing upon your own credit, and by making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a ſad breach in that holy profeſſion, wherein you ſtand ingaged with my ſelfe.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123483:4"/>
What ever your intentions were, I conceive you have done me no more wrong in
clapping the title of an <hi>Independent Proſelyte</hi> upon my back, then <hi>Pilate</hi> did to Chriſt
in affixing this Superſcription over his head, <hi>This is the King of the Iews.</hi> I think
this name to be full as honourable, as that of a <hi>poore and unworthy Preſbyterian,</hi>
wherewith you have pleaſed to baptize your ſelfe: and conceive that herein only
you have followed your owne, or rather the Apoſtles counſell, <hi>in honour to preferre
others be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore your ſelfe.</hi> But had you been minded to ſuppreſſe your name, your
very Dialect had been enough to betray you: Me thinkes you write juſt like ſuch
a one as you ſay you are. Did I not hope for better things from the hands of
more worthy Presbyterians, your unworthy dealing had ſet me off ten degrees
further from your way, then now I ſtand: But I will not take the advantage of
your, or any mans miſdemeanor, though more groſſe and abſurde then yours
to render Pesbytery odious to the world: To cloath any opinion or practice with
the garments of mens perſonall diſtempers, thereby to fall upon them and beat
them with the more applauſe, is a method which I as much abhorre, as the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
you admire, delights in: and if this property in him were one of thoſe
beauty-ſpots which raviſhed you into a paſſionate adoration of him, you need
not fear, that ever I ſhould become your corrivall: And yet I love and honour
Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> for what ever you can finde lovely and honourable in him: I cannot
denie but that in ſome of his workes, he hath acquitted himſelfe upon commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
termes; but to ſay that in all things, he writes after the rate of a God, when
in many things he falls beneath the line of a man, is to make him and my ſelfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the wrath of God, and the ſcorne of man. I acknowledge that for a
time he ran well, but who hindred him? queſtionleſſe <hi>He</hi> who is ever and anon
Hindring the Saints in the race of holineſſe. The Prince of darkeneſſe owed him
a fall for his ſharpe conteſting with his prime agents, and now hee hath payed his
debt; but if Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> will bee ruled by the advice of his beſt friends, hee may
riſe again to his greater glory, and notwithſtanding his fall, triumph over the
envy and malice of the Devill. Concerning Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> (over whom you
ſhake the rod of your reproofe, as if he were one of your Schollers) I could ſpeak
as high and excellent <hi>Encomiums,</hi> as you have ſpoken of your <hi>preci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us Gentleman;</hi> I
could compare him even with Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> himſelfe: but ſuch a compariſon as
this, would bee to mee moſt odious. I could tell you what hee hath done,
what hee hath writ, how deeply hee hath ſuffered from unreaſonable
men; yea, I could give you ſuch a lively and bright deſcription of him, as would
dazle your eyes to look upon, and make you bluſh for ſhame to have grapled with
ſuch a perſon as he is, upon ſuch rude and unmannerly termes as you have done. For
you, who are but a <hi>Teacher of boyes,</hi> ſo haughtily to correct a <hi>great Maſter in Iſrael,</hi>
is ſuch an abſurdity, as cannot but rend a more patient ſoule then mine, into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
and griefe. Tis a wonder to me, that, whereas at the beginning of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you confeſſe your ſelfe to bee but a <hi>poore and unworthy Presbyterian,</hi> you ſhould
ſo far forget your ſelfe before you come halfe way, as to take upon you, like the
Dr. of the Chaire; and to cenſure the beſt of men and wayes with as much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as if your pen had dropt the Votes of a Generall Aſſembly with its inke. Had
a poore and unworthy Independent done the like, you would have caſt this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
into a Baſiliske, and uſed it to batter down the way of his profeſſion, and to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123483:4"/>
lay the glory of it even with the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I well perceive, though you have
ſcap't the <hi>ſnare of Gifts and parts</hi> (in which you fear Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is taken) yet you
are falne into the pit, not of Divine, but naturall ſimplicity; and have verified the
old Proverb, A raſh mans bolt is ſoone ſhot. As for that Book of Mr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi>
called <hi>Innocencie and Truth triumphing together,</hi> though you are pleaſed to triumph
over both, and to caſt it out as an Arch-Rebel to reaſon and morality, yet (I muſt
tell you) it hath found joyfull and bountifull entertainement in the judgements of
ſober and intelligent men: But certainly, it was the unhappineſſe of this Treatiſe
to fall into your hands, when you ſtood upon the Mount of Mr. <hi>Prins</hi> honour, and
when the viſion of his transfiguration wrought ſo ſtrongly in you, that you did not
wot, what you ſpake, no, nor what you did neither, for you laid about you with
ſuch regardleſſe fury that you broke the head of your friend <hi>Priſcian,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The words in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Coppy of his Letter, are theſe, and thus ſpell'd, <hi>qui in alterum paratus eſt dicere, ipſum vicio careat oportet,</hi> as may appeare from the originall in Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

ſafety men of your <hi>profeſſion,</hi> ſhould be moſt tender. I
thought to have argued the caſe with you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your exceptions againſt this Treatiſe and its Author,
will hold in the Court of Reaſon and equity: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you are not ſo well skilled in the rules of this Court;
and I am loath to take the advantage of you. I ſhall only
propound a few Querees, peradventure the ſtruglings of
your thoughts to give them ſatisfaction, may diſſolve the
inchantment that is now upon you. What perſons did
ever moſt <hi>learnedly declare Mr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>to be juſtly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
for Socinianiſme?</hi> When, or in what <hi>publique</hi> place
did they make this Declaration? How call you that Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his, who will <hi>juſtifie</hi> againſt him the charge <hi>of
holding a moſt damnable opinion about juſtifying faith?</hi> I
ſuppoſe you muſt ſtrain, not ſo much your memory as
your invention, in ſhaping your anſwer: You had done well to remember, that
though <hi>Fooles</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>beleeve every thing;</hi> yet <hi>wiſe</hi> men will queſtion
ſuch aſſertions as theſe: Alas (Sir) the beſt courſe you can run to gaine credit with
the prudent, is to cut your allegations and your proofes, juſt of one and the ſame
length: to cloath large and broad ſayings with curtaild Arguments, reflects as much
ſhame upon ſuch ſayings, and him that ſpeakes them, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did upon the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

know, how that many grave, ſober, Godly, and learned men have falne into that <hi>way</hi>
you call <hi>Independencie.</hi> Now, your onely method, to have brought over theſe to
your partie, and to have filled their mouthes with the cry of a confederacy againſt
this <hi>way,</hi> had bin this; not barely to have affirmed it to be a <hi>novell</hi> and <hi>disturbant way</hi>
(as you have done) but to have poyſed the lightneſſe of your affirmation, with the
weight and ſubſtance of a Demonſtration. I aſſure you (Sir) (what ever you may
thinke) I approve of <hi>this way</hi> no further then I ſee the footſteps of thoſe <hi>ſweet
ſiſters, Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> Printed in it: I have narrowly view'd it, and I can finde no
drops of blood, no ſtrewings of the liberties, eſtates, names, comforts of the Saints
ſcattered in it, and yet ſome Travellers affirme, they have ſeen ſuch things as theſe
in that <hi>way,</hi> which the ignorance of thouſands luſt after. But to conclude, I beſeech
