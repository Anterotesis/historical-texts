            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That as yet I cannot ſee, but that ye haue ſinned

giue me leaue to ſpeak ſomewhat to this excuſe.
I will not vrge the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that moſt reuerend,

to manifeſt violence when they be commaunded
not onlie to tollerate the ceremonies, and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
gouernement of our Church, but alſo to
allowe them by their hand writing. For there
is great difference betweene toleration, and
ſubſcription. But I would learne, whether that
ground of pollicie be not to be vnderſtood rather
of</hi> the euils of payne and puniſhment,
<hi>than of</hi> the euils of ſinne and guiltines:
<hi>Sith by the doctrine of our Church, No ſinne is
veniall or pardenable in it ſelfe. And I make
this</hi> Quaere, <hi>Whether ſilence inforced, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing
ſubſcription, be the greater euill? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:6554:6"/>
the former, This is my perſwaſion, That
as God,<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 7. 9</note> (who needeth not</hi> the lye <hi>of politique
ſubſcription, but can butide his Church as hee
will) doeth not giue an ordinarie bleſsing to the

<hi>For, If an hundred godlie ministers were ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for not ſubſcribing to all the ArchBiſhoppes
Articles, I doubt not but that their ſilencing
would preach reformation very effectuallie:
Wheras your temporizing ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth hurt
many wayes. For therby the ArchBb. is ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
in his courſe, that he hath reſolutelie ſaid:
That</hi> ſith God hath ſo bleſſed him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that fewe of any accoumpte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the ſame, hee would not giue it
ouer now. <hi>Is not then your politique ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the cauſe, why thoſe few be ſo hardlie dealt
with, That no mediation can prevaile in their
behalfe? To ſay nothing of</hi> proſeſſours, <hi>who
ſeeing you (who haue ſtood in the gappe) to</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<hi>at the laſt, do thinke thoſe few that now
ſtand, more preciſe than wiſe, and become ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leſſe comfortable to them than they haue
bin. But anſwer me: Is not this affliction added
to their ſufferings by your fault? I ſay more, By
your</hi> ſubſcriprio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>ye may ſeeme (in ſome ſort)
guilty of preiudicing your brethren, not onely for
<pb facs="tcp:6554:7"/>
the time preſent, but for euer hereafter; except
by the ſtanding out of ſome, preſcription be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.
For as many things enacted by Law,
are antiquated by non vſage: ſo many thinges
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by law are eſtabliſhed by cuſtome
and preſcription. This is not all: For as Peters
example</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2. 12, 13.</note> drew not onely the Iewes, but
Barnabas alſo into diſſimulation with
him: <hi>ſo your temporizing ſubſcription hath
bene and daily will be an occaſion to many weak
ones, if not of falling, yet of ſtumbling; if not of
going backe into</hi> Egypt, <hi>yet of looking backe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Sodome. <hi>So that few be now ſo zealous
for reformation, as they haue bene. Which muſt
needes be a great offence, and that giuen by you,
If (in your iudgement) there be neede of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 28. 17, 22.</note> profeſſours occaſioned by ſuch ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues bound, as well as their

it is that<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 14. 4.</note> the multitude is deuided,
ſome holding with the Iewes, ſome

Otherwiſe, it is not to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Secondlie, if by the practiſe and

to add or alter by aduice. So that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that ceremonies, were not ſo eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,

conceiued, that peaceable omiſſion (not
