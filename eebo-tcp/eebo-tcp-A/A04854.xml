            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S one not ambitious to preach or print my selfe, but desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to preach the honor of God and publish his mercies, J give light and after-life to this Sermon. J preached it at the mariage of your peerelesse sister; not on the
<pb facs="tcp:8477:3"/>
day it selfe, but before the daies of that feast and celebritie were expired. J publish it at the birth of her sonne, the first-fruits of the riches of God towards the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world from that Princely garden.</p>
            <p>My gratious Soueraigne who commanded my seruice at that time, out of his zealous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heart, enioined me likewise my taske namely to blesse the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as with <hi>Crescite &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicamini,</hi> (the fundamentall blessing of God) and other such like praiers and prefaces of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie prediction belonging to mari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age: and as often as my matter fitted me, to draw from the hearts of the people, which sate in the
<pb facs="tcp:8477:3"/>
doores of their lippes and waited the watch-word, their answers and <hi>Amens</hi> to those wishes of blessing: that both the Priest and the people like the voice and echo in the woods, vniting their spirits and speech together, might sing to the new maried paire their ioifull <hi>God speed, O Lord prosper</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 129. 8.</note> 
               <hi>them, wee wish them good luck in the name of the Lord.</hi> Thus hauing so glorious a <hi>starre</hi> to point out my way vnto me, and the readiest affections of mine heart lending me winde and sailes at will to doe what seruice I might to that wished coniunction: as Ophir in the daies of Salomon was the place for gold, because the most and best was there; so
<pb facs="tcp:8477:4"/>
went I for a mariage text to that golden and beaten Psalme, as<note place="margin">Psal. 128.</note> well trauelled in this kinde as Ophir for gold, because there was the richest veine to furnish such an occasion. Thence I extracted a small modell for my building: the subiect thereof was <hi>a wife;</hi> the mirrour and metaphor of that wife, <hi>a vine;</hi> the honour and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of that vine, <hi>fruit;</hi> the marrow and meaning of that fruit, <hi>children,</hi> which lay at the next doore to my text. But when I came to the fruit of the vine, J pawsed and with-held my speech, because the time of her fructifying was not yet come. I went on with my song of the <hi>vine</hi> in the words of Esay, <hi>Vinea facta est</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Es. 5. 1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:8477:4"/>
hoping there would be a day and daies, when we should change our dittie, and sing as cheerefully of the <hi>oliue branches</hi> in those sweet notes of the Psalme; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 8.</note> 
               <hi>sunt tibi filij</hi> &amp;c. This day is this word fulfilled in our eares, both in substance and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For not onely the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>worke</hi> of God, prophecie and euent, are really met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but with a reciprocall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and reflected aspect of each to other, that <hi>worke</hi> and his <hi>word</hi> are once more met againe: those very words and syllables of the Psalme, wherein at the first our hopes were conceiued and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, not forced from their owne ranke and station, but by the
<pb facs="tcp:8477:5"/>
monethly order and course of the day, aptly and happily ministring to the entertainment of that newes which by his Maiesties princely care was conueied vnto vs. For at the morning praier of that day which his Maiestie by a speedie messenger posting vpon the wings of the night was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to preuent, it being the day of our Christian Sabboth, whereon the tribes doe vsually ascend to the houses of God, the people, J meane, assemble in their <hi>great Congregations</hi> to praise his glorious name: J say at the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning praier of that day, being the ninth of the moneth, by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vse of the Church, was that Psalme read, wherein was that
<pb facs="tcp:8477:5"/>
verse contained of that first dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous presage, <hi>Nati sunt tibi fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij</hi> &amp;c. As if from out the whole bunch of that sacred Uolume a Psalme had beene pickt of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as proper to that day, to yeeld a consonant voice and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that ioifull tidings. J applie the words of that other Psalme, <hi>Dominus dedit verbum, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelizantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

many perhaps that minded it: that ioined the text and the glosse together, the body and the soule, the letter of the booke and that instant goodnesse of God which that letter imported. Therefore to recall their meditations to that which they might ouerslip, and to reuiue mine owne, to seale the ioy of my heart and my thankefulnes to God in the presence of all his Saints, and to inflame others with the like, and to congratulate to your <hi>roiall house</hi> your new titles of honor and comfort, as of grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, grandmother, vncle, which you had not before; and one line of degree the more to your roiall pedigree, which for <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch</hi> is the most glorious in

the weakest of all plantes, and must haue somewhat to sustaine it.

            <p>The first thing then required, is, that it must be <hi>vitis pergulana</hi> or <hi>chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata,</hi> a vine by some stay. But what stay?

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8477:22"/>
honorable befitting her condition.</p>
            <p>If you call to minde, you shall finde that the place of the woman from her first creation was the <hi>sides of the house.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1</note> First you will not deny vnto mee, but that she was framed in the house. She was <hi>opus domesticum</hi> not <hi>peregrinum,</hi> a worke done at home not abroad. Not as the temple of Salomon was built; the materials whereof were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared a farre of. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was built and fashioned in the house of her husband, out of his very essence and composition; and is some part of him. Secondly, when she<note place="margin">2</note> was thus made, she became not one of his moueables, to be parted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from him; but was fixed to her <hi>house, adhaerebit vir vxori,</hi> the <hi>house</hi> and the <hi>vine</hi> must not be sundered. Thirdly, God so ordered the matter<note place="margin">3</note> betwixt them, that this adhaesion and agglutination of one to the other should be perpetuall. For by taking a bone from the man (who was <hi>nimiùm</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8477:22"/>
               <hi>osseus,</hi> exceeded and was somewhat monstrous by one bone too much,) to strengthen the woman, &amp; by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting flesh in steede thereof to mollifie the man, he made a sweete complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and temper betwixt them, like harmony in musicke, for their amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cohabitation. Fourthly, that bone<note place="margin">4</note> which God tooke from the man, was from out the midst of him. As Christ wrought saluation <hi>in medio terrae,</hi> so God made the woman <hi>e medio viri,</hi> out of the very midst of man. The <hi>species</hi> of the bone is exprest to be <hi>costa</hi> a rib, a bone of the side, not of the head, a woman is not <hi>domina</hi> the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; nor of any anterior part, she is not <hi>praelata</hi> preferred before the man; not a bone of the foote, she is not <hi>serua,</hi> an handmaid; nor of any hinder part, she is not <hi>post-posita,</hi> set behind the man; but a bone of the <hi>side,</hi> of a middle and indifferent part, to shew that she is <hi>socia</hi> a companion to the husband. For <hi>qui iunguntur lateribus,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8477:23"/>
               <hi>socij sunt,</hi> they that walke side to side, and cheeke to cheeke, walke as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Fiftly, I mightadde, a bone<note place="margin">5</note> from vnder the arme, to put the man in remembrance of protection &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense to the woman. Sixtly, a bone not<note place="margin">6</note> far from his heart, to put him in mind of dilection and loue to the woman. Lastly, a bone from the left side, to<note place="margin">7</note> put the woman in minde that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her frailty and infirmity she standeth in need of both the one and the other, from her husband.</p>
            <p>To conclude my discourse; if these things be duely examined, when man taketh a woman to wife, <hi>reparat latus suum,</hi> what doth he else, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the maime that was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made in his side, &amp; desireth to repaire it? <hi>repetit costam suam,</hi> he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and fetcheth backe the rib that was taken from him. And when the woman taketh an husband, shee is but ioyned againe to that side from which shee was first taken. Meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8477:23"/>
if aches, or stiches, or plewri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or other the like maladies befall the man by reason of his <hi>side;</hi> let him remember they came from himselfe, thence they had their beginning, and therefore with the more patience he ought to endure them.</p>
            <p>Wee haue at length brought and<note place="margin">Application.</note> fastned <hi>our vine</hi> to the <hi>sides of her house.

Let the day wherein it was done, be light and not darknesse; let God re gard it from aboue, &amp; the light of his gratious countenance shine euer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. All the parts of our Land (almost of Christendome) haue beene full of rumors; the hearts of all the faithfull in the Land full of horror and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust; I am sure the hearts of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites

            <p>The <hi>sides of the house</hi> not vnanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>vine.</hi> It is not <hi>domus lateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> but <hi>marmorea;</hi> not an house but a pallace, a princes house; not a pallace, but a sanctuary for piety &amp; religion, <hi>a Gods house.</hi> So as <hi>our vine</hi> is not only <hi>vitis pergulana</hi> a vine vpon a frame or <hi>vitis parietaria</hi> a vine vpon a wall, but <hi>vitis Palatina,</hi> a vine ordained by God to grow vp by the sides of an illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Palatine.</p>
