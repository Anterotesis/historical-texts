            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> many Priviledges and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. All which they were Incourag'd to do, out of a firm Belief that their ſaid Rights and Inheritances, upon all Occaſions, would be Objects of the Publick Care.</p>
            <p>Since His Majeſty's happy Acceſſion to the Throne, in ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes of the Honourable the Houſe of Commons, appointed to conſider of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; and in Committees of the whole Houſe, and by the Houſe, as alſo by your Lordſhips, it has been declar'd,<note place="margin">Both Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have Voted, the Trade to <hi>India,</hi> ſhould be in a Joynt-Stock ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</note> That the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade ſhould be carry'd on in a Joynt-Stock exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to all Others. During the Tranſaction of this Matter in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſignifie, in a Meſſage to the Houſe of Commons, of the 14th of <hi>November</hi> 1692, <hi>That upon Examination of the Charters, and conſulting with His Judges, and Learned Council,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Majeſties Meſſage to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> with the Judges Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Charter.</note> 
               <hi>His Majeſty found that He could not legally diſſolve the Company, but upon Three Years Warning; and that during the Three Years, after warning, the Company muſt ſubſiſt, and might continue to Trade: And that though the King might conſtitute a new Company, yet he could not impower ſuch new Company to Trade, till after Three Years: The Crown having expreſly covenanted, not to Grant any ſuch Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereupon His Majeſty was very apprehenſive of the ill Conſequence of giving Warning to the Company, becauſe they would then be leſs Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous of promoting the true Intereſt, and Advantage, of a Trade, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they would not long reap the Fruits: And that no new Company could be immediately admitted to it. So that this very Beneficial Trade, which is already ſo much impair'd, might be in danger of being intirely loſt to the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Cloſe of his Meſſage, upon that occaſion, His Majeſty was graciouſly pleas'd, to recommend to the Houſe of Commons, <hi>The Preparing ſuch a Bill, in Order to paſs into an Act of Parliament, as might eſtabliſh this Trade, on ſuch Foundations, as were moſt likely to preſerve and advance it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the Interlopers ſtarted a Suggeſtion, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Charter was forfeited,<note place="margin">The Company not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tax the 25th. <hi>March,</hi> 1693 their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was queſtioned.</note> upon the Non-payment of the firſt Quarterly Aſſeſſment, of 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Charg'd upon their whole Stock, though the Companies Agent, upon the day limited by the Act, <hi>viz.</hi> the 25th of <hi>March</hi> 1693, went up to the Exchequer, in order to pay it in; but found the Exchequer not open, the ſame being an Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the Printed Act not being publick till that Morning.</p>
