            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the most Illustrious Prince, JAMES Duke of <hi>MONMOUTH,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please Your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Grace has so Nobly Patronized this Undertaking, that I should rob you of your due, if I should not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lay this Play at your feet, since by your great and generous encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of it, you have made that and the Author eternally your own. But had I never received any Obligation, by my particular Inclination I am bound to your Grace, since I am the most humble admirer of your Heroick Vertues, who by your early
<pb facs="tcp:64538:3"/>
and unimitable Example, and by your eminent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are the greatest Patron of Arms; and by your Government of the most famous of Universities, are become the greatest Protector of Arts: of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, which I can never mention without reverence; and from which I have yet another Tie to your Grace, since I had once the honour to be a Member of that Illustrious Society, which though it be the most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World, can boast of no greater Honour then that of being commanded by so Excellent a Prince; one who is equally Valiant against his Enemies, and Courteous to his Friends; whose boundless Courage is always ready to vanquish the one, and whose Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Generosity is always ready to oblige the other.</p>
            <p>I shall not here recite those Heroick Actions, which all <hi>Europe</hi> have celebrated, and none have equall'd: Those are too Great for an Epistle Dedicatory, and onely fit for solid, lasting History; which certainly must do your Grace that right, to Enrol you in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Rank of Fame. Nor can we doubt, but the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of your Grace's Actions will last, when Time shall have devoured the Places where they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: When <hi>Mastrick</hi> shall be a heap of Rubbish, and the name might otherwise be swallow'd in the Ruine, it will be remembred by the greatest Action in the World, done there by the Greatest and the Earliest Hero, and by one, who for all his fierceness of Courage, has yet that Gentleness to Mankind, that he thinks that day lost, in which he does not oblige. One who is not onely infinitely bless'd in the most excellent Partner
<pb facs="tcp:64538:3"/>
of his Joys and Cares, happy above measure in the Goods of Mind, the Perfections of Body, and the greatest Splendour and Ornaments of Fortune, but he enjoys all these unenvied; nay, is not onely free from every mans envy, but has his love.</p>
            <p>I should be afraid of this boldness, in once mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things so much above my Pen, were I not assured of your Grace's Generosity, that enclines you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, even a well-intended Errour, in your humble Creature, who begs Protection from you, and needs it too.</p>
            <p>I have, by my misfortune, not my fault, met with some Enemies, who are always ready to do me the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable injury, to blast my Reputation with the King; and when I have the Honour to please Him, (which is of all things in the world my greatest Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition) endeavour to perswade him, that I do not write the Plays I own, or at least, that the best part of them are written for me; which is so malitious an aspersion, that I am sure they themselves believe it not, and they may as well accuse me of firing the City. I am sure (though I may want Wit to write a Play) I have more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty then to own what another man writes. But I am not yet so poor as to borrow; if I should, I should find not many that are rich enough to lend, Wit being much a scarcer Commodity then Money, I am sure with some who have reported this of me; who what ever they have of of one, have scarce enough of the other to supply their own necessities; and therefore I should be but very slenderly furnished from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64538:4"/>
I can never enough acknowledge the Honour done me by your incomparable Durchess, in endeavouring to clear me of this Aspersion: And who would not be proud of being aspersed, to be so vindicated? From this and some other injuries of my Enemies, I humbly beg your Grace's protection, who, I am sure, have Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Greatness enough to defend me against them: And I had rather owe it to your Grace, then to any man: For no man is more then I,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a good Natur'd Countrey, I doubt not but this my first Essay in Rhime would be at least forgiven; especially when I promise to offend no more in this kind: But I am sensible, that here I must encounter a great many Difficulties. In the first place (though I expect more candour from the best Writers in Rhime) the more moderate of them (who have yet a numerous party, good Judges being very scarce) are very much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with me, for leaving my own Province of <hi>Comedy,</hi> to invade their Dominion of <hi>Rhime:</hi> But me-thinks they might be satisfi'd, since I have made but a small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion, and am resolv'd to retire. And were I never so powerful, they should escape me, as the Northern People
<pb facs="tcp:64538:5"/>
did the <hi>Romans,</hi> their craggy barren Territories being not wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Conqu'ring. The next sort I am to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, are those who are too great Admirers of the <hi>French</hi> Wit, who (if they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> not like this Play) will say, the <hi>French Psyche</hi> is much better; if they do, they will say, I have borrow'd it all from the <hi>French.</hi> Whether the <hi>French</hi> be better, I leave to the Men of Wit (who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand both Languages) to determine; I will onely say, Here is more Variety, and the Scenes of Passion are wrought up with more Art; and this is much more a Play then that. And I will be bold to affirm that this is as much a Play, as could be made upon this Subject. That I have borrow'd it all from the <hi>French,</hi> can onely be the objection of those, who do not know that it is a Fable, written by <hi>Apulejius,</hi> in his <hi>Golden Ass;</hi> where you will find most things in this Play, and the <hi>French</hi> too. For several things concerning the Decoration of the Play, I am oblig'd to the <hi>French,</hi> and for the Design of Two of the onely moving Scenes in the <hi>French,</hi> which I may say, without vanity, are very much improv'd, being wrought up with more Art in this, then in the <hi>French</hi> Play, without borrowing any of the thoughts from them.</p>
            <p>In a thing written in five weeks, as this was, there must needs be many Errours, which I desire true Criticks to pass by; and which perhaps I see my self, but having much bus'ness, and indulging my self with some pleasure too, I have not had leisure to mend them, nor would it indeed be worth the pains, since there are so many splendid Objects in the Play, and such variety of Diversion, as will not give the Audience leave to mind the Writing; and I
<pb facs="tcp:64538:5"/>
doubt not but the Candid Reader will forgive the faults, when he considers, that the great Design was to entertain the Town with variety of Musick, curious Dancing, splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Scenes and Machines: And that I do not, nor ever did intend to value my self upon the writing of this Play. For I had rather be Author of one Scene of Comedy, like some of <hi>Ben. Johnsons,</hi> then of all the best Plays of this kind that have been, or ever shall be written: Good Comedy requiring much more Wit and Iudgment in the Writer, then any Rhiming, unnatural Plays can do: This I have so little valu'd, that I have not alter'd six lines in it since it was first written, which (except the Songs at the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Psyche</hi> in the last Scene) was all done Sixteen moneths since. In all the words which are sung, I did not so much take care of the Wit or Fancy of'em, as the making of'em proper for Musick; in which I cannot but have some little knowledge, having been bred for many years of my Youth to some performance in it.</p>
            <p>I chalked out the way to the Composer (in all but the Song of Furies and Devils in the Fifth Act) having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd which Line I would have sung by One, which by Two, which by Three, which by four Voices, &amp;c. and what manner of Humour I would have in all the Vocal Musick.</p>
            <p>And by his excellent Composition, that long known able and approved Master of Musick, Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> (Composer to His Majesty, and Organist to the Queen) has done me a great deal of right; though, I believe, the unskilful in Musick will not like the more solemn part of it, as the Musick in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the Song of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing Lovers,</hi> in the Second Act; both which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="tcp:64538:6"/>
and admirable in their kinds, and are recommended to the judgment of able Musicians: for those who are not so, there are light and ayery things to please them.</p>
            <p>All the Instrumental Musick (which is not mingled with the Vocal) was composed by that Great Master, Seignior <hi>Gio: Baptista Draghi,</hi> Master of the <hi>Italian</hi> Musick to the King. The Dances were made by the most famous Master of <hi>France,</hi> Monsieur St. <hi>Andreé.</hi> The Scenes were Painted by the Ingenious Artist, Mr. <hi>Stephenson.</hi> In those things that concern the Ornament or Decoration of the Play, the great industry and care of Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, at whose desire I wrote upon this Subject.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AS a young Wanton when she first begins,</l>
               <l>With shame and with regret of Conscience sins;</l>
               <l>So fares our trembling Poet, the first time,</l>
               <l>He has committed the lewd sin of Rhime,</l>
               <l>While Custom hardens others in the Crime.</l>
               <l>It might in him that boldness too beget,</l>
               <l>To lay about him without fear or wit:</l>
               <l>But humbly he your pardon does implore;</l>
               <l>Already he repents, and says he'll sin no more.</l>
               <l>His bus'ness now is to shew splendid Scenes,</l>
               <l>T'interpret 'twixt the Audience and Machines.</l>
               <l>You must not here expect exalted Thought,</l>
               <l>Nor lofty Verse, nor Scenes with labour wrought:</l>
               <l>His Subject's humble, and his Verse is so;</l>
               <l>This Theme no thundring Raptures would allow,</l>
               <l>Nor would he, if he could, that way pursue.</l>
               <l>He'd ride unruly Fancy with a Bit,</l>
               <l>And keep within the bounds of Sense and Wit,</l>
