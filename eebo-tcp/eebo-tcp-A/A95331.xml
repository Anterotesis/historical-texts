            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleaſed to take notice, That this
Diſcourſe was not intended by the
Author to have been ſent abroad
thus by it ſelf, but was fitted by
him to the ayr and mode of other
Diſcourſes, wherewith he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
it to be joyned. But ſome perſons of judgement,
to whoſe peruſal it was committed, ſuppoſing that if this
ſhould be kept in till thoſe other could be finiſhed, ſome
diſadvantage might ariſe to the cauſe which it aſſerts,
wiſhed and adviſed it might be publiſhed by it ſelf. To
whoſe deſires the Author (againſt his firſt deſign) hath
condeſcended, upon this perſwaſion, That though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
thus without ſome formalities and complements
requiſite to an intire Treatiſe, yet, as to the thing it
ſelf, there is nothing wanting to it which he believed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
to the Queſtion, or uſeful to the Church. And as
for thoſe Arguments which in <hi>The Liberty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,</hi>
Sect. 18. are alleaged againſt <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi>
and in the opinion of ſome, do ſeem to
ſtand in need of anſwering, he had it once in thought to
have anſwered them: but upon theſe conſiderations he
<pb facs="tcp:115910:3"/>
forbore, 1. Becauſe thoſe Arguments are not good in
themſelves, or to the Queſtion preciſely conſidered:
but onely by relation to the preceding Arguments there
brought for Paedobaptiſm, they may ſeem good one
againſt another, but theſe in the Plea for the Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
have no ſtrength, but what is accidental (as
he conceives.) 2. Becauſe in this Diſcourſe he hath
really laid ſuch grounds, and proved them, that upon
their ſuppoſition all thoſe Arguments in <hi>The Liberty
of Prophecying,</hi> and all other which he ever heard
of, will fall of themſelves. 3. Becauſe thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to his ſenſe, are ſo weak, and ſo relying upon
failing and deceitful Principles, that he was loath to do
them ſo much reputation, as to account them worthy
the anſwering. 4. But becauſe there may be ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities
which he knows not of, and are better obſerved
by them who live in the midſt of them, then by himſelf,
who is thruſt into a Retirement in <hi>Wales,</hi> therefore he
accounts himſelf at reſt in this particular, becauſe he
hath underſtood that his very worthy friend Dr. <hi>H:
Hammond</hi> hath in his charity and humility deſcended
to anſwer that Collection; and hopes, that both their
hands being ſo faſt clasped in a mutual complication,
will do ſome help and aſsiſtance to this Queſtion, by
which the Ark of the Church is ſo violently ſhaken.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE
Of BAPTISM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the holy Jeſus was to begin his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Office,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> and to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Church on the Corner-ſtone,
he firſt temper'd the Cement with <hi>water</hi>
and then with <hi>blood,</hi> and afterwards
built it up by the hands of the Spirit:
Himſelf enter'd at that door by which
his diſciples for ever after were to follow
him; for therefore he went in at the door
of Baptiſm, that he might hallow the entrance which himſelf
made to the Houſe he was now building.</p>
            <p>As it was in the old,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> ſo it is in the new Creation; out <hi>of the
waters God produced every living creature:</hi> and when at firſt
<hi>the Spirit moved upon the waters,</hi> and gave life, it was the type
of what was deſigned in the <hi>Renovation.</hi> Every thing that lives
now, is <hi>born of Water and the Spirit;</hi> and Chriſt, who is our
Creator and Redeemer in the new birth, opened the fountains
and hallowed the ſtream: Chriſt who is our life went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the waters of Baptiſm, and we who deſcend thither finde
the effects of life; it is <hi>living water,</hi> of which whoſo drinks,
needs not to drink of it again,<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 14.</note> for <hi>it ſhall be in him a well of
water ſpringing up to life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe every thing is reſolved into the ſame principles
from whence they are taken,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the old world which by the power
of God came from the waters, by their own ſin fell into the
waters again, and were all drowned, and onely eight perſons
were ſaved by an Ark: and the world renewed upon the ſtock
and reſerves of that mercy, conſigned the Sacrament of Baptiſm
in another figure; for then God gave his ſign from Heaven,
that by water the world ſhould never again periſh: but he
meant that they ſhould be ſaved by water: for <hi>Baptiſm, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115910:4"/>
is a figure like to this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>doth alſo now ſave us by the reſurrection
of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> the Jews report that the world took up the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Baptiſms, in remembrance that the iniquity of the old
world was purged by water; and they waſhed all that came
to the ſervice of the true God, and by that baptiſm bound
them to the obſervation of the Precepts which God gave to
<hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when God ſeparated a family for his own eſpecial ſervice,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note>
he gave them a Sacrament of <hi>initiation,</hi> but it was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of blood, the Covenant of Circumciſion: and this was
the <hi>fore-runner</hi> of Baptiſm, but not a <hi>type;</hi> when that was
abrogated, this came into the place of it, and that conſigned the
ſame faith which this profeſſes: but it could not properly be a type,
whoſe nature is by a likeneſs of matter or ceremony to repreſent
the ſame myſtery.<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra in lege, imago in Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio, veritas in coelo. <hi>S. Ambr.</hi>
               </note> Neither is a Ceremony, as Baptiſm truly is,
properly capable of having a type, it ſelf is but a type of a
greater myſteriouſneſs: and the nature of types is, in ſhadow
to deſcribe by dark lines a future ſubſtance; ſo that although
Circumciſion might be a type of the effects and graces beſtowed
in Baptiſm, yet of the Baptiſm or ablution it ſelf, it cannot
be properly; becauſe of the unlikeneſs of the ſymboles and
configurations, and becauſe they are both equally diſtant from
ſubſtances, which types are to conſign and repreſent. The
firſt Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Chriſtian Jews for many
years retained Circumciſion together with Baptiſm; and Chriſt
himſelf, who was circumciſed, was alſo baptized; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not ſo proper to call Circumciſion a type of Baptiſm:
it was rather a ſeal and ſign of the ſame Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi>
and the Fathers, and to all Iſrael, as Baptiſm is to all ages of
the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this Rite could not be adminiſtred to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
and was not at all times after its inſtitution, God was
pleaſed by a proper and ſpecifick type to conſign this Rite of
Baptiſm, which he intended to all, and that for ever: and God,
when this family of his Church grew ſeparate, notorious, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and diſtinct, he ſent them into their own Countrey by
a Baptiſm through which the whole Nation paſs'd: <hi>for all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115910:4"/>
fathers were under the Cloud, and all paſſed through the ſea,
and were all baptized unto Moſes in the Cloud, and in the ſea;</hi>
ſo by a double figure foretelling, That as they were initiated
to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law by the Cloud above and the Sea beneath:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 2.</note> ſo
ſhould all the perſons of the Church, Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
be initiated unto Chriſt by the Spirit from above and the
Water below: for it was the deſign of the Apoſtle in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
to repreſent that the Fathers and we were equal as to the
priviledges of the Covenant; he proved that we do not exceed
them, and it ought therefore to be certain that they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
us, nor their children ours.</p>
            <p>But after this,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> ſomething was to remain which might not onely
conſign the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but be
as a paſſage from the Fathers thorough the Synagogue to the
Church; from <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and that was
<hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which was a Rite which God choſe to be a mark
to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which were not within the Covenant of Grace, and to be
<hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> which God made to be the
ſpirit and life of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Circumciſion although it was miniſtred to all
the males,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> yet it was not to the females; and although they and
all the Nation was baptized and initiated into <hi>Moſes in the
Cloud and the Sea,</hi> yet the Children of Iſrael by imitation of the
Patriarchs the poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> uſed alſo Ceremonial Baptiſms
to their women and to their Proſelytes, and to all that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;
and the Jews deliver, That <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> when
they were adopted into the family of the Church, that is, of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> were baptized: and ſo were all ſtrangers
that were married to the ſons of Iſrael. And that we may think
this typical of Chriſtian Baptiſm, the Doctors of the Jews had
a Tradition, that when the Meſſias would come, there ſhould
be ſo many Proſelytes that they could not be circumciſed, but
ſhould be baptized. The Tradition proved true, but not for
their reaſon.</p>
            <p>But that this Rite of admitting into myſteries, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and offices of Religion by Baptiſms, was uſed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
of <hi>Noah,</hi> or at leaſt very early among the Jews, beſides
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115910:5"/>
the teſtimonies of their own Doctors, I am the rather induced to
believe, becauſe the Heathen had the ſame Rite in many places
and in ſeveral Religions: ſo they initiated diſciples into the
ſecrets of<note n="a" place="margin">Tertull. de praeſcrip. c. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Mithra;</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Cotyttus</hi> were called
<note n="b" place="margin">Scholiaſt. in Ju. ſat. 2. l. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Baptae,</hi> becauſe by Baptiſm they were admitted into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and they<note n="c" place="margin">O nimium faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les qui triſtia crimina caedis Tolli ſtumineâ poſſe putatis aquâ.</note> thought Murther, Inceſt, Rapes, and the worſt
of Crimes, were purged by dipping in the Sea, or freſh Springs;
and a Proſelyte is called in <hi>Arrianus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>intinctus,</hi> a
baptized perſon.</p>
            <p>But this Ceremony of baptizing was ſo certain and uſual
among the Jews,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> in their admitting Proſelytes and adopting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
inſtitutions, that to baptize and to make diſciples are all
one;<note place="margin">John 4. 1.</note> and when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> by an order from Heaven
went to prepare the way to the Coming of our bleſſed Lord,
he preached Repentance, and baptized all that profeſſed
they did repent. He taught the Jews to live good lives, and
baptized with the Baptiſm of a Prophet, ſuch as was not
unuſually done by extraordinary and holy perſons in the
change or renewing of Diſcipline or Religion. Whether
<hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm <hi>was from heaven, or of men,</hi> Chriſt asked the
Phariſees. That it was from Heaven, the people therefore

fame for the gathering of Diſciples and admitting
Proſelytes: and the Diſciples of Chriſt did ſo too, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt had inſtituted the Sacrament for the Chriſtian

to believe in the Meſſias now appearing, and to repent of their

Proſelytes or Diſciples, as <hi>John</hi> did; onely they (as it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)

doing it in purſuance of the deſign of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm; and
the latter the form of inſtitution by Chriſt for the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church, appointed after his Reſurrection: the Diſciples at
firſt uſing promiſcuouſly what was uſed by the ſame authority,
though with ſome difference of Myſtery.</p>
            <p>The Holy Jeſus having found his way ready prepared by the
preaching of <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> and by his Baptiſm, and the Jewiſh manner
of adopting Proſelytes and Diſciples into the Religion, a way
chalked out for him to initiate diſciples into his Religion, took
what was ſo prepared, and changed it into a perpetual Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He kept the Ceremony, that they who were led onely
by outward things, might be the better called in, and eaſier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
into the Religion, when they entred by a Ceremony which
their Nation alwayes uſed in the like caſes: and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
change of the outward act, he put into it a new ſpirit, and
gave it a new grace and a proper efficacy: He ſublim'd it to
higher ends, and adorned it with ſtars of Heaven: He made it
to ſignifie greater myſteries, to convey greater bleſſings, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
the bigger Promiſes, to cleanſe deeper then the skin, and
to carry Proſelytes further then the gates of the inſtitution. For
ſo he was pleaſed to do in the other Sacrament; he took the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
which he found ready in the Cuſtom of the Jews, where
the <hi>Major domo</hi> after the Paſchal Supper gave Bread and Wine
to every perſon of his family; he changed nothing of it without,
but transferr'd the Rite to greater myſteries, and put his own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115910:6"/>
Spirit to their Sign, and it became a Sacrament Evangelical.
It was ſo alſo in the matter of Excommunication, where the
Jewiſh practiſe was made to paſs into Chriſtian diſcipline: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violence and noiſe <hi>old things became new,</hi> while <hi>he fulfilled
the Law,</hi> making it up in full meaſures of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>By theſe ſteps Baptiſm paſſed on to a divine Evangelical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note>

               <hi>Hermias,</hi> and their followers, people of a dayes abode
and ſmall intereſt, but of malicious doctrine, taught, Baptiſm
not to be neceſſary, not to be uſed; upon this ground, Becauſe
they ſuppoſed that it was proper to <hi>John</hi> to <hi>baptize with water,</hi>
and reſerved for <hi>Chriſt</hi> as his peculiar, to <hi>baptize with the holy
Ghoſt and with fire.</hi> Indeed Chriſt baptized none otherwiſe.
He ſent his Spirit upon the Church in Pentecoſt and baptized
them with fire, the Spirit appearing like a flame: but he
appointed his Apoſtles to baptize with water, and they
did ſo, and their ſucceſſors after them, every where and for
ever, not expounding, but obeying the praeceptive words of
their Lord, which were almoſt the laſt that he ſpake upon
earth. And I cannot think it neceſſary to prove this to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
by any more Arguments. For the words are ſo plain,
that they need no expoſition; and yet if they had been obſcure,
the univerſal practiſe of the Apoſtles and the Church for ever,
is a ſufficient declaration of the Commandment: No Tradition
is more univerſal, no not of Scripture it ſelf; no words are
plainer, no not the Ten Commandments: and if any ſuſpicion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115910:6"/>
can be ſuperinduced by any jealous or leſs diſcerning perſon, it
will need no other refutation, but to turn his eyes to thoſe lights
by which himſelf ſees Scripture to be the Word of God, and
the Commandments to be the declaration of his Will.</p>
            <p>But that which will be of greateſt concernment in this affair,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note>
is to conſider the great benefits are conveyed to us in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for this will highly conclude, That the Precept was for
ever, which God ſo ſeconds with his grace and mighty bleſſings;
and the ſuſception of it neceſſary, becauſe we cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thoſe excellent things which are the graces of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt fruit is,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> That in Baptiſm we are admitted to the
Kingdome of Chriſt, preſented unto him, conſigned with his

we can, become his Diſciples, witneſſing a good confeſſion, and

theſe three agree in one, or are to one purpoſe; they agree
in Baptiſm, and in the whole purſuance of the aſſiſtances, which
a Chriſtian needs all dayes of his life: And therefore S. <hi>Cyril</hi>

               </gap>, the Antitype of
the Paſſions of Chriſt: it does preconſign the death of Chriſt;
and does the infancy of the work of grace, but not weakly; it
brings from death to life; and though it brings us but to the
birth in the new life, yet that is a greater change then is in all the
periods of our growth to manhood, to <hi>a perfect man in Chriſt

               <hi>Baptiſm</hi> does not onely pardon our ſins, but <hi>puts us into
a ſtate of pardon for the time to come.</hi> For Baptiſm is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the New life, and an admiſſion of us into the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Covenant, which on our parts conſiſts in a ſincere and
timely endevour to glorifie God by Faith and Obedience: and
on Gods part, he will pardon what is paſt, aſſiſt us for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not meaſure us by grains and ſcruples, or exact our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the meaſure of an Angel, but by the ſpan of a mans
hand. So that by Baptiſm we are conſigned to the mercies of
God. and the graces of the Goſpel; that is, that our pardon be
continued, and our piety be a ſtate of Repentance. And therefore
that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed we profeſs to be <hi>for
the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> is called in the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Creed, <hi>The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm

the gate to a perpetual change and reformation, all the way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
our title to, and hopes of forgiveneſs of ſins. And this
excellency is clearly recorded by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

veſtment of Light, or rather Light it ſelf.</q> And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it is, that Baptiſm is not to be repeated, becauſe it does at
once all that it can do at a hundred times: for it admits us to
the condition of Repentance and Evangelical Mercy, to a ſtate
of pardon for our infirmities and ſins, which we timely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
leave: and this is a thing that can be done but once,
as a man can begin but once; he that hath once entred in at
this gate of life is alwayes in poſſibility of pardon, if he be in a
poſſibility of working and doing after the manner of a man, that
which he hath promiſed to the Son of God. And this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly

               <q>That which the

and word of ſanctification, all the evils of the
regenerate are cleanſed and healed: not onely the ſins that are
paſt, which all are now remitted in Baptiſm; but alſo thoſe that
are contracted afterwards by humane ignorance and infirmity:
Not that Baptiſm be repeated as often as we ſin, but becauſe by
this which is once adminiſtred,<note place="margin">Vide Salmeron. tom, 13. p. 487.</note> is brought to paſs that pardon
of all ſins, not onely of thoſe that are paſt, but alſo thoſe
which will be committed afterwards, is obtained.</q> The <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians</hi>
denyed this, and it was part of their Hereſie in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of Baptiſm; and for it they are moſt excellently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by <hi>Iſidore Peluſiot,</hi> in his third Book, 195 Epiſtle to the
Count <hi>Hermin:</hi> whither I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>In proportion to this Doctrine it is,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> that the holy Scripture
calls upon us to live a holy life, in purſuance of this grace of
Baptiſm. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> recals the lapſed <hi>Galatians</hi> to their
Covenant, and the grace of God ſtipulated in Baptiſm: <hi>Ye are
all children of God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26.</note> that is, <hi>heirs of

do not you hope to be <hi>juſtified by the Law,</hi> for you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Covenant of Faith, and are to be juſtified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
This is all your hope, by this you muſt ſtand for ever, or
you cannot ſtand at all; but by this you may: for you are Gods
children by faith; that is, not by the Law, or the Covenant of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115910:9"/>
Works: And that you may remember whence you are going,
and return again, he proves, that they are the children of God
by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they have <hi>been baptized into
Chriſt, and ſo put on Chriſt.</hi> This makes you <hi>children,</hi> and
ſuch as are <hi>to be ſaved by faith,</hi> that is, a Covenant, <hi>not of
Works,</hi> but <hi>of Pardon</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, the Author and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſher
of this Covenant. For <hi>this is the Covenant</hi> made in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
<hi>That being juſtified by his grace, we ſhall be heirs of
life eternal: for by grace,</hi> that is, by favor, remiſſion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ye are ſaved.</hi> This is the onely way
that we have of being juſtified, and this muſt remain as long as
we are in hopes of heaven: for beſides this we have no hopes,
and all this is ſtipulated and conſigned in Baptiſm, and is of
force after our fallings into ſin and riſings again. In purſuance of
this, the ſame Apoſtle declares, That the ſeveral ſtates of ſin,
are ſo many receſſions from the ſtate of baptiſmal grace;
and if we arrive to the direct Apoſtaſie and renouncing <hi>of,</hi> or a
contradiction <hi>to,</hi> the ſtate of Baptiſm, we are then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable,
becauſe we are faln from <hi>our ſtate of pardon.</hi> This
S.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 16, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> conditions moſt ſtrictly, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;

Chriſt; which we afterwards renew in memory and <hi>Euchariſt,</hi>

it follows; <hi>Having boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt by the blood
of Ieſus, by a new and living way, that is, by the vail of his

by vertue of the Covenant conſign'd in Baptiſm, does like a
Centre, tranſmit effluxes to all the periods and portion of our life:
<hi>our whole life,</hi> all the periods of our ſucceeding hopes, are kept
alive by this. This conſideration is of great uſe, beſides many
other things, to reprove the folly of thoſe who in the Primitive
Church deferr'd their Baptiſm till their death-bed: Becauſe
Baptiſm is a laver of ſanctification, and drowns all our ſins, and
buries them in the grave of our Lord, they thought they might
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115910:10"/>
ſin ſecurely upon the ſtock of an after-Baptiſm; for unleſs they
were ſtrangely preventedly a ſudden accident, a death-bed Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
they thought would ſecure their condition: but early ſome
of them durſt not take it, much leſs in the beginning of their
years, that they might at leaſt gain impunity for their follies
and heats of their youth. Baptiſm hath influence into the pardon
of all our ſins committed in all the dayes of our folly and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
and ſo long as we have not been baptized, ſo long we are
out of the ſtate of pardon, and therefore an early. Baptiſm is not
to be avoided, upon this miſtaken fancy and plot upon Heaven:
it is the greater ſecurity towards the pardon of our ſins, if we
have taken it in the beginning of our dayes.</p>
            <p>5. The next benefit of Baptiſm,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> which is alſo a verification of

The holy Ghoſt deſcends upon the waters of Baptiſm, and
makes them prolifical, apt to produce children unto God: and
therefore Saint <hi>Leo</hi> compares the Font of Baptiſm, to the Womb
of the bleſſed Virgin. when it was repleniſhed with the holy
Spirit. And this is the Baptiſm of our deareſt Lord: his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
baptize with water; our Lord at the ſame time verifies
their Miniſtery, with giving the holy Spirit: They are joyned

Water and of the Spirit;</hi> by Water we are ſacramently dead

are myſterious expreſſions, and according to the ſtyle of Scripture,
high and ſecret in ſpiritual ſignifications, therefore that we may
underſtand what theſe things ſignifie, we muſt conſider it by
its real effects, and what it produces upon the Soul of a
man.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> It is the ſuppletory of original Righteouſneſs, by which

               <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt gracious with God, and which he loſt by his
prevarication. It was in him a principle of wiſdome and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
a relation between God and himſelf, a title to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
mercies of God, and <hi>a ſtate of friendſhip:</hi> when he
fell, he was diſcompoſed in all, the links of the golden chain
and bleſſed relation were broken; and it ſo continued in the
whole life of man, which was ſtained with the evils of this folly,
and the conſequent miſchiefs: and therefore when we began
the world again, entring into the Articles of a new life, God
gave us his Spirit, to be an inſtrument of our becoming gracious
perſons, and of being in a condition of obtaining that ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
end which God at firſt deſigned to us. And therefore as
our Baptiſm is a ſeparation of us from unbelieving people: ſo
the deſcent of the holy Spirit upon us in our Baptiſm, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
or marking us for God, as the ſheep of his paſture, as
the ſouldiers of his Army, as the ſervants of his houſhold: we
are ſo ſeparated from the world, that we are appropriated to
God, ſo that God expects of us duty and obedience; and all
ſins are acts of rebellion and undutifulneſs: Of this nature was
the ſanctification of <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb; that is, God took them to his own ſervice by an
early deſignation, and his Spirit mark'd them to a holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
To this alſo relates that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom God by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
ſeparated from his mothers womb to the Miniſtery of the
Goſpel: the decree did antedate the act of the Spirit, which
did not deſcend upon him until the day of his Baptiſm. What
theſe perſons were in order to exterior Miniſteries, that all the
faithful are in order to faith and obedience, conſigned in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
by the Spirit of God, to a perpetual relation to God, in a
continual ſervice and title to his Promiſes. And in this ſenſe the
Spirit of God is called <gap reason="foreign">

ſacramentally, and that part which is wholly the work of God,
does onely antedate the work of man, which is to ſucceed in its

It is more conſiderable, which is generally and piouſly believed

God aſſigns an Angel Guardian: for then the Catechumen

ſure not to want the aids of them who <hi>pitch their tents round

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 7.</note> and that this guard and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
is then appointed, when themſelves are admitted into the

agreeable to the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

to waſh away our ſins, and to purifie our ſouls: but not

pardon for them that hate their ſin, and procures grace for them
that love it. They that are guilty of ſins, muſt repent of them,
and renounce them, and they muſt make a profeſſion of the faith

               <hi>the onely Baptiſm that

need is there of that Baptiſm that can onely cleanſe the fleſh and

<hi>I ſuppoſe that an exact and a firm repentance, is a ſufficient
purification to a man; if judging and conſidering our ſelves for
the facts we have done before, we proceed to that which is before
us, conſidering that which follows, and cleanſing or waſhing our

we uſe to deny the effect to the inſtrumental cauſe, and attribute
it to the principal in the manner of ſpeaking, when our purpoſe
is to affirm this to be the principal, and of chief influence. So
we ſay, It is not the good Lute, but the skilful hand that makes
the muſick: It is not the body, but the ſoul that is the man; and
yet he is not the man without both. For Baptiſm is but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial

Chriſt himſelf did not do all his bleſſings and effects

need, ſo does Baptiſm. Chriſt did not cure all mens eyes, but
them onely that were blinde: Chriſt <hi>came not to call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
but ſinners to repentance;</hi> that is, they that lived in the
fear of God, according to the Covenant in which they were
debtors, were indeed improved and promoted higher by Chriſt,
but not called to that repentance to which he called the vitious
Gentiles, and the adulterous perſons among the Jews, and the
hypocritical Phariſees. There are ſome ſo innocent, that they
<hi>need no repentance</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) meaning, That though
they do need contrition for their ſingle acts of ſin, yet they are
within the ſtate of grace, and need not repentance, as it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the whole man: and ſo it is in Baptiſm, which does
all its effects upon them that need them all; and ſome upon them
that need but ſome: and therefore as it pardons ſins to them that
have committed them, and do repent and believe; ſo to the
others who have not committed them, it does all the work which
is done to the others, above or beſides that pardon.</p>

Current, in which the Spirit moves and deſcends upon us; and
where Gods Spirit is, they are the ſons of God: for Chriſts

ad ſanandum multâ curatione opus eſt.</hi> The work of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that is begun in the Miniſtery of Baptiſm, is perfected in
ſome ſooner, and in ſome later: we may ſoon be waſhed, but to
be healed, is a work of a longcure.</p>
            <p>3. The diſpoſitions which are required to the ordinary ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſception
of Baptiſm,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> are not neceſſary to the efficacy, or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the nature of the Sacrament; but accidentally, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the ſuperinduced neceſſities of ſome men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the conditions are not regularly to be required, but in thoſe
accidents. It was neceſſary for a Gentile Proſelyte to repent of
his ſins, and to believe in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, before he could be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;
but <hi>Abraham</hi> was not tyed to the ſame conditions,
but onely to faith in God; but <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not tyed to ſo much:
and <hi>Circumciſion was not of Moſes, but of the Fathers:</hi> and
yet after the ſanction of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, men were tyed to Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which were then made neceſſary to them that entred into
the Covenant, but not neceſſary to the nature of the Covenant
it ſelf. And ſo it is in the ſuſception of Baptiſm: if a ſinner
enters into the Font, it is neceſſary he be ſtripp'd of thoſe appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
which himſelf ſewed upon his Nature, and then Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is a neceſſary diſpoſition. If his underſtanding hath been
a ſtranger to Religion, polluted with evil Principles, and a falſe
Religion, it is neceſſary he have an actual faith, that he be given
in his underſtanding up to the obedience of Chriſt: and the
reaſon of theſe is plain, Becauſe in theſe perſons there is a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
contrary to the ſtate and effects of Baptiſm; and therefore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115910:16"/>
they muſt be taken off by their contraries, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi>
that they may be reduced to the ſtate of pure receptives. And
this is the ſenſe of thoſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs
ye become like one of theſe little ones, ye ſhall not enter into the
kingdome of heaven;</hi> that is, ye cannot be admitted into the
Goſpel-Covenant, unleſs all your contrarieties and impediments
be taken from you, and you be as apt as children to receive the
new immiſſions from heaven. And this Propoſition relies upon
a great Example, and a certain Reaſon. The Example is our
bleſſed Saviour, who was <hi>Nullius poenitentiae debitor,</hi> he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no ſin, and needed no repentance; he needed not to be
ſaved by faith, for of faith he was <hi>the Author and Finiſher,</hi> and
the great object, and its perfection and reward, and yet he was
baptized by the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> the Baptiſm of Repentance.
And therefore it is certain, that Repentance and Faith are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the ſuſception of Baptiſm, but neceſſary to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are baptized. For it is neceſſary we ſhould much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the difference. If the Sacrament in any perſon may be
juſtly received, in whom ſuch diſpoſitions are not to be found,
then the diſpoſitions are not neceſſary or intrinſecal to the ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Sacrament; and yet ſome perſons coming to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
may have ſuch neceſſities of their own, as will make
the Sacrament ineffectual without ſuch diſpoſitions: Theſe I call
<hi>neceſſary to the perſon,</hi> but <hi>not to the Sacrament;</hi> that is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to all ſuch, but not neceſſary to all abſolutely. And faith
is neceſſary ſometimes where Repentance is not, and ſometimes
Repentance and Faith together, and ſometimes otherwiſe. When
<hi>Philip</hi> baptized the Eunuch,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 37. Acts 2. 38.</note> he onely required of him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
not to repent. But S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he preached to the
Jews, and converted them, onely required Repentance: which
although in their caſe implyed faith, yet there was no explicit
ſtipulation for it:<note place="margin">Acts 3. 15.</note> they had <hi>crucified the Lord of life,</hi> and if
they would come to God by Baptiſm, they muſt renounce their
ſin: that was all was then ſtood upon. It is as the caſe is, or
as the perſons have ſuperinduced neceſſities upon themſelves. In
children the caſe is evident, as to the one part, which is equally
required; I mean, <hi>Repentance:</hi> The not doing of which, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prejudice them as to the ſuſception of Baptiſm; becauſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115910:16"/>
they having done no evil, are not bound to repent; and <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
is as neceſſary to the ſuſception of Baptiſm, as <hi>Faith</hi> is:
but this ſhews, that they are accidentally neceſſary; that is, not
abſolutely, not to all, not to Infants: and if they may be excuſed
from one duty, which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to Baptiſm,
why they may not from the other, is a ſecret which will not be
found out by theſe whom it concerns to believe it.</p>
            <p>And therefore when our bleſſed Lord made a ſtipulation and
expreſs Commandment for faith,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> with the greateſt annexed pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
to them that had it not, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be
damned,</hi> the propoſition is not to be verified or underſtood as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to every period of time; for then no man could be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from infidelity to the Chriſtian faith, and from the power of
the Devil to the Kingdome of Chriſt, but his preſent infidelity
ſhall be his final ruine. It is not therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not
<hi>a ſentence,</hi> but <hi>a uſe,</hi> a <hi>praediction</hi> and <hi>intermination.</hi> It is not
like that ſaying [<hi>God is true, and every man a lyar] [Every
good, and every perfect gift is from above:</hi>] for theſe are true in
every inſtant, without reference to circumſtances: but <hi>He that
believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> is a prediction, or that which in
Rhetorick is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>a uſe,</hi> becauſe this is the affirmation
of that which <hi>uſually</hi> or frequently comes to paſs: ſuch as this.
<hi>He that ſtrikes with the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword; He
that robs a Church, ſhall be like a wheel,</hi> of a vertiginous and
unſtable eſtate; <hi>He that loves wine and oyle, ſhall not be rich:</hi>
and therefore it is a declaration of that which is univerſally or
commonly true; but not ſo, that in what inſtance ſoever a man
is not <hi>a believer,</hi> in that inſtant it is true to ſay <hi>he is damned;</hi>
for ſome are called the third, ſome the ſixth, ſome the ninth hour,
and they that come in, being firſt called, at the eleventh hour,
ſhall have their reward: ſo that this ſentence ſtands true at the
day and the Judgement of the Lord, not at the judgement or
day of man. And in the ſame neceſſity as faith ſtands to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
in the ſame it ſtands to Baptiſm; that is, to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the whole latitude of its extent. Our Baptiſm ſhall no
more do all its intention, unleſs faith ſupervene, then a man is in
poſſibility of being ſaved without faith; it muſt come in its due
time, but is not indiſpenſably neceſſary in all inſtants and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115910:17"/>
Baptiſm is the ſeal of our Election and Adoption; and
as Election is brought to effect by faith, and its conſequents; ſo
is Baptiſm: but to neither is faith neceſſary, as to its beginning
and firſt entrance. To which alſo I adde this Conſideration,
That actual faith is neceſſary, not to the ſuſception, but to the
conſequent effects of Baptiſm, appears, Becauſe the Church, and
particularly the Apoſtles, did baptize ſome perſons who had not
faith, but were hypocrites, ſuch as were <hi>Simon Magus, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
the Copper-ſmith, <hi>Demas,</hi> and <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> and ſuch
was <hi>Judas</hi> when he was baptized, and ſuch were the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi>
Teachers. For the effect depends upon God, who knows the
heart, but the outward ſuſception depends upon them who do
not know it; which is a certain argument, That the ſame faith
that is neceſſary to the effect of the Sacrament, is not neceſſary
to its ſuſception; and if it can be adminiſtred to hypocrites,
much more to Infants; if to thoſe who really hinder the effect,
much rather to them that hinder not. And if it be objected,
That the Church does not know but the pretenders have faith,
but ſhe knows Infants have not. I reply, That the Church
does not know but the pretenders hinder the effect, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the grace of the Sacrament; but ſhe knows that Infants
do not. The firſt poſſibly may receive the grace, the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hinder it.</p>
            <p>But beſide theſe things,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> it is conſiderable, That when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
perſons have faith: it is true, they that require Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
ſhould give a reaſon why they do: ſo it was in the caſe
of the Eunuch baptized by <hi>Philip.</hi> But this is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of others that do not ask it, and yet they be <hi>of the
Church,</hi> and <hi>of the Faith:</hi> for by <hi>Faith</hi> is alſo underſtood the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and <hi>the Chriſtian Faith</hi> is the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
and of this a man may be, though he make no confeſſion
of his faith; as a man may be of the Church, and yet not be of
the number of Gods ſecrets ones: and to <hi>this</hi> more is required
then to <hi>that;</hi> to the firſt it is ſufficient that he be admitted by a
Sacrament or a Ceremony: which is infallibly certain, becauſe
hypocrites and wicked people ate in the viſible Communion of
the Church, and are reckoned as members of it, and yet to them
there was nothing done but the Ceremony adminiſtred; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115910:17"/>
therefore when that is done to Infants, they alſo ate to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
in the Church Communion. And indeed in the examples
of Scripture, we finde more inſerted into the number of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
by outward Ceremony, then by the inward grace: of this
number were all thoſe who were circumciſed the eighth day,
who were admitted thither, as the womans daughter was cured
in the Goſpel, by the faith of their mother, their natural parents,
or their ſpiritual: To whoſe faith it is as certain God will take
heed, as to their faith who brought one to Chriſt who could not
come himſelf, the poor Paralytick; for when Chriſt <hi>ſaw their
faith,</hi> he cured their friend: and yet it is to be obſerved, That
Chriſt did uſe to exact faith, actual faith, of them that came to
him to be cured [<hi>According to your faith be it unto you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 9. 28.</note>] The
caſe is equal in its whole kinde. And it is conſiderable what
Chriſt ſaith to the poor man that came in behalf of his ſon, <hi>All
things are poſſible to him that believeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 9. 23.</note> it is poſſible for a ſon to
receive the bleſſing and benefit of his fathers faith: and it was
ſo in his caſe, and is poſſible to any; for <hi>to faith all things are
poſſible.</hi> And as to the event of things, it is evident in the ſtory
of the Goſpel, That the faith of their relatives was equally effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to children, and friends, or ſervants, abſent or ſick, as the
faith of the intereſted perſon was to himſelf: As appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all exception in the caſe of the friends of the Paralytick,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 13.</note> let
down with cords thorough the tyles; of the Centurion in behalf
of his ſervant:<note place="margin">John 4. 50.</note> of the noble man, for his ſon ſick at <hi>Capernaum;</hi>
of the <hi>Syrophoenician,</hi> for her daughter: and Chriſt required
faith of no ſick man,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 28.</note> but of him that preſented himſelf to him,
and deſired for himſelf that he might be cured, as it was in the
caſe of the blinde men. Though they could believe, yet Chriſt
required belief of them that came to him on their behalf. And
why then it may not be ſo, or is not ſo in the caſe of Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
I confeſs it is paſt my skill to conjecture. The Reaſon
on which this further relies, is contained in the next Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>4. No diſpoſition or act of man can deſerve the firſt grace,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> or
the grace of pardon: for ſo long as a man is unpardoned, he is
an evemy to God, and as a dead perſon; and unleſs he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the grace of God, cannot do a ſingle act in order to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115910:18"/>
his pardon and reſtitution: ſo that the firſt work which God
does upon a man, is ſo wholly his own, that the man hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it, but to entertain it, that is, not to hinder the work of
God upon him: and this is done in them that have in them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that can hinder the work of grace, or in them who remove
the hinderances; of the latter ſort are <hi>all ſinners,</hi> who have
lived in a ſtate contrary to God; of the firſt are they who are
prevented by the grace of God, before they can chooſe, that is,
<hi>little children,</hi> and thoſe that become <hi>like unto little children.</hi>
So that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are not neceſſary at firſt to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the firſt grace, but by accident. If ſin have drawn
curtains, and put bars and coverings to the windows, theſe muſt
be taken away; and that is done by faith and repentance: but
if the windows be not ſhut, ſo that the light can paſs thorough
them, the eye of heaven will paſs in and dwell there. <hi>No man
can come unto me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 6. 44.</note> 
               <hi>unleſs my Father draw him;</hi> that is, the firſt
acceſs to Chriſt is nothing of our own, but wholly of God; and
it is as in our creation, in which we have an obediential capacity,
but cooperate not; onely if we be contrary to the work of grace,
<hi>that</hi> contrariety muſt be taken off, elſe there is no neceſſity: and
if all men according to Chriſts ſaying,<note place="margin">Mark 10. 15.</note> 
               <hi>muſt receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God as little children,</hi> it is certain, little children do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it; they receive it as all men ought, that is, without any
impediment or obſtruction, without any thing within that is
contrary to that ſtate.</p>
            <p>5. Baptiſm is not to be eſtimated as one act,<note place="margin">7.</note> tranſient and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
to ſingle purpoſes, but it is an entrance to a conjugation
and a ſtate of bleſſings. All our life is to be tranſacted by the
meaſures of the Goſpel-Covenant, and that Covenant is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by Baptiſm; there we have our title and adoption to it,
and the grace that is then given to us is like a piece of leaven put
into a lump of dow: and faith and repentance do in all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of our life, put it into fermentation and activity. Then the
ſeed of God is put into the ground of our hearts, and repentance
waters it, and faith makes it <hi>ſubactum ſolum,</hi> the ground and
furrows apt to produce fruits: and therefore faith and repentance
are neceſſary to the effect of Baptiſm, not to its ſuſception; that
is, neceſſary to all thoſe parts of life in which Baptiſm does ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115910:18"/>
not to the firſt ſanction or entring into the Covenant. The
ſeed may lye long in the ground, and produce fruits in its due
ſeaſon, if it be refreſhed with <hi>the former and the latter rain,</hi>
that is, the repentance that firſt changes the ſtate, and converts
the man, and afterwards returns him to his title, and recalls him
from his wandrings, and keeps him in the ſtate of grace, and
within the limits of the Covenant: and all the way, faith gives
efficacy and acceptation to this repentance, that is, continues our
title to the Promiſe, of not having righteouſneſs exacted by the
meaſures of the Law, but by the Covenant and Promiſe of grace,
into which we entred in Baptiſm, and walk in the ſame all the
dayes of our life.</p>
            <p>6. The holy Spirit which deſcends upon the waters of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
does nor inſtantly produce its effects in the ſoul of the
baptized;<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and when he does, it is irregularly, and as he pleaſe:
<hi>The Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, and no man knoweth whence
it cometh, nor whither it goeth;</hi> and the Catechumen is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Kingdome, yet <hi>the Kingdome of God cometh not
with obſervation:</hi> and this ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour was
ſpoken of the <hi>Kingdome of of God that is within us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 17. 20, 21.</note> that is,
the Spirit of Grace, the power of the Goſpel put into our
hearts, concerning which, he affirmed, that it operates ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
that it comes not with outward ſhew, <hi>neither ſhall
they ſay, Lo here, or lo there:</hi> which thing I deſire the rather
be obſerved, becauſe in the ſame diſcourſe which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour continued to that aſſembly,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 16.</note> he affirms this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God to belong unto little children, this Kingdome that
cometh not with outward ſignifications, or preſent expreſſes; this
Kingdome that is within us. For the preſent, the uſe I make of
it is this, That no man can conclude that this Kingdome of
Power, that is, the Spirit of Sanctification, is not come upon
Infants, becauſe there is no ſign or expreſſion of it. It is within
us, therefore it hath no ſignification. It is the ſeed of God; and
it is no good Argument to ſay, Here is no ſeed in the bowels of
the earth, becauſe there is nothing green upon the face of it. For
the Church gives the Sacrament, God gives the grace of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
But becauſe he does not alwayes give it at the inſtant
in which the Church gives the Sacrament, (as if there be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115910:19"/>
impediment in the ſuſcipient) and yet afterwards does give
it, when the impediment is removed (as to them that repent of
that impediment) it follows, that the Church may adminiſter
rightly, even before God gives the real grace of the Sacrament;
and if God gives this grace afterwards by parts, and yet all of
it is the effect of that Covenant which was conſigned in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm:
he that defers ſome may defer all, and verifie every part
as well as any part. For it is certain, that in the inſtance now
made, all the grace is deferred; in Infants it is not certain but
that ſome is collated or infuſed: however, be it ſo or no, yet
upon this account the adminiſtration of the Sacrament is not
hindred.</p>
            <p>7. When the Scripture ſpeaks of the effects of,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Baptiſm, it ſpeaks in general expreſſions, as being moſt
apt to ſignifie a common duty, or a general effect, or a more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
event, or the proper order of things: but thoſe general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
do not <hi>ſupponere univerſalitèr,</hi> that is, are not to be
underſtood excluſively to all that are not ſo qualified, or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
of all ſuſcipients, or of all the ſubjects of the propoſition.
When the Prophets complain of the Jews, that they are faln
from God, and turned to Idols, and walk not in the way of their
Fathers; and at other times, the Scripture ſpeaks the ſame thing
of their Fathers, that they walked perverſly toward God, <hi>ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide like a broken bow:</hi> In theſe and the like expreſſions the
holy Scripture uſes a Synecdoche, or ſignifies <hi>many</hi> onely, under
the notion of a more large and indefinite expreſſion; for neither
were all the Fathers good, neither did all the ſons prevaricate:
but among the Fathers there were enough to recommend to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
by way of example; and among the Children, there were
enough to ſtain the reputation of the age: but neither the one
part nor the other was true of every ſingle perſon. S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt</hi>
ſpake to the whole audience, ſaying, <hi>O generation of vipers!</hi>
and yet he did not mean that all <hi>Jeruſalem and Judea</hi> that <hi>went
out to be baptized of him,</hi> were ſuch; but he under an indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
reproof, intended thoſe that were ſuch, that is, eſpecially
the Prieſts and the Phariſees. And it is more conſiderable yet, in
the ſtory of the event of Chriſts Sermon in the Synagogue, upon
his Text taken out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 22, 28.</note> 
               <hi>All wondred at his gracious words,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115910:19"/>
and bare him witneſs.</hi> And a little after, <hi>All they in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
were filled with wrath,</hi> that is, it was generally ſo; but
hardly to be ſuppoſed true of every ſingle perſon, in both the
contrary humors and uſages. Thus Chriſt ſaid to the Apoſtles,
<hi>Ye have abidden with me in my temptations;</hi> and yet <hi>Judas</hi> was
all the way a follower of Intereſt and <hi>the Bag,</hi> rather then
Chriſt: and afterwards none of them all did abide with Chriſt
in his greateſt Temptations. Thus alſo to come nearer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Queſtion, the ſecret effects of Election and of the Spirit,
are in Scripture attributed to all that are of the outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
So S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls all the Chriſtian ſtrangers of the
Eaſtern diſperſion,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Elect, according to the fore-knowledge of
God the Father:</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the ſame of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that their <hi>faith was
ſpoken of in all the world;</hi> and yet amongſt them it is not to
be ſuppoſed, that all the profeſſors had an unreproveable faith,
or that every one of the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and a charitable perſon: and yet the Apoſtle uſeth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>Your faith groweth exceedingly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the charity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you all towards each other, aboundeth.</hi> Theſe are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſignificant of a general cuſtome or order of things, or duty
of men, or deſign, and natural or proper expectation of events;
ſuch are theſe alſo in this very Queſtion. <hi>As many of you as
are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt;</hi> that is, ſo it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,
and ſo it will be in its due time, and that is the order of
things, and the deſigned event: but from hence we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
of every perſon, and in every period of time; <hi>This man
hath been baptized,</hi> therefore <hi>now he is clothed with Chriſt, he
hath put on Chriſt:</hi> nor thus, <hi>This perſon cannot in a ſpiritual
ſenſe as yet put on Chriſt,</hi> therefore <hi>he hath not been baptized,</hi>
that is, <hi>he hath not put him on in a ſacramental ſenſe.</hi> Such is
the ſaying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them
he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified:</hi> this alſo
declares the regular event, or at leaſt the order of things,
and the deſign of God, but not the actual verification of it to all
perſons. Theſe ſayings concerning Baptiſm, in the like manner
are to be ſo underſtood, that they cannot exclude all perſons from
the Sacrament, that have not all thoſe real effects of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115910:20"/>
at all times, which ſome men have at ſome times, and all
men muſt have at ſome time or other, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Sacrament
obtains its laſt intention. But he that ſhall argue from hence,
that Children are not rightly baptized, becauſe they cannot in a
ſpiritual ſenſe put on Chriſt, concludes nothing, unleſs theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
did ſignifie univerſally, and at all times, and in every
perſon, and in every manner: which can no more pretend to
truth, then that all Chriſtians are Gods Elect, and all that are
baptized, are Saints; and all that are called, are juſtified; and
all that are once juſtified, ſhall be ſaved finally. Theſe things
declare onely the event of things, and their order, and the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
effect, and the proper deſign, in their proper ſeaſon, in their
limited proportions.</p>
            <p>8. A Negative Argument for matters of fact in Scripture,
cannot conclude <hi>a Law,</hi> or <hi>a neceſſary,</hi> or <hi>a regular event.</hi> And
therefore ſuppoſing that it be not intimated, that the Apoſtles
did baptize Infants, it follows not that they did not: and if
they did not, it does not follow that they might not, or that the
Church may not. For it is unreaſonable to argue: The Scripture
ſpeaks nothing of the Baptiſm of the holy Virgin-Mother, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe was not baptized. The words and deeds of Chriſt are
infinite which are not recorded; and of the acts of the Apoſtles
we may ſuppoſe the ſame in their proportion: and therefore
what they did not, is no rule to us, unleſs they did it not becauſe
they were forbidden. So that it can be no good argument to
ſay, the Apoſtles are not read to have baptized Infants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Infants are not to be baptized: but thus; We do not finde
that Infants are excluded from the common Sacraments and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of Chriſtian Inſtitution, therefore we may not preſume
to exclude them. For although the Negative of a Fact is no
good Argument, yet the Negative of a Law is a very good one.
We may not ſay, the Apoſtles did not, therefore we may not: but
thus, they were not forbidden to do it, there is no Law againſt it,
therefore it may be done. No mans deeds can prejudicate a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law expreſſed in general terms, much leſs can it be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
by thoſe things that were not done.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That which is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot be numbred,</hi> cannot be effectual; therefore, <hi>Baptize
all nations,</hi> muſt ſignifie all that it can ſignifie, all that are
reckoned in the Capitations and accounts of a Nation. Now
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115910:20"/>
ſince all contradiction to this Queſtion depends wholly upon
theſe two grounds; The Negative Argument in matter of Fact,
and the Pretences, That Faith and Repentance are required to
Baptiſm: ſince the firſt is wholly nothing, and infirm upon an
infinite account, and the ſecond may conclude, that Infants can
no more be ſaved then be baptized; becauſe Faith is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Salvation then to Baptiſm; it being ſaid, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not ſhall be damned;</hi> and it is not ſaid, <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not ſhall be excluded from Baptiſm:</hi> it follows, that the
doctrine of thoſe that refuſe to baptize their Infants is upon
both its legs weak and broken, and inſufficient.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſuppoſition of theſe grounds,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> the Baptiſm of Infants,
according to the perpetual practiſe of the Church of God, will
ſtand firm and unſhaken upon its own baſe. For, as the <hi>Eunuch</hi>
ſaid to <hi>Philip, What hinders them to be baptized?</hi> If they can
receive benefit by it, it is infallibly certain, that it belongs to
them alſo to receive it, and to their Parents to procure it: for
nothing can deprive us of ſo great a grace, but an <hi>unworthineſs</hi>
or a <hi>diſability.</hi> They are not diſabled to receive it, if they need
it, and if it does them good; and they have neither done good
nor evil, and therefore they have not forfeited their right to it.
This therefore ſhall be the firſt great argument or combination
of inducements; <q>Infants receive many benefits by the ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Baptiſm, and therefore in charity and in duty we are to
bring them to Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. The firſt effect of Baptiſm is,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> That in it we are admitted
to the Kingdome of Chriſt, offered and preſented unto him. In
which certainly there is the ſame act of worſhip to God, and the
ſame bleſſing to the children of Chriſtians, as there was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the firſt-born among the Jews. For our children can be
Gods own portion, as well as theirs; and as they preſented
the firſt-born to God, and ſo acknowledged that God might
have taken his life in Sacrifice, as well as the Sacrifice of the
Lamb, or the Oblation of a beaſt: yet when the right was
confeſſed, God gave him back again, and took a Lamb in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or a pair of Doves. So are our children preſented to
God as forfeit, and God might take the forfeiture, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the babe to the Promiſes of Grace: but when the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115910:21"/>
of the childe, and our acknowledgement is made to God,
God takes the Lamb of the World in exchange, and he hath
paid our forfeiture, and the children are <hi>holy unto the Lord.</hi>
And what hinders here? cannot a creeple receive an alms at
the Beautiful gate of the Temple, unleſs he go thither himſelf?
Or cannot a gift be preſented to God by the hands of the owners,
and the gift become holy and pleaſing to God without its own
conſent? The Parents have a portion of the poſſeſſion: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are bleſſings, and Gods gifts, and the Fathers greateſt wealth,
and therefore are to be given again to him. In other things we
give ſomething to God of all that he gives us; all we do not,
becauſe our needs force us to retain the greater part, and the leſs
ſanctifies the whole: but our children muſt all be returned to
God; for we may love them, and ſo may God too, and they are
the better our own, by being made holy in their preſentation:
whatſoever is given to God is holy, every thing in its proportion
and capacity; a <hi>Lamb is holy,</hi> when it becomes a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and a
<hi>Table is holy,</hi> when it becomes an <hi>Altar;</hi> and a <hi>Houſe is holy,</hi> when
it becomes a <hi>Church;</hi> and a <hi>man is holy,</hi> when he is conſecrated
to be a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> and ſo is every one that is dedicated to Religion:
theſe are holy perſons, the others are holy things; and Infants
are between both: they have the ſanctification that belongs to
them, the holineſs that can be of a reaſonable nature, offer'd and
deſtin'd to Gods ſervice; but not in that degree that is in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
chooſing perſon. Certain it is, that Infants may
be given to God; and if they may be, they muſt be: for it is not
here as in goods, where we are permitted to uſe all or ſome, and
give what portion we pleaſe out of them; but we cannot do our
duty towards our children, unleſs we give them wholly to God,
and offer them to his ſervice and to his grace. The firſt does
honour to God, the ſecond does charity to the children. The
effects and real advantages will appear in the ſequel: in the
mean time this Argument extends thus far, that Children may be
preſented to God acceptably, in order to his ſervice. And it was
highly praeceptive, when our bleſſed Saviour commanded, that we
ſhould <hi>ſuffer little children to come to him:</hi> and when they came,
they carried away a bleſſing along with them. He was deſirous
they ſhould partake of his merits: he is not willing, neither is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115910:21"/>
it <hi>his Fathers will, that any of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.</hi> And
therefore he dyed for them, and loves, and bleſſed them: and
ſo he will now, if they be brought to him, and preſented as Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates
of the Religion and of the Reſurrection. Chriſt hath a
bleſſing for our children, but let them come to him, that is,
be preſented at the doors of the Church, to the Sacrament of
Adoption and Initiation; for I know no other way for them
to come.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> Children may be adopted into the Covenant of the Goſpel,
that is, <hi>made partakers of the Communion of Saints,</hi> which is
the ſecond effect of Baptiſm; parts of the Church, members of
Chriſts Myſtical body, and put into the order of eternal life.
Now concerning this, it is certain, the Church clearly hath power
to do her offices in order to it. The faithful can pray for all
men, they can do their piety to ſome perſons with more regard
and greater earneſtneſs: they can admit whom they pleaſe in
their proper diſpoſitions, to a participation of all their holy
prayers, and communions, and preachings, and exhortations:
and if all this be a bleſſing, and all this be the actions of our
own charity, who can hinder the Church of God from admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Infants to the communion of all their pious offices, which
can do them benefit in their preſent capacity? How this does
neceſſarily infer Baptiſm, I ſhall afterwards diſcourſe<note n="*" place="margin">§. 25, &amp;c.</note> But for
the preſent I enumerate, That the bleſſings of Baptiſm are
communicable to them; they may be admitted into a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of all the Prayers and Priviledges of the Church, and the
Communion of Saints, in bleſſings, and prayers, and holy
offices. But that which is of greateſt perſwaſion and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
efficacy in this particular, is, That the children of the Church
are as capable of <hi>the ſame Covenant,</hi> as the children of the
Jews: But it was <hi>the ſame Covenant</hi> that Circumciſion did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
a ſpiritual Covenant under a veil, and now it is the ſame
ſpiritual Covenant without the veil, which is evident to him that
conſiders it; thus:</p>
            <p>The words of the Covenant are theſe [<hi>I am the Almighty
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 14. Gen. 17. 2, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>walk before me, and be thou perfect; I will multiply thee
exceedingly. Thou ſhalt be a father of many Nations: Thy
name ſhall not be Abram, but Abraham. Nations and Kings
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115910:22"/>
ſhall be out of thee. I will be a God unto thee, and unto thy ſeed
after thee; and I will give all the Land of Canaan to thy ſeed,
and all the Males ſhall be circumciſed, and it ſhall be a token
of the Covenant between me and thee: and he that is not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
ſhall be cut off from his people.</hi> The Covenant which
was on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part was, <hi>To walk before God, and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
on Gods part, To bleſs him with a numerous iſſue, and
them with <hi>the Land of Canaan;</hi> and the ſign was <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
the token of the Covenant. Now in all this, here was no
duty to which the poſterity was obliged, nor any bleſſing which
<hi>Abraham</hi> could perceive or feel, becauſe neither he nor his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
did enjoy the Promiſe for many hundred years after the
Covenant: and therefore as there was a duty for the poſterity
which is not here expreſſed; ſo there was a bleſſing for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
which was concealed under the leaves of a temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and which we ſhall better underſtand from them whom
the Spirit of God hath taught the myſteriouſneſs of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.
The Argument indeed, and the obſervation is wholly
S.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Pauls, Abraham and the Patriarchs died in faith, not having
received the Promiſes,</hi> viz. of a poſſeſſion in <hi>Canaan. They ſaw
the Promiſes afar off,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14.</note> they embraced them, and looked through
the Cloud, and the temporal veil, this was not it; <hi>they might
have returned to Canaan,</hi> if that had been the object of their
deſires, and the deſign of the Promiſe: but they deſired and <hi>did
ſeek a Countrey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">15.</note> but it was a better, <hi>and that a heavenly.</hi> This
was the object of their deſire, and the end of their ſearch, and
the reward of their faith, and the ſecret of their Promiſe. And
therefore <hi>Circumciſion was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note>
               <hi>which he had before his Circumciſion,</hi> before the making this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and therefore it muſt principally relate to an effect and
a bleſſing, greater then was afterwards expreſſed in the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Promiſe:<note place="margin">7.</note> which effect was <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins, a not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to us our infirmities, Juſtification by faith, accounting</hi> that
for <hi>righteouſneſs:</hi> and theſe effects or graces were promiſed to
<hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12.</note> not onely for his poſterity <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> but his
children <hi>after the ſpirit,</hi> even to all that ſhall believe and <hi>walk
in the ſteps of our father Abraham, which he walked in, being
yet uncircumciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115910:22"/>
This was no other but the Covenant of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> though
afterwards otherwiſe conſigned: for ſo the Apoſtle expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the father of Circumciſion (<hi>viz.</hi> by
vertue of this Covenant) <hi>not onely to them that are circumciſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 11, 12.</note>
               <hi>but to all that believe: for this promiſe was not through the
law of works, or of circumciſion, but of faith.</hi> And therefore
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">V. 17.</note> 
               <hi>God promiſed that Abraham ſhould be a
father (not of that Nation onely, but) of many Nations, and the
heir of the world;</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on
the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that we might receive the
promiſe of the Spirit through faith.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 14, 29.</note> And, <hi>if ye be Chriſts, then
ye are Abrahams ſeed, and heirs according to the Promiſe.</hi> Since
then the Covenant of the Goſpel, is <hi>the Covenant of Faith,</hi> and
<hi>not of Works;</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> not <hi>ſaecular;</hi> and
<hi>Abraham the father of the faithful Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
Jews;</hi> and <hi>the heir of the world,</hi> not by himſelf, but
by his ſeed, or the Son of Man, our Lord Jeſus: it follows, that
the Promiſes which Circumciſion did ſeal, were the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
which are conſigned in Baptiſm; the Covenant is the
ſame, onely that Gods people are not impal'd in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and
the veil is taken away,<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epiphan. l. 1. haereſ. 8. ſcil. Epicuraeor.</note> and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is paſſed into ſpiritual, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
will be this, <hi>That to as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and in as many capacities, and in
the ſame diſpoſitions as the Promiſes
were applied, and did relate in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
to the ſame they do belong, and
may be applied in Baptiſm.</hi> And let it be remembred, That
the Covenant which Circumciſion did ſign, <hi>was a Covenant of
Grace and Faith;</hi> the Promiſes were <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> or ſpiritual,
it was <hi>made before the Law,</hi> and could not be reſcinded by the
Legal Covenant. <hi>Nothing could be added to it, or taken from
it;</hi> and <hi>we that are partakers of this grace,</hi> are therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of it by being Chriſts ſervants, united to Chriſt, and <hi>ſo
are become Abrahams ſeed</hi> (as the Apoſtle at large and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
proves in divers places, but eſpecially in the 4. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and the 3. to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>) And therefore if Infants
were then admitted to it, and conſigned to it by a Sacrament
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115910:23"/>
which they underſtood not any more then ours do, there is not
any reaſon why ours ſhould not enter in at the ordinary gate
and door of Grace as well as they. Their children were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
the Eighth day, but were inſtructed afterwards, when
they could enquire what theſe things meant. Indeed their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes</hi>
were <hi>firſt</hi> taught, <hi>then</hi> circumciſed; ſo are ours, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:
but <hi>their Infants</hi> were conſigned <hi>firſt,</hi> and ſo muſt
ours.</p>
            <p>3. In Baptiſm we are <hi>born again;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> and this Infants need in
the preſent circumſtances, and for the ſame great reaſon, that
men of age and reaſon do. For our natural birth is either of it
ſelf inſufficient, or is made ſo by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
evils, that nature alone, or our firſt birth, cannot bring
us to heaven, which is a ſupernatural end, that is, an end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the power of our nature as now it is. So that if <hi>nature</hi>
cannot bring us to heaven, <hi>grace</hi> muſt, or we can never get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if the <hi>firſt birth</hi> cannot, <hi>a ſecond</hi> muſt: but <hi>the ſecond
birth</hi> ſpoken of in Scripture, is <hi>Baptiſm; A man muſt be born
of water and the ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> And therefore Baptiſm is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the laver of a new birth. Either then <hi>Infants</hi> cannot go to
heaven any way that we know of, or they muſt be baptized.
To ſay they are to be left to God, is an excuſe, and no anſwer:
for when God hath opened the door, and calls that the entrance
into heaven, we do not leave them to God, when we will not
carry them to him in the way which he hath deſcribed, and at
the door which himſelf hath opened: <hi>we leave them</hi> indeed, but
it is but <hi>helpleſs</hi> and <hi>deſtitute:</hi> and though God is better then
Man, yet that is no warrant to us, what it will be to the children,
that we cannot warrant, or conjecture. And if it be objected,
That to the new birth is required diſpoſitions of our own, which
are to be wrought by and in them that have the uſe of reaſon:
beſides that this is wholly againſt the Analogy of <hi>a new birth,</hi>
in which the perſon to be born is wholly a paſſive, and hath put
into him the principle that in time will produce its proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
It is certain, that they that <hi>can receive</hi> the new birth, are
capable of it; the effect of it is a poſſibility of being ſaved,
and arriving to a ſupernatural felicity. If Infants can receive
this effect, then alſo the new birth, without which they cannot
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115910:23"/>
cannot receive the effect. And if they can receive ſalvation, the
effect of the new birth, what hinders them, but they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that that is in order to that effect, and ordained onely for
it; and which is nothing of it ſelf, but in its inſtitution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and which may be received by the ſame capacity in
which one may be created, that is, a paſſivity, or a capacity
obediential.</p>
            <p>4.<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> Concerning pardon of ſins, which is one great effect of
Baptiſm, it is certain, that Infants have not that benefit which
men of ſin and age may receive. He that hath a ſickly ſtomach
drinks wine, and it not onely refreſhes his ſpirits, but cures his
ſtomach. He that drinks wine and hath not that diſeaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
good by his wine, though it does not miniſter to ſo many
needs; it refreſhes him, though it does not cure him: and when
oyle is poured upon a mans head, it does not alwayes heal a
wound, but ſometimes makes him a chearful countenance, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it conſigns him to be a King or a Prieſt. So it is in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm:
it does not heal the wounds of actual ſins, becauſe they
have not committed them; but it takes off the evil of Original
ſin:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 17, 18.</note> whatſoever is imputed to us by <hi>Adams</hi> prevarication, is
waſhed off by the death of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> into which we
are baptized. But concerning Original ſin, becauſe there are ſo
many diſputes which may intricate the Queſtion, I ſhall make
uſe onely of that which is confeſſed on both ſides, and material
to our purpoſe. Death came upon all men by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and
the neceſſity of it remains upon us, as an evil conſequent of the
diſobedience. For though death is natural, yet it was kept off
from man by Gods favour, which when he loſt, the banks were
broken, and the water reverted to its natural courſe, and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
became a curſe,<note place="margin">Vide Auguſt. l. 4. contra duas Epiſtolas Pelag. c. 4. l. 6. contr. Iur. c. 4.</note> and death a puniſhment. Now that this
alſo relates to Infants ſo far, is certain, becauſe they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſick,
and dye. This the <hi>Pelagians</hi> denied not. But to whomſoever this
evil deſcended, upon them alſo a remedy is provided by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam, That as in Adam all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall
all be made alive;</hi> that is, at the day of Judgement: then <hi>death
ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> In the mean time, death hath a ſting and a
bitterneſs, a curſe it is, and an expreſs of the Divine Anger: and
if this ſting be not taken away here, we ſhall have no participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115910:24"/>
of the final <hi>victory over death.</hi> Either therefore Infants
muſt be for ever without remedy in this evil conſequent of their
Fathers ſin, or they muſt be adopted into the participation of
Chriſts death, which is the remedy. Now how can they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of Chriſts death, but by Baptiſm into his death? For if
there be any ſpiritual way fancied, it will by a ſtronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
admit them to Baptiſm: for if they can receive ſpiritual
effects, they can alſo receive the outward Sacrament; this being
denyed onely upon pretence they cannot have the other. If there
be no ſpiritual way <hi>extraordinary,</hi> then the <hi>ordinary</hi> way is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left for them. If there be an <hi>extraordinary,</hi> let it be ſhewn,
and Chriſtians will be at reſt concerning their children. One
thing onely I deſire to be obſerved, That <hi>Pelagius</hi> denyed Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin, but yet denyed not the neceſſity of Infants Baptiſm;
and being accuſed of it in an Epiſtle to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt,
he purged himſelf of the ſuſpicion, and allowed the practiſe, but
denyed the inducement of it: which ſhews, that their arts are
weak that think Baptiſm to be uſeleſs to Infants, if they be not
formally guilty of the prevarication of <hi>Adam:</hi> By which I alſo
gather, that it was ſo univerſal, ſo primitive a practiſe, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
Infants, that it was greater then all pretences to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
for it would much have conduced to the introducing his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
againſt Grace and Original ſin, if he had deſtroyed that
practiſe which ſeemed ſo very much to have its greateſt neceſſity
from the doctrine he denyed. But againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and againſt
all that follow the parts of his opinion, it is of good uſe which
S. <hi>Auſtine, Proſper,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> argue; If Infants are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, then they are alſo guilty of it in ſome

feels the evil conſequent, to him the ſin is imputed; not as to
all the ſame diſhonour, or <hi>moral accounts,</hi> but to the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
<hi>to the natural account:</hi> and in holy Scripture the taking
off the puniſhment, is the pardon of the ſin; and in the ſame
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115910:24"/>
degree the puniſhment is aboliſhed, in the ſame God is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and then the perſon ſtands upright, being reconciled to God
by his grace. Since therefore Infants have the puniſhment of
ſin, it is certain the ſin is imputed to them; and therefore they
need being reconciled to God by Chriſt: and if ſo, then, when
they are baptized into Chriſts death, and into his Reſurrection,
their ſins are pardoned, becauſe the puniſhment is taken off, <hi>the
ſting of</hi> natural <hi>death</hi> is taken away, becauſe Gods anger is
removed, and they ſhall partake of Chriſts Reſurrection: which
becauſe Baptiſm does ſignifie and conſign, they alſo are to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.
To which alſo adde this appendant Conſideration,
That whatſoever the Sacraments do <hi>conſign,</hi> that alſo they do
<hi>convey and miniſter:</hi> they do it, that is, God by them does it;
leſt we ſhould think the Sacraments to be meer illuſions, and
abuſing us by deceitful ineffective ſigns: and therefore to Infants
the grace of a title to a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God
by the death of Chriſt is conveyed, becauſe it ſignifies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
this to them more to the life and analogy of reſemblance,
then Circumciſion to the Infant ſons of Iſrael. I end this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
with the words of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>

<hi>Our birth by Baptiſm does cut off every unclean appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of our natural birth, and leads us to a celeſtial life:</hi> and
this in children is therefore more neceſſary, becauſe the evil
came upon them without their own act of reaſon and choice,
and therefore the grace and remedy ought not to ſtay the
leiſure of dull Nature, and the Formalities of the Civill
Law.</p>
            <p>5. The Baptiſm of Infants does to them the greateſt part of
that benefit which belongs to the remiſſion of ſins.<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> For Baptiſm
is a ſtate of Repentance and pardon for ever. This I ſuppoſe to
be already proved, to which I onely adde this Caution, That
the <hi>Pelagians</hi> to undervalue the neceſſity of ſupervening grace,
affirmed, That Baptiſm did miniſter to us grace ſufficient to live
perfectly, and without ſin for ever. Againſt this S. <hi>Jerome</hi>
ſharply declaims, and affirms,<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 3. adv. Pelag. 6. lib. 1. in initio.</note> 
               <hi>Baptiſmum praeterita donare

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115910:25"/>
in another place. <hi>Vetera peccata conſcindit, novas virtutes
non tribuit; dimittit à carcere, &amp; dimiſſo, ſi laboraverit, praemia
pollicetur.</hi> Baptiſm does not ſo forgive future ſins, that we may
do what we pleaſe, or ſo as we need not labour and watch, and
fear perpetually, and make uſe of Gods grace to actuate our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours,
but puts us into a ſtate of pardon, that is, in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, in which ſo long as we labour and repent, and
ſtrive to do our duty, ſo long our infirmities are pityed, and our
ſins certain to be pardoned upon their certain conditions; that is,
by virtue of it we are capable of pardon, and muſt work for it,
and may hope it. And therefore Infants have a moſt certain
capacity and proper diſpoſition to Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſin creeps before
it can go, and little undecencies are ſoon learned, and malice is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their years, and they can do miſchief and irregularities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
and though we know not when, nor how far they are
imputed in every moneth of their lives, yet it is an admirable art
of the Spirit of grace, to put them into a ſtate of pardon, that
their remedy may at leaſt be as ſoon as their neceſſity. And
therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> adviſed the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
of children to be at three or four years of age; meaning,
that they then begining to have little inadvertencies &amp; haſty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and actions ſo evil as did need a lavatory. But if Baptiſm hath
an influence upon ſins in the ſucceeding portions of our life, then
it is certain, that their being preſently innocent, does not hinder,
and ought not to retard the Sacrament; and therefore <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s
<hi>Quid feſtinat innocens aetas ad remiſſionem peccatorum?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. de Baptiſ. c. 18.</note>
               <hi>what need Innocents haſten to the remiſſion of ſins?</hi> is ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
It is true, they need not in reſpect of any actual ſins,
for ſo they are innocent: but in reſpect of the evils of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
derived from their original, and in reſpect of future ſins in
the whole ſtate of their life, it is neceſſary they be put into a ſtate
of pardon before they ſin, becauſe ſome ſin early, ſome ſin later;
and therefore unleſs they be baptized ſo early, as to prevent the
firſt ſins, they may chance dye in a ſin, to the pardon of which
they have yet derived no title from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>6. The next great effect of Baptiſm,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> which children can have,
is <hi>the Spirit of Sanctification,</hi> and if they can be <hi>baptized with
Water and the Spirit,</hi> it will be ſacriledge to rob them of ſo holy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115910:25"/>
treaſures. And concerning this, although it be with them, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of Heirs, <hi>The heir ſo long as he is a childe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing from a ſervant, though he be lord of all;</hi> and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
although they receive the Spirit of Promiſe, and the Spirit
of Grace, yet <hi>in reſpect of actual exerciſe,</hi> they differ not from
them that have them not at all, yet this hindres not but they
may have them. For as the reaſonable ſoul and all its faculties
are in children, <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Paſſions,</hi> and <hi>Powers of
Attraction and Propulſion,</hi> yet theſe faculties do not operate or
come abroad till time and art, obſervation and experience have
drawn them forth into action: ſo may the Spirit of Grace, the
principle of Chriſtian life, be infuſed, and yet lye without action
till in its own day it is drawn forth. For in every Chriſtian there
are three parts concurring to his integral conſtitution, <hi>Body,</hi> and
<hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and all theſe have their proper activities and
times, but <hi>every one in his own order, firſt that which is natural,
then that which is ſpiritual.</hi> And as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, <hi>A man firſt
lives the life of a plant, then of a beaſt, and laſtly of a man,</hi> is
true in this ſenſe: and the more ſpiritual the principle is, the
longer it is before it operates, becauſe more things concur to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
actions, then to natural: and theſe are neceſſary, and
therefore firſt; the other are perfect, and therefore laſt. And
who is he that ſo well underſtands the Philoſophy of this third
principle of a Chriſtians life, <hi>the Spirit,</hi> as to know how or when
it is infuſed, and how it operates in all its periods, and what it
is in its beeing and proper nature; and whether it be like the
ſoul, or like the faculty, or like a habit, or how or to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
God in all varieties does diſpenſe it? Theſe are ſecrets
which none but bold people uſe to decree, and build propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon their own dreams. That which is certain, is, that
* The Spirit is the principle of a new life, or a new birth. * That
Baptiſm is the laver of this new birth. * That it is the ſeed of
God, and may lye long in the furrows before it ſprings up.
* That from the faculty to the act, the paſſage is not alwayes
ſudden and quick. * That the Spirit is the earneſt of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that is, of Reſurrection to eternal life: which inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
children we hope ſhal have, they cannot be denied to have
its <hi>Seal and Earneſt,</hi> that is, if they ſhall have all, they are not to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115910:26"/>
be denyed a part. * That children have ſome effects of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and therefore do receive it, and are <hi>baptized with the Spirit,</hi>
and therefore may <hi>with Water:</hi> which thing is therefore true
and evident, becauſe ſome children are ſanctified, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> and
the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and therefore all may. And becauſe all ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of perſons is an effect of the holy Ghoſt, there is no perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
but they that can be ſanctified by God can in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
receive the holy Ghoſt: and all the ground of diſſenting
here, is onely upon a miſtake, becauſe Infants do no act of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
they ſuppoſe them incapable of the grace of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now <hi>Sanctification</hi> of children, is their <hi>adoption</hi> to the
inheritance of ſons, their preſentation to Chriſt, their conſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Chriſts ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to Reſurrection, their being put into
a poſſibility of being ſaved, their reſtitution to Gods favour,
which naturally, that is, as our nature is depraved and puniſhed,
they could not have. And in ſhort the caſe is this: * Original
Righteouſneſs was in <hi>Adam</hi> after the manner of nature, but it
was an act or effect of grace,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

it men were <hi>not made, but born righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi>
the inferior faculties obeyed
the ſuperior, the minde was whole
and right, and conformable to the
Divine Image, the Reaſon and the Will alwayes concurring, the
Will followed Reaſon, and Reaſon followed the Laws of God,
and ſo long as a man had not loſt this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was pleaſing to God,
and ſhould have paſſed to a more perfect ſtate. Now becauſe
this, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, ſhould have been born with every
childe, there was in Infants a <hi>principle</hi> which was <hi>the ſeed of
holy life</hi> here, and <hi>a bleſſed</hi> hereafter; and yet the children
ſhould have gone in the road of nature, then as well as now,
and the Spirit ſhould have operated at natures leiſure; God
being the giver of both, would have made them inſtrumental to,
and perfective of each other, but not deſtructive. Now what
was loſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> is reſtored by Chriſt, the ſame Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
onely it is <hi>not born,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

not integral, but interrupted, but ſuch as it

or the like principle may be derived to us from Chriſt, as there
ſhould have been from <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, <hi>a principle of obedience,</hi>
a regularity of faculties, a beauty in the ſoul, and a ſtate of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
with God. And we ſee alſo in men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The ſoul is poſſeſſed with
ſparks, or materials of the power of the Spirit) and yet it
is ſometimes ineffective and unactive, ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leſs, and does no more do its work at all times, then the
ſoul does at all times underſtand. Adde to this, That if there
be in Infants naturally an evil principle, a proclivity to ſin, an
ignorance and pravity of minde, a diſorder of affections (as
experience teaches us there is, and the perpetual doctrine
of the Church, and the univerſal miſchiefs iſſuing from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and the ſin of every man does witneſs too much)
why cannot Infants have a good principle in them, though
it works not till its own ſeaſon, as well as an evil principle?
If there were not by nature ſome evil principle, it is not
poſſible that all the world ſhould chooſe ſin: In free agents
it was never heard, that all individuals loved and choſe the
ſame thing, to which they were not naturally inclined. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do all men chooſe to marry, neither do all chooſe to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain:
and in this inſtance there is a natural inclination to one
part; but of all the men and women in the world, there is no
one that hath never ſinned.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we
deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſaid an Apoſtle.
If therefore nature hath in Infants <hi>an evil principle,</hi> which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
when the childe can chooſe, but is all the while within the
ſoul; either Infants have by grace a principle put into them, or
elſe ſin abounds where grace does not ſuperabound, expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the doctrine of the Apoſtle. The event of this diſcourſe
is, that if Infants be capable of the Spirit of grace, there is no
reaſon but they may and ought to be baptized, as well as men
and women; unleſs God had expreſly forbidden them, which
cannot be pretended: and that Infants are capable of the Spirit of
grace,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Fiden. lib. 3. ep. 8.</note> I think is made very credible. <hi>Chriſtus infantibus infans
factus ſanctificans infantes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Irenaeus: Chriſt became an Infant
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115910:27"/>
among the Infants, and does ſanctifie Infants:</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
affirms, <hi>Eſſe apud omnes ſive infantes ſive majores natu unam
divini muneris aequitatem.</hi> There is the ſame diſpenſation of the
divine grace to all alike, to Infants as well as to men. And in
this <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> as it is in the ſecular, Kings may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed
in their Cradles,<note place="margin">S. Aug. lib. de pec. Mer. &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſ. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Dat (Deus) ſui Spiritus occultiſſimam
gratiam, quam etiam latentèr infundit in parvulis,</hi> God gives
the moſt ſecret grace of his Spirit, which he alſo ſecretly infuſes
into Infants. And if a ſecret infuſion be rejected, becauſe it
cannot be proved at the place and at the inſtant, many men that
hope for heaven will be very much to ſeek for a proof of their
earneſt, and need an earneſt of the earneſt. For all that have the
Spirit of God cannot in all inſtants prove it, or certainly know
it: neither is it yet defined by how many <hi>indices</hi> the Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
can be proved or ſignified. And they limit the Spirit too
much, and underſtand it too little, who take accounts of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
workings, and meaſure them by the material lines and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of natural and animal effects. And yet becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is holy, is made ſo by the holy Spirit, we are certain that
the children of <hi>believing,</hi> that is, of <hi>Chriſtian parents,</hi> are holy.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmed it, and by it hath diſtinguiſhed <hi>ours</hi> from the
children of unbelievers, and <hi>our</hi> marriages <hi>from theirs:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the children of the Heathen when they come to choice and
reaſon, may enter to Baptiſm and the Covenant if they will,
our children have no privilege beyond the children of Turks or
Heathens, unleſs it be in the preſent capacity, that is, either by
receiving the holy Ghoſt immediately, and the Promiſes, or at
leaſt having a title to the Sacrament, and entring by that door.
If they have the Spirit, nothing can hinder them from a title to
the water; and if they have onely a title to the water of the
Sacrament, then they ſhall receive the Promiſe of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the benefits of the Sacrament: elſe their privilege is none at
all, but a diſh of cold water, which every village nurſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for her new born babe.</p>
            <p>But it is in our caſe as it was with the Jews children:<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are <hi>a holy ſeed;</hi> for if it were not ſo with Chriſtianity, how
could S. <hi>Peter</hi> move the Jews to Chriſtianity, by telling them
<hi>the Promiſe was to them and their children?</hi> For if our children
<pb facs="tcp:115910:27"/>
be not capable of the Spirit of Promiſe and Holineſs, and yet
their children were holy, it had been a better Argument to have
kept them in the Synagogue, then to have called them to the
Chriſtian Church. Either therefore 1. there is ſome holineſs in
a reaſonable nature, which is not from the Spirit of holineſs; or
elſe 2. our children do receive the holy Spirit, becauſe they are
holy; or if they be not holy, they are in worſe condition under
Chriſt then under <hi>Moſes:</hi> or if none of all this be true, then our
children are holy by having received the holy Spirit of Promiſe,
and conſequently nothing can hinder them from being baptized.</p>
            <p>And indeed if the Chriſtian Jews,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> whoſe children are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and made partakers of the ſame Promiſes and Title, and
Inheritance and Sacraments, which themſelves had at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to the faith of Chriſt, had ſeen their children now ſhut
out from theſe new Sacraments, it is not to be doubted but they
would have raiſed a ſtorm, greater then could eaſily have been
ſuppreſſed: ſince about their Circumciſions they had raiſed ſuch
Tragedies and implacable diſputations: and there had been
great reaſon to look for a ſtorm; for their children were <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,</hi>
and if not <hi>baptized,</hi> then they were left under a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
which their fathers were quit of, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto you,
<hi>Whoſoever is circumciſed, is a debtor to keep the whole Law.</hi>
Theſe children therefore that were circumciſed, ſtood obliged
for want of Baptiſm to perform the Laws of Ceremonies, to be
preſented into the Temple, to pay their price, to be redeemed
with ſilver and gold; to be bound by the Law of pollutions and
carnal ordinances: and therefore if they had been thus left, it
would be no wonder if the Jews had complained and made a
tumult: they uſed to do it for leſs matters.</p>
            <p>To which let this be added,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> That the firſt book of the New
Teſtament was not written till eight years after Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and S. <hi>Marks</hi> Goſpel twelve years. In the mean time, to
what Scriptures did they appeal? by the analogy or proportion
of what writings did they end their Queſtions? whence did
they prove their Articles? They onely appealed to the Old
Teſtament, and onely added what their Lord ſuperadded. Now
either it muſt be ſaid that our bleſſed Lord commanded that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
ſhould not be baptized, which is no where pretended;
<pb facs="tcp:115910:28"/>
and if it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot at all be proved: or if by the proportion
of Scriptures they did ſerve God, and preach the Religion, it
is plain, that by the Analogy of the Old Teſtament, that is, of
thoſe Scriptures by which they proved Chriſt to be come, and
to have ſuffered, they alſo approved the Baptiſm of Infants,
or the admitting them to the ſociety of the faithful Jews, of
which alſo the Church did then principally conſiſt.</p>
            <p>7. That Baptiſm (which conſigns men and women to a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Reſurrection) doth alſo equally conſign Infants to it,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that I know of, pretended againſt it, there being the ſame
ſignature and the ſame grace, and in this thing all being alike
paſſive, and we no way cooperating to the conſignation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of grace: and Infants have an equall neceſſity, as being
lyable to ſickneſs and groaning with as ſad accents, and dying
ſooner then men and women, and leſs able to complain, and
more apt to be pityed and broken with the unhappy conſequents
of a ſhort life, and a ſpeedy death, <hi>&amp; infelicitate priſcorum
hominum,</hi> with the infelicity and folly of their firſt Parents:
and therefore have as great need as any, and that is capacity
enough to receive a remedy for the evil which was brought
upon them by the fault of another.</p>
            <p>8. And after all this,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> if Baptiſm be that means which God hath
appointed to ſave us, it were well if we would do our parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Infants final intereſt; which whether it depends upon the
Sacrament and its proper grace, we have nothing to relye upon,
but thoſe Texts of Scripture which make Baptiſm the ordinary
way of entring into the ſtate of ſalvation: ſave onely we are to
adde this, that becauſe of this law Infants are not perſonally
capable, but the Church for them, as for all others indefinitely,
we have reaſon to believe, that their friends neglect ſhall by ſome
way be ſupplyed; but Hope hath in it nothing beyond a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.
This we may be certain of, that naturally we cannot
be heirs of Salvation, for <hi>by nature we are children of wrath,</hi>
and therefore an eternal ſeparation from God, is an infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
to our evil nature: either therefore children muſt be
put into the ſtate of grace, or they ſhall dwell for ever where
Gods face does never ſhine. Now there are but two wayes of
being put into the ſtate of grace and ſalvation; <hi>the inward,</hi> by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115910:28"/>
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the outward,</hi> by <hi>Water,</hi> which regularly are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
If they be renewed by the Spirit, what hinders them
to be baptized, who receive the holy Ghoſt as well as we? If
they are not capable of the Spirit, they are capable of Water;
and if of neither, where is their title to heaven, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
internal nor external, neither ſpiritual nor ſacramental, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſecret nor manifeſt, neither natural nor gracious, neither ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
nor derivative? And well may we lament the death of
poor babes that are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, concerning whom if we neglect

be comforted over our dead children, but may weep as they that
have no hope. We may hope when our neglect was not the
hinderance, becauſe God hath wholly taken the matter into his
own hand, and then it cannot miſcarry; and though we know
nothing of the children, yet we know much of Gods goodneſs:
But when God hath permitted it to us, that is, offered and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
children to our miniſtery, whatever happens to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
we may well fear leſt God will require the ſouls at our

This ſoul might have gone to God, if it had been purified

know it is not at all good to tempt his goodneſs: and he tempts
him, that leaves the uſual way, and pretends it is not made for
him, and yet hopes to be at his journeys end, or expects to
meet his childe in heaven, when himſelf ſhuts the door againſt
him, which for ought he knows is the onely one that ſtands
open. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſevere in this Queſtion againſt unbaptized
Infants, therefore he is called <hi>durus Pater Infantium:</hi> though I
know not why the original of that opinion ſhould be attributed
to him, ſince S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid the ſame before him, as appears in
his words above quoted in the margent.</p>
            <p>And now that I have enumerated the bleſſings which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
to Baptiſm,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> and have alſo made apparent, That Infants
can receive theſe bleſſings, I ſuppoſe I need not uſe any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
to bring children to Baptiſm. If it be certain they may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115910:29"/>
receive theſe good things by it, it is certain they are not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of them without the greateſt impiety, and ſacriledge, and
uncharitableneſs in the world. Nay, if it be onely probable
that they receive theſe bleſſings, or if it be but poſſible they
may, nay unleſs it be impoſſible they ſhould, and ſo declared by
revelation or demonſtratively certain, it were intolerable unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and injuſtice to our pretty innocents, to let their crying be
unpityed, and their natural miſery eternally irremediable, and
their ſorrows without remedy, and their ſouls no more capable
of relief, then their bodies of Phyſick, and their death left with
the ſting in, and their <hi>Souls</hi> without <hi>Spirits</hi> to go to God, and
no Angel guardian to be aſſigned them in the Aſſemblies of the
faithful, and they not to be reckoned in the accounts of God and
Gods Church. All theſe are ſad ſtories.</p>
            <p>There are in Scripture very many other probabilities,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the Baptiſm of Infants, but becauſe the places admit of
divers interpretations, the Arguments have ſo many diminutions,
and the certainty that is in them is too fine for eaſie underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
I have choſen to build the ancient doctrines upon ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which are more eaſie and certain, and have not been yet
ſullied and rifled with the contentions of an adverſary. This
onely I ſhall obſerve, That the words of our bleſſed Lord
[<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a man be born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter
into the Kingdome of heaven</hi>] cannot be expounded to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of children, but the ſame expoſitions will alſo make Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
not neceſſary for men: for if they be both neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
<hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> then let us provide water, and
God will provide the Spirit; if we bring wood to the Sacrifice,
he will provide a Lamb. And if they ſignifie diſtinctly, one
is ordinarily as neceſſary as the other, and then Infants muſt be
baptized, or not be ſaved. But if one be exegetical and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
of the other, and by <hi>Water and the Spirit</hi> is meant onely
the purification of the Spirit, then where is the neceſſity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
for men? It will be as the other Sacrament, at moſt but
highly convenient, not ſimply neceſſary, and all the other places
will eaſily be anſwered, if this be avoided. But however, theſe
words being ſpoken in ſo decretory a manner, are to be uſed
with fear and reverence; and we muſt be infallibly ſure by ſome
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115910:29"/>
certain infallible arguments, that Infants ought not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
or we ought to fear concerning the effect of theſe decretory
words. I ſhall onely adde two things by way of Corollary to
this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>That the Church of God ever ſince her numbers are full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for very many ages conſiſted almoſt wholly of Aſſemblies of
them who have been baptized in their Infancy: and although in
the firſt callings of the Gentiles, the chiefeſt and moſt frequent
Baptiſms were of converted and repenting perſons and believers,
yet from the beginning alſo the Church hath baptized the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of Chriſtian Parents;<note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 22.</note> according to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,
Behold, I will lift up my hands to the Gentiles, and ſet up a
ſtandard to the people, and they ſhall bring thy ſons in their
arms, and thy daughters ſhall be carried upon their ſhoulders.</hi>
Concerning which, I ſhall not onely bring the teſtimonies of
the matter of fact, but either a report of an Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſome Argument from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which will make their
teſtimony more effectuall in all that ſhall relate to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>The Author of the book of Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to S. <hi>Denis</hi> the Areopagite, takes notice, that certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
perſons and enemies to the Chriſtian Religion, think it a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
thing that Infants, who as yet cannot underſtand the
Divine Myſteries, ſhould be partakers of the Sacraments; and
that profeſſions and abrenunciations ſhould be made by others
for them and in their names. He anſwers, that <hi>Holy men, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of Churches, have ſo taught, having received a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from their Fathers and Elders in Chriſt:</hi> by which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of his, as it appears, that he himſelf was later then the
Areopagite; ſo it is ſo early by him affirmed, that even then
there was an ancient Tradition for the Baptiſm of Infants, and
the uſe of <hi>Godfathers</hi> in the miniſtery of the Sacrament. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, it having been ſo ancient a Conſtitution of the
Church, it were well if men would rather humbly and modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerve, then like ſcorners deride it, in which they ſhew their
own folly as well as immodeſty. For what undecency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity
is it, that our parents natural or ſpiritual ſhould ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
for us, when it is agreeable to the practiſe of all the laws
and tranſactions of the world, an effect of the Communion of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115910:30"/>
Saints and of Chriſtian Oeconomy? For why may not Infants
be ſtipulated for as well as we? all were included in the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
made with <hi>Adam;</hi> he made a loſing bargain for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and we ſmarted for his folly: and if the faults of Parents,
and Kings, and relatives, do bring evil upon their children, and
ſubjects, and correlatives, it is but equal that our children may
have benefit alſo by our charity and piety. But concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an agreement for them, we finde that God was confident
concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would teach his children: and
there is no doubt but Parents have great power, by ſtrict edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and prudent diſcipline, to efform the mindes of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to vertue. <hi>Joſhua</hi> did expreſly undertake for his houſhold,
<hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord:</hi> and for children we may
better do it, becauſe till they are of perfect choice, no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world is ſo great, as that of Parents over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in that which can concern the parts of this Queſtion: for
they rule over their underſtandings, and children know nothing
but what they are told, and they believe it infinitely: and it is a
rare art of the Spirit, to engage Parents to bring them up well
<hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;</hi> they are perſons
obliged by a ſuperinduced band, they are to give them inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and holy principles, as they give them meat; and it is
certain that Parents may better ſtipulate for their children, then
the Church can for men and women; for they may be preſent
Impoſtors and Hypocrites, as the Church ſtory tells of ſome, and
conſequently are <gap reason="foreign">

baptized: and the next day they may change their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and grow weary of their Vow: and that is the moſt
that children can do when they come to age: and it is very much
in the Parents, whether the children ſhall do any ſuch thing,
or no;

For Education can introduce a habit and a ſecond nature, againſt
which children cannot kick, unleſs they do ſome violence to
themſelves and their inclinations. And although it fails too often
when ever it fails, yet we pronounce prudently concerning future
things, when we have a leſs influence into the event, then in the
preſent caſe, (and therefore are more unapt perſons to ſtipulate)
and leſs reaſon in the thing it ſelf (and therefore have not ſo much
reaſon to be confident.) Is not the greateſt prudence of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
inſtanced in their foreſeeing future events, and gueſſing at
the deſigns of their enemies, concerning which they have leſs
reaſon to be confident, then Parents of their childrens belief of
the Chriſtian Creed? To which I adde this conſideration, That
Parents or Godfathers may therefore ſafely and prudently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that their children ſhall be of the Chriſtian faith, becauſe
we not onely ſee millions of men and women who not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the whole Creed onely upon the ſtock of their education;
but there are none that ever do renounce the faith of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

(that S. Cyprian may ſuperadde his Symbol) <hi>God who is no

greateſt delinquents ſinning long before againſt God, remiſſion
of ſins be given when afterwards they beleive, and from Baptiſme
and from Grace no man is forbidden, how much more ought not
an Infant be forbidden, who being new born, hath ſinned nothing,
ſave onely that being in the fleſh, born of Adam in his firſt birth,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115910:31"/>
he hath contracted the contagion of an old death. Who therefore
comes the eaſier to obtain remiſſion of ſins, becauſe to him are
forgiven not his own, but the ſins of another man. None ought to
be driven from Baptiſm and the Grace of God, who is mercifull,
and gentle, and pious unto all; and therefore much leſſe Infants,
who more deſerve our aid, and more need the divine mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in the firſt beginning of their birth crying and weeping,
they can do nothing but call for mercy and reliefe. For this reaſon
it was</hi> (ſaith <hi>Origen) that they to whom the ſecrets of the Divine
myſteries were committed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Origen. lib. 5. ad Rom. C. 6.</note> 
               <hi>did baptize their Infants, becauſe
there was born with them the Impurities of ſin,</hi> which did need
material abſolution as a Sacrament of ſpiritual purification; for
that it may appear that our ſins have a proper analogy to this
Sacrament, <hi>the body it ſelf is called the body of ſin:</hi> and therefore
the waſhing of the body is not ineffectual towards the great
work of pardon and abolition. Indeed after this abſolution there
remains concupiſcence, or the material part of our miſery and
ſin: For Chriſt by his death onely took away that which when
he did dye for us, he bore in his own body upon the tree. Now
Chriſt onely bore the puniſhment of our ſin, and therefore we
ſhall not dye for it, but the material part of the ſin Chriſt bore
not. Sin could not come ſo neer him; It might make him ſick
and dye, but not diſordered and ſtained. He was pure from
Original and Actual ſins; and therefore that remains in the
body, though the guilt and puniſhment be taken off, and changed
into advantages and grace; and <hi>the Actual</hi> are received by the
Spirit of grace deſcending afterwards upon the Church, and ſent
by our Lord to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But it is not rationally to be anſwered what S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
ſayes,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note>

onely ſhould be left without a Sacrament, and an inſtrument of

yet neither do they refuſe; and yet they conſent as
much to the grace of the Sacrament, as to the prevarication of
<hi>Adam</hi> and becauſe they ſuffer under this, it were but reaſon
they ſhould be relieved by that. And<note n="*" place="margin">S. Greg. Naz. <gap reason="foreign">

their own knowledge, then to dye without their being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
for ſo it happened to the circumciſed babes of Iſrael: and if
the conſperſion and waſhing the doore poſts with the blood of a
lamb, did ſacramentally preſerve all the firſt-born of Goſhen,</hi> it
cannot be thought impoſſible or unreaſonable that the want of
underſtanding in children ſhould hinder them from the bleſſing
of a ſacrament, and from being redeemed and waſhed with the
blood of the Holy Lamb, who was ſlain for all from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>After all this it is not inconſiderable that we ſay the Church
hath great power and authority about the Sacraments;<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> which
is obſerveable in many inſtances. She appointed what perſons
ſhe pleaſed, and in equal power made an unequal diſpenſation
and miniſtery. The Apoſtles firſt diſpenſed all things, and then
they left off exteriour miniſteries to attend to the word of God
and prayer: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> accounted it no part of his office to
baptize, when he had been ſeparated by impoſition of hands at
<hi>Antioch,</hi> to the work of preaching and greater miniſteries;
and accounted that act of the Church, the act of Chriſt, ſaying,
<hi>Chriſt ſent mee not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel:</hi> they
uſed various forms in the miniſtration of Baptiſm, ſometimes
baptizing <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> ſometimes expreſſely invocating

as in the Latine Church, but in Greek, [<hi>Let the ſervant of

Church invented the forms, &amp; in moſt things hath often changed
them, as in <hi>abſolution, excommunication,</hi> and ſometimes they
baptized people upon their profeſſion of repentance, and then
taught them; as it hapned to the Jaylor and all his family; in
whoſe caſe there was no explicit faith afore hand in the myſteries
of Religion, ſo far as appears; and yet he, and not onely he, but
all his houſe were baptized at that hour of the night when the
earthquake was terrible, and the fear was pregnant upon them, &amp;
<hi>this upon their Maſters account,</hi> as it is likely: but others were

the after ages of the Church which refuſed to communicate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
have found ſome little things againſt the lawfulneſſe, and
thoſe ages that uſed it found out ſome pretences for its neceſſity;
yet both the one and the other had liberty to follow their own
<hi>neceſſities,</hi> ſo in all things they followed Chriſt. Certainly there
is infinitely more reaſon why Infants may be communicated,
then why they may not be baptized. And that this diſcourſe
may revert to its firſt intention; although there is no record ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of any Church in the world, that from the Apoſtles dayes
incluſively to this very day ever refuſed to baptize their children,
yet if they had upon any preſent reaſon they might alſo change
their practiſe, when the reaſon ſhould be changed; and therefore
if there were nothing els in it, yet the univerſal practiſe of all
Churches in all ages, is abundantly ſufficient to determine us,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115910:33"/>
and to legitimate the practiſe, ſince Chriſt hath not forbidden it.
It is ſufficient confutation to diſagreeing people to uſe the words
of S. Paul, <hi>we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God,</hi> to
ſuffer children to be ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, till
they ſhall enter into it as Jews or Turks may enter, that is, by
choiſe and diſputation. But although this alone to <hi>modeſt</hi> and <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi>
that is, <hi>to Chriſtian Spirits,</hi> be ſufficient, yet this is more
then the queſtion did need. It can ſtand upon its proper foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

               <hi>O</hi> Holy and Eternal Ieſus, who in thy own perſon wert pleaſed
to ſanctify the waters of baptiſm and by thy inſtitution and
commandment didſt make them effectual, to excellent purpoſes of
grace and remedy, be pleaſed to verify the holy effects of baptiſm
to me and all thy ſervants whoſe names are dedicated to thee in an
early and timely preſentation, and enable us with thy grace to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
all our promiſes, by which we were bound, then when thou
didſt firſt make us thy own portion and relatives in the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a holy covenant. O be pleaſed to pardon all thoſe undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and unhandſome interruptions of that ſtate of favour in which
thou didſt plant us by thy grace, and admit us by the gates of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:
and let that Spirit which moved upon thoſe holy waters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be abſent from us, but call upon us and invite us by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
argument and daily ſolicitations and inducements to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
that we may never return to the filthineſs of ſin, bnt by the
anſwer of a good conſcience may pleaſe thee and glorify thy name
and doe honour to thy religion and inſtitution in this world, and
may receive the bleſſings and the rewards of it in the world
to come, being preſented to thee pure and ſpotleſs in the day of
thy power when thou ſhalt lead thy Church to a Kingdome, and
endleſs glories. <hi>Amen.</hi>
