            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen first I design'd to Publish this small Treatise, I thought no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so fit to dedicate it to, as such, on whose Judgment and Capacities the World might rely; upon which account it is that I make no scruple to prefix your names here.</p>
            <p>I cannot likewise but promise to my self encouragment from Others, acquainted with this Art, in that not only your selves, but many besides, of the most Ingenious, seem to desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e an Essay of this Nature· For as for the Modern preparations I know their usefulness cannot but be inviting; in that they have been made use of by diverse of the greatest Persons of the times; and One in Particular, by that discerning Monarch K. <hi>Charles</hi> the II.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I know Experimentally the unvaluable good producible from our Art;
<pb facs="tcp:105424:3"/>
and I need not blush to say, that were it brought to perfection, (of which I cannot but despair upon the Grounds that some Chymists proceed) it would prove of the Greatest and most Noble benefit to Mankind. I am satisfi'd that the Ordinary Methods of Physick cannot cure so expeditiously, as some Medicines I have heard off, that were produced from the Noble Art of Pyrotech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and I may without boast aver, that my Modern discovery contains some of that Nature.</p>
            <p>And this I Assert to a Physician, who himself has given me encouragment suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for this Publication; who as he was Physician to the Prince above mention'd, so he may well be presum'd to be a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Judge in the matter.</p>
            <p>Nor can I imagin, but that a Person, who wants only the name and practice of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, does likewise approve of this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; because he well knows, all Arts and Sciences, (how ever inprov'd by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age) are as yet impart imperfect; and I believe, we may take his Judgment in a greater matter, then either what I Publish, or what I assert in relation to the excellency of our Art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105424:3"/>I cannot indeed assert a possibility of finding out such Compendious ways, as would cure all kinds of Diseases, which were much to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I verily think, if any humane Art or Science could work such Miracles, Chymistry would Effect it: But as for several Distempers, which the Common Method of Physick are slow in, Chymistry has done More than is yet Publick.</p>
            <p>I cannot hope ever to see those of this Art to be Incorporated, for were they so, and a due encouragement added to it, as likewise due care taken of them and their Medicines, I cannot but think, it would be the greatest blessing to Mankind.</p>
            <p>But I shall not insist on this Topick here, tho' I suppose all good Men; and particular the most ingenious Physicians, will joyn issue with me; because 'tis the most desirable of all others. All that can be objected is, that I have added <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> which makes up so conciderable apart of the Book; but no ingenious Man can dislike that Author, as here Methodiz'd; since were he duely followed by other Chymists of this Age, it would much better the Art.</p>
            <p>You will excuse me, Gentlemen, for this harangue for our Art, <hi>&amp; veniam prolaude peto</hi>; tho' I know not, whether you will think it necessary, since it may prove a defensatory preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against all Cavils, that may be made to this Essay: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it will justify my design for the Publick good in this Publication, and You in accepting of it from, Gentlemen,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AS to the Title of these Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, none can question its proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being so well adapted to those uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and compendious ways of Cure, discover'd in this Treatise; in which Artful Methods the great <hi>Hermes Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>megistus</hi> and <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> lead the way, of whom, because no Man can doubt of their Merits, I shall say little of in this Preface.</p>
            <p>And as to the excellency of the Modern Preparations, Discover'd to the World in the first part, I need not say much; because the Names of those two Famous Chymists Mr. <hi>Wil. Russel</hi> (of the Little <hi>Minories,</hi> but lastly of <hi>Goodmans Fields</hi>) and his brother <hi>Richard Russel</hi> are deservedly known to most Ingenious Men; such Persons knowing their usefulness to the Publick, can spare me the labour of an Encomium, either on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, or their incomparable <hi>inventa,</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:105424:4"/>
somuch that the World must own, they have gained themselves a lasting memory among all ingenious Artists of both kinds, as well as with the Chymists.</p>
            <p>That which I find most Necessary in their Case is, to vindicate their Medicines from Scandal occasioned by pretenders after their Death; for which end I have produced these Genuine Ones, as invented by Themselves; in doing which I promise to my self to be useful to the World, and do Justice to the Authors at once: For should I not do so, who would not see these two inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies to follow?</p>
            <p>First, the World is by such pretenders really bubled, both as to their expectations in the Cures, and as to the expences bestowed on them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Authors are thereby much debased, as well as the Art, in that the World does expect that real Benefit, as formerly they had, and still might, were it not for the Art of Counterfiting; which indeed hath much hindered the use of these Medicines.</p>
            <p>Now to Obviate both these Errors, and free both the Physician and Patient from them, I found it necessary to publish this Treatise,
<pb facs="tcp:105424:5"/>
as being the alone means to prevent these abuses. And as I do freely own that these Medicines are not mine but theirs, yet I again presume to have the alone true Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal method of preparing them.</p>
            <p>And how I came by the knowledg of them, the World will soon disern upon telling them, that I practised their Operations, with one of the Brothers and for his Widdow, and my self about Twelve years past; and have taken great Care, and still do, to give them there true and due preparation, according to the Original Method; which none can do so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as my self, because I have been so Conversant in their Operations.</p>
            <p>I need not, I presume, make any Apology for this plainess, because I reckon the ablest and most Ingenious Artists will count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Obliged; for since these Medicines seem to be much desired, I have therein gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the World, and given them the true Key of these Secrets; in which I do assure all, that I aim not so much at my own private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as that of the Publick; partly that these most Noble and Compendious Medicines, might not dye with the Authors, and partly to avoid the above mention'd inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105424:5"/>And here at last I declare to the World the satisfaction I receive from this Publication because I cannot in the least doubt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd event; by reason, that all Men have here that real Method of these Preparations, as I learned them my self: But if any one should be so obstinate as to proceed in any other manner of preparing them, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of bettering them, I cannot but declare them Counterfits.</p>
            <p>It cannot but be an honour, to the memory of Mr. <hi>William Russel,</hi> That that discerning Monarch King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to whom he was Chymist in Ordinary made frequent Use of his Tincture; whereby His Majesty found such singular Benifit, that he was pleased to stile it the <hi>Royal Tincture</hi>: And I doe Assure the World that our Chymist was much valued by that Prince, insomuch, that he was often in his Conversation, upon such grounds, as His Royal Prudence thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable: According to which Example, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the highest quality in the Kingdom esteemed his prepared Medicines, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses of <hi>Darby</hi> and <hi>Ossery,</hi> and no small number of Considerable Rank and Figure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being without them.</p>

For in the Primary assaults of any Disease (that is upon the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Evening) unto perfect Recovery; but in Intermitting Fevers I always give it an hour before the Fit, in every Epidemic, Putrid or acute Fever, it answers the Regular Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, because it sometime Vomiteth, Purgeth, and provokes Sweats (without the help of Cloaths more than usual) and other while stayeth Vomiting and Looseness arising from Natures Errour, or Debility of Parts, or Organs rectifying her Errour and strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parts. Also it stops those Morbifick Sweats that arise from Languishment, or alters such Sweats, as are forced by Diaphoreticks, unseasonably used contrary to the Intent of Nature.</p>
                  <p>In Vertigoes and all Dolour of the Head, Stomach, Back, or Sides; 'tis a Medine of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral use and service.</p>
                  <p>In the Iliack and Collic Passions, in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and all pains in the Muscles, that happen from the Scurvy, or in any other congealed Distemper, or what may be Comprehended under the name of Congelation; this Powder proves it self a power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In the Bloody-Flux 'tis a certain and speedy Cure even to admiration: Also in the Griping of the Guts, attended with vehement Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and a continual Loosness, it effects so much beyond the power of other Medicines, as is scarcely credible; yet the same Powder, in extream Costiveness accomplisheth the work by loosening the Belly.</p>
                  <p>In the small Pox, taken in the beginning of the Disease: It causeth Vomiting, Purging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Sweats, and then binds the Body (as is fit) and brings out the small Pox; fortifying the life as far as it is gifted for that work.</p>
                  <p>In the Jaundice no Medicine exceeds this, for it extirpates the Diseases Root and Branch.</p>

                  <p>In Convulsions it is highly serviceable; for if it be given to Children new born, and for sometime used, it prevents such fits, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those Crudities Children bring with them into the World.</p>

                  <p>In Femenine Diseases, all Intemperancies, Inordinancies, and Distemparatures of the Womb, 'tis a certain and speedy Remedy.</p>
                  <p>If Women with Child take the Powder up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any sense of Illness; or where a Tendency to Abortion is, it prevents the Danger thereof by strengthening the Womb. In the Birth it brings on Pains, and hastens the Labour with safety, but if the Natural time of Delivery be not near, it restrains Pains until that time comes. It stops Floudings, facilitates the Birth and Cleanseth as is fit, curing the after Pains; and in Women Lying in, answereth the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the Patient either in Cleansing or Strengthening.</p>

                  <p>Also in the Sore or Ulcerated Breast of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, this Powder is of great service.</p>
                  <p>It strengthens a week Stomach enabling it to retain the Food and digest it; especially if taken so soon as the party have Eaten. And in all weakness of old Age so far as the first Digestion is concern'd, it is of great Use.</p>

be frequently taken, and that in a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> Forty drops at Night going to Bed, and also every Morning fasting.</p>
                  <p>In Suppression, Difficulty or sharpness of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin it is an Effectual Remedy, if twenty drops be taken Morning and Evening in Mace-Ale, or in a decoction of Mallows if they design Ease, or Parsly roots if they intend Expulsion.</p>
                  <p>In Convulsions, Lethargies, great Pains, Weights in the Head it is profitable if taken four times a Day twenty Drops at a time.</p>
                  <p>Against Pains in the Stomach, and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses thereof, 'tis very Efficatious if thirty or forty Drops be taken at a time, twice or four times a Day in drink, when the Pains begin to invade, and the use thereof continu'd till the Dolour ceases. Only in this case let the Partys so griev'd be sure to take care, never to Eat or Drink, until they are assured, that what they Eat and Drank before be well Digested.</p>
                  <p>In imbecility of the Generative faculty, or in Weakness, Coldness, and unaptness to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this Tincture is very profitable if twenty Drops at a time be taken in Sack, three times a Day, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Morning fasting, one hour before Dinner, at four a Clock after noon, and the fourth time at Night going to Bed, in mace-Ale, especially if the Powder be used with it. This method must be continu'd for a Month together.</p>
                  <p>For Recovery of Srength in Consumptions, where the Lungs are not Ulcerated, this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105424:16"/>
ought to be given, by ten Drops at a time, as often as the Patient takes any thing Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid (whether Broth, Milk, Gellies, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulsions of any kind) as also in all his or her Drink.</p>
                  <p>In the Jaundies 'tis no less Effectual; if thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Forty Drops be taken at a time in what drink the Afflicted party best liketh, in the same manner as before, and the use thereof continued, till the Urin be clear as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Disease invaded.</p>
                  <p>Against after pains in Child bed, and to open Obstructions, this Medicine yields Relief, if ten Drops be given to Women in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (in their usual Candle) every time they drink it.</p>
                  <p>A Child of a year old may take two drops in two spoonfuls of Brest milk, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably.</p>

                     <hi>Note,</hi> In taking or administring this Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 'tis very convenient not to suffer your Selves, Friends or Patients, to be over perswaded by any Arguments whatsoever, to take Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Solutive Medicines. altho' your Friends or Patients Bodies seem to be somewhat Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: For so doing you will much retard the benifit which would naturally accrew from this Tincture, by its Transpirative vertue. And let this be a caution to All, in every kind of Distemper where this Medicine is used, not to take or intermix any other things (except as is above in this Treatise described) with the same.</p>

                  <p>WHatsoever (almost) can be said of the Powder, may also be truely averred of this Medicine, which is as general as that. In Distempers of Women (because pleasant to take) it proves more serviceable than that, by reason of the nice Palats of most Women: It prevents Abortion, stays the Child in the Womb (if the Ligiments happen not by some Accident to be broken) unto the full time of Delivery, when that is come it hastens the Birth as is fit, and after the Birth cleanseth well, and either prevents or cures the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains; but more readily if the Powder be taken in it so soon as the Woman is laid. This I have very often prov'd by my proper Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. In Womens Distempers the Powder cannot be taken in a more proper Vehicle than this Cordial. To Men also where Wine is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, I give it both as a Vehicle for the Powder, and also to comfort them. If a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting Potion, or a common Cathartic be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the prejudice of the Patient, this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial either st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>Of Fevers.</head>
            <p>OF Fevers there are four Kinds, <hi>Viz.</hi> in the Stomach, Liver, Reins, and Extraneus Fevers.</p>
            <p>Touching Fevers of the Stomach, it is to be noted, that by their Oppilation, and defect of Separation, occation to Putrefaction is given. This Generation is the Infection of the Aire. (of the Body) Now if the Body be infected by the same, it suffers a Trembling; for since the Aire bares not Putrefactions in it self, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it attempt an Egress, by the motion of the Body. (as of the Earth)</p>
            <p>Therefore all Trimbling is from Putridness, and the motion it self by infection of the Aire. And the infection of the Aire is Cause of the Fitt. Putridness of Tartar is the Feculency thereof. Those things which pass not into Tartar, become Feces, from which the first Febrile Generation, and the first begining of all Fevers, have their existancy. Through vapours generated from the Feces of Tartar, the Aire of the Body is infected. And whilst the Aire is cleansing it self, the Fitt continues, and this is sometimes for twelve hours. But when the Aire is not so strong as to expel the Infection, it recedes and rayseth a Compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105424:54"/>
in the Stomach. Thence it is that the Sick say: the Fitt shakes me not but oppresseth me.</p>
            <p>But it may be said a Fever trembles every day, and not every other day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is the cause? It is this, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Feces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest also, as well as the Stomach, or Liver; and therefore, so soon as they begin to wax hot, a vapour ascends, infecting the Air, as is said, thence is the Trembling. And when the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (of the Tartar) are from Mercury, their digestion is in one day. If from Salts, after the second day. And if from Sulphur, after the third day. Accordingly is the Paroxysm.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Signes of Fevers from the Stomach, are these.</head>
               <p>Compression of the Stomach, Nauseating, a Stinking breath, weakness of the Head, and discoloration of all Members; also strong trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and raving after the hot Fitt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Fevers of the Liver.</head>
               <p>This Fever is an Oppilated Heate, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from putrefyed Feces in the Regions of the Liver. For this Oppilation is sometimes in the whole Region, sometimes particularly according to the Place.</p>
               <p>If of the whole part, then the Tumor is great, and long, and there is Heat of those Members, Deoppilation, but after the stoppage is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then Heats of (the whole) body is present.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105424:54"/>
But if Locally, then the Trembling soon pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth into Heat, this Oppilation causeth its own Stoppage, and by Trembling breaks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppilates, sometimes all Obstructions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sometimes but a few of them. When it makes a general Deoppilation, then the Fever is more easie. When but in part only, the Fever is more greivous, and undoubtedly is a preparation to the generation of another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Oppilations are to be Consider'd: For if the Feces shall not be resolved after the cold Fitt, then is to be feared an Increase of these Oppilations, as also a Disease of long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and a future Imposthum. Likewise, Swelling of the External parts of the Body, tending inward to the Center, and pricking dolours.</p>
               <p>Signes of the Disease approaching are: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Members, Discoloration of the Face, Extention and Rigor of the Members; then follows a gentle cold Fitt, but the second Fitt is more strong, and the Third stronger, at no certain hour, but before, or after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; then the Heat is long, and the dolour difficult, also the Body consumes, and in the end a Dropsy takes beginning (by reason of the Liver) from Roch-Allom resolved; or the Jaundies is Ripened, by reason of its Region and matter.</p>
               <p>It very often happens, that the generation, and disease of the first Fever, <hi>viz.</hi> of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105424:55"/>
Stomach, is followed with a second Fever, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Liver. Now, if the matter of the Fever in the Stomach, was a Tertian, and that of the Liver a Tertian also; these two make a Quotidian.</p>

               <p>Fevers of the Reins have beginning from the Feces of Tartar, by reason of Digestion For their is a Trembling in the Reins like a Fever fitt, which assailes the whole Body, by reason of Oppilation. Every Oppilation is a motion of the whole Body, and a consequent corporal Heat, by reason of Vapours passing through all the Pores.</p>
               <p>The Antients called it the Passion, the Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica; others, an Erratick Fever; others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Motion or fit of the Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>Extraneous Fevers, or Fevers of the Blood, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>A Fever is a putrefied Heat, with tremblings from its own Oppilation, by reason of unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred matter (in the closed Pores) with a stiptick force.</p>
               <p>These Fevers arise not from Nutriments.</p>
               <p>The Heat of a Fever is not without Cold: For every Putrefaction gives Heat, Conjoyn'd with some Cold: Such a Cold, the Blood may
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105424:55"/>
also induce, when the peccant matter adheres in the Principle members, then the Fit passeth thoughout the whole Body.</p>
               <p>This is an Universal Fever; the Particular is, when one Vein only is Feverish. Also from the Flesh, there is an Universal and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fever. It is possible that Tertian, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Quotidian, and all other Fevers, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the Spleen, and other Principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as Heart Reins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Quartan is from Sulphur; the Tertian from Salts; the Quotidian from Allom. Before the Fit begins the Urin of the Sick is Red.</p>
               <p>Every Material Putrefaction makes its own Oppilation from the Spirit of Salt, with an ingenited Coagulation, passeth by Digestion into Trembling.</p>
               <p>By the Digestion it may be fore known, how long the Fever will dure. If the Quotidian number concur with a white Colour, six Weeks will be the Period thereof, and sooner it will not be Cur'd: But, if it be exhibited with a green Colour, it will continue 19, 20, or 21 Weeks: If it comes with a Cough, it will be protracted to 7, 8, or 9. Weeks: If it afflict with Tumors of the Feet, it will abide 15 Weeks: If it changeth the number of Fits, as when a Quotidin becomes a Tertian, it will endure a Years spase: But when the number be increased, as when a Quartan becomes a Quotidian, it will continue Ten months: If the Sick have a good appitit to Meat and Drink,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105424:56"/>
that is a sign the Fever will not be long: But if the appetite of Meat and Drink be decay'd, it more inclines to a Quartan, as is said.</p>
               <p>It sometimes happens, that (by reason of the Vehemency of the Fit) Blood issues out of the Nosthrils, and goes forth by Urin, some Vein being broak: This is not only a good sign, but is also a Cure of the Fever: But if a Fever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Diversly, now sooner, then later, that is Erratick, and the worst sign, unless in the time of the Cure, then it is a good sign: When the Fit is unequal, that is to be judged an Evil sign, because by its portended an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the matter.</p>

                     <p>Rubarb is an Arcanum in the Jaundies, if the same be Corrected and amended diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this manner reduce Rubarb (imbibed in Oyl of bitter Almonds) into a Bolus; which inclosed in a Glass, expose to the Sun for some time; then it will be turned into an Oyl, first Yellow, Afterwards purplish; which seperate from the Feces by Expression; Dose ℈j. every day once, for 3 or 4 days together. So also the Rubarb may be macerated in the Waters of Prassium, Horehound, Celandine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as before set in the Sun.</p>

            <head>Of Madness according to <hi>Paracelsus.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALtho' Madness be one only Disease, yet many names have been given to it, both by the Latins, and other Nations; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly various Causes have been assigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, none of which are consonant to (or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with) Experience, drawn from the very Light of Nature.</p>
            <p>When a Man having Reason, is depriv'd and spoiled thereof, so, as he cannot imploy the same to those ends for which it was created, but furiously acts, and inconsiderately tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuates; then is that Man seized with Madness. Indeed many Men are otherwise spoiled of their Reason, as the Possessed, Drunk, Fatuate and Tyrants; which are not to be referred to this Classis. For they are not deprived of Reason from a Disease, but from other Accidents: But those Distempers, of which we now treat, are true Diseases, and naturally arise from Morbifick Causes.</p>
            <p>Now that we may explain the Cause, it is to be understood. The Reason should be pure and Clean, such as the best Wheat in the Feild is, without Cockle or Darnel. But as among Wheat sown, Tares grow and increase; so also Darnel is bred in the Intellect.</p>
            <p>In a Natural manner Madness is thus caused, <hi>viz.</hi> When any thing is extended beyond its
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105424:68"/>
Strength, and Nature, it is broaken. So the Eyes are blinded by beholding the Sun. For unto every Member its bound and Office is assigned, pass beyound these, it cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damage.</p>
            <p>To speculate beyond Humane Capacity, is to infringe and cast down Reason it self.</p>
            <p>But there is also another sort of Madness, which proceeding from Elements hurts our Reason, no otherwise, then as you see Fire to rage, and become furious in the Element of Water, and by that excited Ebullition, to cast forth Bubbles, Froath, and Vapour: for our Reason is as a certain Liquid thing, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that Element, in which the Fire exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth its power. But by what is this Element broaken? <hi>viz.</hi> By Fire only: Therefore if, what breakes is Fire, what is broak must be Water. Thus the Body of our Reason is a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> highest subtilty of which is a boyling Dew. Therefore the Fire kindling, such Operations are made, as from Fire and Water.</p>
            <p>Besides these said two Causes of Madness, <hi>viz.</hi> One, a too great confidence of Strength and Power; the Other, the Operation of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, many other Causes of Madness may be added and commemora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by other Men; but these can neither find weight, or place, in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy or Astronomy, in which Physick is founded, Yet I own there is another kind of Madness, which ariseth from Meats eaten, as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105424:68"/>
Lupines inflict Madness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (See <hi>Paracelsus</hi>'s Treatises of Madness; and of Diseases of Mad-Folks.)</p>
            <p>Also, trouble of mind even to Desparation, may cause Madness; for by this disturbance, they enforce Madness on the Brain. Yet the cause hereof is hidden and Obscure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner some Diseases may induce Madness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that an Imposthum should cause Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as the Humorists say, is utterly false. For this Imposthum they never saw; and if any should at any time appear outwardly, in a Person that is Mad, then judge, that the same thing, which generated Madness, produced the Imposthum its fore-runner: For the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthum it self inferrs not Madness, but is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually produced by the same thing, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Madness.</p>
            <p>He, who suddainly degenerates from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, custom, and manners, and is mutable according to the Affections of his mind, not having the use of Reason, but hates and striks Men, crys out and Raves, acting many mad pranks, may certainly be prounced Mad.</p>
            <p>Also he, who museth and sits quiet and still, not having the use of his Reason, may in like manner be termed Mad: Therefore the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of their gestures and manners should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently observed, yea, and the Assendant of every hour (which alone infuseth manners) exactly taken notice of, more then those things which are in the Body.</p>

               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:105424:69"/>
               <head>Cure.</head>
               <p>He, who indeavours Experimentally to cure this Disease, must let pass the Syrups, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and prescribed Diet of Antient Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; the chief of which are Violets, Roses, Camomil, the Water Lilly and the like. This Disease is familiarly cured by the Adjurers of Divels, altho they themselves well know it is otherwise; in the mean while, they give him other Remedies, by which they expel the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and then they glory they have cast out the Devil, when as they have only cured that Madness, which afflicted the Man. By these Deceits they gain more, then by their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Therefore let him, who is desirous of Skill in these matters, learn of those Adjurers, not to cast out Divels, but to cure Maniacks, with sutable Secrets.</p>
               <p>Medicines taking away Madness are twofold; one Chirurgick, the other Physical.</p>
               <p>Yet I would have all Men be advised, not rashly to undertake this Chirurgick cure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by their proper Experience, they be well instructed and skilled in all Accidents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The other way of Curing, is effected by those things which mortify the Madness, and do moreover so still, and allay the peccant matter of the same, as it thenceforth can no more be perceived. Of this Cure the Remedies also are manifold, as well External as Internal; the best of which are those which are prepared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Extracting Quintessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as are: The Highest Anodine, Qintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of Poppy, Mandrake, Loliats, Opiats, and Henbane; Altho all these Remedies be strong and vehement, yet being so purged, and prepared, have no Impurities left in them, by which the Body can be hurt.</p>

            <p>WHen any thing is Eat, Drunk Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and not well separated by the Stomach, and so passeth out by Urin, Seidg; or Vomiting, thence is made the Dysentery, Lientery, and Diarrhaea, either of the Urin, Seidg, or Vomiting.</p>
            <p>It is called a Disease from Dissolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is dissolved in the first Operation. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and Putrifaction are one Passion, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from good things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Dissolution is twofold, either by the Stomach, or by Minerals. When the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach cannot Digest, then is a Dissolution of the Stomach. The other Dissolution is when the Minerals in the Body are dissolved. For every watery thing admits of resolution.</p>
            <p>Of the first Species there are three Diseases of Dissolution, or of things Dissolved, <hi>viz.</hi> Red, White, and Laxate.</p>
            <p>What is digested and not separated passeth out Red, as by the Fundament Clots of Blood are often expelled. All these proceed from the evil digestion of the Stomach, and the Blood issues not, from any Veins broke in the Body. When any one pisseth Blood, and yet in pissing feeles no pain, nor is pained in his Loins,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105424:72"/>
Groins, and Back, nor perceives any other Evil, then that he pisseth Blood; that is a Diarrhaea of the Urin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Seidg or Stools are White, Froa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as Lime or Chalk, or else have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Skin, and are Thin, Viscous, and Flatuous, that is the White Dissolved Disease, and the Stomach is faulty. If by Vomit it pass out white, it is a Diarrhaea of Vomiting. When the Urin is Milky, it indicates the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry of the Urin; and when without pain, it is the Diarrhaea.</p>
            <p>The Laxate Disease is, when the Archeity of the Stomach is infirm, and the Stomach operates not, as it ought. When the Patient makes abundance of Urin, and that appears now White, then Red, another time Turbid, and hath no content; then a Flux of the Urin is present. But when much Vomiting is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, it is a Flux of Vomiting.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there are three dissolved Diseases (or Disseases of Dissolution) by Urin, <hi>viz.</hi> Urin of Blood, a milky Urin, and Mandra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate or Aqueous Urin. Also, there are three dissolved Diseases by Vomiting, as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting from what is digested, frequent Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Vomiting of the Thorax.</p>
            <p>Mandragorate Urin is, when any one pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hath no sence at all of his Water passing from him, and voids much Urin, yet feels not that Tickling at its outgoing, which is common to all Creatures by Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105424:73"/>Vomiting from what is digested, is, when any one is compelled to Vomit an hour, or two after he hath eaten, and that as often as he eats. Frequent Vomiting is, when a Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually Vomits. Vomiting of the Thorax is, when any one is constained to Vomit every eighth day, or every two or three days.</p>
            <p>This Dissolved Disease is such, whether it pass out by Urin, Seidg, or Vomiting.</p>
            <p>The power and strength of this Disease, are the Accidents thereof. That Species which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out by the Fundament, hath four Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, <hi>viz.</hi> the Collick, Gripes, Dolours of the Hips, and Back. That which is by Urin hath three, <hi>viz.</hi> the Disury, Strangury, and Laxation. And in Vomiting the Accidents come from the Stomach, as bitterness of the Gall, which is made of the great dryness of the Stomack; but Sobbing (or the Hec-cough) comes from the Stomachs Coldness.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Cure of all these consists in Curing the Stomach, which should be deduced to such a state, as it may digest whatsoever is eat, or drunk; for this end the Archeity of the Stomach must be comforted. And such a Confortation must be procured by Spagyrick Degrees, that the Pure may be separated from the Impure. But in descending to the Cure, such things must be taken, as may Coagulate the Dissolution</p>

                  <p>This Dissolved Disease begining, the Patient is troubled with a continual Flux of the Belly, and yet eats and drinks much.</p>
                  <p>He, who goes to Stool often, eats and drinks strongly, and waxeth lean in Body, doth also suffer a dissolution of the Mineral.</p>
                  <p>When the Food is cast out by Vomiting, crude and undigested, that is a Sign of a dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Disease from Minerals.</p>

                  <p>In a Mineral dissolution, the Blood comes forth by the Fundament more Red, then in the dissolution of the Stomach.</p>

            <head>The Conclusion.</head>
            <p>I Had not any design to Publish this small Tract, especially the First Part thereof, but finding (as the saying is) some to ready to thrust their Sicle into another Mans Harvest, was one reason that mov'd me to it: For I never met with one Man from the Artist to the Bungler, but what pretended to the <hi>Species Vitae</hi>; if not to them all: But now they may with confidence pretend to them, yet let me tell yee, 'tis not every Fop can be Master of them, and I am fully resolv'd, never to alter or deviate from the Original method, but to prepare them exactly and curiously, with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and diligence, and to keep large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities by me, to oblige all those ingenious Men who are pleased to make use of them.</p>
            <p>Another reason that induced me to Publish this small Treatise was the uncivility I receiv'd from some disingenious Persons (especially one in particular) who was so Foolishly Envious as to insinuate into the heads of some Men that I could not make any of these Medicines here deliver'd: But I think they had more Wit then to believe them, because they knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but their full design in so doing, a Man of a mean Capacity may easily disearn: Also I did it in Respect to those ingenious Men, who
<pb facs="tcp:105424:76"/>
daily make use of these Medicines, that by knowing the method and manner of prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they might the better know their Nature and partly to Oblige the Sons of Art, who have taken great pains, and made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent search after those Medicines, Especially the <hi>Species Vitae</hi> and <hi>Tincturae Regalis</hi>; but let me tell you the <hi>Species Minor,</hi> and <hi>Pleura</hi> comes not an Inch behind them as to what they are apropriated to.</p>
            <p>I hope these my small endeavours will be accepted, and receiv'd into the favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Ingenious as a Guift from one of the meanest of its professors, which indeed is the least of my fear, being fully satisfied, of the love such Persons bare to all Novalties, and instead of hindring things of this Nature, they always applaud what ever may be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Publick, For it will be very rare if the Reader cannot find something herein that may be serviseable to him.</p>
            <p>But some m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y object and say, that the Part of <hi>Paraoelsus,</hi> is no Novalty, because we have it in the Latin.</p>
            <p>I answer, 'Tis true, we have it in the Latin Tongue; but there's several Ingenious Men that doth not understand the Latin: For which reason I thought it necessary to add them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in doing which, I hope such will not be offended at it, there being many a score of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Medicines in it; which I hope the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious will find of great use and service to them,
<pb facs="tcp:105424:76"/>
to their desir'd success and advantage. Thus much I thought to premise by way of Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, hoping this Tract will find a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance amongst the Ingenious, which will be an incouragment to me, and may cause me (if a Second Impression should be) to add som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be as acceptable as this, if not more.

            <p>I Have, with diligence and care invented a Curious Purging Electuary, which is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chymical, and I am Certain, never known to the World before. It is certainly one of the most noblest <hi>Antivenerial Medicine</hi> as ever yet, discover'd to the World, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced both on Men, Women and very young Children. It is of a strange Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating power in Correcting and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nting the edges of the <hi>Venereal Salts,</hi> carrying of the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by Stool and Urin, without griping, or offending the Bowels in the least, purifying the whole mass of Blood (with the Assistance of the <hi>Tincturae Scorbutica</hi>) totally Eredicating the Venomous ferment, causing a good Diges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Complexion, and Restoring the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to their former Vigor, its not Obnoxious to the Stomach, as most Commonly Clap Physick is, but is very pleasant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Price 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Ounce.</p>
            <p>I have also an Infalable Powder for the Cough, Fever, and Pleurisy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a most excellent preservative in the Pest, a Certain and Speedy cure in the Pleurisy, and inposthumes of what kind soever: it is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative in all manner of Fevers, it is also, a present help in the Epilepsy, and a Curative in every Cough of what Nature soever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be newly taken, or inviterate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
