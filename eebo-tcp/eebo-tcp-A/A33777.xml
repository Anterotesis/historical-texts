            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>COnforming</hi> and <hi>Reforming</hi> is now the talk of every man in this Kingdome. Some are very zealous for one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. is for <hi>both</hi> conjoyntly, but yet in due order. He would have us first obey the laws of Christ (our great Law-maker) and then the Canons of the Church: and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason. For if the Church be <hi>the body of Christ,</hi> I would fain learn from <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 17. and xii. 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 16. iv. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 15.</note> our Non-conformists, why we may not give as much reverence &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the laws of the Church, as we must to the laws of each paltry Corporation The contrary position hath occasioned the great increase of fanaticks in this Realm, as I have proved in my discourse of the <hi>rise &amp; growth of Quakerisme,</hi> which will shortly be printed.</p>
            <p>If you desire to be informed concerning the life of this excellent person D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Colet,</hi> you may read it described at large by <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his Epistles, √† pag. <hi>702.</hi> ad <hi>712.</hi> (to which add S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thom.

               <hi>If any ask why I cite</hi> Theodorus <hi>and the</hi> Canon law <hi>thrice,</hi> Linwood <hi>and</hi> Spelmans <hi>Councels often: I answer, Because I suppose our</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>meant them. And again those that I cite seem to be confirmed by an Act of Parl.</hi> 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8 <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>entituled,</hi> An Act concerning submission of the Clergy: <hi>wherein it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed thus,</hi> Provided also, that such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Constitutions, &amp;c. being already made, which be not repugnant to the laws, statutes and customes of this Realm, nor to the damage or hurt of the Kings preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, shall now still be used and executed, as they were before the making of this Act, &amp;c. <hi>which Act is revived,</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have lately seen two small pieces in</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <hi>on the same subject with this Sermon of</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <pb facs="tcp:42744:4"/>
the want of putting old Canons in execution, is the chief cause of almost all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>If any object, that these times will not bear the publishing of such books here; I answer, that I hope better things, that our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not so bad as their enemies do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <head>A SERMON <hi>OF</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>COLET</hi> made to the <hi>CONVOCATION,</hi> in the year 1511.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E are this day come together (Fathers and Right-wise bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) to enter into Councel: in which, what ye will do, and what matters ye will handle, we do not yet understand. But we wish, that once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring your name and profession, ye would minde the reformation of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical affairs. For assure your selves there never was more need of it, the state of the Church did never more desire your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. The Spouse of Christ (whom ye would should be without spot or wrinkle) is made deformed and ill-favoured; as saith Esaias, <hi>The faithfull city is become an harlot,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 21. <hi>She hath plaied the whore with many lovers,</hi> Jer. 3.1. whereby
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42744:5"/>
she hath conceived many seeds of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and daily bringeth forth very foul fruit. Wherefore I come hither to day (Fathers) to warn you, that in this your Councel ye bestow your whole thoughts upon the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>But indeed I came not willingly; being sufficiently conscious of my own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness; and foreseeing how hard it will be to please the precise judgement of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men. I esteemed it very unmeet (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most too malapert) that I a <hi>servant</hi> should counsel my <hi>Lords;</hi> that I a <hi>son</hi> should teach you my <hi>Fathers.</hi> Truely this had been more fit for some one of the Fathers themselves; that is to say, You <hi>Prelates</hi> might have done it with far more grave authority and greater wisdome. But the command of the most Reverend Father and Lord the <hi>Archbishop</hi> (President of this Councel) must be obeyed, who laid upon me this burden (which is in truth too heavie for my shoulders) for I remember that the prophet Samuel said, <hi>Obedience is better then sacrifice.</hi> Wherefore I pray and beseech you, to sustain my weakness
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42744:5"/>
               <hi>with your goodness and patience: in the first place to help me with your good prayers. And before all things,</hi> Let us pray to God the Father Almighty: first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring our most holy Father the Pope, and all spiritual Pastours, with all christen people; furthermore the most reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Lord the Archbishop, President of this Councel, and all Bishops, and all the Clergie, and all the people of England: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring finally this your congregation; Desiring God to inspire your minds so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to agree, to the benefit and fruit of the Church, that ye may not seem when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel is finisht, to have been gathered together in vain, and without cause. Let us all say, <hi>Pater noster, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To exhort you, Reverend Fathers, to endeavour Reformation, because nothing hath so disfigured the face of the Church, as hath the fashion of secular and worldly living in Clerks and Priests, I know not where more conveniently to begin my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, then from the Apostle Paul (in whose temple ye are gathered together): for he writing to the Romanes (and under their name to you) saith,
<q>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42744:6"/>
                  <bibl>ROM. xii. 2.</bibl>
Be not conformed to this world, but be ye reformed by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your minde; that ye may prove what is that good will of God, well-pleasing and perfect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THis the Apostle writ to all Christen men, but most chiefly to Priests and Bishops. Priests and Bishops are the light of the world. For he said unto them, <hi>Ye are the light of the world:</hi> and he said also, <hi>If the light that is in you be darkness, how grea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t is that darkness?</hi> that is, If Priests and Bishops (who should be as lights) run in the dark way of the world, how dark then shall the secular people be? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Paul said chiefly to Priests and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>Be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye reformed.</hi> In which words the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth two things: First he <hi>forbids,</hi> that we be not conformed to this world, and made carnal: and then he <hi>commands,</hi> that we be reformed in the spirit of God, and become spiritual.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42744:6"/>
Intending to follow this order, I shall speak first of Conformation, and then of Reformation. <hi>Be not conformed to this world.</hi> By the word <hi>world,</hi> the Apostle meaneth the ways and manner of secular living; which chiefly consist in four evils of this world, that is, in devillish pride, carnal lust, worldly covetousness, and secular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. These are in the world as S. John witnesseth, 1 Epist. 2. 16. For he saith, <hi>All that is in the world is either the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life.</hi> These same things now <hi>are</hi> and <hi>reign</hi> in the Church and Ecclesiastical persons; so that we may seem truly to say, All that is in the Church is either the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, or pride of life.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And first to speak of <hi>pride of life.</hi> How much greediness and appetite of honour and dignity is seen now adays in Clergy-men? How run they (yea almost out of breath) from one benefice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the less to the greater, from the lower to the higher? Who seeth not this, and who seeing sorroweth not? And most of those which are in these dignities, carry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42744:7"/>
their heads so high, and are so stately, that they seem not to be put in the humble Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop-rick of Christ, but rather in the high Lordship and power of the world; not knowing, or not minding what Christ the master of all meekness said unto his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (whom he called to be Bishops and Priests); <hi>The princes of the Gentiles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise dominion over them, and those that be in authority have power; but do ye not so. Whosoever will be chief among you highest in dignity) let him be your servant. The son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister,</hi> Matth. 20. 25, &amp;c. By which words our Saviour doth plainly teach, that a prelacy in the Church, is nothing else but a ministration; that an high dignity in an Ecclesiastical person, ought to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meek service.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second secular evil is carnal <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence.</hi> And hath not this vice grown and encreased in the Church so far, that in this most busie age, the far greater number of Priests minde nothing but what doth delight and please their senses? They give themselves to feasts &amp; banquetting, spend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42744:7"/>
their time in vain babling, are addicted to hunting and hawking, and in a word drowned in the delights of this world; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent onely in progging for those lusts they set by. Against which sort of men S. Jude exclaims in his Epistle, saying, <hi>Wo unto them which have gone the way of Cain: they are foul and beastly, feasting in their meats, without fear feeding themselves; flouds of the wilde sea, foaming out their own shame: unto whom the storm of darkness is reserved for everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Covetousness</hi> is the third secular evil, which S. John calls the <hi>lust of the eyes,</hi> and S. Paul, <hi>idolatry.</hi> This abominable pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence hath so entred into the minds of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Priests, hath so blinded the eyes of their understanding, that we see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which seems to bring unto us some gain. What other thing seek we now adays in the Church, except fat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and high promotions? And it were well if we minded the duty of those when we have them: but he that hath many great benefices, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> not the office of one small one; and in these high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42744:8"/>
what other thing do we pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely our tithes and rents? We care not how vast our charge of souls be, how many or how great benefices we take, so they be of large value. Oh covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, covetousness! S. Paul justly called thee <hi>the root of all evil.</hi> Of thee cometh this <hi rend="sup">a</hi> heaping of benefices upon benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Of thee so great pensions assigned, from many benefices resigned. Of thee so much suing for tithes, for offerings, for mortuaries, for delapidations, by the right and title of the Church: For which things we contend as eagerly as for our lives. O covetousness! of thee it comes that these visitations of Bishops are so chargeable. Of thee the corruptness of Courts, and these daily new inventions, wherewith the poor silly people are so vexed. Of thee cometh the besyte and wantonness of <hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
               <hi>Officials.</hi> O covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! mother of all iniquity; of thee comes this fervent studie of <hi>Ordinaries</hi> to dilate their jurisdictions; of thee comes this peevish and raging contention in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries; of thee insinuation of testaments;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42744:8"/>
of thee the undue sequestration of fruits; of thee comes the superstitious observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all those laws that sound to any <hi>lucre;</hi> setting aside, and despising those that concern the <hi>amendment of manners.</hi> What should I rehearse the rest? To be short (and to conclude at one word) all corruptness, all the decay of the Church, all the offences and scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of the priests: according to that of S. Paul, which here I repeat again, and beat into your ears, <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness is the root of all evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth secular evil that spotteth the face of the Church, is <hi>continual secular occupation;</hi> wherein Priests and Bishops now adays do busie themselves, becoming the servants rather of men then God, the warriours rather of this world, then of Jesus Christ. For the Apostle Paul wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to Timothy (2 Epist. ii. 3.) that no man who is a good souldier of Christ, or that warreth for God, entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, is turmoiled with secular business. The warfare of Gods souldier, is not carnal, but spiritual. Our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42744:9"/>
warring is to pray devoutly, to read and study Scriptures diligently, to preach the word of God sincerely, to administer the H. Sacraments rightly, and offer sacrifice for the people. For we are mediatours and intercessours unto God for men: which S. Paul witnesseth writing to the Hebrews, <hi>Every Bishop,</hi> saith he, <hi>taken of men, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for men in those things that be unto God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</hi> Wherefore those Apostles, that were the first Priests and Bishops, did so much abhor all manner of meddling in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things, that they would not minister the meat that was necessary to poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; although it were a great work of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: but they said, <hi>It is not meet that we should leave the word of God and serve ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, we will give our selves continually to prayer and preaching the word of God,</hi> Act. vi. 2, 4. And S. Paul cryes to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, 1 Epist. vi. 4. <hi>If you have judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of things pertaining to this life, set them to be judges that be most in contempt in the Church.</hi> Many evils doubtless do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue from this secularity, when Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42744:9"/>
and Priests (leaving all spirituality) turmoyl themselves with earthly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. First, the dignity of Priesthood is dishonoured, which is greater then either that of Kings or Emperours, equal with the dignity of Angels. But the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this great dignity is sore shadowed, when Priests are employed in earthly things, whose conversation ought to be in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Priesthood is despised, when there is no difference between such Priests and Lay-people; but according to the prophesie of Hosea, <hi>As the people be, so are the priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the beautifull order and holy dignity in the Church is confused, when the highest in the Church do med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with vile and earthly things; and in their stead vile and abject persons do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise high and heavenly things.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the lay-people have great occasion offered them of evils, and cause to fall; when those men whose duty it is to draw others from the affection of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42744:10"/>
world, do by their continual conversation in this world, teach men to love the world; and by the love of the world cast them down headlong into hell.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in such Priests that be so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, there must needs follow hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. For when they be so mixed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused with lay-people, under the garment and habit of a Priest, they live plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lay-fashion. And through spiritual weakness, bondage, and fear (being made weak with the waters of this world) they dare neither do nor say any, but such things as they know to be pleasing and gratefull to their Princes ears. At last, through ignorance and blindness (when they are blinded with the darkness of this world) they see nothing but earthly things. Wherefore our Saviour Christ (not without cause) did warn the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of his Church in this manner; <hi>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with gluttony and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the cares of this world,</hi> Luk. xxi. 34. The cares, saith he, of this world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with when the hearts of Priests being sore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42744:10"/>
charged, they cannot minde the other life, nor lift up their souls to high and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. There be many other evils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these that follow of the secularity of Priests, which were long here to rehearse: but I make an end.</p>
            <p>These be the four evils that I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of (O Fathers, O Priests) by which we are conformable to this world, by which the face of the Church is made ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured, by which the state of it is destroyed; much more truly then it was in the beginning by the persecution of <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi> or afterward by the invasion of <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> that followed. For in the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tyrants, the Church being afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was made stronger and brighter; in the invasion of hereticks, the Church being shaken, was made wiser and more skilfull in holy writ: but since this secularity was brought in, since the worldly manner of living crept in among Church-men, the root of all spiritual life (that is, <hi>charitie</hi>) hath been extinct: which being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Church can neither be wise nor strong in God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42744:11"/>
In this age we are sensible of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of lay-people. But they are not so much contrary to us, as we are to our selves. Their contrariness hurteth not us so much, as the contrariness of our own evil life; which is contrary both to God and Christ; who said, <hi>He that is not with me is against me.</hi> We are also now adays troubled with hereticks (men intoxicated with strange opinions) but the heresies of them are not so pestilent and pernicious to us and the people, as the <hi>naughty lives of Priests,</hi> which (if we beleeve S. Bernard) is <hi>a kinde of heresie; nay, the chief of all, and most perillous.</hi> For that holy Father preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a certain Convocation to the Priests of his time, had these words in his sermon: <hi>Many men are Catholick in their speaking and preaching, which are hereticks in their works and actions. For what the hereticks do by evil teaching, the same do these men by ill example;</hi> viz. <hi>they lead the people out of the right way, and bring them into errour of life. And these men are so much worse then hereticks, by how much their works prevail more then their words.</hi> This that holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42744:11"/>
S. Bernard spoke, with a fervent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, against the sect of evil Priests in his time. By which words he sheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there be two kinds of heresies; one arising from perverse teaching, &amp; the other from naughty life: of which two this latter is far worse, and more perillous; reigning (now) in Priests, who do not live like themselves: not priestly, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to the utter and miserable destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church of God. Wherefore you Fathers, you Priests, and all you of the Clergy, at last rouze and look up from this your sleep in this forgetfull world; and being well awaked, hear S. Paul crying unto you, <hi>Be ye not conformed to this world.</hi> Thus much for the first part. Now let us come to the second.</p>

               <p>THe second thing that S.

                     </gap>, and vertuously in this present world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reformation and restoring of the Churches estate must needs <hi rend="sup">b</hi> begin of you our <hi>Fathers,</hi> and so follow in us your <hi>Priests,</hi> and in all the Clergy. You are the <hi>heads,</hi> you are an <hi>example</hi> of living to us; upon you we look as upon marks of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42744:12"/>
our direction. In you and in your lives we desire to read (as in lively books) how, and after what manner we ought to live; wherefore if you will consider, and pull out the motes that be in our eyes, first cast out the beam out of your own eyes. 'Tis an old proverb, <hi>Physician heal thy self;</hi> Let me beseech you, spiritual Physiclans, first to take your selves this purgation of manners, and then afterwards offer us the same to take.</p>
               <p>Now the way whereby the Church may be reformed into a better fashion, is <hi>not to make new laws:</hi> there be already laws enough, if not too many. <hi>Nothing is new under the sun,</hi> as saith Solomon, Eccl. 1.9. For the evils that are now in the Church, were before in times past; and there is no fault committed among us, for which our fore-fathers have not provided very good remedies. There are no trespasses, but there be remedies against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in the body of the Canon law. 'Tis not needfull then that <hi>new</hi> laws, and <hi>new</hi> constitutions be made, but that those which are made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready be <hi>well kept</hi> and put in execution.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42744:13"/>
Wherefore, I pray you, let those canons and laws which are made be called for, and rehearsed before you, in this your assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: those canons I mean that restrain <hi>vice,</hi> and those that further <hi>vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, let those canons be rehearsed, that do warn you, O Fathers, <hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">c</hi> not to lay hands suddenly on any man;</hi> not to be too facile in admitting into holy Orders. For here lies the original and spring-head of all our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, that the gate of Ordination is too broad, the entrance too wide and open; every man that offers himself is admitted every where without putting back. Hence comes it that we have such a multitude of priests, who have little learning and less piety. In my judgement, it is not enough for a priest to construe a collect, to put forth a question, to answer a sophism; but <hi>an honest, a pure, a holy life is much more necessary,</hi> approved manners, competent learning in holy Scripture, some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Sacraments. But <hi>chiefly and above all things, the fear of God and love of heavenly life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the canons be rehearsed, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42744:13"/>
command that <hi rend="sup">d</hi> benefices of the Church be given onely to those that are <hi>worthy,</hi> &amp; that promotions be made by the right ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>vertue,</hi> not by nearest <hi rend="sup">q</hi> 
                  <hi>kinred</hi> or carnal <hi>affection,</hi> or acception of persons: whereby it happeneth now adays, that boyes, and fools, and ill-livers do reign and rule in the Church, in stead of <hi>old</hi> men, and <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this end, let the canons be rehears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which forbid and oppose the dirt of <hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Simony.</hi> Which corruption, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which cruel and detestable pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doth now creep abroad like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in the minds of Priests; so that in these days many are not afraid, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For of this many evils grow, because all Offices now adays are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Vicars and Parish-priests; yea, and those foolish and unmeet, oftentimes wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: that seek nothing among the laity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42744:14"/>
but filthy lucre, whereof cometh occasion of evil heresies, and ill christendome in the people.</p>
               <p>Let the canons be rehearsed, which concern the lives of you Fathers, and the honesty of us Priests: which forbid a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-man to meddle in <hi rend="sup">g</hi>

               <p>Above all things, let the canons be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed that appertain to you, my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers and Lord-bishops; laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your <hi>just and</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">b</hi> 
                  <hi>canonical election</hi> in the Chapters of your churches, calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Ghost. For because those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are not obeyed now adays (but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates are chosen oftentimes more by the favour of men, then by the grace of God) hence truly it comes to pass, that we have not seldome Bishops who have little spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality in them; men rather worldly then heavenly, savouring more the spirit of this world, then the spirit of Christ.</p>
               <p>Let the canons be rehearsed of the <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>residence of Bishops in their Diocesses;</hi> which command that they look diligently to the health of souls, that they sow the word of God, that they shew themselves in their Churches, at least on great holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; that they <hi>officiate in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42744:15"/>
and do sacrifice for their people, that they hear the causes and matters of poor men; that they sustain fatherless children and widows, and exercise themselves in works of vertue.</p>
               <p>Let the canons be rehearsed concerning the <hi>right bestowing of the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">p</hi> 
                  <hi>patrimonie of Christ:</hi> the canons which command that the goods of the Church be spent not in costly building, not in sumptuous apparel and pompes, not in feasting and banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not in excess and wantonness, not <hi>in</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">q</hi> 
                  <hi>enriching of kinsfolk,</hi> not in keeping of hounds; but in things profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Church. For when S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine the Monk (once Bishop of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) asked Pope Gregory, how the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Prelates in England should spend their goods, which were the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of faithfull people; the said Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered (and his answer is put into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, cap. 12. <hi>quaest.</hi> 2.) <hi>That the goods of the Bishops ought to be divided into four parts; whereof one part ought to be for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and his houshold, another to his poorer Clergie-men, the third to repair and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42744:15"/>
                  <hi>his tenements, the fourth to poor people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Canons be rehearsed (yea, and that oftentimes) which take away the filthiness and <hi>corruption of your</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">n</hi> 
                  <hi>Courts,</hi> which take away those daily new-found crafts for lucre: which effectually pull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this foul <hi>covetousness,</hi> which is the spring and cause of all the evils that we feel; the fountain of all iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let those canons and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our fore-fathers be renewed, which concern the <hi>celebration of</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Councels;</hi> which appoint Provincial Synods to be oftener used for the Reformation of the Church. Because there never happens any thing more hurtfull to the Church of Christ, then the lack of Councels, both general and provincial.</p>
               <p>When these Canons are rehearsed (and such others as concern us and the <hi rend="sup">s</hi> 
                  <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our manners</hi>) nothing will be lacking, but that the same be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with all authority and power. That once (seeing we have a law) we live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law. For which things,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42744:16"/>
with all due reverence, I call chiefly upon you Fathers (for this execution of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and observing of the constitutions, must needs begin at you) that ye may teach us Priests to follow you, by lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: or else truly it will be said of you, <hi>They lay grievous burdens upon other mens backs, but they themselves will not as much as touch them with their little finger,</hi> Matth. xxiii. 4.</p>
               <p>For indeed if you keep the laws, and first reform your own lives to the rules of the canon-laws, then shall ye give us light (in which we may see what is to be done on our part) that is to say, the light of your good example. And we seeing our Fathers so keep the laws, will gladly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their steps.</p>
               <p>The Clergie and Spiritual men being thus once reformed in the Church, we may then with a just order proceed to the reformation of the <hi rend="sup">t</hi> laities part: which truly will be very easily done if we be first reformed our selves. For the body fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the soul, and such as the Rulers in the city be, such are the inhabitants.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42744:16"/>
Wherefore if Priests that have the charge of souls be good, the people will straight be good too. Our goodness will teach them far more clearly and effectually to be good, then all other teachings and preachings whatsoever: our goodness shall <hi>compell</hi> them into the right way, truly more powerfully, then all your suspensions, excommunications, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if ye will have the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people to live after <hi>your</hi> wish and will, first live you your selves after the <hi>will of God;</hi> and so (trust me) ye shall effect in them whatsoever ye would.</p>
               <p>Ye would be obeyed by them: and 'tis fit ye should (for these are the words of S. Paul to the lay-people, Heb. xiii. 17. <hi>Obey them that have rule over you, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your selves:</hi>) But if you will have this obedience; first do you perform within your selves that which is the reason and cause why they ought to obey you, which the said S. Paul teacheth (and it follows in the text) <hi>viz. Take you heed diligently as those that must give a reckoning for their</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42744:17"/>
                  <hi>souls,</hi> and they will obey you.</p>
               <p>Ye would be honoured of the people: and reason good (for S. Paul writes to Timothy, that the <hi>Priests who rule well are worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and teaching,</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 17.) But if you desire to be honoured, first look that you rule well, and that you labour in word and teaching: and then shall the people have you in <hi>all</hi> honour.</p>
               <p>Ye would reap their carnal things, and gather tithes and offerings without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and it is very fit (for S. Paul wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Romanes, saith, <hi>It is their duty to minister unto you in carnal things,</hi> Rom. XV. 27.) But you ought first to sow your spiritual things, &amp; then ye shall reap plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully their carnal things: For truly that man is very hard and unjust, that will reap where he never did sow, and desires to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where he never scattered.</p>
               <p>Ye would have the Churches libertie, and not be drawn before secular Judges, this also is reasonable (for it is in the Psalms, <hi>Touch not mine anointed,</hi> Psal. CV. 15.) But if ye desire this libertie,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42744:17"/>
first unloose your selves from the worldly bondage, from trucking with the world, and from the vile services of men; and lift up your selves to the true libertie, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual libertie of Christ; place your hearts and affections upon his service which is perfect freedome, serve you God, and reign in him: And then (beleeve me) the people will not touch the anointed of their Lord God.</p>
               <p>Ye would be out of business, in rest and peace; and that is convenient: But if ye would have peace, return to the God of peace and love. Come again to Christ (in whom is true peace, which passeth all understanding) come again to your selves, and to your <hi>priestly</hi> living. And (to make an end) as S. Paul saith, <hi>Be ye reformed by the renewing of your minde, that ye may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the things that be of God, and the peace of God shall be with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I recited to you (Reverend Fathers, and right famous men) the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which I thought fit to be spoke for the reformation of Ecclesiastical affairs. I trust you will take all (out of your gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42744:18"/>
in good part. If peradventure it be thought that I have passed my bounds in this sermon, or have said any thing out of temper, forgive it me; and ye shall forgive a man speaking out of meer zeal, a man <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily</hi> lamenting the decay of the Church: and consider the thing it self, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any foolishness. Consider the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition and state of the Church, and endeavour your selves with all your souls and abilities to reform it.</p>
               <p>Suffer not, Fathers, this your great Convocation to depart in vain; suffer not this your congregation to be for no end. Truly ye are gathered oftentimes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but (by your favour to speak the truth) I see not yet what good cometh of your assembling, namely to the Church.</p>
               <p>Go ye now in the Spirit that ye have called upon, that by the help of it ye may in this your Councel finde out, decree, and ordain those things that may be profitable to the <hi>Church,</hi> a praise unto <hi>You,</hi> and an honour to <hi>God;</hi> unto whom be all honour and glory now and for ever.</p>

There are in the</hi> 25 <hi>Session of it</hi> 21 <hi>chapters concerning Reformation; the first whereof is this:</hi> Optandum est, ut ii qui episcopale ministerium suscipiunt, quae suae sint partes, agnoscant; ac se non ad propria commoda, non ad divitias aut luxum, sed ad labores &amp; solicitudines pro Dei gloria vocatos esse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligant. Nec enim dubitandum est, &amp; fideles reliquos ad religionem innocenti√°mque facili√πs inflammandos. si Praepositos suos viderint non ea quae mundi sunt, sed animarum salutem ac coelestem patriam cogitantes. Haec c√πm ad restituendam Ecclesiasticam disciplinam praecipua esse sancta Synodus animadvertat; admonet Episcopos omnes, ut secum ea saepe meditantes, factis etiam ipsis ac vitae actionibus (quod est veluti perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum quoddam praedicandi genus) se muneri suo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes ostendant. In primis ver√≤ it√† mores suos omnes componant, ut reliqui ab eis frugalitatis, modestiae, continentiae, ac (quae nos tantopere commendat Deo) sanctae humilitatis exempla petere possint. Quapro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, exemplo patrum nostrorum in Concilio Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginensi, non sol√πm jubet, ut Episcopi modest√¢ supelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctili, &amp; mensa, ac frugali victu contenti sint; ver√πm etiam in reliquo vitae genere, ac tot√¢ ejus domo cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, n√® quid appareat, quod √† sancto hoc instituto sit alienum; qu√≥dque non simplicitatem, Dei zelum, ac va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatum contemptum prae se ferat.

When at last the holy Councel of Trent was celebrated, the Fathers coming to debate the amendmentof manners (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it desired to make a perfect reformation in the Universal Church) they were constrained onely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish some things which they beleeved ought to be received in the whole Church; and such things as those times (being so much vitiated and corrupted) would permit. Just as a prudent Physician endeavours wholy to apply himself to the disposition, fansie, and strength of his patient; though perhaps the infirmity may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a stronger cure. ‚ÄîFor though they saw very well, that many things of greater perfection and severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might have been decreed, which some holy men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded yet they desired onely to establish some things that were most necessary, and which they judged to be most convenient, according to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the time, and likely to be most easily received by all men, &amp;c. <hi>See more to the same purpose in the same</hi> memorial, <hi>par.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1, &amp; 2. <hi>and in Parsons description of the person and family of a Bishop, and his relation of</hi> John Davila's <hi>petition to the said Councel,</hi> ibid. <hi>He who desires to read a D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of the Romane Church on this subject, and cannot meet with</hi> Parsons memorial, <hi>may peruse and blush at</hi> Granada's <hi>sermon at the Consecration of a Bishop</hi> (upon Joh. xxi. 15.) <hi>tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 1395. <hi>in his works printed at</hi> Cullein, 1628. <hi>The sayings of Fathers are numerous to this purpose; but I cannot forget one passage of</hi> S.

               <hi>Reformation of the laity]</hi> It seems the laity needed reforming in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Colets days; but how much more they have needed it since, appears by a Sermon preacht by the Bishop of Chichester at S. Pauls Cross March 4. 1576. in the midst whereof are these words: <hi>Good Lord, what devotion was there in the children of darkness</hi> (meaning <hi>papists</hi> in his memory.) <hi>They would go a foot many an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42744:32"/>
miles to a dumb image. They would rise by mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and tarry all the morning in the Church cold and hungry to hear that which they understood not. They gave away their goods and their lands to clothe images. They would eat nothing but bread and water full many a time; and spare from their own belly to bestow it as their zeal led them. I leave them to God, I hope the best.</p>
            <p>But we that have the light of the Gospel (that know true religion, and true faith, and true prayer, and true alms) have little devotion, either to fast, or to do the works of true mercy. We will scarce rise at seven a clock (nay at nine a clock) to hear the word of God, and to serve God; we will not go a mile (nay we will scarce go out of our chambers and houses) to hear Christ preached, and to honour God in his congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Never so little business stayeth us from Sermons and Common-Prayer, &amp;c.</p>

First, that many of us did not spend our Church-means in a Church-like manner, but convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to our own private uses, or otherwise mis-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them: therefore God justly takes them away, and permits sacriledge; we our selves having first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42744:32"/>
in the same kinde. For certainly Church-means should have relation as well to the uses as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and a Church man in mispending them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits sacriledge. And whereas many excuse it in regard of their wives and children, God forbid but regard should be had of them, yet still with moderation. I cannot excuse the excess of Apparel and some other courses of expence. Yet this I must testifie for a truth, that speaking privately with some Bishops, they told me (and I beleeved them) that they layed not up one farthing of their Bishopricks: and this may appear, for many of them died very poor, as <hi>Worcester, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Peterborough, Bristol;</hi> and not unlike but others will do so.</p>
            <p>Another great fault in the Church was the <hi>intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuse of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction;</hi> therefore God hath made us now uncapable of any Jurisdiction. So just and wonderful is he in all his judgements! I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess in mine own particular I did as much desire and labour to reform it as any man could do, yet I could never prevail. Herein a little to excuse the Church, I have it (and can produce it at this time) under the Kings own hand and seal wherein he forbids that any Church man or Priest in holy Orders, should be a Chancellour; and this was the occasion of all the corruption of the spiritual Court: for the Judges at the Common Law have their Pensions and Allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but Chancellours have none at all, they live onely upon the fees of the Court, and for them to dismiss a cause, it was to loose so much bloud. Now if they be naught in themselves, then they must for their own advantage and profit have Instruments and Agents accordingly: so the Registers, Proctours. Apparatours, they were <hi>pessimum genus hominum.</hi> While the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Court was onely governed by Church men and Priests, as it ought to be (and hath ever been so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) they had their spiritual Benefices and Dignities
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42744:33"/>
to live upon, and did scorn the Fees of the Court: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the holiness of the Profession kept them from bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and corruption. Little do men think how much they suffer by this one position, <hi>That Church men should not interpose in Civil and Moral affairs:</hi> Whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Bishops and Church-men onely were trusted with last Wills and Testaments, and granting out Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations. And certainly if there be any honesty among men, it must be supposed to be rather in them then in others; but there having been such an abuse it must be acknowledged that God is most just in all his ways, and what hath befaln us, is according to the deserts of our sins.</p>

                  <p>¬ß. 6. SIR; I lately met your boy in Cheapfide, whom I was very glad to see, chiefly because I thought he had not returned without you. But when he told me that you were not onely not come, but not coming; you cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine into what a dump of sadness I fell from an height of joy. For what can be more trouble some to me, than to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of your most sweet companie? having been so long used to enjoy your most prudent counsel, to be refresht with your most pleasant society, to be rouzed with your most grave sermons, and bettered by your excellent example and life: in a word, in whose very countenance and gesture I was wont to be unspeakably delighted. As me thought I was strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by these things while I had them, so for want of them I seem to languish. And because of late by following you, I had almost got out of the jaws of hell, now again like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Euridice</hi> (yet by a contrary law; for she fell because <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> lookt upon her, but I fall because you do not look upon me) I am carried back by a kinde of force and necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sad darkness. For what is there in this city that should move any body to live well, and not rather (while he is of

I know not how it comes to pass, but methinks the very tops of the houses almost meet sometimes, and take away a good part of the pleasant light; and will not suffer us to look upon heaven freely: so it is not the circumference of the horizon, but the house-top that bounds the air. For which cause I may excuse you the more, if you are not yet weary of the countrey; where you see people dealing plainly, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the knavery of the Citie; where which way soever you turn your eys, the smiling face of the <hi>earth</hi> pleases, the sweet temper of the <hi>air</hi> refresheth, and the goodly aspect of the <hi>heaven</hi> delighteth you.

For he kept himself to one meal a day many years together, both before and after his preferment: which at once cut off all his supper-guests (late dinners not a few) and the more, because his entertainment (though neat) was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther costly nor excessive; his sitting short, and his whole discourse such as pleased none but those that were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned or pious. For soon after he had said grace, his boy read a chapter (distinctly and aloud) out of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, or <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs; from which he himself for the most part pickt the subject of that meals discourse: asking not onely Scholars, but even ordinary

people (if they were ingenuous) what was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this or that passage. And he so ordered his words, that though he were holy and grave, yet he seemed no whit tedious or supercilious. And at the end of the meal, when their hunger (not pleasure) was satisfied, he fell upon another subject: thus dismissing his guests, with as much satisfaction to their minds as refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their bodies, desiring they should depart <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> men then they came, not with bigger bellies.

Now the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had an excellent faculty in such a case (to make every one merry at his table) ordering his discourse according to each mans peculiar temper; so he began to compare our several ages, and then those who sat musing before, fell to chatting; and the unkle (as old men are wont to do) began to brag, that though he were so far stricken in years, he felt no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of his strength. After dinner they two had some discourse betwixt themselves; but what I cannot tell. When <hi>Colet</hi> and I were come back to the boat, he told me that he saw I was an happy man; I answered, that I wondred why he should call me happy, who thought my self the unhappiest person in the world: whereupon he told me, that he had been that day so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his unkle, that he had almost resolved (break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all bonds of Christian modesty, and natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his kinred) to have sued him openly at law: That for this reason he took my <hi>

of each was so far allayed, as that when the Archbishop stepped aside, and they talkt together privately, the whole difference was composed. [<hi>p.</hi> 705.] In a word, <hi>Colet</hi> did daily so endeavour to conquer all his passions, and subdue the haughtiness of his minde by reason, that he would take it well to be admonished even by a childe.</p>

Lasciviousness, sleep, and luxury he chased away by abstaining constantly from supper, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual sobriety, indefatigable study, and holy conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But yet when there was occasion, either to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with fair Ladies, or jest with witty persons, or feast with pleasant, a man might easily perceive some foot-steps of his <hi>nature,</hi> which made him for the most part keep from the society of all lay people; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from banquets, to which when he must needs come, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>monly took with him me or some learned friend, with whom he discoursed in Latine, that he might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void idle talk. His custome was to eat onely of one dish, to content himself with one glass of beer or ale, or two at the most. And though he was delighted with good wine, yet he drank very little of it; always suspecting his own sanguine complexion and inclination, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very wary of all those things, by which he might offend any person whatsoever.</p>
            <p>¬ß. 18. In all my life I never saw a more happy wit; and thence it came that he was exceedingly pleased with such wits as were like himself: but at all times when he might choose his discourse, it was of such things as prepared him for the immortality of a life to come. And when at any time he refresht himself with pleasant stories, he did not fail to make use of his philosophy in them. He was much pleased with the purity and simplicity of nature in little <hi>children</hi> (to the imitation of whom we are called by our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) being wont to compare them to <hi>angels.</hi>

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42744:40"/>
much differed in them from the vulgar. The <hi>Scotists</hi> (of whose acuteness most men have an high conceit) he esteemed heavie fellows, and any thing rather then ingenuous. And yet he had a worse opinion of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> (for what reason I know not) then of <hi>Scotus.</hi> For when I sometimes commended <hi>Thomas</hi> to him as no contemptible authour (among the moderns) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he seemed to have read both Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as I guessed by his <hi>Catena Aurea</hi>) and to have somewhat of affection in his writings; <hi>Colet</hi> seemed not to minde me two or three times, &amp; said nothing.

No man was more a friend to true Christian piety, yet he had little or no kindness for Monks, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should say for those who are now (for the most part falsly) so called: and therefore while he lived he gave them but little, and when he died, nothing. Not that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the profession, but because he saw they did not live according to it. Yet his desire was to have disingaged himself from the world, and betaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a Monastery, if he could any where have found a society that was truly and unanimously resolved upon an Evangelical life. And when I went into <hi>Italy,</hi> he charged me to seek for such an one; telling me that he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42744:40"/>
had found some Monks there, who were really pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and pious: commending also some <hi>Germans,</hi> among whom he thought that the footsteps of the good old Religion did still remain.</p>
            <p>¬ß. 21. Though he lived very chastly himself, yet he had a very charitable opinion of those Priests and Monks, who had no other crime but venery. Not that he did not heartily abhor the sin; but because he found such men far less mischievous then others (if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) who were haughty, envious, backbiters, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, vain, unlearned, wholly given to the getting of money and honour. Yet these had a mighty opinion of themselves, whereas others by acknowledging their infirmity, were made more humble and modest. He said, that to be covetous and proud was more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in a Priest, then to have an hundred concubines: not that he thought incontinence to be a light sin; but covetousness and pride to be at a greater distance from true piety. And he was not more averse to any sort of men, than such Bishops who were wolves in slead of shepherds: and commended themselves by external service of God, ceremonies, benedictions, and indu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to the people; while with all their hearts they served the world, that is, glory and gain. He was not much displeased with them, who would <hi>not</hi> have <hi>images</hi> (either painted or carved, gold or silver) <hi>worshipt in Churches;</hi> nor with them, who doubted whether a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>wicked Priest could consecrate the Sacrament.</hi> Hereby not favouring their errour, but expressing his indignation against such Clergy-men, who by an open bad life gave occasion to this suspicion.</p>
            <p>¬ß. 22, He said, That the Colledges in <hi>England</hi> (which are large and stately) hindergood literature, and are receptacles of idle people: nor did he much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the publick Schools, because there ambition and gain did corrupt the sincerity of all old discipline. As he did much approve of <hi>secret Confession</hi> (professing that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42744:41"/>
he never had so much comfort from any thing as that) so he much condemned anxiety in it, and repetition. Whereas it is the custome in <hi>England,</hi> for Priests to consecrate the host, and receive it almost every day, he was content to sacrifice on Sundays and Holi-days, or some few days beside: either to gain more time for his sacred studies, and fit himself the better for his pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employments, and the business of his Cathedral; or because he found that his devotion had a greater edge, when it was sharpened with intervals. And yet he would not condemn them who were minded to come to the <hi>Lords</hi> table every day. Though he was a very learned man himself, yet he did not prize that anxious and laborious fort of wisdome, which is fully attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by knowledge of several sciences, and reading a multitude of books; saying oft, that the native sound constitution of mens parts, and the sincerity of their wit was lost thereby; and that they rather got a learned sort of madness, then any true incentive to Christian innocence, simplicity, and charity.</p>
            <p>¬ß. 23. He attributed very much to the Epistles of the H. Apostles; but when he compared them w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersull Majestie w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to be found in our <hi>Saviours</hi> own sayings and sermons, he thought them somewhat dry. He had very ingenuously reduced almost all the sayings of Christ to <hi>ternaries,</hi> and intended to write a book of them. He wondred that Romane Priests should be forced to say so many prayers every day; nay, though they are much employed, whether at home or in a journey: but he much approved of the performing divine service magnificently. He dissented from innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable opinions now commonly received in the Schools, in which he would sometimes tell his minde to his friends; but say nothing to others, lest he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>¬ß. 28. Here the King (who was an excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his youth) gave an evident proof of his royal parts; exhorting <hi>Colet</hi> privately, <hi>to go on in his preaching, freely to tax the corrupt manners of that age, and not to withdraw his light in those most dark times; adding, That he knew very well what incensed the Bishops so highly against him, and how much good Colet had done by his divine life, and holy doctrine to the English Church and Nation; lastly, that he would so curb their endeavours, that it should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the world, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>¬ß. 29. But soon after another occasion was offered, by which they hoped to ruine him. For it happened that the King made preparation to march after Easter against the <hi>French:</hi> and upon Good-Friday <hi>Colet</hi> made a sermon to the King and Courtiers, which was much admired, concerning <hi>the Victory of Christ:</hi> Wherein he exhorted all Christians to fight under the banner of their heavenly King, and overcome: saying, That they who either through hatred, or ambition, or covetousnes do fight with evil men, and so kil one another, fight not under the banner of <hi>Christ,</hi> but the <hi>Devil;</hi> shewing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42744:43"/>
withall how hard a thing it is to die like a Christian, how few go forth to battell free from hatred and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness; and how difficult for such to be in charity (without which no man shall see God) who sheath their swords in their brethrens bowels. Adding, that they should rather imitate their King <hi>Christ,</hi> then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Cesars</hi> and <hi>Alexanders.</hi> And he had so many other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> passages to this purpose, that His Majestie was somewhat afraid lest this sermon would dis hearten the souldiers that were listed.</p>
            <p>¬ß. 30. Hereupon all the birds of prey flockt about <hi>Colet</hi> like an owl, hoping the King would be incensed against him. His Majestie commands <hi>Colet</hi> to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> He goes into the garden of the Monastery of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> which was near, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently dismisseth his attendants.

In the mean while <hi>Bricot</hi> (the <hi>Franciscan</hi> Bishop) was in the Court stark wilde, hoping that <hi>Colet</hi> had been in great danger, whereas the King and he agreed in every particular very well. Onely His Majestie wisht, that what <hi>Colet</hi> spoke <hi>truly,</hi> he would speak (sometime or other) more <hi>plainly;</hi> lest the rude souldiers should mis-understand it, as if he had said, <hi>That no war is lawfull among Christians.</hi> And thus <hi>Colet</hi> (by his singular prudence &amp; moderation) not onely satisfied the King, but got farther into his favour.</p>
            <p>¬ß. 31. When they returned from the garden to the Court, the King being about to dismiss <hi>Colet,</hi> called for a cup, and drank to him, embraced him most kindly, and promising him all the favours that could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42744:43"/>
from a most loving Prince, dismissed him. And now the Courtiers standing round the King, expected to know the issue of this long conference; and the King in the hearing of them all, said, <hi>Well, let other men choose what Doctours they please, and make much of them; this man shall be my Doctour.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Bricot,</hi> with the rest of the gaping wolves departed: and from that day forward never dared trouble <hi>Colet</hi> any more; a person that in an high fortune and plenty, was led &amp; governed not by his <hi>nature,</hi> but by <hi>Christ:</hi> in a word, whom I shall not doubt to reckon in the catalogue of my Saints, though he be never canonized by any Pope.</p>
