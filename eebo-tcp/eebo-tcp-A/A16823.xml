         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er. I have (ſaith he) long with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of a good opinion exerciſed it, and with
tryed certainty know it to be uncertainty, and
certaine deceit: It is therefore unworthy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and the name of Art. Reade the Tract
above mentioned, and you ſhall ſee this confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
further amplified. If you pleaſe to take my
confeſſion too, you ſhall have it: I for mine owne
part have been ſo fortunate herein, that I have
ſeldome failed an my predictions of determining
a woman to be with childe by the Vrine, as I
have made them beleeve, when the meſsenger
hath been able to certifie me of the ſtate of the
Womans body, and could anſwer me to certaine
other queſtions touching other ſignes of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Above all the reſt, I was once magnified
by a Counſellors wife for this cunning cozenage
(I am not aſhamed to terme it ſo) at a feſtivall
meeting at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the preſence of two
(as I take it) other Doctours of Phyſicke: She
told them to their faces that I was the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningst
Doctour in all the Towne, for I had told
her by her water that ſhe was with child, and
<pb facs="tcp:15179:4"/>
just how long it was ſince ſhe conceived of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But had the woman ſhew'd me (that brought it)
no more than the Vrine did, I ſhould ſcarce have
adventured to have pronounced her to have been
with childe: Yet I might (knowing the Gentlewoman,
how long it was ſince ſhe had a child, and
the diſtance that ſhe commonly kept in child-bearing,
as alſo that ſhe nurſed her children
her ſelfe) have pronounced her, and that upon
ſome probable conjecture, to have beene with
child, though the meſſenger could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me to ſuch interrogatives (as we uſe to
demand of them before we pronounce a woman
to be with childe) nor the Vrine ſhew (as it doth
not) any thing concerning conception at all. I
dare ſay, that the good Gentlewoman is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that I determined her to be with childe
by the ſight of her Vrine onely, becauſe I did not
intimate any thing to the contrary: Neither
is ſhe to be ſo much blamed for her credulity, as
I for my jugling. But to make her and other
good women amends (whom I have thus beguil'd)
I have in this enſuing Tract ſet downe the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies,
by which I judged her, and every other
Phyſician doth judge every other woman to be
with childe; as alſo, by which we give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Diſeaſe, Sex, and the like, ſeeming
<pb facs="tcp:15179:4"/>
to doe it onely by the Vrine: which have not
heretofore beene publiſhed (though too much
practized of moſt) by any man in the Engliſh
tongue. Doctour <hi>Hart</hi> (in his Booke intituled
<hi>The Anatomie of Urines)</hi> hath by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
argument and demonſtration, confuted the
Piſse-Canons, or Conjectures of Vrines, taken
from the ſeverall accidents of the ſame (as the
ſeverall colours, parts, contents, ſubſtance,
quantity, ſmell) and ſhewed their falſhood in all
theſe, and the many abſurdities that have been
committed by pretending knowledge of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
by all theſe; I thought it likewiſe fit to ſet
downe the fallacies; by which judgement of
Diſeaſes is given by the Vrine, to the end that
the writings of other men (who have written
against this baſe cuſtome of Water-propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
may gaine the more credit, and for the
further ſatisfaction of ſuch as yet remaine
doubtfull whether there be any judgment to
be taken from the Vrine ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the diſeaſe. To this end therefore I have
ſet downe the fallacies which have upheld this
custome of prating, and predicating ſtrange
things by the Vrine: And I have pen'd them in
the Engliſh tongue, becauſe that meere Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen
(I meane the common people) who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb facs="tcp:15179:5"/>
Engliſh only, are and ever have ben moſt
ſubject to be deceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> deluded. I hope
therefore that no Artiſt will be offended hereat,
for I dare ſay that there is no ingenuous man,
but is of mine opinion, and would as gladly (as
I my ſelfe) that this baſe custome, of Lecturing
upon the Vrine, were overthrowne and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
What I have therefore done to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I intreat the courteous Reader to accept
in as good part, as I have been willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the ſame: And for as much as I have
been guilty of this fraud, though I have not
long uſed it, let it ſuffice that it repenteth me
of the ſame, for I meane never hereafter to ſhew
my cunning, or rather cozening, upon the water,
and hope that other men will helpe to beate down
this cuſtome, or elſe all that I have written will
be to little purpoſe. However it will ſome thing
delight the underſtanding and impartiall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and might profit the ignorant, if they

of the ſick partie (though he ſeeme to have named

then he names the diſeaſe, looking upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of a Fever (and indeed one deſcription will
ſerve for any Fever, and for all ſharpe and violent
diſeaſes) is but to reckon up the Symptomes and
ſignes of a Fever (the which we know before that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15179:8"/>

<hi>namely;</hi> great oppreſſion of the ſtomach by choler,

are for the moſt part in every reſpect, but at the

the meſſenger to thinke, that the Doctour doth

of a Fever (as heat, drought, thirſt, paine in the
head, want of ſleepe, oppreſſion of ſtomach, want
of appetite, oppilation of the liver and ſpleene, or
any one of theſe) are not therein to be ſeene,
though it pleaſe his worſhip to play the Anticke

neither am I ſo skilfull a Phyſitian, though I have

deceive the meſſenger; nor ſo honeſt a man as I
am eſteemed, though I carry the matter very faire,
becauſe I doe not ingenuouſly confeſſe to the
meſſenger, and ſo to every body elſe when I ſhall
have occaſion to diſcourſe about it, that there is
no certaine judgement of any diſeaſe by the Urine,
but out of pride pretend knowledge of diſeaſes
by it, and to backe this knowledge bluſh not to
uſe ſuch deceit and fallacies as hereafter follow.
But now to returne to the Urine from the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
and the fool,<note place="margin">The manner of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.</note> the Meſſenger: <hi>This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> if

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15179:10"/>
brought in an Urinall; it is likewiſe red and high
of colour, and that (for the moſt part) be tokeneth
a Fever. I now therefore (before that ever I can
poure the water out of the bottle, or take the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinall
out of the Caſe) rip up all the Symptomes
of a Fever, and ſay, This partie hath a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of ſtomach and no appetite to meat, a
great oppilation and obſtruction of the Liver and
Spleene, is very hot and dry, deſireth much to
drinke, hath a great paine in the head and can
take no reſt, and was taken in the manner of an
Ague with a grooving in the backe and paine in
the head, firſt cold and then hot, reckning up all
theſe things (as if I ſaw them there ſo ſoone as
ever I looke into the water) ſo faſt as ever I can
make my tongue belie my heart. And with this
deſcription I have made the meſſenger admire my
readineſſe and skill in judging of Urines, and he
verily beleeves that I have eſpied theſe things in
the water; but it is farre otherwiſe; for theſe
things (that I have reckoned up) are but the uſuall
Symptomes and companions of a Fever, and the
moſt of them are joyned with every Fever, and all
of them and many moe at once are complicate
with many a Fever. Theſe things being ſo, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but have hit the nayle on the head, for ſome
of thoſe Symptomes that I have reckoned up, muſt
needs accompany the diſeaſe; and when I have
once named them, the meſſenger preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
that the partie is juſt ſo affected as I have
ſaid: But (as yet) I have not named the diſeaſe, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15179:11"/>
perhaps omitted ſomething which is expected
that I ſhould have named: and the meſſenger is
as ready then to aske me if I perceive nothing
elſe by the water, as I was to pronounce my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it before: To whom I anſwere, yes if
you will give me leave to tell you; and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
askes me if I doe not perceive a ſtitch, and
whether the party have not a Pluriſie, I anſwer
(looking upon the water as if it were there to be
perceived) yes I well perceive the ſtitch, and
ſome cough too; and I ſay, that when the cough
takes the partie, the partie is much pained in the
ſide; and for as much as I did not name the ſtitch
at firſt, I tell the meſſenger that we uſe firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the cauſe of the diſeaſe before we come to
every paſſion or affect of the diſeaſe, or before we
name it: I further adde that I was not yet come
to ſpeake of the ſtitch (no nor ſhould never have
found it out of the water, had not the meſſenger
bolted it out) becauſe I had named the cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
namely, the oppreſſion of the ſtomach and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Spleene, and meſentery, and that
the ſtitch was nothing elſe but a flatuous and
windie humour proceeding from thence to the
place affected; ſo now I determine the diſeaſe
to be (as they ſuppoſe) a Pluriſie; And indeed
they can better define their owne diſeaſes by the
Symptomes and paſſions that they ſuffer, than any
Phyſician can doe by the water onely. But now
as I have been happy in my predictions of the
diſeaſe, and rightly determined it to be (as it is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15179:11"/>
indeed) a Pluriſie; ſo now I muſt proceed to the
preſcription (as it is required) of ſuch remedies
as may cure this Pluriſie: And now I am here as
farre to ſeeke (though I know the diſeaſe to be a
Pluriſie) as if I knew not the diſeaſe at all, nor
had ſeen the Urine, becauſe I doe not therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſcope and grounds of preſcribing fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
(according to the rules of Art) in every
reſpect proper to the diſeaſe;<note place="margin">Indication of curing.</note> 
               <hi>The which ſcope</hi> and
grounds are theſe (namely) the parties age, the
ſexe, the conſtitution of the body, and the ſtrength
of it at this time, with divers other accidents, as
whether the party be bound in his body, or have
a flux and ſcouring, or the like: All the which nor
any one of them can be diſcerned by the Urine, &amp;
yet I muſt finde them there if the meſſenger refuſe
to tell me (but that they ſeldome refuſe to doe
after that I have given them a deſcription of the
diſeaſe, and ſhewed them in ſome part how the
partie is affected) or elſe I muſt needs erre in my

the age of the partie) ſuch a quantitie of
blood to be taken away from a young youth (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ten or twelve ounces) in a Plureſie, which is
the diſeaſe in hand, as ſhould be taken from a man
in his full ſtrength, the partie might periſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
or if I ſhould take but foure or five ounces of
bloud from a luſty young man (in this diſeaſe) at
his full ſtrength, I ſhould doe him no good, and ſo
he might periſh on the other ſide: I might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
erre in the doſe, if (not knowing the parties
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15179:12"/>
age) I ſhould preſcribe more or leſſe than were
proportionable to the parties age in preſcribing
purging Potions or Clyſters in this caſe; I might
likewiſe commit no leſſe errour if (not knowing
the ſexe) I ſhould in the forenamed diſeaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
blood-letting to a woman, her naturall
courſes being broke forth upon her; for I might
by that accident expect a ſolution of the diſeaſe
without blood-letting. I might likewiſe erre,
if (knowing the ſexe) I ſhould preſcribe purging
Phyſicke for a woman in this caſe (not knowing
whether ſhe be with child or no) of ſuch a quality
as might cauſe her to miſcarry: I might erre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the conſtitution of the body if I ſhould
(not knowing the ſame) preſcribe that for a
weakly conſtitution of body which were fitter
for a robuſtuous and ſtrong conſtitution: and ſo
on the contrary. I might likewiſe erre if I ſhould
(not knowing the ſtrength of the body at this
time) preſcribe too ſtrong a Potion, or too much
blood to be taken away, when the diſeaſe hath
overcome the ſtrength and the partie is too much
debilitated, or if I ſhould preſcribe too gentle a
potion, or too little blood to be taken away when
the ſtrength is not yet dejected, but ſtands in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
conteſtation with the diſeaſe. I could ſhew
a thouſand wayes more how I could erre, and how
moſt Phyſitians doe erre that preſcribe Phyſicke

all theſe things by the Urine (as thou thinkſt I do)
namely the diſeaſe, the parties age, ſexe, ſtrength,
conſtitution of body, and the like: I have therfore
digreſſed herein from my purpoſe (ſince my intent
was not to ſhew the errors that are committed by
ſuch as pretend knowledge of diſeaſes by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
but to ſhew the fallacies and jugling that they
uſe in giving judgment of it) and ſo fruſtrated thy
expectation of this dainty Art; but I hope it ſhall
be to thy profit, for thou ſhalt hereby be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to give thy Phyſitian ſuch inſtructions as
he ſhall require, and ſhalt perceive the danger of
taking Phyſick preſcribed by the ſight of the Urine
only: And now to the purpoſe indeed; but firſt
imagine with me, that the laſt meſſenger, having
received good ſatisfaction by the deſcription of
the parties diſeaſe for whom he came, was ready
to certifie me of all the forenamed circumſtances
that were requiſite for me to inquire of, as the
parties age, ſexe, conſtitution of body, preſent
ſtrength, how long the partie had been ſicke, &amp;c.
And I have ſent him away with<note place="margin">Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a Pleuriſie.</note> 
               <hi>ſuch remedies</hi> as
were moſt proper for his Pleuriſie, directions for

Phyſick to eaſe his cough, with a Liniment to
mollifie, and to diſpell wind, to anoynt his ſide
withall for his ſtitch, and wiſh him to repaire unto
me again within a day or two to certifie me of the
ſucceſſe of the Phyſicke, and how the partie ſtands
now affected, that if need require, I may ſupply
him with further adviſe. Now in all this (I hope)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15179:13"/>
I have not erred, ſave only that I forgot to tell the
meſſenger that the partie was very dangerouſly
ſicke, and would hardly recover, but yet I have
preſcribed him the beſt meanes that can, by the art
of man, be for his recoverie, and I pray God to give
his bleſſing, and ſo I have quite diſpatched this
meſſenger. And now whether the partie live or
dye I ſhall be ſure to be magnified for my skill; if
he die, for that my predictions prove true; and if
he live, for that I recovered him of ſo dangerous
a diſeaſe. And now I am ready to encounter with
the next meſſenger, who likewiſe brings me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Urine of an high red colour, in giving judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon which I will plainely ſhew how a man
may give judgement of all other ſharpe and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
diſeaſes by the water (though it doe not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
ſhew any Symptomes of any diſeaſe, which
determine the ſame) and how thou ſhalt get out of
the meſſenger every circumſtance neceſſary to the
judging and determining of a diſeaſe, as the age,
ſexe, and ſtrength of the partie, and to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a man in preſcribing of fit remedies, and
yet he ſhall not perceive but that thou findeſt
them in the Urine; <hi>Sed hoc est decipere, non judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care;</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>SUppoſe this next meſſenger to be ſome
Nurſe or tender of ſick perſons, who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
verſed, and accuſtomed in carrying
ſick folks Urines unto Phyſicians; and ſhe ſalute
me, with Maſter Doctor, I have brought you a
Water, and deſire your opinion of it: and now I
am like to have a hard taske of it, and to be ſo
put to my trumps, that (if I play not my cards ſure)
I ſhall loſe the ſet, miſcarry in my judgement, be
accounted a dunce, and loſe my patient for ever;
but I will be aware of that, I warrant you. I now
therefore take this carfty wench to doe,<note place="margin">How crafty meſſengers may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> and I will
handle her as craftily; <hi>I take the Vrinall</hi> of her, and
bid her come from the doore of my Parlour, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15179:14"/>
or Chamber (where they commonly ſtand,)
unto the window, or light, where I commonly
give my oracle; and indeed, a man had need of
a good light, and a better ſight, that ſhall perceive
all theſe things that I muſt find out of this Urine.
Being come to the light (as I am uncafing the
Urinall to looke upon it,) I aske the Nurſe a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
not whoſe water it is (for that ſhe is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
any conjured, not to tell me, eſpecially if
it be a womans, nor any thing elſe, unleſſe I firſt
find it out of the water) but my queſtion is; How
long the party hath beene ſick; And ſhe out of
modeſty and good manners, can doe no leſſe but
anſwer me to this queſtion, for ſhe thinkes this
queſtion to be but words of courſe, and that I
can gather nothing from hence touching the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
diſeaſe; and ſo ſhe anſweres me a weeke, a
forthnight, two or three dayes, or more or leſſe.
But from hence I collect and have ſtrong preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
that it is an acute diſeaſe; and if ſhe ſay,
A forthnight, I ſhall thinke it to be only an acute
diſeaſe and of the leſſe danger, unleſſe there have
another Phyſician beene imployed already, the
which I ſhall be ſure to know, and if there have,
I ſhall go neere to ſtrike his noſe out of joynt, and
gaine the patient to my ſelfe, and then (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him) I ſhall get immortall fame; but if he
chance to die, I will make a ſhift to ſhuffle off the
diſgrace upon my brother Doctor, for that (as I
will ſay) ſuch and ſuch meanes were not uſed at
the firſt, though haply he have uſed as good a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15179:14"/>
thode as my ſelfe could have done: But if ſhe ſay
that the party hath beene ſick a weeke, I ſhall
thinke it is a more acute diſeaſe, whether there
have another Phyſician beene imployed or no.
But if ſhe ſay three or foure dayes, I then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that it is a moſt ſharpe diſeaſe, and now I
will ſo plant and intereſt my ſelfe in the party,
as that I will prevent anothers comming there,
unleſſe it be to a perſon of quality, and then I will
be as ready to deſire another Phyſician to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as the ſick party ſhall be to requeſt it, not ſo
much that I deſire his aide, or would have him
partake with me in the booty, as in the diſgrace, if
the party ſhould chance to die. And now I know
(by this queſtion, as alſo the Water, being high
and red, witneſſing the ſame) that it is an Acute
diſeaſe: <hi>And now I take</hi> the Urinall in my hand,
and hold it up to the light, and (looking very little
upon it) I ſhake it together, and ſet it downe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
artificially in the window aſloop, as if I meant
to inquire further of it anone, and that it muſt
ſtand ſo a while; and indeed it muſt ſtand ſo a
while, and I muſt looke but lightly upon it at
firſt, or elſe I ſhall not have ſo good an evaſion if
I erre never ſo litle, nor ſo fit an opportunity to
propound another queſtion to the ſetting me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the pronoucing of my opinion, or to the
inquiry of ſome other circumſtance (neceſſary to
the guiding me in preſcribing fit remedies) as the
parties Age, Sexe, Strength, and the like, for this
wench will be ſure to hold me to my text. And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15179:15"/>
now go along with me ſtill, and conceive with me
that it is aſharp diſeaſe (as appeareth by her anſwer)
and that I have no ſooner asked her how long the
party hath beene ſick, and ſet downe the Urinall
in the window (as I ſaid before) but that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſay, This party hath a great oppreſſion of
Stomach, no appetite to meate, with a great oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Liver and Spleene, is very hot, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
much to drinke, hath a great paine in the
head, and can take no reſt, and was taken in the
manner of an Ague (as they call it) with a groo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the backe, and paine in the head, firſt cold
and then hot, as I ſaid in giving my judgement
upon the laſt Urine; and indeed this deſcription
will ſerve for any acute diſeaſe, whether it be
the Pleuriſie, the ſmall Pox or Maiſels, a fit of
the ſtone in the Kidneis, the Squinancy, Phrenſie,
Iliaca Paſſio, the Arthritis, or what other ſharp
diſeaſe ſoever,<note place="margin">Why unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in judging is not to be uſed.</note> wherewith there is a Fever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
complicate, or whether it be a ſimple Fever
which is primarily the diſeaſe it ſelfe; but yet I
will not alwayes uſe the ſame deſcription to all
commers, becauſe divers meſſengers may come
to a Phyſician, and may ſtay for companies ſake
to goe away together, and might fall to queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with each other what the Doctour ſaid unto
them, and ſo might thinke (if I ſhould uſe the
ſame deſcription unto them all) that I could ſay
nothing elſe. I therefore vary my deſcription of
the diſeaſe, and am ſometimes ſhorter in the ſame,
and then (if I find by expoſtulation with the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15179:15"/>
that I have omitted any thing that I ſhould
have ſpoken of) I ſay that it proceeded from ſuch
a cauſe as I had already named, and that I ſhould
have come to ſpeake of that anon; I am ſometimes
likewiſe larger in my deſcription, as I am here in
relating how the party is affected, for whom this
Nurſe comes: and ſhe is as ready to take me up
for the ſame, and ſayes, that it is true indeed, that
the party can take no reſt, hath no appetite to
meate, and was taken (as I ſaid) in the manner of
an Ague, but complaines not of her ſtomach at
all, but cries out, My head, my head, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
altogether of want of reſt; To whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that the paine in the head is the chiefe of the
paſſions that the party is affected withall, but yet
that it proceeded from the oppreſſion of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and oppilation of the Liver and Spleene,
which being obſtructed, ſend a cholericke fume
unto the braine, which infiame the Animall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and cauſe this paine which hindred reſt, and
that (if reſt were not cauſed) it would make the
party rave, be franticke, and burſt forth into
ſenſeleſſe, and idle talke. Thus having anſwered
this objection, I now begin to touch the Urinall,
to ſee if it have ſetled enough, but finding it not
to have ſetled enough to my purpoſe, and to ſhew
me thoſe things that I muſt finde out of it, I ſet it
downe againe very tenderly, ſaying, it muſt yet
ſettle alittle better; and then I fall to queſtioning
with the Nurſe concerning ſomething that may
ſhew me the ſexe, for I muſt find that out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15179:16"/>
too; And now I aske her, what the party uſeth
to doe in the time of health, and this is a queſtion
that may (ſhe thinkes) as well be anſwered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving me any light of the ſexe, as the former
queſtion (which was, How long the party had
beene ſicke) of giving me any light of the diſeaſe;
but you ſhall heare what I collect from thence.
She anſwers, I demanding what the party uſeth
to do, that the party uſeth to do little, ſave onely
to goe up and downe the houſe, to worke about
the houſe, to walke up and downe abroad, to
keepe a ſhop, to labour, or the like; and from all
theſe I have my ſeverall collections. Now if ſhe
ſay, that the party uſeth to doe little, ſave onely
to goe up and downe the houſe, I preſume that it
is the Miſtreſſes of the houſe, or the good-wifes,
or one of their daughters, or ſome Gentlewoman
in the houſe, but for certaine, that it is a womans
water, or a maides, for they ſhould, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
doe (if their ſhooes be not made of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
leather) keepe their houſe, and their worke
is to walke up and down the houſe; but if ſhe ſay,
the party uſeth to doe ſuch worke as is to be done
in or about the houſe, it is moſt likely that it is a
maid-ſervant, but if ſhe ſay to walke abroad, I
then preſume that it is a mans water, and that it
may be the Maſter of the houſe, or his ſonnes, or
ſome other Gentlemans, whoſe worke and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
is onely to walke abroad and take his
pleaſure; but if ſhe ſay, to keepe a ſhop, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to be the Maſters thereof, or an he Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15179:16"/>
his; or if ſhe ſay, that the party uſeth to
labour, I imagine it to be a man-ſervant, or ſome
hired labouring mans; ſo by her anſwer to this
queſtion, namely, what the party uſeth to doe in
the time of health, I diſcerne the ſexe. And now
I take the Urinall againe in my hand (for by this
time it hath ſtood long enough to ſettle) and now
I ſay that it is a womans water, ſuppoſe that her
anſwer to my queſtion (What the party uſed to
doe in the time of health) did inferre as much,
that ſhe hath a burning Fever, is ſo dangerouſly
ſicke that ſhe will hardly recover, unleſſe ſuch and
ſuch ſpeedy meanes be uſed, and yet that All will
ſcarce doe; and this danger I will alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in every Violent diſeaſe, though there be no
deadly ſigne at all; but not to the ſicke parties
(for that they cannot indure to heare of) but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
to the meſſenger, or ſome neere friend, or
by-ſtander, if I be preſent with them; and then if
the party live. I ſhall not ſo much as have my
judgement called in queſtion, for ſaying the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would die, but be magnified for that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
her of a dangerous diſeaſe; nay, to be ſure
to be happy in my predictions and prognoſticks
concerning the life and death of my Patients (for
they muſt alwayes have a hint of that, although
the thought of death be an unwelcome gueſt) I
will deliver mine opinion both wayes; I will
threaten, or rather pretend the danger of death to
the ſicke party (if my opinion be deſired,) with a
But if ſuch and ſuch meanes be uſed, you may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15179:17"/>
haply recover: and to ſome by-ſtander or hanger
on, I will ſecretly whiſper that there is no danger
at all: or elſe I will promiſe life to the Patient,
which is altogether wiſhed, and threaten death
to ſome other inquiſitour: and thus was a learned
Doctour in Phyſicke over-matched by a meaner
Practicant in Phyſicke, at Aſhford in Kent who
uſed this policy in his prognoſticks. I have for
mine owne part and office, herein delivered my
ſelfe well enough to this Nurſe in my progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
concerning the event of the womans ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
for whom ſhe is come: I have told her how
the woman is affected, what the diſeaſe is, and
what will be the event; and the Nurſe is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
well ſatisfied herewith, but yet I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſomething, that ſhe will be ſure to tell me of,
for ſince ſhe hath undertaken the matter, ſhe will
not goe without her errand. So, now ſhe asks me
if I perceive nothing elſe by the water, and I
imagine well enough what it is elſe that I ſhould
perceive by it, for when that queſtion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
it is to know whether the woman be
with child or no: to whom I anſwer, that there
are many moe things to be perceived by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(but not at all times) as whether a woman
were with child or no, which is that you looke
for; but it is no now to be ſeene in this water,
becauſe her body is all out of temper, and her
water troubled and diſcoloured, but yet I thinke
her to be, and well I may, if ſhe her ſelfe thinke
ſo; I further tell her, that I could have certainely
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15179:17"/>
told, (but yet I lie,) if ſhe had brought her water
in the time of her health: and ſo ſhe is ſatisfied for
that matter, and confeſſeth that ſhe is with child
indeed. Having thus ſatisfied her in all theſe
things, told her that it is a womans water, in what
manner ſhe was ſicke, what was her diſeaſe, that
it was likely that ſhe was with child (which proves
true) and that ſhe would ſcarce recover (which is
no great matter whether ſhe doe or no) I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to cloſe with her, and aske her whoſe water it
is; but ſhe will not tell me, and commend her
for it, for ſhe was forbid, and therefore hath vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the contrary; and indeed ſhe was ſent onely to
heare mine opinion of the water, the which, if ſhe
like, ſhall haply heare further from the party, but
if not, ſhe hath order to goe to another Piſſe-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and ſo if ſhe like not his opinion neither,
from him to another, untill ſhe come to him that
hits the diſeaſe righteſt (as ſhe conceives) by the
water, and he (I dare ſay, the moſt foole and
knave of all the three) is the man that ſhall be
made choiſe of to cure this woman; and this is
thought great policy in making choice of an able
Phyſician. It behooves me therefore to be my
crafts maſter in this Art, for elſe you ſee here how
I am like to be noſed of a Patient, and to have my
skill call'd in queſtion; for (if I cannot finde the
diſeaſe by the water) they will ſoone conclude
that I know not how to cure it. This Nurſe tells
me indeed (but if ſhe had not told me, I ſhould
have perceived it) that ſhe came to heare mine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15179:18"/>
opinion of the water, and that the ſicke party
would ſend to me againe, when ſhe had heard (ſhe
ſhould have ſaid, If ſhe liked it) what was mine
opinion, and I thinke I have fitted her, and now
tell the Nurſe, that it had been fitter they had ſent
for ſome preſent remedies, than to know the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
or to heare mine opinion of it, ſo I haſt her
away with her oracle, bid her be ſure to deliver it
ſo as I had told her, and tell (but not to the ſicke
party) to ſome of her neere friends, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
ſhe is ſicke, and that I would (if ſhe thinke
good to make uſe of me) uſe the beſt meanes to
recover her that Art could lead me unto; and now
I bid her make all the haſt that may be, but yet
(before I let her goe) I thus beſpeake her; in faith
Nurſe, I commend thee that thou wilt doe thy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
handſomely, and make a Phyſician finde the
diſeaſe out of the water, and not be gull'd (to tell
how the party was affected) as many a foole
would have done, but I hope I have ſhewed thee
truly how the party is affected, and what is her
diſeaſe, and given thee ſuch ſatisfaction as will
content them that ſent thee: loe therefore here is
for thy paines, becauſe thou haſt put me to it ſo
handſomely, and ſo I give her, (fearing leſt I
ſhould have erred, that ſhe may maintaine my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and in hope of receiving a better fee, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent for) the crackd groat, or the Harry groat
that was ſent in ſtead of ſixe pence, for caſting this
water; nay, if it chance to be ſixe pence indeed,
ſhe ſhall have it all, and ſo I ſhall be ſure to have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15179:18"/>
my meſſage well done, and perhaps ſhe will tell
me that which ſhe denied before; but if not, ſhe
will magnifie me for my skill, and I ſhall be ſure to
heare further from the party, and have the caſting
of all the waters that ſhe can bring me; ſo I now
ſend her away and laugh at her, and the Devill at
us both: I laugh at her becauſe I have cozend her,
and the Devill, that he hath cozend us both, by
making her to believe that I diſcerne all thoſe
things by the water that I told her, and making
me to back my pretended knowledge by ſuch fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies.
But doe not now imagine that I have been
ſo long in hand with this Nurſe, in giving judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Urine, as I have been in penning the
circumſtances with the ſeverall actions and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures

give his judgement of any ſharpe diſeaſe by the
water, (though it be not there to be ſeene,) in
pronouncing my judgement upon this laſt Urine,

marke therefore the deſcription that I gave
to the Nurſe of the laſt diſeaſe, which I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be a Fever, after that I perceived by the

how long the party had been ſicke) that it was a
ſharpe diſeaſe;<note place="margin">The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of a ſharpe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> 
               <hi>now my deſcription was this;</hi> that
the party had a great oppreſſion of ſtomach and
no appetite to meate, a great oppilation of the
Liver and Spleene, was very hot, deſired much
to drinke, had a great paine in the head, and
could take no reſt, and was taken in the manner
of an Ague with a paine in the head, and groo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the backe, firſt cold and then hot, the
which deſcription may ſerve for any ſharpe diſeaſe
in giving judgement of a water; yet I doe not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that in every ſharpe diſeaſe the party is juſt
thus affected in every reſpect, but for the moſt
part, for if it chance to faile and be excepted
againſt, I have ſhewed, how to make it good to
the meſſenger, and to ſerve the turne to ſatisfie
him, and not the Phyſician and practicant in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.
Marke further, that in deſcribing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
and ſhewing how the party is affected, I
doe not yet define, determine, or name the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
till I have expoſtulated with the meſſenger
ſo farre, that I perceive the diſeaſe from thence,
and have ſounded enough out of him, to tell him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15179:19"/>
any thing that he ſhall deſire to know of me; and
then I determine the diſeaſe to be (as the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
when I have ſtrictly examined them, ſhall
agree with the meſſengers relation.) A Fever,
the ſmall Pox, or Maiſels, a Pleuriſie, or the like,
looking ſtill upon the Urine, as if I found it there,

which helpe me out, or elſe Dun might have
ſtucke full faſt in the mire. I hope alſo, that you
perceive how eaſily a man may give his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <argument>
               <p>The rude ſimplicity of ſuch as ſend their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Phyſician without any inſtructions how
the party is affected: And the desperate haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
that they put their lives in, who adventure
to take Phyſicke preſcribed only by the ſight of the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOw this meſſenger is as rough-hewed as
he that ſent him and is a very plain fellow
in his holy-day Jacket and his busking
Hoſe; he was call'd from making of Faggots, or
from thraſhing, to goe to the Doctour and carry
this Piſſe that is put up in the Vinegar bottle, and
brought to me to judge of; and it is a very turbid
water of a very high, darke, red colour, by which
as alſo by the meſſenger, (for I can better tell, by
the meſſenger, his geſture, time of comming, haſte
to be gone, and other circumſtances, what the
partie ayleth, how long he hath beene ſicke, and
whether it be a mans or womans water, than I or
any Phyſician can doe by the Urine, eſpecially if I
lived in a Towne or Citie where I had much
Country practice) I conceive it to be ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
Farmers, his ſonnes, or mans, his <hi>Hubber de
hoy</hi> which is his man-boy, or halfe a man and halfe
a boy: But which of them ſoever it be, hee hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15179:20"/>
borne it out with head and ſhoulders (for ſo your
Country people uſe to doe before they ſend to a
Doctour) and wraſtled ſo long with the diſeaſe,
and been ſo often foyled out, for they doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the orders in <hi>Moore</hi> or <hi>Lincolns-Inne fields,</hi>
where if a man be three times foyled out, it is to
ſtand for a fall, and he is to wraſtle no more for
that time, as that he can no longer ſtand, and yet
he is to have one bout more with the diſeaſe who
hath a cruell ſecond in this Duell, even death it
ſelfe: And now (if nature be not aſſiſted by Art)
this fellow, whoſe ſecond I muſt be, is like to be
put to the worſt, and the diſeaſe is like to give
him a flat fall upon his backe in his Grave, never
to riſe againe untill the reſurrection. Therefore
if I have any skill, I muſt ſhew it now or never: I
now therefore take the water to examine it, and
thinke to queſtion with this meſſenger (as with
the former) How long the partie hath been ſicke,
whoſe water it was, and to put him ſuch other
queſtions as might ſhew me ſuch other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which might ſhew mee the diſeaſe, and
guide me in the preſcribing fit remedies for the
ſame; but he cannot anſwer mee one queſtion,
not whoſe water it is, nor how long the party hath
been ſicke, no nor whether it be a mans or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
water; much leſſe the conſtitution of the
body, the preſent ſtrength of it at this time, or
whether the partie be bound or looſe in his body,
with divers other ſuch circumſtances, all the
which are ſo neceſſary for me to know, as that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15179:21"/>
without the knowledge thereof I cannot ſafely
preſcribe any Phyſicke, and yet this fellow can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell me one word, for he ſaith that he was not
told, but was onely hired to bring me the water,
and to bid me ſend ſomething to help the partie,
and hath brought eighteene pence or two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with him to pay for that which I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
or ſend; and all that he can ſay, is, that ſuch
a mans ſervant came to him to get him to come,
but did not tell him whoſe water it was, nor how
long the partie had beene ſicke. And now what,
on Gods Name, ſhall I doe in this caſe, for it is
preſumed that I know the diſeaſe by the water,
and all other circumſtances belonging to the
ſame, which are requiſite for to guide me in the
preſcribing of fit remedies, and I have pretended
as much, and holpen to nurſe up folkes in this
folly, (as other Phyſicians have done before mee)
by giving my judgement of diſeaſes by the ſight
of the Urine, and backing my pretended know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by ſuch fallacies as I have ſpoken of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which neither I nor any Phyſician in the
world can give any judgement of a diſeaſe, nor
come to the knowledge of ſuch circumſtances
(unleſſe the meſſenger, that brings it, tell us) as
may guide us in the preſcribing of ſafe medicines
every way proper unto the diſeaſe. I muſt tell you
therefore (for mine own part) that I have already,
and doe for ever hereafter meane to ſteere a new
courſe; yet I muſt, for this one time, preſcribe
for this fellow, who (being all this while out of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15179:21"/>
breath with his laſt Arthleticke combate, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
caught ſuch a wrinch, (though he played
ſtrong play, as that he will goe neere to fall the
next bout) is expected to enter the ſands, to revive
the quarrell, and to undertake the laſt encounter.
I now therefore take the Urinall (ſince the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
can tell me nothing) and looke better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water, as if I could tell miracles by it, for
I muſt now make all the haſte that may be to ſet
him on foot,<note place="margin">What is to be done, when no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can be had from the meſſenger.</note> ſince he is ſo earneſtly expected by
his adverſarie: Now looking <hi>upon the water,</hi> I
perceive it to be very craſſe, thicke, and turbid, in
all places alike, of an intenſe, high, darke, red
colour; and from thence I conceive, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fopperous Piſſe-maximes, and rules
of our great Piſſe-prognoſticatours, there is a
great commixture of ſuperabundant humours,
which the ſubſtance of it (as they ſay) being
craſſe, thicke, and turbid, ſheweth; and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not yet able to concoct theſe humours, for
then there would be ſome ſeparation in the Urine,
and it would not be in all places alike, but would
have ſediment in the bottome, and be tranſparent
in the upper part; I conceive alſo that he hath a
great Fever, for that the colour ſheweth, being
red and high, and that there is great danger, for
it is of an high darke red colour, tending to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But yet I cannot tell what manner of Fever
it is, for I cannot diſcerne by the Urine (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people ſuppoſe) the paſſions and affects of
the ſicke party, that determine the diſeaſe, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15179:22"/>
ſhould guide me in the preſcribing fit remedies,
and therefore I cannot tell whether it be beſt to
let him blood, to give hive him a purging potion,
or Clyſter, or whether his body would now beare
any of theſe, or whether I were beſt to give him
ſomething to make him ſleepe, or ſome cooling
Juleb, or ſome Cordiall Antidote to expell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
humours from the vitall parts; now which of
theſe methods I ſhall beſt uſe (for the meſſenger
can tell me nothing) I know not, but however
the matter is not great, for the party ventureth
but his life, and why ſhuld not I adventure my
skill againſt it? I now therefore pronounce the
party to be ſicke of a baſtard Pleuriſie (for, it is no
matter what I ſay to this meſſenger,) or a Fever,
and that the party would hardly recover, further
adding, that hee ſhould have beene let blood a
weeke agoe, and that I feared it would now be
too late, but yet I wiſh it to be done, for if any
thing in the world recover him, it muſt be that;
and if that do it, it is but Hab, Nab, but yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I muſt put it in practice; ſo now I haſt away
the meſſenger to get a Chirurgion to let him
blood; and tell him where, and in what quantity
it muſt be done, and now it is a queſtion whether
the diſeaſe, or the life be let out by this blood-letting:
if blood offending in quantity, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
blood (offending in quality) putrified by chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in the leſſer veines, be let out, the diſeaſe may
chance to be let out with it, and ſo <hi>Mors</hi> or
Death may tarry for a ſacrifice, till ſome other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15179:22"/>
ſickneſſe take him upon more advantage. But if
the good blood, ſeeming to be inflamed, be let
out, when this Fever proceedeth from choller in
the greater veins, or from Flegme, or other mixt
humours in the ſtomach, Spleene, or Meſentery,
which ought to be purged, the life (inſteed of the
diſeaſe) may be let out, by loſſe whereof the debt
to God and Nature would be paid. But haply (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed
of blood-letting, I preſcribe at randome,
(for ſo I muſt doe in either) ſome purging Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo ſet the diſeaſe and a medicine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the eares &amp; leave the ſucceſſe to fortune.
And now whether the party live or die, I care not:
for if he die, I have taught them to blame their
owne negligence, in not ſending any ſooner; but
if Nature be of ſuch for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, that ſhe be able to
withſtand the conflict betweene the diſeaſe and
the Antidote, and ſtart up, and take part with
the Medicine, ſo that the party recover, I ſhall
have more attributed unto me, (as the onely
cauſe of his recovery) than I have deſerved, or
than to God, who in his providence, had beene
pleaſed (by the worke of Nature, more than by
any skill of mine) to ſpare and recover him: and
thus you uſe to over-value the meanes, whereby
(as you ſuppoſe) you have beene recovered, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
uſed ſo deſperatly (as I have preſcribed
for this fellow) by a methodicall Phyſician, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
knowledge of diſeaſes by the Urine, or
uſed quite contrary to the rules of Art, by ſome
rude Empiricke and Quack-ſalving knave, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15179:23"/>
if you chance to recover; and to under-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the beſt meanes in the world, uſed by the moſt
grave and learned Phyſician, if the party chance
to die: never ſatisfying your ſelves, when things
are ſo come to paſſe, that it was Gods providence,
ſaying, <hi>(ſic placuit Domino,)</hi> it was Gods will
it ſhould be ſo, and ſo reſting your ſelves conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but ſtill tormenting your ſelves further, in
thinking that this child, that friend, this brother,
or that ſiſter might have beene recovered, if the
beſt meanes had beene uſed, as if God would not
have directed thee unto that meanes, had it not
beene his will now to take this party unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
And now, I hope that you perceive by theſe
few inſtances, how a man may deceive the wiſeſt
meſſenger that you can ſend unto a Phyſician with
a water, and ſhew you the diſeaſe by the ſame,
although it be not there to be found, and how
great danger they put their lives in, that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to take Phyſicke preſcribed by the ſight of
the Urine only: and ſo I have done with all ſharp
and violent diſeaſes, and am now comming to
ſpeake of Chronicall, lingring, and diſeaſes of
continuance, wherein I meane to ſhew you how
to give judgement of them by the water, though
in thoſe diſeaſes, it ſhew leſſe than in ſharpe and
violent diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>A Recapitulation of thoſe things which have beene

            </argument>
            <p>AND now, whereas I ſhew'd you (before
that I came to inſtance and ſhew my cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in giving judgement upon Urines in
violent diſeaſes) that diſeaſes are either ſharpe
and violent, (the which I have ſpoke of) or Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
and of continuance, ſuch as I am now to
ſpeake of next; and that, in ſharp diſeaſes, the
Urine is for the moſt part of an high red colour,
and that there is a Fever alwayes joyned with
every ſharpe diſeaſe; ſo I ſhewed you that one
may give a deſcription how any ſicke party is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in any violent diſeaſe, by rekoning up the
common Symptomes and companions of a Fever
(which are oppreſſion of ſtomach, want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
Heate, Thirſt, Paine in the head, want of
ſleep, &amp;c.) and make the meſſenger believe that
I perceive the diſeaſe by the water, becauſe I ſhew
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15179:24"/>
how the party is in ſome kind affected, the which
neither I, nor any Phyſician in the world can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in, or by water, but gather by conſequence,
when we once conceive that it is a violent diſeaſe;
for then we know that there is a Fever joyned, and
that there are ſome of thoſe Symptomes (that I
named) joyned with it, but yet I doe not know
what kind of Fever it is, nor what violent diſeaſe
it is (and therefore I doe not name or determine
it) untill I have expoſtulated with the meſſenger,
in ſuch manner as I have already ſhew'd, and
thereby come to the knowledge of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall
note, or difference, which determine the
ſame.</p>
            <p>I muſt now likewiſe give you to underſtand
(before that I come to examine ſome few Urines,
to ſhew you how I give my judgement of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
diſeaſes) that in Chronicall diſeaſes (ſuch as
are the Drop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, Gout, Palſey, Falling ſickneſſe,
Scurvey, French Pox, Green ſickneſſe, Malacie,
which is the diſeaſe of women newly conceived
with childe, Cough, Head-ach, Mother, and ſuch
like) the Urine is no way faulty, but repreſenteth
the Urine of healthfull; nay, oftentimes the moſt
healthfull men in the world: And yet the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
(ſuch a Urine being brought unto him) muſt
ſentence the partie that made it, to be ſicke, upon
no other proofe but onely this lying ſtrumpet, and
falſe witneſſe (the Urine) ſuborned by the begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and ſo ſelfe-conceited vulgar, and connived at
by the Piſſe-Juſtice or Judge, before whom ſhee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15179:24"/>
is brought, who is corrupted for a teſtar, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for more and ſometimes for leſſe, and is
contented to accept of her evidence for truth,
when he knowes it to be a palpable lye that ſhee
comes to affirme. She is indeed the dumbe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
betweene the Doctour and his Patient,
who (inſtead of paſſing the relation of his diſeaſe
in writing, or by ſome diſcreet meſſenger) piſſeth
his minde in his water, and expecteth an anſwer;
but if I ſhould write him an anſwer in a letter
written in the ſame language, I doubt he would
ſcarce read it. How then ſhall I doe, who muſt
anſwer his expectation, ſince the Urine in this
caſe ſheweth no diſeaſe at all? Or what oracle
ſhall I give? Shall I ſay (ſuch a water being
brought unto me) I doe not perceive by this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the partie that made it is ſicke, or ayleth
any thing: farre be it from me for thinking ſo:
If I ſhould returne ſuch an honeſt plaine-dealing
anſwer, both the meſſenger and he that ſent him
would perceive me to be diſeaſed in my braine,
without the caſting of my water, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſay that I were troubled with the ſimples:
For why (would they ſay) have I ſent or brought
this Urine if the partie be not ſicke? Is not this a
wiſe Doctour that cannot tell the Diſeaſe by the
water? This Doctour ſhall give me no Phyſicke,
for I have gone to ſuch a Doctour (Rogue or
Knave you might call him) that hath told me my
diſeaſe directly by the water, and he ſhall be my
Doctour; and (for me) ſo let him: And thus you
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15179:25"/>
grumble at your Doctour, if he honeſtly tell you
that the Urine doth not certainly ſhew any diſeaſe,
and begin to examine whoſe water it is, and how
the partie is affected, as alſo the age, ſexe, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of body, the preſent ſtrength of it, and ſuch
other circumſtances as ſhould ſhew him (he not
ſeeing the partie) the diſeaſe, and guide him in
the preſcribing fit remedies, you preſently ſuſpect
him of ignorance, and thinke that he ſhould tell
you theſe things by the Urine. And thus was I
lately taxed by a Goſſip at <hi>Eaſt Greensted</hi> in <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>
(where I lived and began my practice) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I was ſtrict in examining the ſtate of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
that I might not erre in preſcribing her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to give her eaſe of that which ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of; for it was very ſuſpitious that ſhee
was with child, and ſhe pretended that ſhe deſired
to take ſomething by my preſcription, but becauſe
I asked her ſo many queſtions (the which ſhee
thought I ſhould have reſolved my ſelfe by the
water) ſhe would none of mine adviſe, but repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that I had no skill in waters, and ſaid, I asked
her many queſtions, but could tell her nothing
from the water. I ſpare to name her, yet I wiſh
that ſhe may chance to read this Story, wherein
ſhe may perceive that I could have cozen'd her,
that ſhe may bluſh to thinke that ſhe was ſo much
a foole, and thanke me that I have canonized her
for a foole-Saint, by no other name, but the name
of a Goſſſip and ſo let her know that I wanted
not wit to have deceived her, had not my will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15179:25"/>
beene reſtrained by a better reſolution than to
uſe ſuch baſe deceipt (to fit the humours of my
Patients) as is uſed to delude the vulgar, who
think that there is no diſeaſe nor ſymptome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
belonging to the body of man or woman, but
that it may be diſcerned in the Urine: Yet it is
farre otherwiſe, for in theſe Chronicall diſeaſes
(for the moſt part) the water ſeemeth not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
any diſeaſe at all, and yet the partie is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
ſicke: So likewiſe the Urine is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of an high red colour, and ſeemeth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a violent Fever when the partie is not ſicke
at all: It may be alſo of ſo good a colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
in a violent diſeaſe, as importeth no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
at all, and yet the partie ſicke unto death:
for confirmation whereof, I will give you two or
three inſtances out of mine owne experience, and
referre you to Doctour <hi>Hari</hi> for further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who in his Booke intituled, <hi>The Anatomy
of Vrines,</hi> hath ſet downe many examples out of
his owne obſervation, as alſo out of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and authenticke Writers, which confirme
the ſame which I affirme: Firſt, therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this point, That the ſicke partie is often ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably
ſick of a moſt Acute and violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
when his water ſeemeth not to import any
diſeaſe at all; I had a Urine brought me (when I
lived at <hi>Eaſt-Greenſted</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where I was then
a young practicant in Phyſicke) which did not
ſeeme to import any diſeaſe, but was of a better
colour and conſiſtence than mine owne, who was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15179:26"/>
in perfect health, in ſo much that I could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
thereby that the partie was ſicke; much
leſſe that he was ſicke unto death of a violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
But I did not tell the meſſenger that brought
it, that I did not perceive by the water, that the
partie was ſicke, for then I might have ſhew'd my
ſelfe to have beene a foole, and to have had no
skill in waters, as that Goſſip thought me that I
laſt ſpake of: But thus I handled the meſſenger;
I asked him how long the partie had been ſicke,
and he anſwered me, a weeke; from whence I
knew that it was a violent diſeaſe, for elſe I ſhould
(if I had not put him that queſtion) have thought
it to have been a Chronicall diſeaſe, and ſo ſhould
have given a wrong deſcription of the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the water ſeemed to import no diſeaſe at
all: So when I had gathered, by his anſwer to
that queſtion that it was a violent diſeaſe, I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
knew that there was a Fever joyned, and
gave him but the deſcription of a Fever, to ſhew
him how the partie was affected, and he was very
well ſatisfied therewith, and thought I perceived
the diſeaſe in the water. Now having given this
deſcription how the partie was affected, and that
he had a Fever (and indeed a man needs not to
ſay any more, what kind of Fever ſoever it be) I
fell to ſome conference neerer to the matter (with
the Meſſenger) whereby I came to underſtand the
diſeaſe better than by the Urine; and now I begin
to tell him the danger that the partie was in. and
he deſires me (for the meſſenger was kinſman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15179:26"/>
to the ſicke partie) that I would be pleaſed out of
charitie (for the ſicke man was poore, by profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Shooe-maker, by name <hi>John Lintell)</hi> to
goe along with him, and to ſee him; the which I
granted, and went along with the meſſenger to
ſee this ſicke partie, whom I found, lying in his
bed not able to ſtirre himſelfe, ſick of a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumoniacall
Fever (which is the Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mation
and inflamation of the lungs) with all the ſignes
of death in his face, upon the eighth day of his
ſickneſſe, with ſharp noſe, hollow eyes red cheeks,
a great paine in his backe betweene his ſhoulders,
and a great oppreſſion of his ſtomach and pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parts, in ſo much that he could ſcarce breathe
or ſpeake, but with ratling in the throat; all the
which when I had well obſerved, I put him in
mind of his mortality and preſent imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
gave him the beſt inſtructions that I could to
prepare himſelfe for that ſodaine change of this
life for another that was like to be, and ſo tooke
my leave of him: But before I could get away, I
was deſired by ſome of his friends that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, to tell them (for they thinke that wee
can ſurely tell, or elſe that we are not our crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters)
whether hee would dye, or no; and I
tooke upon me to determine his death before
eight of the clocke the next night, within halfe
an houre of which time he dyed. But (before I
could get out of the chamber) they began to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as the manner is and to ſcoffe me to my face,
ſaying amongſt themſelves, that they did nor
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15179:27"/>
perceive but that he might live as long as I; but
my predictions proved ſo true, and were ſo ſoone
accompliſhed, that I came off from that their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
with more than ordinary credit, for as much
as I had prefixed ſo ſhort a time of his life, and
the event (death) following now ſo neere the
utmoſt bounds and limits of the time. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
ingenuouſly, that I was too peremptory in
determining his death within ſo ſhort a time, or
by ſuch an houre, for I had told them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee
could not live untill ſuch an houre (which was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of the clocke) and that, if he ſhould eſcape
that houre, he would recover; but yet both of
theſe predictions might have proved falſe, for he
might both eſcape that houre, and yet might not
recover (though I ſaid he would, if he paſſed that
houre) but dye within a few dayes or houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Neither did I pronounce my judgment from
any grounds of Art, that did determine his death
within ſuch an houre, but onely by conjecturall
probabilitie; for your cunning men, or Conjurers,
nay the Devill himſelfe, cannot otherwiſe than
upon conjecture, determine a ſicke mans life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an houre, unleſſe you make him one of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
ſcoret counſell. Nay I dare affirme, that
the Devils may, and often are deceived in their
conjectures and calculations touching the life and
death of men, and yet their naturall knowledge is
farre more than mens, for they are ſpirits; and
their acquired knowledge is as much beyond
mens, becauſe they are ancienter than men (even
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15179:27"/>
from the beginning of the world) &amp; are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ſame mortality that man is, who (before
he come to begin to have underſtanding) is in his
Grave. I ſay therefore, that no Phyſician, nay the
Devills (who are ancienter than <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> or
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or any of that race) cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the life and death of a man, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
and may be deceived; but yet you looke
that a Phyſician ſhould be able to doe it, and not
to erre, becauſe ſuch an event doth oftentimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
follow ſuch a peremptory concluſion
as this of mine was, that this partie would dye
within ſuch an houre. It is true indeed, and I
might truely ſay (the nature of the diſeaſe, and
the ſtrength of the body, with all other ſignes of
death being well conſidered) that I thought the
partie would ſcarce live untill ſuch an houre: but
if I ſhould ſay (without any qualification of the
ſenſe) that the partie would not live untill ſuch
an houre, and that he would recover if he ſhould
paſſe that houre, you might thinke that I ſpake
without my booke, for I could not ſay ſo, but that
I muſt ſpeake more than I know, and ſo derogate
from the providence of God, in aſſuming that
knowledge unto my ſelfe that belongs onely to
him. I was likewiſe called to another luſtie yong
man (one <hi>John Duffield</hi> by name) in the very ſame
Towne, very ſhortly after, who was ſicke of the
very ſame diſeaſe, in the ſame manner, whoſe
friends were very importunate at me to be tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15179:28"/>
with him, and to uſe my beſt skill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him, but I perceived that there had another
Quack been tampering with him before, who had
omitted the opportunity of letting him blood, and
found him ſo far and in ſuch caſe debilitated that
now there was no place for bleeding unleſſe I had
beene contented to have undergone the ſcandall
that would have ſoone enſued; ſo I wiſhed them
to ſend for the Phyſician of the ſoule, and told
them there was no place for my Art: For, had I
cauſed him to have been let blood, he would have
gone neere to have dyed under the Chirurgians
hands, and then they would not have ſtuck to have
ſaid that I had kil'd him; for it was afternoon, and
almoſt night when I was called unto him, and he
dyed before the next morning: Yet (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the incertaine judgment of diſeaſes by the
water) his water was of as good a colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
every way as any healthfull mans, yet
notwithſtanding I gave my judgement ſo upon
this Urine, as that I ſatisfied the meſſenger; for I
asked the meſſenger, how long the partie had
been ſicke, who anſwered almoſt a weeke; from
whence I gathered that it was a violent diſeaſe
although the water did not witneſſe the ſame, and
ſo gave the deſcription of a Fever which ſhewed
how the partie was affected, and made the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
thinke that I perceived his diſeaſe in the
water; but you (I hope) well perceive how I did
it, and how a man may be ſicke unto death, his
Urine ſhewing no diſeaſe at all, and if a Phyſician
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15179:28"/>
can ſatisfie the meſſenger and ſeeme to deſcribe
the diſeaſe by the Urine, notwithſtanding. So
now I proceed to ſit in judicature upon this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
harlot (the Urine) who in Chronicall diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſeemeth to import no diſeaſe at all, and yet ſhe
is caught <hi>ipſo facto</hi> in her cloſe tricks, for which
ſhe is come to publike cenſure: But firſt, before I
come to examine this ſtrumpet, I muſt further
ſhew you how I come to know certainely whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a Chronicall diſeaſe or no, ſince ſhe is
(namely the Urine) ſo perfidious as that there is
no credit to be given to any thing that ſhe comes
to give in evidence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſtate of any ſick
or well bodies water whomſoever:<note place="margin">How a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is found out.</note> 
               <hi>Now that I
diſcern</hi> (namely whether it be a Chronicall diſeaſe
or no) by the ſame queſtion that I propounded in
giving my judgement upon Urines in violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes;
and that queſtion was this; I onely asked
the meſſenger how long the partie had been ſicke,
by anſwer whereunto I am certified, or at leaſt
have ſtrong preſumption, whether it be a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
or violent diſeaſe; for if the Piſſe Poſt ſay
a weeke or leſſe, I then preſume that it is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
diſeaſe: But if the Piſſe-bearer ſay that the
partie hath not beene very well a good while
(which is their anſwer commonly in a Chronicall
diſeaſe, when we aske how long the partie hath
been ſicke, for indeed they are not ſicke in moſt
Chronicall diſeaſes, but are illiſh or not well) I
dare ſay then that it is a Chronicall diſeaſe; and
when I have once received this anſwer to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15179:29"/>
forenamed queſtion, (let the water be of what
colour ſoever it will, or whether I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or no, I
care not) I know how to give an anſwer that ſhall
pleaſe the meſſenger, and fill his bagge, but put
nothing in it; and though the water ſhew no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
at all, (for ſo it falleth out for the moſt part,
as I have already told you, in theſe Chronicall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
that I am now to ſpeake of next;) yet I will
finde the diſeaſe (for which the party ſent it)
out of it: nay, (if the party ſhould have no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
at all, but ſend his Urine to ſee if he be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
unto ſome ſuch hereditary diſeaſe as his
Parents have dyed of, or beene ſubject unto, as
the Gout, Stone, Conſumption or the like) I will
ſhake it into the danger of falling into the ſame,
or ſome other diſeaſe of no leſſe danger, for that
they alwayes feare, and love to be warned of,
though they have obtained ſuch a conſtitution of
body as is not obnoxious unto their Parents diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes;
and thus I muſt doe, if an Urine be ſent,
though the party be well, or but a little out of
tune, by reaſon of the leaſt diſtemper that may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for there is no ſuch conſtitution of body, but that
it hath its proper infirmities, the which muſt be
diſcerned (ſince there is ſuch a cuſtome) by the
Urine; and I will find them out, and more than
there are, by it, if once I come to lecture upon it,
or elſe let them blame my judgement; ſo then (I trow)
there will be worke for the Tinker to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
an hole in Nature, where there was never
like to be a breach. But (I pray) may not this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15179:29"/>
Phyſick-tinker (who pretending ſuch knowledge
by the Urine, is conſtrained to backe his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
knowledge by ſuch baſe fallacies) may not
(I ſay) nay, will he not, thinke you (under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of fortifying that place where you feare a
breach) grate an hole in another to let in diſeaſes,
to make himſelfe continuall worke, the which
(at laſt) will let out that precious liquor of thy
life, that thou wouldſt be loath to loſe? But I
leave that to thine owne charity to judge of; and
ſo betake my ſelfe to my Study, to come forth
from thence in my gowne and my cap, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the next Piſſe-bearers, who now begin to
come thicke and threefold; I muſt therefore be
gone to my Study, from whence you ſhall ſee me
come forth preſently, and heare me pronounce
true judgement, upon the falſe evidence of the
ſuborned witneſſe (the Urine) on the delinquent
(the ſicke party) though he be abſent, and not

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15179:30"/>
be faine to goe ſee what the matter is: ſo to my

quicke pace and a ſharpe looke, importing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
buſines than to examine a Piſſe-pot, where I
finde three or foure Piſſe-meſſengers at once,
(with their Urinals under their aprons) whom I
uſher into my Hall, and there begin (before I
take them aſide, apart, to Lecture upon their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
to looke very ſternely upon them, and aske
them very haſtily, (to the end that I may daſh
them ſo farre out of countenance, that they may
not be capable of conceiving whether I erre or no
in giving my judgement on their waters, and to
make them the more ready to tell me whatſoever
I ſhall demand of them) what they would with
me, where they live, whoſe water it is for whom
they come, &amp;c. And they are all ready to preſent
me their waters, looking who ſhall be diſpatched
firſt: but before I take any of their Urinals of
them, I ſound them how farre I ſhall be puzled
with them, diſpatching them firſt, that I ſhall be
leaſt troubled withall. To the firſt therefore I ſay,
where live you? and ſhe anſwers, at ſuch a place,
naming it: I further aske her whoſe water it is?
and ſhe ſaith her Miſtreſſes: I aske her alſo who
is her Miſtreſſe, to which ſhe anſweres me very
orderly, and is now ready to put foorth her Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
unto me, but I doe not yet take it, nor I aske
her no more queſtions, for ſhe will be ready to tell
me whatſoever I ſhall demand: I come therefore
to a ſecond, and aske her where ſhe dwells, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15179:31"/>
(ſhe having told me) I likewiſe aske her whoſe
water it is that ſhe hath brought, and ſhe ſaith a
Gentlewomans, who deſired her to bring it unto
me, and ſhe is ready to give me her Urinall, but
I refuſe it: I goe now to a third, and aske her (for
they are for the moſt part, She-piſſe-bearers in a
great Towne or City) where ſhe dwells, and that
ſhe is contented to tell me: but when I aske her
whoſe water it is, ſhee pauſeth here, and begins
to make a doubt whether ſhe were beſt to tell me
that, or no; and therefore anſwers, that it is a
friends of hers: I then aske her what friends it is,
and whether it be a mans or a womans water; and
ſhe tells me, that I ſhall perceive that by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(thinking that I can or ought to do ſo indeed)
when I looke upon it, and holds forth her Urinall
unto me, in hope that I will diſpatch her firſt, but
I refuſe to take it, for I am like to be puzled with
her, and it will require more time and Art to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
her than both the other, and therefore ſhee
ſhall tarry to be the laſt anſwered for that tricke.
I now therefore take the Urinall of her that told
me that it was her Miſtreſſe water, and ſingle her
out from her fellowes, and bid her follow me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another roome (for I muſt not let ſeverall meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
heare what I ſay to each other) becauſe I
may chance to ſtop two gaps with one buſh, and
to give the ſame anſwer and deſcription of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
to them all three, (and indeed one deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

as the deſcription of a Fever for all violent diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15179:31"/>
as I have ſhewed you) and then they would
thinke that I puld the buſh out of one gap to put
it into another, and that I could ſay nothing elſe.
I having therefore tooke the maid into another
roome, bid her come to the light, and as I am ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Urinall out of the caſe (perceiving it to
be of a ſubcitrine or pale colour, which ſeeme not
to import any diſeaſe) I preſently ſay; maid, thy

yes forſooth; and imagines no leſſe now, but that
I perceive the Idea or ſhape of her Miſtreſſe in
the water, and thinks that I can tell any thing elſe
by the ſame, ſo that I ſhall not now need to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſhe tells me that her Miſtreſſe goes up and downe
indeed, and that I had ſaid very right, and tells
me that her Miſtreſſe deſired that I would certifie
her whether ſhe were with child, or no; ſo I now
ſet downe the Urinall in the window, and tell her
that it muſt ſtand ſo a little while, and ſettle, and
then I will tell her preſently.<note place="margin">Ordinary times of conception.</note> 
               <hi>In the meane time,</hi>
I fall to parley with the maid, and aske her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

before) is the moſt certaine token in the world,
that I know, that a woman is vvith child: it is

it (as though I looked for ſome little child
there) <hi>And ſay now to the maid</hi> that her Miſtreſſe
is not very well in her ſtomach,<note place="margin">Other ſignes of the ſame.</note> hath no appetite
to meate, is ill in her ſtomach in a morning, and
apt to vomit after meat (and ſo are moſt childing
women at this time) and ſay, that ſhe is a quarter
gone with child, which jumps juſt with tenne
weeks, according to the common computation of
a womans go in forty weeks: but doe not ſay,
that ſhe is tenne weeks with child, or juſt ſo long
as ſince ſhee had her naturall courſes laſt, for that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15179:32"/>
would make them ſo cunning (in time) that they
would not ſend their waters to a Doctour to caſt,
to know whether they were with child or no, but
I ſay, ſhe is a quarter gone with child, which is
but as much as to have ſaid ſhe is tenne weekes
with child, or juſt ſo long as ſince ſhee had her
courſes laſt, which was (as the maid told me) ten
weeks agoe. <hi>I further ſay,</hi> that ſhee is with child
of a boy, and to ſay ſo, is an even lay; yet, leſt it
ſhould prove falſe,<note place="margin">How you are to deale with thoſe who deſire to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whether the child is like to be a boy or a girle.</note> I ſay (looking upon the water
very earneſtly) that if it had beene brought when
it had beene warme, or when ſhe had been quick
with child, or ſome ſuch like flamme, I could have
told her certainely whether ſhee were with child
of a boy, or of a girle, but I verily thinke it will
be a boy; ſo now, if it chance to be a boy indeed, it
will be granted that I knew for certaine that it
would be a boy, and I ſhall be accounted one of
the rareſt Doctours in the Town; but if it chance
to be a girle, the flamme, that I gave to the maid,
and the truth of my predictions in determining
the Gentlewoman to be with child, and telling
her how long ſhe was gone with child, will help to
beare out the other, ſo that I ſhall not have my
skill one jot abated thereby. I now therefore tell
the maid, (as if ſhe had come in but now) that her
Miſtreſſe is not very well in her ſtomach, hath no
appetite to meat, is inclinning to vomit after meat,
is with child a quarter gone, (and as I thinke) of
a boy, and that it were very convenient for her to
take ſome corroborating Electuary to ſtrengthen
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15179:33"/>
and ſettle her ſtomach though ſhe be with child,
nay, I tell her that it will be good, not only for
her, but for her child alſo, and I bid her tell her
Miſtreſſe, that it will make her child to proſper the
better within her, and make it the more lively, ſo
that ſhe ſhall be the better able to bring it forth
with the more eaſe; nay, I tell her that it will make
her bring forth the more wiſe and underſtanding
child. And ſo I have done with the maid, bid her
remember me to her Miſtreſſe, and be ſure to tell
her what I had ſaid: and now I am ſure that I ſhall
get a fee for my ſelfe, and a feeling for mine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie;
for what woman (being with child)
would not have it to proſper within her? but
would ſhe not more gladly bring it forth with
eaſe, and moſt gladly (it being brought forth)
have it prove a wiſe and underſtanding child? I
dare ſay ſhe would, though for no other end but
(meerely out of pride and emulation) to have
it wiſer (that is wittier, and more ſharpe-vvitted)
than her neighbours, and not ſo much out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

ſcornefull manner queſtioned with me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

her that they did corroborate the ſtomach, and

againſt vomiting, and fluxes; at which ſhee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſcorn, and ſaid, that ſhe had heard a learned

wit than to tell this Gentlewoman ſo, or to give
her a boxe of Marmalade, and bid her eate often
of it in the morning faſting, and before and after
meate, no, ſhe would then under-value my skill,

ſo takes me off, and ſaith ſhe is troubled with a
great paine in the head indeed, but doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
much of her ſtomach: and then I reply that
the paine in the head proceeded from the ſtomach
and parts thereunto adjoyning, and that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
is alwayes acceſſary to the diſeaſes of the
head, and that I named the ilneſſe of her ſtomach,
firſt, becauſe it was the cauſe of her diſeaſe: and
having once given a deſcription of a diſeaſe I muſt
be ſure to make it good, whether it be true or
falſe; for if I had (for a deſcription of a diſeaſe)
ſaid that ſhe had been troubled with an oppilation
of the Liver, and paine in the head (the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               </gap>he, but yet I would maintaine it very confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it came from the head (for the ſtomach
and head doe mutually offend each other) and
what could ſhee have ſaid to the contrary? or if,
when I had given a deſcription of the diſeaſe, ſhe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15179:35"/>
had ſaid, Maſter Doctour, ſhe is much as you
have ſaid, but doe not you perceive that ſhe hath
a very weake backe? to which I anſwer, yes marry
hath ſhe (for elſe why ſhould ſhe aske me?) and
ſomething elſe too, which I ſhall tell you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and then I take the Urine and looke upon it
and ſhake it together and ſet it downe in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

the diſeaſe for which ſhee hath ſent her wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though ſhe ayle nothing ſave only that <hi>Cupid</hi>

wanteth a good husband, and that ſhe
dreameth often of her ſweet-heart; &amp; bid the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bid her be of good cheere, &amp; tell her that her
ſweet-heart will come very ſhortly; and with this
meſſage ſhe is ſo delighted, that ſhe is more than
halfe well againe, and thinks to her ſelfe (though
ſhe ſay nothing to her that brought me her Urine)
that I am a very cunning man, and that I can as
well tell, whether ſhe ſhall enjoy him whom ſhe is
taken withall, as I have gueſt by her yeers &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of body (but ſhee thinks I have done it
by her Urine) that ſhe is in love, and that I can
helpe her to ſomething to make her ſweet-heart
as farre in love with her, and meanes to trie me
for ſome Love powder, or ſome other deviſe to
catch her Lover in a Cleft ſticke; for ſhee hath
heard of ſuch tricks, and ſome that have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Phyſicke, have taught that Art, and divers
both men and women have repaired unto ſuch
Knaves, (and by practizing ſuch wicked meanes
as hath beene taught them) have obtained their

Lovers; but yet if ſhe repaire unto me againe for
this purpoſe (though I have beene very youthfull
in deſcanting upon her water) I will read her a
graver Lecture, for I diſclaime ſuch knowledge
(though haply I know more than ſuch a Rogue
as ſhall practice it) and deteſt ſuch wickedneſſe
at mine heart. But now this long Parentheſis, or
diſcourſe concerning this maiden-Gentlewoman,
may ſeeme to have hindred the diſpatch of the
woman that came for the married Gentlewoman:
yet if you doe ſuppoſe that ſhe came in but now
and that I have but now taken her to doe, and
have gathered (after that I have once pronounced
a deſcription of the diſeaſe) by parly with her,
that the Gentlewoman is married, and ſuch other
circumſtances as I would know, you ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but that I preſently diſpatch her; taking the
Urinall in my hand and from the water (though
ſhe have told me all) pronounce the diſeaſe, and
ſay, that the Gentlewoman hath a very weake
back, is troubled with the Whites, &amp; that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
had hindred (for you muſt conceive that the
woman told me that this Gentlewoman hath not
had any child, this three or foure yeeres) her
conceiving with child, and that ſhe would have
no more children, unleſſe ſhe were freed of them;
and now I muſt think upon ſomething (againſt ſhe
ſend) to cure this Gentlewoman, for I am ſure
ſhe'll to't againe for the t'other boy: and now I

            <p>I Have made this Goſſip tarrie till the laſt for

handle her gently, for the wildeſt colts are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

have the raines lie ſtill in their necks, and giving

this colt to play in her owne halter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till ſhee have

roughly, or ſpeake harſhly unto her, and ſay, come
you with your friends water, and let me ſee it,
and (when I have taken it of her) aske her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a mans or a womans water, for it
ſeemeth by her other anſwer, that ſhee will
not tell me that, and then ſay (ſhe denying to tell

it is, for I have not time to ſtand peering into it,
for every thing that I muſt tell you, though I could
find it there, if I had not other fiſh to ſeeth: and
indeed their fooliſh peeviſhneſſe had (oftentimes)
need to be ſo met withall, and ſome Phyſicians
have gone that ſtraine, and by that humour have
gotten more fame, than their tranſcendent skill in
Phyſicke or learning, above other men hath
deſerved: but I am not of that humour, no, I
ſay, come good woman (who ſtinkes as much of
goodneſſe, as a Poult-cat of muske) I have made
you tarry, but you ſhall not altogether loſe your
labour; I pray follow me; and ſo I conduct
her into my Parlour, where I have now my man
waiting for me with a cup of Ale, with a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browne
toſt in it, or elſe a cup of good Engliſh
Beere of ſixteene at the leaſt, with Nutmeg and
Sugar in it for my mornings draught, and ſit me
downe in my chaire, and ſay, here good woman
I drinks to you, and ſo fetch off a bowle of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a pinte, and bid my man fill the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

cup, that I may waſh both mine eyes, ſo that
I may ſee the better to diſpatch this woman

my man fill the good woman another cup, and
bid her mend her draught, and tell her that to
drinke Nutmeg and Sugar in her Beere in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

away all the ill quality of this womans nature

wrought her to ſo good a temper with my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

will tell me any thing that I ſhall aske her: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I have now drunke my mornings draught
and ſhall be able to ſee the clearer, if I muſt find
it all out of the water, that I muſt ſhew. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now ſay, come good woman (it is a great
chance but that I lie;) how long hath your friend
beene ſicke? and ſhee cannot anſwer me to this
queſtion without ſhewing me the ſexe, (that is,
whether it be a mans or a womans water) for the
party is not ſicke; for then ſhe might anſwer me
directly without giving me any knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and might ſay, a weeke, a forthnight, or more,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15179:38"/>
or leſſe, but ſhe muſt needs ſay, He, or She (but
yet ſhe will ſcarce remember that ſhe ſaid, He or
She, anone when I ſhall ſhew my skill upon the
water, and determine the Sexe) hath not beene
very well a good while, and ſo offers me her Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
with the water in it, as it is in the Caſe, but
I refuſe to take it, and ſay unto her as followeth.
Good woman, becauſe I have made you to ſtay
ſo long, I will ſhew you your friends diſeaſe by
the Urinall Caſe, and never looke upon the water
at all: give me therefore the Urinall Caſe, and do
you keepe the water to your ſelfe, ſo that I doe
not ſee it at all, and yet I will tell you your friends
diſeaſe, as well as he that ſhould pore and peepe,
or gaze into the water this month: and now the
woman thinkes that I can ſurely conjure. I now
therefore take the Urinall Caſe of her, and looke
as wiſtly upon it, as if it were the Urinall with the
water in it, and preſently pronounce (looking
upon the Caſe,) That this party goes up and
downe, is not heart-ſicke, but is faint in the
body, hath but a bad ſtomach, doth linger
and pine as it were, is joyleſſe and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and takes no pleaſure in any thing, which
ſhall be the deſcription of this diſeaſe: and now
the woman ſhe wonders to heare me ſay, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only upon the Urinall Caſe, that the party is ſo
affected, as I have ſaid; and yet it is true, that the
party is ſo affected, &amp; it is as true that the Urinall
Caſe doth ſhew it as certainly as the Urine it ſelfe.
For the water might be of ſuch a laudable colour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15179:38"/>
and conſiſtence as might ſeeme not to import any
diſeaſe at all, and yet the partie might be ſick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death: It might likewiſe be of ſuch a colour
and conſiſtence as might ſeem to import a violent
diſeaſe when the partie is not ſicke at all: I wiſh
therefore that any Phyſician would ſet pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to diſprove me, or to ſhew that there is any
certaine judgement of any diſeaſe, by the water;
and yet forſooth this baſe cuſtome, of divining by
it, muſt be continued: But how then, will you ſay,
can a Phyſician conclude, that a partie is thus or
thus affected, from it? Why thus you may doe
it: namely, by putting a queſtion; For (as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
ſaith) <hi>Interrogatiuncula cautè praemittenda
quampridem morbus invaſit:</hi> A queſtion is to be
propounded (craftily) to the meſſenger (as I
have done to this woman) how long the partie
hath beene ſicke: Then pronounce a deſcription
of the diſeaſe, and fall to parly with the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and thou ſhalt quickly find what the diſeaſe is;
for the ſame Author ſaith, <hi>Verborum circuitu ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
mens facile irretitur,</hi> by exchange of words
the foole meſſenger is ſoone caught: And thus
have I caught this woman, whom (though ſhe be
an old bird) I have caught with chaffe; for I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
her, before I tooke the Urinall caſe of her
(by which I have undertaken to divine) how long
her friend had been ſicke, and ſhe anſwered mee,
that he (but hath forgot that ſhe ſaid he) had not
been very well a good while, from which anſwer
I ſhall ſhew both the ſexe and the diſeaſe; for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15179:39"/>
this word (He) ſheweth me the ſexe, and theſe
words, Hath not beene very well a good while,
ſhew me that it is a Chronicall diſeaſe, and how
the partie is affected: The latter part of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
namely, A good while, ſhew that it is a
Chronicall diſeaſe; and the former part of the
words, namely, Hath not been very well, doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
that the partie lyeth not by it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he goeth up and downe, hath no appetite to
meat, is faint in his body, doth linger and pine as
it were, is joyleſſe and melancholicke, and takes
no pleaſure in any thing (as I told her before) and
ſo are all they that have not beene very well a
good while: But the woman never dreames that
I gather all this from her anſwer, becauſe I looke
upon the Urinall-caſe, but rather thinke that the
Urinall infected the caſe, or elſe that I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure:
But let her thinke what ſhe will, ſo that I
conſerve that fame which I have got in the Piſſe-pot
Science, I care not: Yet this I am ſure, that ſhe
will thinke never the worſe of mee for being a
conjurer. Imagine with me, that ſhee came but
now in, and that (after my courteous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her) I have but now taken the Urinall
caſe of her, asked how long her friend hath been
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cke, and received her anſwer, but that I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounce the ſame deſcription of her friends
diſeaſe that I have already ſhewed you; at which
ſhee wonders not a little; but I ſhall make her
wonder more anon: And now I adde, that it is a
mans water, to which ſhe anſwers, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15179:39"/>
I further aske her how old the partie is,
and according to her anſwer, as the parties age
ſhall agree with hers, I ſay that it is her husbands,
at which ſhe mervailes more than at all the reſt,
and ſaith that it is indeed: And now ſhe is ready
to put finger in the eye, and askes me if he be not
in a Conſumption, and tells mee (for I did not
name it) that he hath a very great cough: Shee
askes me likewiſe if I doe not perceive it; and I
anſwer, yes I doe perceive it, or elſe befoole mee
while you will, and I will never be angry: And
then I tell her that this cough proceeded from his
ill ſtomach (which I had named) that ſent a
theume unto his head, which diſtilled down from
thence upon his lungs and cauſed the ſame. I
now come neerer to the matter, and tell her that
her husband is inclining (and perhaps further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
than ever I ſhall be able to recover him) into
a Conſumption: But yet I tell her that I hope he
may be recovered as yet, and that I will uſe the
beſt meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that may be, to reſtore him: I alſo
aske her why ſhe ſo long deferred comming to a
Phyſician, and ſhee ſaith, that her husband had
thought to have worne it out, as they all think to
doe: I now tell her that I feare there will bee
ſome danger, yet I will doe what can be done on
my behalfe, and that ſhee muſt now deferre no
longer time, if ſhe love her husbands life: And
now if ſhe be not provided of another husband
already, and ſo come more to know how long ſhe
ſhall be troubled with him, and to excuſe her
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15179:40"/>
ſelfe (if he ſhould chance to dye) than for any
thing to cure him, I muſt bethinke my ſelfe of
ſome <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> ſome Liquor of life of a
great price, ſome Conſumption pouder of twenty
or thirty ſhillings an ounce, or ſome ſuch receipt
which no body hath but my ſelfe) than the which
<hi>non datur majus ſecretum,</hi> there is not a greater
ſecret in the world: And now if I recover the
man, he will think his purſe to be in a Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but I cannot cure it there. But if this woman
would have him dye, ſhe'l goe home and tell him
that he is in a Conſumption indeed, and will ſcarce
recover: So now whereas he went up and downe
before, walked abroad, and was ſicke but a little
in jeſt, he feeles himſelfe iller already with this
meſſage, and meanes to dye in good earneſt; and
ſo betakes himſelfe to his chamber, with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to ſave his purſe, out of which hee never
comes till he be brought with his heels forward:
And thus was I cruelly haunted (at <hi>Canterbury)</hi>
by a man to put him in comfort of his wives more
ſodaine departure than God had decreed, but ſhe
is yet living, and (for ought that I know) may
live to eate of that Gooſe that may graze upon
his Grave. I dare ſay that women come not ſhort
of that man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I did never perceive that any
woman ever brought me her husbands Urine for
that purpoſe; I will not therefore belye them, to
make them worſe than they are, for they are (God
amend them) bad enough of themſelves already.
I have therefore done with this woman (for I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15179:40"/>
for all her fained teares, that ſhe came to
to that purpoſe) and have given her her errand,
and ſent her away, and ſhe (by this time) hath
given her husband his errand, and ſent him the
way of all fleſh, (who had he not truſted to his
wife, and relied upon the ſending of his Piſſe in
ſtead of ſending for my ſelfe or ſome other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Phyſician) might have been a live man and
have lived many a faire yeere: But you ſee what
is become of him, and (I hope) conceive what
danger you put your lives in that adventure to
take Phyſicke preſcribed by the ſight of the Urine
onely: I hope likewiſe that you conceive by theſe
few inſtances that I have already ſet downe, how
a Phyſician (if I may ſo call him that uſeth ſuch
baſe fallacies to backe his pretended knowledge)
may give judgement of Urines both in Acute and
Violent, or Chronicall and lingring diſeaſes, and
how handſomely your Piſſe-meſſengers are fob'd
over: for I proteſt before God, that by theſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies,
this deceitfull jugling, and farre worſe
ſhifts than any I have here ſet downe, hath this
baſe cuſtome of giving judgement of diſeaſes by
the ſight of the Urine, beene underpropped and
ſupported, or elſe it had long agoe been abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and fallen to the ground: For there is no
knowledge of any diſeaſe to be gathered by the
Urine, ſufficient to guide a Phyſician in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
of medicines to cure the ſame: (And yet
(forſooth) ſuch a baſe cuſtome hath beene uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by moſt of our beſt Phyſicians, that (you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15179:41"/>
bringing us your Piſſe) we muſt tell you (though
we do it meerly by ſuch fallacies as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, or the like) what is the diſeaſe by it, and
whether it be a mans or a womans water; as alſo,
if it be the water of a woman-kinde, whether it be
a married womans or a Maidens; and, if a married
womans, whether ſhe be with childe or no; and,
if with child, whether ſhe ſhall bring forth a boy
or a girle, and when ſhe conceived of it; and (I
think too) whether ſhe ſhall bring forth a man or
a monſter: I can tell you one thing more (as well
as any man in the world can tell you any of theſe
that I have named) by the water, if you bee as
much deſirous to know, as you are farre to ſeeke
ſometimes, and that is this, namely who begot
this child, whether your owne husband or vvhat
other man. But if vvomen did beleeve as much

faſt, they thinke that a Doctour can tell how the
knot ſlipt, and eaſily reſolve them of that doubt:
But if we ſuſpect and conceive it to be ſo indeed
by the tale of the meſſenger that brings this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet wee dare not ſay that this Maid is with
childe, for wee know not the trouble and ſtirre
that might come of it; but happily we ſay, Is this
a Maids water? and then we ſay (if it be) that
ſhe hath a Tympanie (which is a Dropſie as her
Parents feared) meaning with two legges, which
proves too true, and makes the meſſenger to call
to minde (when this Tympanie hath more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcovered it ſelfe) that the Doctour asked her
if this were a Maids water; and then they ſurely
thinke that we could tell by the water; but yet
we can tell no otherwiſe, than as I have ſhewed
you before in giving judgement of womens U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,
and how we judge them to be with childe
by their water; the which, women themſelves
might doe (if they would apply their hearts unto
that wiſedome that moſt properly concerned
them) by conferring with diſcreet women, or
Midwives, who (if they could not better tell by
that ſecret examination of their bodies which
they might make, and by other obſervations,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15179:42"/>
whether a women were with child or no, than any
Phyſician can doe by the Urine,) were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to exerciſe that function; So they ſhould not
need to trouble a Phyſician (for that matter) but
that they love rather to be tampering with a man
than with their owne ſexe, and ſo might ſave that
groat (ſent for caſting their water to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the woman is, ſo addicted to the man, that Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives
(I thinke) ere long will be quite out of requeſt,
ſo that if ſome more of us Phyſicians (who are the
moſt proper and handſome handed men amongst us)

will not now rub any more upon this ſore, for I have

I will let it a one untill I may chance to ranke
it with the other monopolized ſecrets of the met ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
Abuſers of the noble Profeſſion of Phyſicke.</hi>
And thus have I ſhewed the fallacies and knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(of all thoſe, whether Phyſicians or Quacks
and Empiricks; who pretend knowledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes

that the moſt ignorant people may perceive how
finely they are flamm'd over, when they ſend
their Piſſe to a Doctour to caſt, and may collect
(for it is very true) that there is no certaine
knowledge of any diſeaſe to be gathered from
the Urine; but yet the nature of men is ſuch that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15179:42"/>
(being ſetled in an opinion, though grounded
meerly upon errours and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be bearen from it by ſound arguments and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
reaſons and will rather imbrace and maintain
falſehood (inſtead of truth) than be thought ſo
weake as to have beene poſſibly deluded: I know
for certaine that it will hardly ſinke into many of
your heads, which I have written; becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Phyſicians, ſome Divines, and other ſilenced
Miniſters who have turned Phyſicians (vvhoſe
tender conſciences vvould not ſerve them to
ſubſcribe to the decent ceremonies of the Church)
have practized theſe baſe fallacies, in giving judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Waters being brought unto them: But
(I hope) ſome of their vvaters vvill bee better
looked into, than to be ſuffered to exerciſe tvvo
callings of ſuch vveight as are Divinitie and
Phyſicke: And (for mine ovvne part) ſcare not
though I be cenſured for going about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvv
this cuſtome of giving judgment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
by the Urine, the vvhich I knovv I ſhall be;
for I have already ejaculated ſomething to this
purpoſe, and I finde men ſo prepoſſeſſed vvith an
opinion that the Urine is ſufficient to ſhevv a
Phyſician the diſeaſe, ſexe, and conception, and
the like, ſo that very mechanicks tell me that
they have ſent their vvaters unto ſuch and ſuch
Doctours, vvho have thereby told them their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
directly: I (ſaith one) have ſent my Wives
vvater by my Maid (vvho is a cunning vvench,
and vvould not be deceived) to a young Dutch
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15179:43"/>
man a Doctour, who (they ſay) is the moſt expert
man, for his judgment in waters, in all the
Towne; and he hath told the Maid (by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
how her Miſtreſſe hath beene affected in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
reſpect, and that ſhe was with childe, which
proved true. To which I anſwer, that if the Maid
had no more wit than her Maſter, I could as
eaſily cozen her as the Dutch-man did; and I
doe further affirme that the Dutch-man is an
Aſſe, the French-man a Foole, and the Engliſh-man
a Knave, who pretendeth knowledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
by the Urine. I have likewiſe had ſome
conference with ſome of better breeding, and
more knowing men, who (becauſe they have been
thus deluded by their Phyſicians) doe likewiſe
beleeve that the Urine doth ſhew the diſeaſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
of it ſelf: And (to this purpoſe) ſaith one,
I have ſent my water unto ſuch a Doctour with
a Latine Epiſtle of two or three lines (not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
how I was in any kind affected) and he hath
returned me an anſwer in very terſe Latine, and
ſhewed me truely how I was affected, and what
was the cauſe of my diſeaſe; and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
(ſaith hee) the Urine doth ſhew the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
To whom I anſwer, that he could pen no
Epiſtle (though he doe not write therein how he

            <p>I confeſſe that this Epiſtle doth give a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
very little light of the diſeaſe, towards the
pronouncing judgement of the ſame, yet not ſo
little as the Urine. I can draw no concluſion from
the words thereof, becauſe I penned them my
ſelfe. But from the circumſtance of the words I
gather theſe particulars. Firſt that there was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
betweene you and your Doctour, and
that thereby he knew the complexion and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of your body, which conferred much to the
giving judgement of your Urine: otherwiſe (if
there had beene no acquaintance betweene you)
you would not have written unto him ſo familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſecondly, you did but <hi>leviter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

but a little ſickiſh or ill at eaſe; or elſe you would
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15179:45"/>
not have beene able to have written your ſelfe
for in a Violent diſeaſe (for the moſt part) men
are in two or three dayes ſo debilitated in their
bodyes, and diſturbed in their ſenſes, that they
cannot write: Thirdly, from the Urine ariſeth this
circumſtance, that (as the water ſeemed not to
import a violent diſeaſe) it did not ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
any diſeaſe at all, ſave onely that it was ſent
with your letters, to witneſſe that you were not
well. Fourthly, I preſume, that the meſſenger,
whom you ſent with your Piſſe, could tell your
Doctour (for I am ſure he would demand that)
that you walked up and downe, but were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well: all which circumſtances being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
and layd together, were light enough for
your Phyſician to ſhew how you were affected. I
doubt not, but that your Doctour knew well how
to make uſe of all ſuch advantages, for elſe hee
would have beene as lightly eſteemed of all men,
as you would have eſteemed him, if hee had not
told you (as you thinke) your diſeaſe by your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I will now pen his anſwer unto your letters,
and then I will ſhew you the fallacies of them;

            <p>This Epiſtle (Maſter Doctour) hath pleaſed your
Patient, and you thereby have purchaſed a great
deale of honour: your Latine he underſtands well
enough, but the implied ſenſe and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is not aware of, becauſe he is not acquainted
with the myſtery of giving judgement of a Piſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot:
I will therefore be ſo bold as to comment
upon your Epiſtle, the better to helpe his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and then I leave him to his owne
<hi>Genius</hi> to retaine or reject his old opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
judgement of diſeaſes by the ſight of the
Urine.</p>
            <p>And now (Maſter Doctour for your Epiſtle)
you begin it thus, firſt you write, That the diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and finding out of diſeaſes by the ſight
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15179:46"/>
of the Urine onely, is a very difficult matter.</p>
            <p>It is very true, Maſter Doctour, that you have
ſaid; it is a very difficult matter (indeed) to finde
out diſeaſes by the ſight of the Urine onely, but
theſe your words implie that it may be done, and
that you your ſelfe have arrived at the Haven of
this knowledge, and that moſt other men have
come farre ſhort of it. Herein, Maſter Doctour,
that which you implie is meerely falſe; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> nor <hi>Galen,</hi> nor your ſelfe (who
think not your ſelfe inferiour unto them) did ever
attaine unto this knowledge: but however you
will not be aſhamed to aſſume and arrogate it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your ſelfe (becauſe it is put upon you, and you
can make a ſhift to delude ſuch Novices,) and to
derogate what you can from other men: and this
is very common to you with moſt other men of
our Profeſſion. If you had written thus to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
(Sir it is impoſſible to give true judgement
of diſeaſes by the ſight of the Urine only, which is
but one of the many ſignes which together, with
the knowledge of divers other Symptoms (which
the Urine ſheweth not, do determine the diſeaſe)
you had ſaid but truth, and ſhewed your ſelfe to
have beene an honeſt man. But hang honeſty,
what care you for it? ſo that you carry the matter
ſo faire, that you be not caught in your knavery.
You thinke, that if you had written ſo to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
hee would have ſuſpected your skill, and
therefore you will rather ſmother the truth to
maintaine this your pretended skill (though you
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15179:47"/>
be conſcious to your ſelfe that you are a Knave for
your labour) than you will have your skill que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned,
though you have ſpoken truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
plaid the part of an honeſt man: for then you
thinke you ſhould likewiſe loſe your Patient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you ſay, That you have according to
your Patients deſire, written unto him what you
deſcerne by his Urine. To which I anſwer, that if
the Urine ſhew you any thing, which I queſtion
much in ſuch a caſe, you write a great deale more
than you perceive in the water, and that (if you
will be an honeſt man) you muſt often fruſtrate
the deſire and expectation of your Patients,
which you may doe, and yet give them content
too, if you carry the matter diſcreetly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Maſter Doctour, you write, That your
Patient (as you conceive) is troubled with Rhume
ariſing from the ſtomach unto the head, and from
thence diſtilling againe upon the lower parts; but
what part it moſt oppreſſeth, or what place it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth,
(which is moſt true, but yet there will be
no notice taken of theſe words) you know not.</p>
            <p>I anſwer unto this, that you doe not (from the
vvater) gather this, but from his complexion and
conſtitution of body vvhich you knovv and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
vvithall: for neither doth any Urine ſo
certainely betoken either Phlegme, Rhume, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
or Melancholy, but that (by reaſon of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
variations that it is ſubject unto) it may (falſly)
pretend any of theſe humours to be predominant,
and ſo be farre diſtant from the conjecturall and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15179:47"/>
probable Canons of the Piſſe-pot-ſcience: but
admit, Maſter Doctour, that this Urine had beene
brought you from a Stranger, whoſe conſtitution
you had not known, I preſume that you would have
enquired very narrowly what conſtitution of body
the ſicke party had been of, whether a leane ſpare,
a groſſe and fat man, or of a middle temperature
and habit of body, as alſo how long he had beene
ſicke, and whether he went up and downe or no,
before you pronounce your judgement of the
Urine: and then, if it chance to be true that you
ſpeke or write, you can make him beleeve, that
you perceive it by the Urine; but if it be falſe, that
you have ſaid, you can make it good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Maſter Doctour, you write, That you
have a great ſuſpicion (which is a word that might
call you judgement into ſuſpition, but that your
Patient is very confident of your skill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will give it a favorable conſtruction) that
this Rhume did chiefly poſſeſſe his ſtomach, and
that his ſtomach was now become nauſeous and
loathed meat, and did not digeſt it being eaten:
and your Patient beleeves that you perceive his
ſtomach is poſſeſſed with this humour, &amp; that you
perceive alſo by it that his ſtomach is nauſeous,
deſires not meat, nor digeſts it being eaten: but
here, Maſter Doctour, you are too cunning for
him; he writes unto you for your judgement of
his Urine, and you are afraid, that if you doe not
ſatisfie his deſire, he will ſeeke advice ſomewhere
elſe: you therefore thinke that you were as good
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15179:48"/>
deceive him as another man. You read his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and they only deſire your judgement of his
Urine, but doe not ſhew you any thing how he is
affected: you looke upon his water, and that
importeth no diſeaſe at all: you tell the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
looking upon the water (as if you there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it) that he goes up and downe, and the
meſſenger anſwers that he doth. You likewiſe
know his conſtitution to be ſpare and thin, and
what humour is predominant in the complexion
&amp; temperature of the ſame. You take all theſe into
conſideration: and firſt collect that he is not very
well, becauſe he hath ſent unto you his Urine; and
deſires your advice of it: Secondly, you conceive
that he is not very ill, becauſe hee walks up and
downe, and his Urine doth not import any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
at all. Thirdly, you know his complexion to
be (for ſo I ſuppoſe it) Phlegmaticke. And now
you conclude (he neither being ſicke nor well,
and his complexion Phlegmaticke) that he cannot
have a good ſtomach to his meat, and therefore
you determine the cauſe of his ſickneſſe to be
Phlegme in the ſtomach: ſo you write unto him
that he is troubled with Rhume in the ſtomach ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from thence, and diſtilling downe thither
againe, cauſed nauſeouſneſſe, and want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
and digeſtion, and your Patient thinks you
perceive all theſe things by his Urine: never drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that you collect from the forenamed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
(namely his complexion, his going up and
downe, and his Urine not importing any diſeaſe)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15179:48"/>
that he was troubled with Rhume in the ſtomch;
nor once imagining that you adde the nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his ſtomach, want of appetite and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
as conſequent effects of this precedent
cauſe (Phlegme in the ſtomach) but thinkes that
you perceive them all ſeverally in the water:
whereas indeed, you perceive none of them at
all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Maſter Doctour, you adde, That your
Patients Spleene is ill affected by reaſon of the
impurity of his ſtomach: and he thinks likewiſe
that you perceive this in his water: if his Spleene
be not ill affected at all, yet he will thinke it to be,
becauſe you ſay ſo: and if it be ill affected, it is
not to be diſcerned in the Urine, but is (you well
know) <hi>Cacochymiae ſoboles,</hi> the off-ſpring of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which followeth (very) often crudity of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, You further adde, that his head and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
parts are aſſaulted with a noxious vapour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from his Spleem, which makes him ſad,
and that hee cannot take his reſt, or at leaſt that
his ſleeps are very troubleſome, hee ſtill thinkes
that his water ſhewes all this, not knowing that
theſe are neceſſary conſequences of a crude ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and a Rheumatick conſtitution: he never
conſiders, Maſter Doctour, (as you doe) that thoſe
that are on the ſodaine diſtempered (though they
be but a little ill) doe not take their reſt, or at leſt
have troubleſome ſleep: but thinks that the
Urine (according to the ſeverall parts of it) doth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15179:49"/>
ſhew the diſeaſe of the ſeverall parts of the body:
he therefore thinks, that the Circle ſhews the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes
of the head, the Center of the truncke or
middle part of the body, and the lower part the
diſeaſes of the lower parts of the body: and ſo by
conſequence the diſeaſe of the Toe is to be found
in the very loweſt part of the Urine; but the paines
in the head or Toes, are neither to be perceived
by the upper-moſt or lower-moſt part of the Urine
nor by any other part of it. Yet a ſilenced Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in Kent, who was become an <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi>
being asked by a friend of mine (when he had,
by this fallacious way of giving judgement upon
an Vrine, reckoned up a Paine in the head,
amongſt other Symptomes) whether hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Vrine, that the party had a paine in
the head, he anſwered, yes: looke you here (quoth
he) this Circle or Ring, by ſome marks that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in it, doth ſhew me that the party hath a
paine in the head. He might as well have worne
the Surplice, and baptized with the Croſſe,
againſt his conſcience, as to make a common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of lying againſt his conſcience wilfully.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, You adde that he is troubled with
wind in the belly &amp; Hypochondres; which is like-wiſe
incident to Phlegmatick conſtitutions, but is
not (as he ſuppoſeth) to be perceived in the Urine.</p>
            <p>Eightly, You adde that he ſeemeth to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
feveriſh: you doe not perceive this in the
water neither, yet you know that whoſoever is
not well doth <hi>(vel febre laborare, vel ſebricitare)</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:15179:49"/>
labour either of a Fever, or is feveriſh; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have added this to helpe at a pinch, for
you know not certainely, but that his feveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
may be greater than you ſuſpect: his heat
may be ſuch, as that he may expect that you ſpeake
ſomething of his Liver, for hee thinkes that it is
over-hot; but you can tell him that hee cannot
have a Fever, but that his Liver muſt be inflamed.
In fine (Maſter Doctour) whether he he have a Fever
or no Fever, you have hit the nayle on the head,
and he believes that you have written nothing but
what you perceived in the water; but if it pleaſe
him to read an expoſition upon your Letters, hee
ſhall perceive your cunning to be <hi>(vix frans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſta)</hi>
ſcarce honeſt cozening. You determined
his diſeaſe (as he told me) to be <hi>Flatus Hypochan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacus,</hi>
when you ſaw him, that is, wind in thoſe
parts called the Hypochondres: but it was (as he
confeſſed to me) <hi>Flatus Hypochondrunckicus,</hi> or
(as I thinke I may fitly call it) the druncken Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
<hi>ex crapulâ contractus,</hi> taken by a drunken
ſurfeite. It skills not what his diſeaſe was, nor
how he tooke it; I doe not meane to ſcandall him
for it, ſince he is recovered of it; I rather beſtow
this <hi>Recipe</hi> upon him, by the way of prevention,

becauſe hee heareth women clatter ſuch things

is a loving man to his wife, for which I thinke

likewiſe, very punctuall and carefully, how ſhe
is affected: namely, that ſhe hath a nauſeous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
loathes meat, longs after trifles, and is apt
to vomit after ſhe hath eaten: now all theſe are
evident ſignes of Conception, if ſhe be a childing-woman,

read his Letters, and therein finds enough to his
purpoſe, and a great deale more than the Urine
ſheweth, from whence he may boldly pronounce
her to be with child, though he never looke upon
the water at all: yet (having read the Letters) hee
taketh the Vrine, and before the meſſenger that
brought it) falls to peering into it, to ſeeme to
find that there, for which he hath brought it: and
ſo he betakes him to his pen and inke, to anſwer
theſe Letters, and (having deſcanted upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

as you ſee in his anſwer, which ſhewed him that

determines her to be with child, and that almoſt

him likewiſe to write how hee is affected,

what other unuſuall ſymptomes the partie now
laboureth of: as whether he have a vomiting or

likevviſe vvhether he have a cough, or ſtitch, or

then (on Gods Name) let them alſo ſend their V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine

that ever he vouchſafe to looke upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
ſtrictly examine all thoſe, or the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that I have named: Then let him take the
Water and looke upon it, and pronounce the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
But if he take the water, and begin to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a deſcription of a diſeaſe by the ſight of
the Urine alone, before he have examined thoſe
circumſtances; he makes but a foole of thee, and
is (for his labour) but an impoſtour, and a knave
himſelfe. I had not thought that this impoſture
had crept into this Citie, or been connived at by
thoſe that have power to ſuppreſſe it: But here it
is ſo exerciſed, that ſome refuſe to be informed of
thoſe circumſtances (to the end that they may
purchaſe the more fame) till they have ſhewed
their jugling skill upon the Urine. A friend of
mine told me (very lately) that hee carried his
Urine unto a Dutch Doctour (naming the man) to
have his judgement of it: Now this man was ſo
faint and weake, that he was faine to reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
three or foure times by the way, and had his
diſeaſe written more manifeſtly in his face than
in his water; and now being arrived at the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
houſe, and admitted unto his preſence, he
begins to tell the Doctour that he had nor beene
very well (which the Doctour perceived very
well by his countenance) a good while, and that
he had made hard ſhift to come unto him; and
was ready, preſenting him his Urine withall, to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15179:56"/>
declare unto him further how he had beene affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
but this Butter-box interrupted him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I pray forbeare to tell me any thing, yet I
will tell you your diſeaſe by your water: Was
this (thinke you) an hard matter to doe, to tell
the Gentleman (whoſe ſickneſſe was written in
his fore-head, who had told the Doctour that he
had not been very well a good while, and whoſe
complexion and conſtitution of body ſhewed the
Doctour vvhat diſeaſes he vvas moſt ſubject unto)
vvhat vvas his diſeaſe? He might have done that
vvithout the Urine, though his Patient had ſaid
no more unto him: Yet to ſhevv his Uroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
skill to the end that his fame may be the
more ſpread for the ſame, hee takes the Urine
(though he diſcerne no diſeaſe by the ſame) and
pronounceth his opinion from it. I hope you
vvill (in time) perceive your ovvne errours, and

if you chance to recover, you impute the cauſe

it was Gods providence not (as yet) to take this

partie unto himſelfe, and that this raſcally Quack
(for medicines uſed by an ignorant Quacke, are
ſaid to be poyſons; but being uſed by a skilfull
Phyſician, they are ſaid to be Gods owne helping

you are no more able to judge of than a blinde

that they are skillfull men: but yet, in reſpect

            <p>You erre likewiſe, when (being deſtitute of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

thee in the choice of an able and convenient
Phyſician in the time of a violent and dangerous
ſickneſſe. <hi>Take therefore,</hi> (and that in time) ſuch
a Phyſician as is authorized and allowed, either
by the Univerſities, or by the learned College
of Phyſicians of <hi>London:</hi> In the choice of ſuch a
one, who is ſo allowed and approved of, have
ſome reſpect unto his dwelling, and other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and conſider with thy ſelfe whether by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſſe
of place, or multitude of imploiments,
he can give that attendance, that thy need may
require. For in diſeaſes of danger, it were very
convenient that the Phyſician did ſee his Patient,
(if it were poſſible) three times in a day: ſo hee
ſhould often obſerve ſomething or other in the
ſicke party, that might divert him from his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
purpoſe, and direct him a ſafer way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

purſes will not reach to the gratifying of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian

no man ſhake off that Phyſician whom he hath firſt
entertained; but let him (if he pleaſe) take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(in briefe) ſuffice to direct in the choice of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
for I had no purpoſe to touch upon this
ſubject, but only to ſhew the fallacies and jugling,
that is uſed in giving judgement of diſeaſes by the
Urine, with the dangers that inſuethe preſcribing

have not therefore ſatisfied thee in this latter,
read Doctour <hi>Cotta</hi> his booke, called, <hi>A ſhort
