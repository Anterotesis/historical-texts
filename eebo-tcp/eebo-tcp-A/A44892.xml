            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>OUR firſt Parents, READER, were turned out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe for their Diſobedience: Many of their Poſterity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by their Disbelief of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings, to turn Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe out of the World. To ſtop and correct this Humour, ſeveral Learned Books have been put in Print; and this, the laſt of all.</p>
            <p>It was writ by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and much Celebrated <hi>Peter Daniel Huet,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:48265:3"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Copy was ſcarce, and like to be ſo; and the Argument ſo uſeful in theſe days: It hath been judged very expedient to put it forth in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Atheiſts and Scoffers, whom the Pſalmiſt calls Peſts, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally demand, <hi>What's become of Paradiſe? Shew us the place in the Maps?</hi> And if this be not done for them (they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lazy) with all exactneſs, butted and bounded by Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Latitude; hedged in with Degrees, and Minute Meaſures; atteſted alſo by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> they will ſlide into a disbelief firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> then of the whole Bible, and laſtly of all revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48265:3"/>This great and wiſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath pitched upon that very Method, which this ſort of Men call for. He treateth the cauſe and queſtion with good profane Hiſtory (which they ſo much love) and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Teſtimony. Could the Situation of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s <hi>Tadmor,</hi> the courſe of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Timavus</hi> be ſo clearly deſcribed and ſet out; I ſuppoſe theſe Men would ceaſe their Diſputings about thoſe Matters. In the preſent Controverſie they are more yare. For ſhould they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Satisfaction in this Point, they muſt alter, retract, and part with many other their ill grounded Perſwaſions. They mightily doubt the reality of
<pb facs="tcp:48265:4"/>
the Torments of <hi>Hell,</hi> becauſe they have not yet found it proved to be <hi>Local.</hi> This is very difficult to prove; for ſhould <hi>one come from the Dead, they would not believe him.</hi> I ſee no way more probable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their diſtruſt, than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; But who ought to be at the <hi>Pains</hi> and Coſt of it, but they that want to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced? Well then; If theſe Men ſtand to their own Principles, they muſt henceforth allow the Hiſtory of Paradiſe; for it is here ſo fully and plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced to be <hi>Local,</hi> as any thing can poſſibly be, ſo diſtant in time, and remote in Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

I made you that promiſe when many of us being met
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48265:14"/>
together, before the hour appointed for our Academical Exerciſes, there was ſome talk about the Situation of the Earthly Paradiſe, occaſioned by a Bible that lay open upon the Table at the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> I told you at that time my opinion concerning it; and as you were asking me the Proofs of what I ſuggeſted, and I was ready to give them, the Clock ſtruck, and broke off our diſcourſe; you only told me when we parted, that I ſhould not come off ſo: And I anſwered, That I very willingly did take upon me that Debt, and ſhould clear it one time or other. I do it now, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and I'll endeavour that it may be in good coin. But to confeſs the truth in this, I do not ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Promiſe, as I follow my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. And, as I have had the honour for many years of being a Member of your Society, and having been received amongſt you in ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a manner, I am very glad to give you publickly this mark of my Thankfulneſs, and to ſhew the World that I glory in the title of being with you a Member of the Academy. But above all I moſt paſſionately deſire to expreſs the great Veneration I have for a Society ſo famous for the Vertue,

A matter as dark as this is, cannot be made clear but by theſe helps: I call it dark, for altho' the Wit and Learning of the Fathers of the Church, of the Interpreters of Holy Scripture, and of all ſorts of learned Men, hath been more employed about this matter than any other; and altho' it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an infinite number of Books, yet there is hardly any certainty in it.

They placed it under the artick Pole, in <hi>Tartaria,</hi> in the place where now is the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. Others have placed it as far as the extremity of the South, in the Land of Fire. Many will have it to be in the Eaſt, either along the ſides of the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> or in the Iſle of <hi>Ceilan,</hi> deriving alſo the name of <hi>Indies</hi> from the word <hi>Eden,</hi> which is the name of the Province where Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe ſtood.

They are no leſs divided about the Onyx, being uncertain whether it is really the Onyx, or the Sardonyx, or the Beryl, or the Carbuncle, or the Cryſtal. The <hi>Gehon,</hi> which was another branch of the ſame River that ſprung out of Paradiſe, is the <hi>Nile,</hi> according to the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

This he declares in ſome places of his Writings, and he ſpeaks of it, as if the work had been already finiſhed, and as if his <hi>Phaleg</hi> had been but a ſequel of it. Yet I heard from one of his Relations, that after his Death they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amongſt his Papers, but a very imperfect draught of his deſign, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48265:17"/>
even doth not declare what opinion he was of. It were to be wiſhed that he had performed his Enterprize. No body was more capable to do it than he, by reaſon of the underſtanding he had of the letter of Holy Scripture, which he got by a very long Study, by reaſon of his great skill in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Tongues, and by reaſon of his being ſo well verſed in the Prophane Authors. He hath a little declared his mind upon this queſtion in ſome places of his Works, but ſo variouſly that he ſeems to contradict himſelf, for in his<note place="margin">Boch Phal. l. 1. c. 4.

                  <hi>Phaleg</hi> he places Paradiſe about <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> and in his Book <hi>of the Animals mentioned in Holy Scripture,</hi> he ſeems to be almoſt of the opinion of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who placed it upon the ſides of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> joyned together; in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> between the City of <hi>Apamea</hi> and the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf. However being long uncertain whether the Relations of Mr. <hi>Bochart</hi> would find at laſt in his Cloſet that work perfected, as he had inſinuated, I ſtill deferred to collect my Obſervations: But ſeeing that after four and twenty years, which is the time that this learned Man hath been dead, no body gives us hopes of any ſuch work, I'll try to give ſome light to this matter.</p>

The Situation of the Earthly<note place="margin">The Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned do not agree with the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who deſcribes it exactly.</note> Paradiſe ſeems to me ſo exactly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by theſe words, that I very often wondred at the Interpreters ſhutting their eyes at it, to give way to ſo many frivolous Conjectures, who have ſo little relation to it; for if you ask for example thoſe who place it in <hi>Syria</hi> near <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where be thoſe four Rivers, and thoſe Regions of <hi>Chavilah</hi> and <hi>Chus,</hi> they let you ſtay without any anſwer at all.

<pb facs="tcp:48265:19"/>
where may then be the Countries of <hi>Chavilah</hi> and <hi>Chus,</hi> they are forced to ſet them in ſuch places as contradict the Teſtimony of all Antiquity. If one objects to thoſe who fanſied that the <hi>Nile</hi> was the <hi>Gehon,</hi> and the <hi>Ganges</hi> the <hi>Phiſon;</hi> the diſtance of their Springs, and thoſe of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates:</hi> They defend themſelves by Miracles, or by Fictions, giving out what they think may be, inſtead of what is, and affirm, without any proof, that the Spring of thoſe four Rivers was really in Paradiſe; but that after having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that delightful place, they dived into the Earth, and went to look for ſome other Sources, towards the end of the World, through ſome ſubterraneous Canals. Thus humane minds go aſtray, when once they ſwerve from Truth.</p>
               <p>III.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48265:19"/>
do make, between the place of their coming together, and that of their going one from another, before they fall into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Canal made ſome turnings or windings; I ſay, to ſpeak more preciſely of it, that Paradiſe was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon one of thoſe turnings, and likely upon the Southern Branch of the biggeſt, which hath been marked by <hi>Agathodaemon</hi> in the Geographical Tables of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> when that River comes Eaſtward again, after having made a long turning towards the Weſt, about 32 Degrees 39 minutes Northern Latitude, and 80 Degrees 10 minutes Longitude, according to the Delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Agathodaemon,</hi> very near the place where he ſets <hi>Aracca,</hi> which is <hi>Erec</hi> in Scripture. Now my deſign is not to examine whether the Poſition of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> be right, it ſuffices me to have delivered my opinion. I add to it, that the four heads of this River are the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> before their coming together, and the two Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels that carry it into the Sea after it has divided it ſelf; that the more Weſtern of theſe two Channels is the <hi>Phiſon,</hi> that the Country of <hi>Chavilah,</hi> through which it goeth, is part of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and part of <hi>Arabia De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerta;</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48265:20"/>
that the <hi>Gehon</hi> is the Eaſtern Channel of the two aforementioned, and that the Country of <hi>Chus</hi> is <hi>Suſiana.</hi>

But beſides that the Authority of the Rabbins, who have daubed and cruſted over with their Points the Hebrew Text of Scripture, is not of great weight, and that I do not ſee that the modern Grammarians do approve of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, I'll diſcover the falſeneſs of<note place="margin">The Prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion added to the word <hi>Eden,</hi> makes it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that it is the name of a place.</note> it, when I ſhall inquire after the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country of <hi>Eden.</hi>

               <p>II. I am not contrary to that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and I grant that the Word<note place="margin">Mikkedem <hi>may ſignifie both Time and Place; but here it ſignifies chiefly Place.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48265:28"/>
Orientem.</hi> And the Lord God planted a Garden in <hi>Eden,</hi> overagainſt the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> It is plain, that only the reſpect he had for the Three ancient <hi>Graecian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, <hi>Aquila, Theodotion,</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> made him alter the <hi>Italick</hi> Tranſlation in this Place, and made him infer out of the Words they made uſe of, That Paradiſe had been created by God before Heaven and Earth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs this <hi>Italick</hi> Tranſlation, from whom this place of our Vulgar Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation hath been taken, was made uſe of even from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, long before and after St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s time, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all the Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> before all the other Tranſlations.

Chriſtians by that Situation to turn to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> in making their Prayers. The chief Reaſon for it given by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> is, ſay they, to put us in mind, when we look toward that part of the World, where that delicious Placo ſtood, of the Happineſs we have loſt by the Sin of our firſt Father; and of the Care we ought to take for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of it. But it ſeems more probable to me, that the Church brought in this Cuſtom to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it ſelf from the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Temple was turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Weſt;</hi> as it is likely that the <hi>Jews</hi> placed theirs ſo, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from their Neighbours, who for the moſt part were Idolaters, and Worſhippers of the Sun, and made their Prayers towards the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> which Idolatry had crept in amongſt the People of God, and is condemned by <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And it is a remarkable thing,<note place="margin">Ezek. 8. 16</note> that as the ancient Religion, I mean the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> ordered that Prayers ſhould be made towards the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and that afterwards the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion altered this Cuſtom, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that Prayers ſhould be made towards the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> So the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did build their Temples toward the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which Cuſtom was ſince abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,

He denoted it plainly enough, when he named the four Chanels or Rivers, which grew from that diviſion. Thoſe four Rivers were ſo well known in the places where <hi>Moſes</hi> then was, and to thoſe to whom he wrote, that it was enough to name them that they might be known. Yet he was not contented with it; and as if he had foreſeen that future Ages, and far Nations, who were alſo concerned in the deſign of his work, might want ſome clearing of this matter, he gave ſo evident tokens to make thoſe Rivers

known, that no Man can miſtake them but for want of heed; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but eaſily perceive that the four Rivers which divided the great River of Paradiſe, were the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> above it; and under it the two branches which divide the common Chanel of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> before it falls into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf.

The <hi>Euphrates</hi> takes its courſe towards the Weſt, the <hi>Tigris</hi> towards the Eaſt; and they incompaſs <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> one of the moſt famous and fruitful Countries upon Earth.

Of the five Chanels that carry the Water of the <hi>Euphrates</hi> into the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and many Lakes, four have been made by the Induſtry of Men; that only which run through the great City of <hi>Babylon</hi> is natural.

the Sea, as it happened to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> by reaſon of the frequent Cuts made by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. But ſo great a River as the<note place="margin">The <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> had at firſt but one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel which joined it to the <hi>Tigris.</hi> But many others have ſince been drawn out of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Euphrates,</hi> ſwelled with many Rivers, and increaſed every Summer by the melted Snows and Torrents from the Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> was able enough in thoſe beginnings to make two Chanels, becauſe it afterwards made ſo many others. Some were firſt made, only to prevent the Overflowings that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the Country; their number was ſince increaſed, to water ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as wanted Water. <hi>Nebuchado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozor,</hi> who was a very great Prince, and undertook many high things, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized himſelf in thoſe Works; and that he might free that Country from the Waters of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> under which it was wholly drowned, digged the chief Chanels; and to prevent the Country from growing dry, he made very large Ponds and Sluces, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered that unruly River, and its trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Waters. But tho' this great quantity of Water might at firſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Canal that fell into the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and that which ran towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> and entred into the Sea, it is yet more credible, that the <hi>Euphrates</hi> had but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48265:42"/>
one natural Canal, by which it emptied it ſelf into the <hi>Tigris;</hi> and that the other which diverted it towards the Weſt, was the work of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> All the Ancients, and even thoſe who beſt deſcribed theſe Canals made by hand, do affirm ſo conſtantly that the <hi>Euphrates</hi> joined naturally with the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and that thoſe who digged ſome others, did but follow the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, that the contrary can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid without raſhneſs. We read in an ancient Fragment of <hi>Abydenus,</hi> quoted by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that all that Land<note place="margin">Euſeb. praep. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. l. 9. c. 41.</note> was at firſt ſo covered with Water, that it was called the Sea. This could not be, but by the overflowing of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> whoſe Chanel is very high; ſo that when it found any way to come out, it was by a natural fall carried into the flat Country of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and having ran over it, it neceſſarily fell into the <hi>Tigris,</hi> which was near and whoſe Chanel was very low. And this obliged <hi>Trajan</hi> to leave off the deſign which he had, to draw a new Trench from the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> to the <hi>Tigris,</hi> that Boats might be brought thither, of which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make a Bridge over the <hi>Tigris.</hi> He was afraid that too great a draining
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48265:43"/>
ſhould happen of the Waters of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and that it ſhould become innavigable.</p>
               <p>IV. Theſe Overflowings being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented<note place="margin">Other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels yet drawn from the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</hi>

The <hi>Arabians</hi> following that example, to avoid a contrary evil, I mean the drought of their Sandy Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to divert the Waters of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> and to draw them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and having watered their Soil, they let the overplus run into the Sea. This overplus was dried up ſince by new Cuttings. It may be alſo that this Conduit was but a Torrent, which in Summer run into the Sea, when the <hi>Euphrates</hi> overflowed. However, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who by reaſon of a long Poſſeſſion conſidered theſe Waters as their own, oppoſed this Theft of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aroſe great Quarrels betwixt thoſe Nations. It ſeems, that to make an end of thoſe Quarrels, and reſtore to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> what belonged to them, <hi>Alexander</hi> undertook to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the <hi>Euphrates</hi> in its former Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, by ſtopping the Canal called
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48265:43"/>
                  <hi>Pallacopas</hi> which made that River run another way. Thoſe that digged this Ditch, had no other deſign but to hinder the Overflowings of this River, which happened every Summer, by conveying its Waters into Ponds and Meers; but the <hi>Babylonians</hi> Territory remaining dry throughout all the reſt of the Year, and that of the <hi>Arabians</hi> injoying the benefit of it, <hi>Alexander</hi> deſigned to reſtore things to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer State, as a Governor of <hi>Babylon</hi> had before undertaken to do. The work was begun, but the death of that Prince hindred it from being finiſhed then, as it hath been ſince. <hi>Alexander</hi> viewed ſeveral of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, cauſed them to be made clean, opened ſome, ſtopped others, and cauſed ſome new ones to be made. Many other Princes took the ſame care. One may ſee ſtill, along the common Chanel of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> on the right hand and on the left, many Canals made by the Induſtry of Men. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> who did not underſtand Navigation, neither Commerce, or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fights, and being afraid that their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould be invaded, by means of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> cauſed Falls and Cataracts to be made in many places

                  <hi>Phiſon.</hi> The word <hi>River</hi> muſt be ſupplied here, which the ſacred Author expreſſeth afterward when he ſpeaks of the other Rivers. This is the firſt of the four, into which the great River that went out of <hi>Eden</hi> and Paradiſe was divided. It would be a very great undertaking, very tedious to the Reader, and yet more to me, to relate in particular the different opinions Men have had about this River, the Names of the Authors that maintained them, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereon they grounded them; and to loſe time in examining and contradicting them. I will only touch upon them by the bye, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they cannot be better confuted, than by carefully ſeeking after the Truth, and endeavouring firmly to eſtabliſh it, when it is found;

for this being done, every thing that will not agree with it, muſt neceſſarily fall of it ſelf. The moſt ancient and generally liked opinion is, That the <hi>Phiſon</hi> is the <hi>Ganges.</hi> It ſeems that <hi>Joſephus</hi> was the firſt Author of it;<note place="margin">Joſeph.

The Beauty, Riches and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies<note place="margin">The grounds of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> of that River wherewith the Books of Travellers are filled, are the chief reaſons why Men gave credit to that opinion; for tho' <hi>Arrian</hi> hath written that all the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> ſubdued, had no Gold, yet<note place="margin">Exped.

So the Beauty and Riches of the <hi>Ganges</hi> made Men believe, that it came out of Paradiſe, and this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was the occaſion of its being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Holy.</hi> But beſides, as thoſe who pretend that the <hi>Phiſon</hi> is the <hi>Ganges,</hi> do alſo perſwade themſelves that the <hi>Gehon</hi> is the <hi>Nile,</hi> we diſcover another Motive, that inclined them to give credit to that opinion.

having once found the Country of <hi>Chavilah</hi> where there was plenty of <hi>Gold, Pearls,</hi> and <hi>precious Stones,</hi> they had alſo found in it a River that had any communication with the <hi>Gehon, Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> they had argued very rationally, to inferr, that that River was the <hi>Phiſon.</hi> But inſtead of that, they placed the <hi>Phiſon</hi> where they pleaſed, and as it happened; and then they called <hi>Chavilah,</hi> that Land they had choſen, to place the <hi>Phiſon</hi> in. And as the two moſt common opinions are, that the <hi>Phiſon</hi> is the <hi>Ganges,</hi> or that it is the eaſterly Canal of thoſe two which do divide the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> after their being joined; ſo the two moſt common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning <hi>Chavilah,</hi> are, that it is that part of the <hi>Indies</hi> which the <hi>Ganges</hi> runneth through, as moſt of the <hi>Fathers</hi> believed; or that it is the <hi>Suſiana,</hi> which lieth on the Eaſt of that Canal. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> followed by<note place="margin">Joſeph.

Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that the Reader may not think I deſire to be truſted, for want of Money to pay him, I will name ſome few of thoſe, whoſe Authority cannot be excepted againſt. <hi>Nearchus;</hi> one of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains, that conducted his Fleet from the <hi>Indies,</hi> as far as the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf, ſpeaketh of an Iſland in that Gulf, abounding in Pearls of great value. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> of <hi>Charax,</hi> who lived<note place="margin">Iſidor. Charac. apud Athen. l. 3. Plin. l. 6. c. 28. &amp; l. 9. c. 35.</note> a little after, ſays the ſame thing. <hi>Pliny,</hi> having commended the Pearls of the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas, adds, that ſuch as are fiſhed towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Gulf, deſerve moſt to be praiſed: And in another place he takes notice of the Iſland of <hi>Tylos,</hi> as being the place of that fiſhing, which many ſuppoſe to be the Iſland of <hi>Baharen. Arrian,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Periplus of the Red Sea,</hi> ſets a greater value upon the Pearls of <hi>Arabia,</hi> than upon thoſe of the <hi>Indies. Aelian</hi> deſcribes exactly enough how<note place="margin">Aelian. de anim. l. 10. c. 13. &amp; l. 15. c. 8.

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:48265:60"/>
Pearls, thoſe of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> are of the greateſt value. We may ſee by theſe words, that he made the <hi>Perſian</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plin. l. 9. c. 35.</note> Sea a part of that of the <hi>Indies. Pliny</hi> doth the ſame.

ſuch an illuſtrious Perſon. But finding nothing of it in their Archives, nor in their Hiſtories, they put his Perſon, Name and Deeds, upon ſuch of their Kings, whoſe Life was moſt like to his. <hi>Amenophis</hi> ſeemed to them very proper to ſerve their turn, tho' he lived long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War of <hi>Troy.</hi> He had been war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in <hi>Aſia,</hi> he had been in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and had lived at <hi>Suſa.</hi> This agreeableneſs and likeneſs of names betwixt <hi>Memnon,</hi> and <hi>Amenophis,</hi> ſeemed to them a ſufficient ground to ſay, that they were one and the ſame. They built him Temples in many places, and eſpecially in the great City <hi>Thebes;</hi> they offered him Sacrifices, and worſhipped him as a God. They ſhewed in that City and other places, ſome Palaces which they called <hi>Memno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as were thoſe of <hi>Suſa.</hi> And there they ſet up to him that marvellous Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which made a merry and loud noiſe, when the Sun-riſing ſhined upon it; and ſeemed to groan and ſhed Tears, when the night drew near.

that <hi>Haoula</hi> is the Iſle of <hi>Ceilan,</hi> contrary to all probability, ſince he could not have gone thither in ſeven days.

I judge by that account, that thoſe Nations were <hi>Suſians,</hi> or their Off-ſpring, and that they learned of them the Art to make ſuch <hi>Solar-Statues,</hi> which were a kind of <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> which ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves to be what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> how frivolous are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of the Ancients about the Etymology of the word
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48265:79"/>
                  <hi>Tigris.</hi> Some believed that this River was ſo called by reaſon of the ſwiftneſs of its Stream, like to that of the Beaſt of the ſame name; others derive the name of the River and of the Beaſt from that of the Arrow, which they ſay, is called <hi>Tigris,</hi> by the <hi>Armenians, Medians,</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> We might confidently ſpeak of that Etymology, if the knowledge of the old <hi>Perſian</hi> Language was come unto us. Many words of it are paſſed into that which is now in uſe, and perhaps the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Tojor</hi> is of that number. It ſignifies <hi>an Arrow.</hi> That Etymology is not unlikely, for the <hi>Tiger</hi> which is the moſt nimble of all Beaſts, and the <hi>Tigris</hi> the ſwifteſt of all Rivers, could not be better compared than to an Arrow. It ſeems the Ancients have affected to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the rapidity of that River, by the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

Upon the ſame account <hi>Diodorus</hi> compared the <hi>Nile</hi> to<note place="margin">Diod. l. 1.</note> an Arrow, by reaſon of its ſwiftneſs. So the River <hi>Acis</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> got that name, which ſignifieth the point of an Arrow, by reaſon of the ſwiftneſs of its Stream.

It ſeems alſo that for the ſame reaſon the <hi>Tigris</hi> was called <hi>Sollax,</hi> or <hi>Sulax,</hi> which ſome Authors take notice of, and render by <gap reason="foreign">

Such is the Fruitfulneſs of the Country, and the Goodneſs of its Soil, which ſeemeth ſtill to keep ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of that Bleſſing God poured
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48265:85"/>
upon it. For, that Plentifulneſs was partly Supernatural, and partly Natural. <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, that God in order to<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 9.</note> make Paradiſe, <hi>cauſed to grow out of the Ground every Tree that is pleaſant to the</hi>

And there is no doubt to be made, but that place, framed by the hands of God in a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural manner, hath been the pattern, out of which the profane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Man in a delicious place, had made choice of a barren and unfruitful Soil, or of ſome horrid Wilderneſs, rather than of a plentiful Country, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beautified and inriched, ſince the beginning of the World. Now not only <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Coeleſyria,</hi> but alſo <hi>Babylonia,</hi> which extended it ſelf to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf, and a good part of <hi>Syria,</hi> were then the pleaſanteſt and richeſt Countries in the World. So that the Fruitfulneſs of the Gardens of <hi>Syria,</hi> the great care that People took for their Culture, and the great Plenty of their Pulſe and Pot-herbs, are grown into a Proverb. And that I may not go far from the Region where I placed Paradiſe, beginning at the Confluence of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened near the City of <hi>Apamea,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) unto their mouth, their ſides, (as well towards <hi>Suſiana,</hi> as towards <hi>Arabia</hi>) are every way as Beautiful and Fertile as any other Country in <hi>Aſia.</hi> I do not mean that thoſe Delights are found there, which the hand of God did ſpread to form Paradiſe; nor all thoſe that the labour of Men can procure: I only mean that the Ground is extraordinary good, and that Nature made it capable of all kind of Culture; though it be true that it

very ſeldom Rains there, and that its Plentifulneſs is meerly owing to the Goodneſs of its Soil, and to the Rivers that water it. This we learn from the old and new Hiſtorians and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and without producing here a long Series of Quotations, it will ſuffice to ſay, that by reaſon of thoſe Delights and Beauties, the Province where Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe ſtood was called <hi>Eden,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> the name of the Iſland <hi>Chader,</hi> formed by the <hi>Phiſon</hi> and <hi>Gehon,</hi> declareth its beauty; <hi>Chadaron</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>I. WE are now to anſwer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections<note place="margin">Firſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> which have been made againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in what they agree with ours, and thoſe that can be made againſt us. It hath firſt been objected that that River formed by the coming together of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> called at preſent the River of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf only through one mouth; from whence it follows, that the two Chanels of its diviſion, which I would have to be the <hi>Phiſon</hi> and the <hi>Gehon,</hi> are two imaginary Chanels. I already ſhewed, by the Authority of ancient Writers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Travellers, the Falſeneſs of that Objection. The occaſion of this Errour was, becauſe that River in dividing it ſelf, encloſeth a pretty large extent of Land, called formerly <hi>Meſſene,</hi> and now
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48265:90"/>
                  <hi>Chader.</hi> If we look upon that Land only as upon an Iſland ſituated in the midſt of the mouth of the River, one may truly ſay, that the River hath but one mouth; but it will be yet more true to ſay, that this mouth being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by a great Iſland above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Leagues long, as <hi>Teixeira</hi> who was an Eye-witneſs aſſures it, and above one degree wide, according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Maps, is made up of two Branches very diſtant from one another, having each of them their particular mouth. So that that River hath one or two mouths, according to the divers manners of conſidering them. It hath but one mouth, ſeparated by a very great Iſland; or it hath two mouths, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of the two branches, into which it is divided.</p>
               <p>II. They object in the ſecond place,<note place="margin">Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> that thoſe two Branches are no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Rivers from the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> ſince they come out of them, and by conſequence that we do not ſet forth the four Rivers which came out of Paradiſe, as the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeem to require. But it is plain that this is but a queſtion of names only, it is no new thing that a River changeth its name in dividing it ſelf. One might very well ſay of the City of <hi>Cologne,</hi> that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48265:91"/>
it is watered by a River, which divides it ſelf into four Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moſel,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Yſſel</hi> and the <hi>Vahal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The third Objection is yet more<note place="margin">Third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> Frivolous than the former. What <hi>Moſes</hi> calls Heads, muſt be underſtood, ſay they, of the Springs of the four Rivers, and not of their Extremities on the places of their joining and parting. They do not allow that the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Raſchim,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> makes uſe of, that of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Seventy Interpreters, and that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pita</hi> in the vulgar Tranſlation, doth ſignifie Fountains. There are in thoſe Tongues proper words to ſignifie Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and there is no reaſon to think that <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Tranſlators ſhould not have made uſe of thoſe proper words, inſtead of ambiguous ones. Thoſe they made uſe of ſignifie new entrances into divers Chanels of Rivers, in regard to the Situation of the Earthly Paradiſe. But this hath been already ſaid.</p>
               <p>IV. Let us come to the laſt Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Fourth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> that can be made againſt our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and is the moſt rational. Many ancient Authors witneſs that the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> entred formerly into the Sea by a peculiar mouth; but that the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> called <hi>Scenites,</hi> and many other
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48265:91"/>
Nations that dwell along that River, having by a great many cuttings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it into their dry Soils, have at laſt weakned it ſo much, that it was not able to get into the Sea, but loſt it ſelf in Meers. It ran towards the Weſt, and <hi>Arabia,</hi> between the place where <hi>Moſes</hi> was writing his Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, and the Chanel which I call <hi>Phiſon.</hi> From whence it follows, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> mentioned the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he could mean nothing elſe than that Chanel, which then was the true <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> and had not yet been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by cuttings, and which could not be taken for one of the four Heads, that I ſuppoſe he hath ſpoken of. And it alſo follows, that in the Enumeration he made of the four Rivers, and which I ſuppoſe he begun with the neareſt to him, he ought to have begun with the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> I already obviated this objection, when I ſaid it was moſt probable that that Chanel of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which fell into the Sea by a peculiar mouth, was nothing but a turned part of the body of thoſe Waters, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſtole from that River to water their Soils, and that thoſe People at laſt dried up that Chanel by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual diverting of its Waters. Art
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48265:92"/>
having been thus deſtroyed by Art, things have been reſtored to the State in which they were in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time. It is alſo perhaps nothing elſe but a Torrent cauſed by the Overflowings of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which ſometimes went as far as the Sea, and ſometimes ſtaid by the way. It went as far as the Sea, when thoſe Overflowings filled the Cuttings and the Meers made by the coming together of the Waters of thoſe Cuttings; and it ſtaid by the way, when the Overflowing of <hi>Euphrates</hi> had cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But though this Canal ſhould be as old as the Earthly Paradiſe, our opinion would ſubſiſt, provided we be ſure, as we moſt certainly are upon the Teſtimony of Antiquity, and by the natural diſpoſition of places, that the <hi>Euphrates</hi> was joined with the <hi>Tigris.</hi> For although that branch of the <hi>Euphrates</hi> were ſituated between <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> was writing, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel which I ſuppoſe to be the <hi>Phiſon,</hi> it was poſſible that <hi>Moſes</hi> had no regard to it, and only conſidered the four Rivers that did belong to his deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I. I Think I have done what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<note place="margin">God planted a Garden in <hi>Eden</hi> Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> to my ſelf, and have ſo lidly made good that the Earthly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48265:93"/>
Paradiſe was ſituated on the River made by the coming together of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and now called the River of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> between that coming together, and the dividing of the ſame River, before its entring into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea. But becauſe the proofs I produced, being ſcattered, may perhaps make the leſſer impreſſion upon the Reader's mind, they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him better, if they are joined, and ſhew themſelves altogether to him. <hi>Moſes</hi> then ſays, <hi>That God planted a Garden in</hi> Eden. We find a Province of that name along that River, and towards the place that I marked. That Province deſerved the name of <hi>Eden,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> by reaſon of its Pleaſantneſs and Fertility. Although moſt part of it is not cultivated now<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>a-days, it nevertheleſs ſeems to retain yet ſome marks of the bountiful hand of God in the goodneſs of its Soil. That Garden was ſituated <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> that is to ſay, in the eaſterly part of the Land of <hi>Eden,</hi> on both ſides of the River. This may alſo ſignifie that eaſterly ſide, which in the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the running of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> had the name of <hi>Kedem,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as a Proper, and not as an Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive name. Even as the Lands ſituated
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48265:93"/>
on the weſterly ſide, had the proper name of <hi>Ereb,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Weſt,</hi> from whence <hi>Arabia</hi> took its name. So that <hi>Moſes</hi> would give us to underſtand, that Paradiſe, at leaſt its greateſt and chiefeſt part, was placed on the eaſterly ſide of the River. Beſides the natural goodneſs of that Country, God beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it in an extraordinary manner, to make Paradiſe out of it, in making <hi>grow out of the ground every Tree that is pleaſant to the ſight and good for food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>That River went out of</hi> Eden <hi>to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A River went out of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden.</note> 
                  <hi>water the Garden;</hi> that is to ſay, that having ran through that Province, it entred into the Garden; which being at the Eaſt of <hi>Eden,</hi> the River at the place where it entred into the Garden, muſt have run from the Weſt to the Eaſt; and by conſequence it muſt have been ſituated upon one of the turnings of the River, which runs that way. And ſince it makes no turning more conſiderable, between its joining, and dividing, than that great one which is to be ſeen in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Maps, it is the moſt likely thing in the World, that Paradiſe was placed on the eaſterly end of the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly branch of that turning. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Maps do not repreſent it; but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48265:94"/>
we muſt not forget that the Art and Induſtry of Men brought conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Alterations to the running of thoſe Rivers. They mark this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little from the Weſt to the Eaſt, between the coming together of the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the City of <hi>Baſſora.</hi> Though the running of the Waters had been diſpoſed ſo ſince the time of the Earthly Paradiſe, and not according to the ancient Maps, it would yet agree with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>III. This River being conſidered<note place="margin">It divided it ſelf and became into four heads.</note> in reſpect to the Garden, according to the diſpoſition of its Chanel, and not according to the running of its Waters, <hi>divided it ſelf and was</hi> parted, not into four Springs, as ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters believed, but <hi>into four heads,</hi> that is to ſay, into four entries or apartures of four different branches. Theſe four branches were four Rivers; two above in regard to the running of the Water, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Tigris;</hi> two below, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Phiſon</hi> and the <hi>Gehon.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48265:94"/>
with the <hi>Phiſon,</hi> which I ſay is the more weſterly Chanel of the two into which the River is divided, before its entring into the Sea; becauſe it was the very next to the place where he was writing, and preſented it ſelf firſt to his Mind, as it had preſented it ſelf firſt to his Eyes and Feet, if he had gone that way.
