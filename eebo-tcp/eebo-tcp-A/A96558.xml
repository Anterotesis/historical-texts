         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>How infinitely does this Glorious Goodneſs and Condeſcention to His People outſhine His Predeceſſors! To inſtance no farther back then the two laſt Reigns, Time has been when the National Eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> has been ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the conſideration of the Crown, that our very Meeting of Parliaments have dwindled into little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uſe, than, <hi>Give us more of your Money, and leſs of your Counſels;</hi> and ſcarce one good Act for the benefit of the Subject obtain'd without the tacking of a Money-Bill at the End of it. Nay, and when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would not drain faſt enough, we have wretchedly truck'd to <hi>France</hi> to help out the count. But not to rake into the Aſhes of one, or the misfortune of the other, what between the Effeminacy of one Reign, and the Bigotry of the other, what unaccountable ſumms, and as unaccountably conſumed, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and preverted directly contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Original Donation, the great End they were given for?</p>
               <p>But this long Soveraign fault amended, (not to mention all the other long blemiſhes in the Imperial Scutcheon, waſht off in the Perſon of our preſent <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> GRACIOUS KING,) as vaſt a Revenue as the Chimney-money may be, yet conſidering the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Partiality of it, together with the Cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, (for never ſo <hi>uneven</hi> a Tax was formed.) He conſiders the Delight of disburthening His People above the Gratification of filling His Exchequer: And as weighty a Crown Jewel as it is, He thinks His Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem (on that only ſtore) ſhines <hi>brighter,</hi> though not <hi>richer,</hi> without it. And undoubtedly this one unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented Act of Royal Grace, attended with all the Circumſtances of ſuch a Voluntary Tender, (even ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly and ſeparate from that unbounded Goodneſs, and thoſe Accumulated Glories we have ſo large a future proſpect of, from ſo promiſing a Reign,) is ſufficient of it ſelf alone to ſtand a REGAL MONUMENT.</p>
               <p>And now my Friends and Neighbours, after a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Farewel to your Chimney-Money, liſten to ſome few Comforts in ſtore for you. The poor Country Wife may now boyl her Childs Milk, or her Husbands Gruel, without endangering the Conſiſcation of her Skillet or Crock, for the uſe of a Chimney to warm it in. The poor Labourer, that out of his Weeks Wages can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to a Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Days-Joint of Meat, need not fear the loſs of his Spit on <hi>Monday,</hi> for eating of Roaſt-Meat on <hi>Sunday;</hi> with the hearty Wiſh too, perhaps at the Tail on't, that the Chimney-Money-Statute-Makers were ſpitted and roaſted after it.</p>
