            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first saw the <hi>Empress</hi> of <hi>Morocco,</hi> though I found it then to be a Rapsody of non-sense, I was very well contented to have let it pass, that the Reputation of a new Authour might not be wholly damn'd; but that he might be encourag'd to make his Audience some part of amends another time. In order to this, I strain'd a point of Conscience to cry up some passages of the Play, which I hop'd would recommend it to the liking of the more favourable <hi>Judges.</hi> But the ill report it had from those that had seen it at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> had already done its Buisness with Iudicious Men. It was generally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd by them; and but for the help of Scenes and Habits, and a Dancing Tree, even the <hi>Ludgate</hi> Audience had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken it. After this ill success, one would have thought the Poet should have been sufficiently mortified, and though he were not naturally modest, should at least have deferr'd the showing of his Impudence till a fitter season. But instead of this, he has written before his Play, the most arrogant, calumniating, ill manner'd, and senseless Preface I ever saw. This upstart illiterate Scribler, who lies more open to censure then any writer of the Age, comes amongst the Poets, like one of the Earth-born Brethren, and his first buisness
<pb facs="tcp:54618:3"/>
in the World is, to Attack and Murder all his Fellows. This I confess rais'd a little Indignation in me, as much as I was capable of, for so contemptible a Wretch, and made me think it somewhat necessary that he should be made an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to the discouragement of all such petulant Ill Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that he should be dragg'd out of that Obscurity to which his own Poetry would for ever have condemn'd him. I knew indeed that to Write against him, was to do him too great an Honour: But I consider'd <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> had done it before to <hi>Deeker,</hi> our Authors Pred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cessor, whom he chastis'd in his Poet aster under the Character of <hi>Crispinus</hi>; and brought him in Vomiting up his Fustian and Non-sense. Should our Poet have been introduc'd in the same manner, he must have disgorg'd his whole Play ere he had been cleans'd. Never did I see such a confus'd heap of false Grammar, improper English, strain'd Hyperboles, and downright Bulls. His Plot is incoherent and full of absurdities; and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his Persons so ill chosen, that they are all either Knaves or Fools; only his Knaves are Fools into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and so must be of necessity while they are in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement. They all speake alike, and without distinction of Character: That is, every one Rants and Swaggers, and talks Non-sense abundantly. He steals notoriously from his Contemporaries; but he so alters the property, by disguising his Theft in ill English, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>citas incipit esse tuus.</hi> A Poet when he sees his thoughts in so ill a dress, is asham'd to confess they ever belong'd to him. For the Latine and Greek Authors, he had certainly done them the same injurie he has done the English, but that he has the excuse of <hi>Aretine</hi> for not railing against
<pb facs="tcp:54618:3"/>
God: he Steals not from them, because he never knew them. In short, he's an Animal of a most deplor'd understanding, without Reading &amp; Conversation: his being is in a twilight of Sence, and some glimmering of thought, which he can never fashion either into Wit or English. His Stile is Boisterous and Rough Hewen: his Rhyme incorrigibly lewd, and his numbers perpetually harsh and ill sounding. That little Talent which he has is Fancy. He sometimes labours with a thought, but with the Pudder he makes to bring it into the World, 'tis commonly Still-born: so that for want of Learning and Elocution, he will never be able to express any thing either naturally or justly. This subjects him on all occasions to false allusions, and mistaken points of Wit. As for Iudgment he has not the least grain of it: and therefore all his Plays will be a mere confusion. What a beastly Pattern of a King, whom he intends vertuous, has he shown in his <hi>Muley Labas</hi>? Yet he is the only person who is kept to his Character; for he is a perpetual Fool: and I dare undertake that if he were Play'd by <hi>Nokes,</hi> who Acted just such another Monarch in <hi>Mackbeth,</hi> it would give new life to the Play, and do it more good then all its Devils. But of all Women, the Lord Bless us from his <hi>Laula</hi>: no body can be safe from her; she is so naturally mischievous, that she kills without the least occasion, for the mere Letchery of Blood-shed. I suspect he took her Character from the poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woman, who, they say, makes almost as little ceremony of a Murder as that Queen. It were endless to run over the rest; but they are all of the same S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>amp: He has a heavy hand at Fools, and a great felicity in writing Non-sense for them. Fools they will be in spight of him. His King, his two Empresses, his Villain and his Sub-villain, nay
<pb facs="tcp:54618:4"/>
his <hi>Heroe</hi> have all a certain natural cast of the Father: one turn of the Countenance goes through all his Children. Their Folly was born and bred in 'em; and something of the <hi>Elkanah</hi> will be visible. Our Poet in writing Fools, has very much in him of that Sign-post Painter, who was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous only for drawing Roses; when a Vintner desir'd him to paint him a Lyon, he answer'd he would do it to content him, but he was sure it would be like a Rose. Yet since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Audience are much of his levell, and both the great Vulgar and the small (as Mr. <hi>Cowly</hi> calls them) are apt to admire what they do not understand; <hi>(omne ignotum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent pro magnifico)</hi> and think all which rumbles is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick: It will be no wonder if he pass for a great Authour amongst Town Fools and City Wits. With these Men, they who laugh at him, will be thought envious, for they will be sure to rise up in Arms for Non-sense, and violently defend a cause, in which they are engag'd by the tyes of Nature and Education. But it will be for the benefit of Mankind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to observe what kind of People they are, who frequent this Play: that Men of common sense may know whom to shun. Yet I dare assure the Reader, that one half of the faults and absurdities are not shown; what is here, is only Selected Fustian, Impertinence, and false Grammar. There is as much behind as would reasonably damn as many Plays as there are Acts: for <hi>I</hi> am sure there are no four Lines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which are free from some errour; and commonly a gross one. But here is enough to take a tast of him: to have observ'd all, were to have swell'd a Volume, and have made you pay as dear for a Fools Picture, as you have done for his Tragedy with Sculptures.</p>

            <p>What a Medley of confounded stuff is here? <hi>in the publick honours you have condescended</hi>; condescend honours is a new and a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per phrase. <hi>To grant this Play and its Authour, have heightned my sense.</hi> Here he distinguishes betwixt himself and the Authour of the Play; if spoke with design, it is the only thing in the Epistle that has Wit in it; for no one but would be ashamed of owning such a Play; but there is very little reason to think that is his design, and so I must place it among the rest of his Fustian. <hi>Besides the publick honours you have condescended â€” have heightned</hi>: Here is have â€” have twice. And then what tolerable connexion is there in the words? <hi>This Play which for no other merit,</hi> i. e, No other merit then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours condescended; he makes conferring of honours to confer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

But perhaps he will say, he means the Story only is his Lordships; <hi>The Story of which I owe to your hands.</hi> What, did his hands tell the Story? they say indeed that in <hi>Spain,</hi> persons that cannot get access to each other to talk, have a knack of imparting their minds by their fingers and thumbs; but this needed not to have been used in this case. The too frequent access he has had to this Great and Noble Person, is that which swells him to this arrogance. Besides, if he owes the Story to his Lordships hands, why does he pay it to his feet? This is robbing <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul.</hi> Every thing that he does, as well as all he writes must be incongruous. But I do also say, the Story is not his Lordships, I mean as this Poet has manag'd it; for though I know not what story he received, yet I am pretty sure it never was this barbarous and ridiculous Tale that he has pester'd us with. He may well tell his Lordship, <hi>he throws it at his Feet as his own</hi>: that is, as it were his own; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now to collect, if possible, out of this heap of Rubbish, the grounds we heard so much talk of: The sum total amounts to no more then this: <hi>the honours condescended,</hi> &amp;c Favours from a Person of Honour, are incomparable grounds for being Sawcy with him. Truly, ingenious Men they use to render more modest and submissive; but Fools it seems more arrogant. <hi>And this heightned his sense of Gratitude beyond his power of expressing it.</hi> And this so transported our Poet, he has not been able to speak one wise word. Poor Poet! he has it seems a very weak head, he cannot bear a little favour, but he must presently be intoxicated; and in his Drink he has another infirmity, to be Sawcy. But is this all he has to brag of? Other Scriblers for ought he knows may be fuddled with Favour, and sawcy in their Drink as well as he; and then why must they be jerked and he be stroked: What equity is there in that?

I have tyred my self and I fear my Reader, with raking into the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less absurdities of this Epistle; there are many more, almost as many as words; but I shall but touch at some few, and the next that offers it self, is I think worth observing.</p>
            <q>I present it to your Patronage, as the <hi>Jews</hi> made their Sacrifices, which we read took Fire from Heaven: <hi>the Incence</hi> was lighted by that Divinity to whom it was offered.</q>
            <p>Here he compares presenting to making, and has Tautology upon Tautology, <hi>Made</hi> and <hi>Offered, Fired</hi> and <hi>Lighted, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> and which is most gross of all, <hi>Incence</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must be added to the Tautology: for it is apparent he takes 'em to be the same. He says he presented it, <hi>as the Iews made their Sacrifices, which we read took fire from Heaven.</hi> How did the <hi>Iews</hi> make such Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Answ. <hi>The Incence was lighted by the Divinity to whom it was offer'd.</hi> Besides, the absurdity of saying the same thing over again, as if I should ask one how the paper come to be blotted, and he should answer me by blotting the paper; It further appears he takes them to be the same, by his saying that of Incence which was only true of Sacrifice: for Sacrifice indeed did take Fire from Heaven, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence it is known, had a distinct Altar appointed for it, and if he would but have vouchsafed to have looked into the Bible, he might have found Incence was lighted by the Priest, with a Coal from the Altar of Sacrifice; but I suppose he avoids reading the Bible, as he says he does other books, for fear of spoiling his Fancy. I do not wonder he cannot distinguish betwixt Sense and Bulls, sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Poet sure never learnt his Accidence, no ten lines pass him without false English; but he does by Tenses as he does by Words and Sentences, put 'em together Higglety Pigglety, first that come into his head first served, and what stuff they make when they come together he is unconcerned at.</p>

But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this is that Honourable Persons first Essay, the next Poet he is pleased to make, perhaps will be better. 'Ere I let this pass, I must beg pardon, if tracing the footsteps of this Impudent Scribler, I use any unfitting freedom; but I am thrust upon it by my Authour, whose non-sensicall and arrogant Epistle, like a Fanatick Prayer is hard ro expose without seeming profaneness, and entrenching upon things that are Sacred.</p>
            <q>And if this Play live or have success enough to preserve a Name, 'tis by being your Creature, and enjoying your Smiles.</q>
            <p>Then the Play will live and live Merrily; for it is impossible for any one to abstain from Smiling that ever sees or reads it, it is so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant a Tragedy. <hi>Will<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Doll</hi> the Sculptor too, has a little helped on the Mirth with his Sculptures, if the charge of 'em like the double rates at Foolish operaes, does not spoil the Mirth among our Poets upper Gallery Friends, and make 'em see his Plays with Smiles upon their Brows, as in the fourth Act he makes his Queen-Mother meet Death, that is with Frowns. <hi>But that which is an abuse</hi> to them <hi>is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to the Book-Seller, who whisper'd the Poet and told him, Sir, your Play had misfortune,</hi> was thought a little non-sensical, <hi>and all that</hi>â€”but if you would be at the charge of a Sculpture or two â€” <hi>the Poet takes the hint</hi>; lets the Book-seller (as 'tis said) pick his Pocket â€” <hi>and all that â€” 'Tis not to be imagin'd how far</hi> a Sculpture or two at the Poets charge, <hi>goes to make the Book-seller Rich,</hi> and the Poet Ridiculous. I will conclude my observations on this Epistle with four lines of our Poets.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Kings Bounties act like the Suns courteous Smiles,</l>
               <l>Whose race produce kind Flowers on fruitful Soiles;</l>
               <l>But cast on barren Sands and baser Earth,</l>
               <l>Only breed poysons, and give Monsters Birth.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I will not engage in the non-sense of these lines, my buisness here being only to return his Simile upon him, and leave the examination of the non-sense of the expression to another place, it being too much for this, witness the plenty contained but in the first line.</p>

               <l>Kings Bounties act like the Suns courteous Smiles.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He calls a Smile courteous, and says a Kings Bounty acts like a Smile; it had been more like sense to have said Kings in their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties act like Smiles; and yet it had been ridiculous enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb facs="tcp:54618:8"/>
a King to a Smile. But I observe our Poet is much delighted with Smiles, and they are things that have great power over him.</p>
            <p>In his Epilogue to <hi>Cambises,</hi> he begg'd Smiles to help him to write a Play.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Faith for once grant it, that the World may say,</l>
               <l>Your Smiles have been the Authour of a Play.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In this Epistle he begs his Patrons Smiles to preserve his Play. And in his Epilogue to this Play he begs Smiles in general for the Scribling Trade.</p>
            <q>
               <l>So your kind Smiles advance the Scribling Trade.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Oh: Witty Smiles, what cannot Smiles do? write Plays, preserve Plays, and advance Play-making! sure Smiles cannot but be very proud of themselves. But I doubt our Poet means he will write the Plays, and Smiles shall have the credit of them; an excellent Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle! Truly if Smiles get no more credit by their Plays, then they get by <hi>Morocco,</hi> Smiles will give over Smiling, or Smile upon the Brow; which is worse. And I believe Smiles cannot but be vext, that they were drawn in to be the Authours of a Play, since it was such a wretched one. A barbarous thing it is of the Poet, with his non-sense to force Smiles to Smile, and then accuse Smiles of all his non-sense. If this be the trade, there will be no end of Smiling and Non-sense; for his Non-sense will beget Smiles, and Smiles will beget Non-sense, and so to the end of the Chapter, unless Smiles convinced of the evil consequence contain themselves though never so much provok'd. But to apply his Simile: <hi>As the Suns raies cast on fruitful Soils produce Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but on barren Sands and baser Earth only breed Monsters and Poisons,</hi> (where by the way it is hard to find any baser Earth then barren Sands, nor are those Sands properly barren that produce poisons, nor the Womb that breeds Monsters, but the Sands or Womb that produce nothing.) So the favours of persons of Honour and Generosity cast on ingenious Men, encourage them to produce excellent things, and are bestowed for the advantage of the World; but thrown away on such unimprovable Dunces as this, only produce such things as they say are bred of Sun and Slime in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> things half Mud and half Monster, and such another thing is this Play, a thing made up of Fustian and non-sense, which with much a do, after two years painful hatching, crawl'd out of the muddy head where it was engendred.</p>

To have said he had a knock in his Cradle, had been good sense, and every one would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it; but to damn him to Fetters before he was so much as in Swadling-cloaths, is very severe. But this kind of Figure is frequent with out Poet, who not only damns People before they die, as <hi>Pluto</hi> in the Masque does <hi>Orpheus,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Thy Breath has damn'd thee, thou shalt die,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But before they are born, and Routs Armies before they fight. As if our Poets Plays should be damn'd before they were made; to say our Poet is a damn'd Poet, is not only Sense but Truth; but to say his Plays are damn'd Plays before he writes them, is I think as great non-sense as any he can write.</p>

            </q>

               <l>Yet Fortune to great Courages is kind.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here he makes the King call himself a Man of small Courage; for immediately before he makes him complain of his Fetters, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of Fortunes unkindness to him, and here he says,
<q>
                  <l>Yet Fortune to great Courages is kind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>An excellent Character of a King both Fool and Coward. But perhaps he means Fortune is kind to great Courages in their very mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; and then it is absolute non-sense. That is; Great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages though unfortunate, are fortunate.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54618:10"/>
               <l>'Tis he wants liberty whose Soul's confin'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Then all the people in the world want liberty; for all their Souls are confin'd within their Bodies. But there is farther non-sense in it; for this Line is design'd for a proof of the former, else it is all empty Tautology.</p>
            <q>
               <l>'Tis he wants liberty whose Soul's confin'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He means not Corporal Liberty, it is plain; for his King who speaks it, and who would fain proove (if he would speak sense) that he does not want the nobler kind of Liberty which is that of the Mind, yet confesses himself to want the former, and shews his Fetters. And therefore the sense is, he who has a confin'd Soul, has a confin'd Soul. But if it relates to the former Line, there is this non-sence in it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Yet Fortune to great Courages is kind;</l>
               <l>'Tis he wants liberty whose Soul's confin'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>'Tis apparent, that great Courages and unconfin'd Souls are here the same thing, and then the sence is this: Great Courages, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confin'd Souls are unconfin'd by the kindness of Fortune; that is, great Courages are valiant by chance or by good luck.</p>
            <p>What stuff may not a silly unattending Audience swallow, wrapt up in Rhime; certainly our Poet writes by chance, is resolv'd upon the Rhime before hand, and for the rest of the Verse has a Lottery of words by him, and draws them that come next, let them make sense or non-sense when they come together he matters not that; and his luck is so bad, that he seldom hits upon any that agree any more, than so many Men of several Languages would do.</p>

            </q>
            <p>To pass by the non-sense of enslaving a Man to a walk, and to the walk of a Globe, a thing so improper for a walk, that a Woman up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Globe is the Embleme of Fortunes inconstancy; a Globe being a thing that no one can with ease so much as stand upon; and to the walk of a poor Globe, as if there could be poverty in a Globe; the whole is unintelligible Fustian. He brings in his foolish King, after he had as good as confest himself a Man of mean Courage, preferring himself before <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, but no body can tell in what. He
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54618:10"/>
says his thoughts out-fly that mighty Conqueror; that mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror never pretended to flying that I know. But I suppose he means his thoughts out-fly that mighty<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Conquerors thoughts; and then wherein? In this it seems; <hi>Alexanders</hi> thoughts were too big for the World, and <hi>Mulylabas</hi> his for a Prison. As if he should say: He scorned the World, but I scorn a Goale, he scorned Empires, but I scorn Fetters, I am a greater Man than he, because he was a greater Man than I; and my thoughts out-fly his, because his out-flew mine.</p>

            <p>The soft headed King is so blunder'd with <hi>Morena's</hi> non-sense, that he cannot bring out a plain word.</p>

               <l>And the same jealousie that made his breath</l>
               <l>Decree your Chains, made him pronounce your death.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This Poet has so perverse a fancy, that he inverts the whole order of nature; he will make people see with their Ears, and hear wth their Noses: Here he makes the old Emperour pronounce with no body knows what, and contrive and decree with his Breath. It is frequent with him to put one faculty upon an imployment which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another. If he tells you a man sees a thing, it is indifferent to him whether he tells you he sees with his Eyes or his Nose. But he is not so large in his Commissions to any thing as Breath. Here he makes Breath decree. In the next Page he makes it Paint, Write, Print, Guild, or something of that kind; for he says, â€”
<q>
                  <l>Whose couragious Breath,</l>
                  <l>Can set such glorious Characters on death.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Breath has Courage too, and in the second Act he makes it hear. â€”
<q>
                  <l>Her gentle Breath already from just fame.</l>
                  <l>Has kindly entertain'd your glorious name.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the third Act he gives he gives it Regal Dominion, the Queen Mother claims a supremacy above her Son the King, because
<q>
                  <l>She gave him Breath by which he does command.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And yet she gave him not Breath neither; at most she gave him but Lungs wherewith to breath, and the poor Fool might have sound
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54618:11"/>
Lungs and yet be still-born. Nay in the same Act he makes Breath transmigrate like Souls, and subsist after a Mans death in Parchment and Paper,
<q>
                  <l>For this guilt, our Prophets Breath,</l>
                  <l>Has in our sacred Laws pronounc'd your death.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It seems <hi>Mahomets</hi> Breath subsisted in his Books for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years after his death, a very strange Miracle, and could our Poet prove it to be true, he would do infinite service to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the <hi>Mufti</hi> could do no less than procure him to be made a <hi>Mamamouchi.</hi> But I am afraid this miracle, when all is done, is but a Cheat, is wholly subject to faith, and not to sense; being indeed all non-sense: For the Prophets breath subsists in the Book, and yet the Book I suppose does not breath, as if sight could be in Eyes and yet Eyes not see. To Conclude, breath can command the fates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. In the same Act the Queen mother says,
<q>
                  <l>You see the fates do their allegiance know,</l>
                  <l>And to my powerfull breath their conduct owe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is pleasant to make a Queen brag of her strong breath. Put any thing to exalt breath. Oh! wonderfull Breath! what canst thou not do? oh! Breath.</p>

               <l>Life is a Debt we to our Parents owe.</l>

            </q>
            <p>That attends that Breath. â€” The Poet is at Breath again, Breath can never scape him; and here he brings in a Breath that must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious with pronouncing a Sentence, and this Sentence is not to be pronounced till the condemned party bleeds; that is she must be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted first and sentenced after, and the pronouncing of this Sentence will be infectious, that is others will catch the disease of that Sentence, and this infecting of others will torment a mans self. The whole is thus, when she bleeds thou needest no greater Hell or Torment to thy

But the Poet perhaps makes a distinction betwixt Saluting and Greeting. Sea Captains do indeed observe differences in the manner of Saluting, according to what it is they Salute, a Merchant Man, a Man of War, or a Castle; but they know no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Saluting and Greeting, or rather Greeting seems a very absurd Tearm, for a Salutation at Sea. But the Poet seems to make it a higher sort of Salutation; observing still their Rules in Saluting: For if it be but an Emperour you meet with, then you are but to Salute with Breath; that is, to flash in the Pan only: But if a King, then Greet is the word, and you let off all the Thunder and Lightning; that is, you fire all your upper and lower Teer; for King is a more thundring Title than Emperour.</p>

            <p>Singers sure, and not Messengers make a Consort, and they make it with their Voices, and not with their Wings. And they are winged Messengers of Fire: by this it should appear he shot Bullets; for what else can he mean by Messengers of Fire? unless the Fire blew all the Guns in the Air; perhaps he means every Corn of Powder was a winged Messenger, and if so, their Wings must be small.</p>

He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Thunder, Lightning, and Roaring of Guns to Incense: And says thus; he expresses his loud Joys in a Consort of Thundring Guns, as Men send up silent Vows in gentle Incense.

But as he that pretended he would shew a Beast, which was very like a Horse, and was no Horse, set people much admiring what strange Animal it should be; but when they came in, and found it was nothing but a plain Grey Mare, laught a while at the conceit, but were ready after to stone the Fellow for his Impudence. So it must needs fare with our Poet, when his upper Gallery Fools discover they have tricks put upon them, and all that they have so ignorantly clapt, is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right non-sense. And for my part I cannot but admire, that not only to those who know, or at least have had time enough to learn, what sense is, but also to a people who of all Nations in the World pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to understand best what belongs to shiping, our Poet should dare to offer this Fustian for sense, and a description of Ships. A descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so ridiculous, that <hi>Mulylabas,</hi> as errant a Fool, and as ignorant of Ships as he is, must needs discover that he is abused; and that Ships cannot be such things as the Poet makes them: But the Poet has not only been so Impudent to expose all this stuff, but so arrogant to defend it with an Epistle; like a sawcy Booth-keeper, that when he had put a Cheat upon the people, would wrangle and fight with any that would not like it, or would offer to discover it; for which arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance our Poet receives this Correction, and to jerk him a little the sharper, I will not Transprose his Verse, but by the help of his own words trans non-sense sense, that by my stuff people may judge the better what his is.</p>

            <p>Poor King! the Poet makes thee here confess thy self fit to be beg'd for a Fool, and so chuse thy Cousin <hi>Mulyhamet</hi> for thy Guardian. But perhaps the Poet has a deeper search in Politiques, and would imply that that King who trusts a Subject to Conquer for him, makes himself the Conquerours ward, and deserves to be beg'd: But I doubt both Poet and King are too much Fool to have so wise a meaning. The former therefore must be the Poets design; and as if he had brought the King before a Court to be tryed whether he could count five, tie a Knot, and was fit to be beg'd or no, he makes him say,
<q>
                  <l>Conquest and Monarchy consistent are.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A wise Apothegme! implying it is possible for a Monarch to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, or a Conquerour to be, or to serve a Monarch. And the sense rises well too from the former Line. In the former he had said, a Conquerour is a Kings Guardian, or protects a King, and here he says he is consistent with a King; that is, he is a brave fellow, and 'tis possible for him to be an honest fellow: Just as if he had been askt, how many are the Five Vowels, and he had answered almost five. Poor King! thou art beg'd, there is no saving thy Estate; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Poet thinks he helps him in the next Line.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Not at all! this Line is as silly as any of the rest. [<hi>'Tis Victory secures!</hi>] That is, whilst we Conquer, we shall not be Conquered, and whilst we Conquer we are safe. As if he had been asked, which was safer to beat or to be beaten? and he answers, 'tis as safe a thing to beat as to be beaten. Now let us take the whole Speech together.

            <p>
               <hi>Mulyhamet</hi> by this Speech seems to be a kind of jeering Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; under pretence of complementing the King and his Sister, he abuses them both. The King he calls by craft a pittifull Optique Glass, a thing to see through, and he tells <hi>Mariamne</hi> that her love seen through that Optique Glass called a King, seems to be a greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness than it is indeed.

            </q>
            <p>That is, though <hi>Mariamne's</hi> love be the most glorious thing in the World; yet there is no Object so great or glorious, but what may put on a greater form than it hath, as the Sun does by the help of an Optique or Magnifying Glass.

               </gap>t is. No other tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable sense can be made of this Speech; for it would be most ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to say, no Objects are so great, but what may appear almost as great as they are, that would be as much as to say, no Objects are so great, but what may appear pretty great; as if it were wonder for great Objects to appear great; I wonder what should appear great, but great Objects. The wonder is, that no Object is so great, but may seem greater than it is by the help of Art, and saying this, he speaks sense, but then his allusion abuses <hi>Mariamne,</hi> as I said before, and affirms an Optique Glass makes the Sun look bigger than it is.

            </q>
            <p>Tributary Subjects again! But the King is beg'd, and so they only give him Tribute; I suppose he means a small allowance to maintain him, for an acknowledgement. Witness these two following Lines<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

               <l>The wearer and defender of a Crown.</l>
            </q>
            <p>It is something unusual for a Subject to sit on a Throne with a King, but it is his Guardian, whose authority sways all; as it appears by the next words.</p>

               <hi>Mulyh:</hi> â€” Lead on, â€” and all that kneel to you shall bow to me; this Conquest makes it due.</p>
            <p>The Kings word of command signified nothing, he is but a Cypher; and therefore his Protector <hi>Mulyhamet</hi> gives it; but yet to please the King they mock him with a Coronation, and have a fine Childish babble at it, a dancing Palm-tree, which dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Loyalty sings Musick, and sings a Consort of Hearts: This is like singing with anothers mouth, for one to sing a Consort, and sing the Consort of others.</p>

            <p>Fate sets Beauty in their way that has more power than it; here he puts false Grammar for Rhimes sake. And Fate sets Beauty in their way, which has more power than it self.

            <p>In the last Scene of the Third Act, <hi>Crimalhaz</hi> was in <hi>Morocco</hi>; 'tis a pretty leap <hi>Elkanah</hi> makes him take from thence to <hi>Atlas</hi> 130.

            </q>
            <p>Gold is prophane, because it takes Birth from <hi>infectious Earth, viz.</hi> Infection is Prophaneness; <hi>From Infectious Earth, and from Contagious Mines</hi>; that is, from, from, two froms to the same thing, then <hi>takes Birth</hi>; to be Born has a Passive signification, but to take Birth an Active one; and one that takes Birth is Author of his own Birth.</p>
            <p>Then he makes the same thing Sulphurous and Contagious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Sulphur is one of the best things in the world against Contagion, and then after it has taken Birth both from <hi>Infectious Earth and Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Mines,</hi>

            <p>Bounties are very like Smiles, besides he might have said Civil or Well-bred as well as Courteous, and Civil as well as kind Flowers: But his Epithetes never signifie any thing, but serve to make up his Verse. â€”

            <p>The Common Rout of Beauties is excellent sense, and a very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thing it is to run away with the Army whether the King would or no, which the Lord in the next Line but one calls a Flight of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but <hi>Muly Labas</hi> says no: He's a Traytor, subtilly found out.

            <p>Here he compares Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> Swords (as he names 'em before) to Mountains, which if any body should misplace; that is, whip 'em up, and carry 'em into the Sea, would turn Rocks <hi>ipso facto.</hi>

            <p>Here the Pious Queen Mother advises her Son to out-face <hi>Crimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz's</hi> Treason before it be Treason, <hi>viz.</hi> Out-face that which is now Treason before it be Treason. Besides the <hi>English</hi> of its Rise, Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is naught. Treason may begin its Rise, but Treasons Rise can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not begin of it self; for this he admires her Courage he tells her, but not her Wit, for he says,

            <p>If he means by Flight the Wit of Treason it must be thus, <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's a very witty thing which you do'nt understand</hi>; he takes her for as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a Fool as himself: But to pass by a great deal of non-sense; (for I pass by more than half) <hi>Muly Labas</hi> says,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For as he says in the precedent Line he can frown and <hi>bow (for bend) Crimalhaz's</hi> thoughts with his Brow, though he has no Arms; but the subsequent Line is,
<q>
                  <l>Heav'n is not Heav'n, though't lays its Thunder by.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As if any Fool believ'd that Thunder made it Heaven: Here he modestly compares himself to Heaven, and his having his Army ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him to Heavens voluntary laying its Thunder by: For if it wanted Thunder as he Arms, or could be rob'd of it, it were no Heaven as certainly as Mr. <hi>Settle</hi> is no Poet; but the Queen Mother says very well,

First therefore let us look on him in the judicious part of a Poet, his Plot, and the management of his Play<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> you see him stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the very beginning of the First Act; there his <hi>Morena</hi> tells the Story of her love to her lover; How he stole her away from her Fathers Court; where she (sayes this incorigible Dunce) was a Conspirator in her own Rape, and from thence brought her to <hi>Morocco,</hi> Where they were both imprisoned by his Father, and to be put to death for the stealing away of one another; Yet in the mean time, her Father is so far offended, that he is wageing Warr, against his; and coming with an Army against <hi>Morocco.</hi>

            <p>On this foundation of Nonsence his play is built.</p>

            <p>In the next place why should this <hi>Muley Labas</hi> steale her away, or, to follow our Authors Bull, ravish her with her own consent? who for ought we know might have had her for speaking.

his Seige: And for his Son he will execute him for suspition of treason! Who he a Traytor! I wonder his Father knew him no better than to suspect him of so much wit as goes to the makeing one! I dare say there was not one honest Citizen in the pit, but his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach was ready to rise to heare him so miscall'd: by the first twenty lines he spoke you might finde he was never like to make such a designing person.

He is certainly the most Innocent servant his Majesty has; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am sorry that I finde by the Gazette he must loose his priviledge of poet in extraordinary to his Majesty</p>
            <p>But what if after all this, <hi>Morena</hi> can furnish us with a reason why she maks this relation to her Lover, of what she suffered for him, will the Critticks he then contented? she tells him 'tis not to upbrayd him, but to arm his fancy for more pleasing formes: (that expression is non-sense too, by the way, to arme against an Enemy is proper, but to arme for a more pleasing form, that is where there is no danger, is ridiculonsly absurd:) but she wou'd say she relates their past troubles to make him taste the pleasures which must follow; For now his Father is grown kind; and has designd their mutual Happiness. This is good news indeed; and surprizes <hi>Muley Labas</hi> so much that he falls into a fit of nonsense (very natural to our Author) And in broken sentences, expresses his joy.

            <p>Well, from whencesoever the News arrives, <hi>Muley Labas</hi> is thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-struck with it: He wonders his Father should suspect him of Treason; and pray observe how he cleares himselfâ€”

And all these within the Sphere of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours activity. His argument runs thus: No Traitor can come within the Sphere of <hi>Morena,</hi> but I can come within the Sphere of <hi>Morena,</hi> therefore I am no Traitor: what could his Father reply to this; but that <hi>his Treason greater was for being small; And had been greater were it none at all.</hi>

This was a miserable shift of the Poet, to let the Audience know how the old <hi>Emperour</hi> Dyed: For she her self, could not be ignorant of it: She who was whor'd by <hi>Grimalhaz</hi> who set him on, and who could not have known her Husbands Death, but she must know the Circumstances also. So he did before in the first Scene betwixt <hi>Muley Labas</hi> and his <hi>Morena</hi>:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54618:40"/>
to make the Storie plaine to us he makes it told to those who knew it before, But we must excuse him he had but that one trick, and was forc'd to use it twice, like him who haveing but one Trump in his game takes it up to play again.</p>
            <p>After this you have a wonderful politick speech of the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> that she has onely set up her Son to throw him down: That he was not yet ripe for Ruine, till she had undermind his absent General; who being taken from him, the King would be left without a Prop, and then she might safely murther him to make way for her Lover <hi>Crimalhaz.</hi>

               </gap> they immediately possessed themselves of the Crown, now in their reach, Than if they waited for the Generals comming, who was a Friend to the King, and whom they were not certain they could render suspected to him: â€” But then the Play must have ended in the first Act, or the Poet had been to seek for a more reasonable Plot. But wanting that, he has drawn his buisness out at length; and like a Roguish Chyrurgeon has made a sore first, that he might make a cure afterwards.</p>
            <p>His Address is admirable too. He acquaints his Audience with what he intends to do; which is the way never to surprize them: As if a man who intended to cheat another, should tell him his design before hand.</p>
            <p>But what a Character of a Woman was here in his <hi>Queen-Mother</hi>: He designes her Bloody, and Cunning, and Ambitious: we will grant she might be unnaturall enough to commit Murthers on her nearest Relation: But no body was ever wicked for the sake of Wickedness, and without design. She was ambitious and Crafty, as well as Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and neither of those two Qualities were consistent with her Actions. For as she was ambitious she ought to have let her Husband have lived, because by his life she was a Queen. And as she was Crafty and Ambitious, she ought, when she had kild him, not to have overskipd the occasion of taking the Power again into her hands, to have pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed it with her Lover.</p>

            <p>By his Conquest he means <hi>Mariamne</hi>; whom it seems, he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken in, amongst the rest of his Saphees and Sallyes: But as I take it, 'tis not very Heroick in his Heroe, to assume to himself the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of his <hi>Mistress</hi>; nor savours of much good manners in him, to tell the <hi>Emperour</hi> that it is his due,</p>
            <p>To conclude the Absurdities of this Act; the <hi>Emperour</hi> gives <hi>Muly Hamet</hi> a Ring, that by shewing it he might be admitted to visit the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> who was a close mourner for her Husbands death; and was not to stir from her private Lodgings. Tis true, in decency she ought not: but yet our Poet, though he calls himself the Kings Servant, is a little forgetfull of the Court mode<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> He did not think time enough
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54618:42"/>
of the Ceremony; for after her Husbands death the <hi>Queen</hi> dowager appear'd in the first Act, to bring her Son the news in Prison: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears abroad again in the third Act, that is the next day after, to catch <hi>Mariamne</hi> with <hi>Muley Hamet:</hi> the onely excuse that can be found is that it may be there was a Prison in the Kings Palace; and that <hi>Muly Labas</hi> and after him <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> were onely sent to be whipt at the Porters Lodge.</p>
            <p>The third Act has more of buisness in it than the second, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is faller of Absurdities. Here it is that Poet <hi>Ninnyes</hi> play be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gins to thicken. <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> haveing the <hi>Emperours</hi> signet come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the next place 'tis to be considered that the <hi>Emperour</hi> gave his sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> in publick: So that the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Crimalhaz</hi> had fair warning of their danger.</p>
            <p>Then, though <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> gain'd admission into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he could not git into the Queens Lodgings without the notice of some of her Attendance: so that it was, impossibe he should have surpris'd the Lovers. Nay you see <hi>Achmat</hi> the <hi>Eunuch</hi> afterwards confesses that he met <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> and did not stop him; which makes the story more ridiculous<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for <hi>Achmat</hi> knew what was doing within, as being their confident a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in reason could not have made so great a mistake<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as to have let <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> passe without notice given.</p>
            <p>The Queens defence is yet more improbable: She sayes that <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> would have ravished her; and <hi>Crimalhaz</hi> came in to her rescue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> was in love with her Daughter, and came to ask her consent to the Marriage: He was a heroe indeed and a very bold one, to fly upon the old Gentlewoman with so much violence to forsake the Daughter for the Mother; and to attempt a rape in her own Seraglio, in the midst of her Servants: Yet <hi>Muley Labas</hi> is foole enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eive all this: But how came <hi>Crimalha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> to her rescue! He had not the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54618:42"/>
               <hi>Emperours</hi> signet too? did he drop from the Clouds into the Seraglio; this is so manifestly absur'd that it is not to be suffered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> all this while sayes nothing to the purpose in his own defence; but onely that their mystique Language does his sense con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and can th' eternal powers such Trechery permit oh horrour! and such balderdash stuff, he suffers himself to be run down without telling his own Story. Onely he offers <hi>Crimalhaz</hi> the duel in these words
<q>
                  <l>That justice by his hand might give him death</l>
                  <l>And stifle with his Blood his perjur'd breath.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Put that a man should stiffle anothers breath with his Blood, seems rather a desire to be his Hangman, than to fight with him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> is ever sure to take all things wrong: and therefore in stead of granting the Combat to <hi>Muley Hamet</hi>; he thinks his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a proof of his guilt. <hi>If you this rash attempt pursue, you'l make me thinks that what he sayes is true!</hi> That is if you will offer to cleare your selfe, I shall conclude you guilty. Admirably argued, If you dare fight, I am sure you are a Rascall. presently upon this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the sentence of his Death: And now what can the Poet do to save his heroe.</p>
            <p>Of all the world who could imagine the Queen Mother should be the Woman? yet the Poet makes use of her to do it: and gives his reason in these lines aside;
<q>
                  <l>But hold the King will then my cheat descry:</l>
                  <l>I wish his Death, who tamely see him die.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which i confess I either do not understand, or if I do they are flat non-sense. The Queen-Mother's great design with her Gallant was to ruine <hi>Muley Hamet:</hi> Now she has it in her power she sayes the King will descry her cheat, if she desires his Death. If the Poet had so thought fit, it was the onely way in the World to keepe her cheat undiscover'd: for who should reveale it when he was dead on whom it was practised; or doth he meane, the King will find out the Cheat, that she wishes his death is she tamely see him die; take his bad English in the most favourable meaning, Yet what reason had she to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e if the King knew she desired <hi>Muley Hamets</hi> death, who was supposed to have attempted a rape upon her!

            </q>
            <p>That is without reason, thought, or understanding: without sense I am sure.</p>
            <p>Another part of the Heroes Character is that he will not plead for himself because the Kings-Mother accuses him:
<q>
                  <l>Believe me her intended Ravisher</l>
                  <l>Appearing so I take the guilt from her.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A very well bred Heroe, to be hang'd out of pure respect to her who accused him.</p>
            <p>His Mistres coming to see him in Prison, and freeing him, is one of our Poets Generosityes: 'tis an usuall saying with him, that 'tis an easy thing to make an Heroicke play: Som forty rants and some four or five Generosityes and the buisness is done (at least for ought he knows But this Generosity, by his favour; was a very Senseless one for <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omne</hi> to free <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> because he had been false to love and would have ravished her own mother, I am affraid she had some other design in coming thither and hearing of his manhood in enterprising upon an old Woman, she thought he would do miracles to her.</p>
            <p>But how knew she he was in Prison: she was not by, when he was committed; and yet within Ten or Twelve lines, after his going off, she has not onely heard of it, but has gone to his Jaile and bribd his Keeper for his delivery, very quick work of a nimble witted Poet: and yet all this is suppos'd too: for we heare nothing of those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. So the Play goes forward till it comes to a broad place, and there the Authours comes tothe ditch leaps over with the Story, and leaves the plot to come after as it can.</p>
            <p>When it was not for his purpose that <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> should cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; then he had not a word to say in his own defence: But when the buisness is over he makes out his innocence to <hi>Mariomne:</hi> But when <hi>Muley Labas</hi> and that close mourner the <hi>Queen-mother</hi> came in the second time, he is bewitchd againe and cannot speake to the King. So though he be the Heroe and the <hi>Emperour</hi> the Foole of the Play, yet the the Foole rides the Heroe, and has the whip hand of him perpetually. Once more the King will have his blood, and once more the <hi>Queen-mother,</hi> whose second thoughts are no wiser than her first, would save him: At last tis concluded he must be banished. Upon this the old <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Crimalhaz</hi> plot a new to destroy him by an <hi>Ambuscade</hi> which they would lay for him, in his way to Banishment. They might have

done it more easily and less Suspiciously by the Kings otder and by Law; but they will needs wave the certain way for the uncertain, and the plausible for the Suspicious.

I can not find when Poets had Liberty from any Autority to write non-sense more then any other men, Nor is that Plea of <hi>Poetica Licentia</hi> used as a Subterfuge, by any but weake professors of of that Art, who are commonly given over to a mist of Fancy a buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of invention and a sound of something like Sense, and have no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54618:44"/>
use of Judgement: They never think throughly but the best of their thoughts are like those we have in dreams imperfect; which though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wee are often pleased with sleeping, we blush at wakeing. The licentious wildeness and extravagance of such mens conceits have made Poetry contemn'd by some, though it be very unjust for any to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Science for the Weakness of some of the Professors.</p>
            <p>Men that are given over to sancy onely, are little better then Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: What people say of Fire (<hi>Viz.</hi> That it is a good Servant, but an ill Master.) May not unaptly be applyed to Fancy, which when it is too active Rages, but when cooled aud allay'd by the Judgement, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces admirable Effects. But this rage of is Fancy never Mr. <hi>Settles</hi> crimes he has too much flegme, and too little Choller to be accused of this, He has all the pangs and throws of a fancyfull Poet, but is never deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of any more perfect issue of his Flegmatick braine, then a dull <hi>Dutchwomans</hi>-Sooterkin is of her body.</p>
            <p>His stile is very muddy, and yet much Lobour'd; for, his meaning (for Sense there is not much) is most commonly obscure, but never by reason of too much height, but Lowness. His Fancy never flyes out of sight, but often sinkes out of sight: But now I hope the Reader will excuse some digression upon the extravagant use of <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Poeticall Lycence.</hi>

So Wine use'd moderately does not take away the Judgement, but used continually debauches mens understandings; and turns 'em into Sots, makeing their heads continually hot by accident, as the others heads are by nature; so meer Poets and meer Musicians, are as sottish as meer Drunkards are, who live in a continuall mist without seeing, or judgeing any thing clearly.</p>

And besides this should have experience in all sorts of humours and manners of men: should be throughly skil'd in conversation, and should have a great Knowledge of mankind in generall. Mr. <hi>Settle</hi> haveing never studied any sort of Learning but Poetry, and that but slenderly as you may find by his Writeings, and haveing besides no other advantages, must make but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54618:44"/>
very lame work on't; He himselfe declares he neither reads, nor cares for Conversation, so that he would perswade us he is a kind of Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in Poetry, and has a light within him; and writes by an inspiration which (like that of the Heathen Prophets) a man must have no sense of his own when he receives, and no doubt some body would be thought inspired and would be reverenc'd extreamly in the Country where <hi>Santons</hi> are worship'd; But some will I doubt not object, That Poetry should not be reduced to the strictnesse of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> to which I answer it ought to be so far <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> as to have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Proportion, since they will all confess that it is a kind of Paintaing: But they will perhaps say that a Poem is a Picture to be seen at a distance, and therefore ought to be bigger then the life; I confess there must be a due distance allowd for the seeing of any thing in the World: For an object can no more be seen at all too neare, then too far off the eye; but granting that a Poem is a Picture to be viewd at a great distance, the distance and the bigness ought to be so suited, as though the Picture be much bigger then the life, yet it must not seem so, and what miserable mistakes some Poets make for want of Knowing this truly I leave to men of Sense to Judge, and by the way let us consider that drammatick Poetry, especially the English brings the Picture nearer the eye, then any other sort of poetry.</p>
            <p>But some will say after this, what Licence is left for Poets, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the same that good Poets ever tooke, without being faulty (for surely the best were so somtimes, because they were but men) and that Licence is <hi>Fiction,</hi> which kind of Poetry is like that of Landschap painting and poems of this nature, though they be not <hi>Vera</hi> ought to be <hi>Verisimilia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great art of poets is either the adorning and be autifying of truth or the inventing pleasing, and probable fictions. If they invent impossible fables, like some of <hi>Aesops,</hi> they ought to have such Morals couch'd under them as may tend to the instruction of mankind, or the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners; or they can be of no use nor can they really delight any (but such as would be pleas'd with <hi>Tom Thumb</hi>) without these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. But there are some pedants who will quit Authoritie from the ancients for the faults and extravagancies of some of the modernes, who being able to immitate nothing but the faults of the clasick Authours mistakes 'em for their excellencyes. I speake with all due reverence to the Antients for no man esteemes their perfections more then my self though I confess I have not that blind implicit faith in them which

some ignorant Schoolmasters would impose upon us to believe in all their errours and owne <hi>own all their crims</hi> to some pedants every thing in 'em is of that Authoritie that they will create a new Figure of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick upon the fault of an old poet. I am apt to believe the same faults were found in them, when they wrote which men of Sense find now; but not, and that those if mine excellencies in 'em as Schoolemasters would perswade us, Yet I must say now,
