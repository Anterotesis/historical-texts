            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And certainely as to Luther, I credit you, when ye accuſe him of falſe doctrine and his followers, becauſe he him ſelfe doth acknowledge his nature to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19324:36"/>
be ſo corrupted and defiled, that he can do no good at all. But that ye be not draw in frome your paritie, I gif alſo credit to Luther and his followers when they accuſe you of ſo many errours, and your patriarche Caluin of ſo great wickednes, becauſe he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges him ſelf of as good nature and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as Luther, and therefor can not tell the veritie ſincerely, as not being proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for ſo precious a worke which wold be ſpilt, if they touch it. Monſieur du Pleſſis hath no better opinion of mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in generall, as may be ſeene in the third book of the Euchariſtie cap. 17. not far from the end, where he ſeemeth to ſay that the grace of God can not mak good, that cometh of vs, becauſe that we mix in with Goddes work ſome of our owen particular honour, glorie, profit, and ſo that there is no good which we can do well, nor no ill but we can do ouer well: for ſo he ſpeaketh. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we read not that any, who hath beene ſent extraordinariely by God to preach the veritie, haue teached or propoſed in Godds name to be beleeued any falſe doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne And it is to be ſuppoſed that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſent Luther, hath alſo ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in all thinges he ſhould ſay or do in that charge and office: for otherwiſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19324:37"/>
ſeing the thinges that we should beleeue at aboue all naturall reaſon and humaine iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, how shall we know, if he, who is ſent by God, keep the direction which he hath receaued? if he be conuict in one falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he loſſeth credit in all the reſt, and there by diſappointeth his maiſters intent, who employeth him, Further it is certaine that God of his in finite wiſdome &amp; power, either choſhed or maked the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he will employ, and ſuffers not in theis great matters to go otherwiſe then he will &amp; our ſaluation requireth. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that man can be deceaued by God who is the veritie it ſelf. But ye will ſay that his doctrine who is ſent, should be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the word of God conteined in the ſcriptures: yea but he is come to interprete the ſcriptures to you and not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which I proue once againe in this ſort: He who is ſent a Paſtour and Doctour in the kirk of God, principally is ſent to preach the Doctrine, as he receaued it of the Doctour who ſent him: if he doeth otherwiſe, his commiſſion or procuration conteining no ſic thing as he hade donne, can not ſerue him: for who ſo euer cometh in the kirk with charge, cometh as procurer, and not as proprieter, wherefor he should do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his procuration, (becauſe he hath onely the handling of other mens goods and good) and not according to his fantaſie, as if all were his owen. Now if Luther the firſt of this new extraordinarie calling ſent you, it vvas to preach that ſame doctrine, which he preached &amp; hath deliuered to the world before he ſent you. If ye keep not that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, his miſſion ſerueth you to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So what doubt is but Luther hauing power to ſend them, hath power alſo to call them back if they paſt the boundes of his commiſſion?

the middes of their reformation, and ye alſo, deſtitute of all power and authoritie to excommunicat any man.

Sainct Paul: <hi>Ego enim accepi à Domino, quod &amp; tradidi vobis:</hi> there is no other witnes here but God and he. If ye of your reformed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie will giue them bothe, or any one of them the lie, I can not mend it, ſeing, it is ye, who hath gotten the charge to reforme the world, and ſo this may be accompted as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lie, with the which no man should be formalized: yet with licence I may vrge Caluins pretended right. If he ſpak &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te according to the direction that he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God how ſo euer thes thinges ſeemes ſtrange to you, yet should ye admitte them &amp; think, that they ar according to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: becauſe God is never contrarie to him ſelf, he being but one in diuerſe mouthes, &amp; not diuerſe in one mouth. how can it be poſſible that ye can better know, what char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge Caluin receaued of God, then he him ſelf, who was (as he and ye pretend) employed? We receaue without any contradiction or gaineſaying the writtes of the Prophetes and Euangeliſts with all the reſt of the holie bible, becauſe thes writters were ſent &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by God.
