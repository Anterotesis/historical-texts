            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE moſt Notorious <hi>Salamanca-Doctor, Titus Oates,</hi> after having ſignaliz'd his prodigious Parts, by the Deſtruction of ſeveral eminent Perſons, and hazarding the lives of God knows how many more; after having miraculouſly ſav'd his Majeſties Perſon from Poyſon, ſcrew'd Gu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and Conſecrated Dagger, and freed three Nations from imminent ruine; after having defeated the deſigns of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the plots of the greateſt Politicians in the world, though they had been hatching theſe 100 years paſt; and all this by meer <hi>Buke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blawing,</hi> and to the aſtoniſhment of the whole Chriſtian world, by <hi>the breath of his mouth;</hi> was at laſt put upon it, to try an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment or two to fix Property, which by Wiſe heads (that is by Needy or Covetous perſons, who wanted Biſhops or Crown-Lands) was thought to be in equal danger with our Religion. For if, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he could ſwear a friend to the cauſe into the right of forty or fifty thouſand Pounds, (which the Law it ſeems was ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in, as not to underſtand;) then <hi>true Proteſtants</hi> might have a compendious and infallible way to ſecure their Property againſt the encroachments of whatſoever Arbitrary, that is, Legal power. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to effect this wonderful project, he was pleaſed unhappily both for himſelf and me, (at the inſtigation of what <hi>Lord</hi> or Devil the <hi>Lord</hi> knows,) to beſtow a <hi>caſt of his office,</hi> on a friend who ſhall be nameleſs, and to ſtoop an oath or two at his ſervice, againſt ſo mean a perſon as my ſelf: not only engaging his <hi>Verbum Sacerdotis</hi> in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even where men ought to be very furious, before the King; but alſo Swearing, invocating the ſacred Majeſty of God, who will one day call him to account for it, to witneſs to the truth, when he aſſerted, that I was a <hi>Mahumetin,</hi> and had been thereupon Circumoiſed; and that alſo I was a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> having received Orders from the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> by the former charge making me unworthy of credit or reputation, uncapable of the advantages of converſe amongſt Chriſtians; and by the later, the milder indeed of the two, aiming only at my life, which as being a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is forfeited to the Law. I muſt indeed confeſs of all kinds of Deaths I have the leaſt fondneſs to be hanged, and I hate mortally that the butcherly Executioner ſhould be rummaging amongſt my Entrailes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither can I apprehend any pleaſure in being drawn up <hi>Halborn hill</hi> upon a Hurdle: therefore it was, that I had no mind to appear either
<pb facs="tcp:63264:3"/>
a <hi>Renegado,</hi> or a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt;</hi> and I thought my ſelf oblig'd both by the Laws of God and Man to preſerve my life as long as I could, and to vindicate my reputation from infamy, and aſſert my juſt and honeſt title to the comforts of humane ſociety: and that I have no ways deſerved to be proſcrib'd the Communication of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe I made my application to the Law for ſatisfaction, and had the Doctor arreſted in an Action of the Caſe for Defamation. The Cauſe was tryed before the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi> L. C. J. of his Majeſties Court of Common Pleas, <hi>June</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> laſt paſt; where the iſſue went upon my ſide, and the Jury brought the Doctor in guilty, allowing me 20 <hi>l.</hi> Damages: which ſmall ſumm, though by many it was lookt upon as very inconſiderable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the dammages wherewith the Doctor had affected both my Reputation and my Purſe; yet by another party, it was lookt upon with a ſore eye, to ſee their <hi>Goliah</hi> (who had for ſome time paſt, hector'd and ſwore for the cauſe) foil'd, if not knock'd down by ſo mean a perſon as my ſelf. They admired my inſolence in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to defend my life, when the Doctor was pleaſed to ſwear it from me; they inveighed againſt me, as a narrow ſelfiſh ſoul, far from a publick ſpirit, who would not rather be hang'd, than the Doctor's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity ſhould be liable to any ſuſpicion; a man who had <hi>laid himſelf out,</hi> and ventur'd <hi>all</hi> for the good of the Nation; yea, who is <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Nation,</hi> ſaid prudent <hi>Sh. Pilk.</hi> Notwithſtanding all which, I cannot but be of this faith, that it is more convenient for me, that the Doctor ſhould ſwing than I; as for his <hi>all</hi> that he has ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, I never heard of any thing he had to venture, unleſs his <hi>all, i. e.</hi> his Soul; which to my knowledge is deeply engag'd. And as for his being ſtil'd <hi>the Saviour of the Nation,</hi> it is <hi>Scandalum Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in the higheſt degree; the Title is moſt arrogant, and intimates a Blaſphemous relation to the <hi>Saviour of the world;</hi> a moſt odious Compariſon 'twixt the Merits of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Titus Oates;</hi> for which there cannot be the leaſt reaſon or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Analogy; unleſs that as it was judg'd neceſſary (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Oates</hi> preach'd to the contrary) that <hi>our Saviour</hi> ſhould be crucified, that the world might be ſav'd; ſo it ſhould be thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that <hi>Oates</hi> might be hang'd, that ſo our Nation periſh not. Then indeed he might ſuſtain ſome Relation, even the ſame that the Blaſphemous Thief had to our Saviour when he was on the Croſs, and in ſome ſenſe he might be call'd <hi>the Saviour of our Nation;</hi> but otherwiſe the Title is intolerable, and he muſt firſt be hang'd before by any propriety of ſpeech, it can agree to him.</p>
            <p>There are a Party of men I ſay, who finding what an intractable, moroſe, uncomplaiſant humour I am of, and that by refuſing to be accounted a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt</hi> or a <hi>Circumcis'd Mahumetan;</hi> the Doctor has fallen under a ſhrewd ſuſpition of Perjury, and may in time put in his claim to the Pillory, though with the forfeit of his Ears. Therefore it is, that they have us'd all baſe unworthy arts to blacken my reputation; and ſeeing it was manifeſtly prov'd in Court, that the Doctor had frequently uttered thoſe ſcandalous words, which tended
<pb facs="tcp:63264:3"/>
to my Defamation, they give out now, that I was the firſt Author of them my ſelf; and what the Doctor ſaid or ſwore concerning me, was only what he heard me ſay of my ſelf; thus endeavouring to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix as notorious a mark of Folly to my name, as before he would of Villany. Therefore to anſwer the importunity of my friends, and to diſabuſe any, who may be deluded by the malicious calumnies of my nettled Adverſaries, I have adventured to put Pen to Paper, to give a full and clear account of the proceedings 'twixt the Dr. and my ſelf; which will conſiſt in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt give a ſhort Narrative of my Travails, Captivity and Eſcape from Slavery in <hi>Barbary;</hi> which though it may ſeem forreign and impertinent to my deſign, yet, becauſe it is the ſubject of the Doctor's Oaths, I cannot clearly without <hi>it,</hi> repreſent the quality of <hi>them;</hi> and beſides, being a recital of ſome rare accidents, and almoſt miraculous inſtances of the providence of God in my deliverance from a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Captivity, I preſume it will make ſome compenſation for the impertinence which it ſeemingly carries to the deſign of theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I ſhall faithfully ſet down, what the Doctor hath depos'd againſt me upon Oath, under his own hand, at <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and what was prov'd in Court at our Tryal by unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Witneſſes, that he had ſaid ſeveral times againſt me, to the ſame purpoſe with what he ſwore before.</p>
            <p>And in the third place, I ſhall give an account of what was ſworn in his behalf to mitigate Dammages: Upon all which, I ſhall only make ſuch Anirnad verſions as are pertinent and proper, and draw ſuch Inferences as the matter will rationally allow. And then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſelf to the whole Nation as Judges, whether or no the Doctor has not only falſly and maliciouſly defam'd me, but likewiſe ſworn that to be true, which in it ſelf is falſe, and to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, I cannot ſee how it will follow that the Doctor is guilty of Perjury; for though in the Court of Heaven, and before God, Perjury and falſe ſwearing be ſynonymous, yet none are eſteemed guilty of Perjury, by the Laws of this Land, but who have been convicted of ſwearing falſly in a Court of Record. But the <hi>Court of Delegates,</hi> where <hi>Oates</hi>'s Depoſitions againſt me were exhibited, being no ſuch Court; therefore according to the Law-Phraſe, what ever I think in my conſcience (and I am ſure he is Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn) yet I cannot ſay that the Doctor is Perjur'd, and conſequently that the Pillory has never been adequate to the Doctor's high merits. A Wooden Ruff does not well become the <hi>Saviour of the Nation,</hi> with modeſty be it ſpoke as I ſaid before, I think a Halter would much better befit him; and really before I ſhould ſee the <hi>Salamanca Doctor</hi> treated as they ſay poor <hi>N. T.</hi> was, I had much rather ſee him hang'd.</p>
            <p>This <hi>modeſt Vindication</hi> of the Doctor, my grateful ſenſe of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful kind temper to me has commanded from me; for if the Doctor had pleaſed to have thought of me when he and Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> were think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, he might eaſily have beſtowed a ſmall Commiſſion upon
<pb facs="tcp:63264:4"/>
his old Acquaintance; ſome little <hi>Croſs-bearers</hi> place amongſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Pilgrims,</hi> or elſe if he had only made me a <hi>Courier</hi> 'twixt <hi>tall fair Don John</hi> and the <hi>four Ruffians;</hi> any ſuch like employment, (and the Doctor has beſtow'd abundance, and has much more in ſtore) would have conſigned me to <hi>Jack Ketches</hi> diſpoſal long ago; for it is very hard to prove a Negative. But now that he has only made me a <hi>Muſſelman, cujus character eſt indelebilis,</hi> he has given me a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of proving him a <hi>forſworn Liar;</hi> for which ſingular kindneſs I cannot ſufficiently profeſs my obligations: And this is one reaſon why I have undertook this <hi>modeſt Vindication.</hi> Which labour of mine, though it may ſeem to carry an oblique deſign only of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying my fond humour to the Doctor, yet to conſidering perſons alſo I preſume I ſhall be thought to have hereby contributed my Mite to the publick, in expoſing the wickedneſs of a Wretch whoſe talent lies only in Swearing: for though I have undertook his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet I intend it ſhall be with all Modeſty, and ſuch as ſhall not interfere with the Truth.</p>
            <p>The Doctor has employ'd his Swearing faculty only to my particular detriment, the meaneſt of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> he has forſworn himſelf to prejudice me; but yet every member thereof is concern'd, ſince this publick Enemy has given broad ſigns of his inclinations to them all, as namely, when he ſaid <hi>there were not above three Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Biſhops in the Church of</hi> England, and that <hi>all the Clergy were tantivying to</hi> Rome: as alſo in his Sermon at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> he delivered for true doctrine <hi>that the Presbyterians were the only ſupporters of the Proteſtant intereſt;</hi> and there is no queſtion, but that when there ſhall come a Houſe of Commons to pay him the 40000 <hi>l.</hi> promiſed (as he ſays) by the laſt Houſe who ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> he has 40000 Oaths at their ſervice. But now, by expoſing him as Forſworn, the edge of his Swearing will for the future be rebated; for if it be the dictate of prudence, never to truſt thoſe who have but once been found to impoſe upon us, then certainly it is unaccountable folly and madneſs, to accept the teſtimony of one who has manifeſtly Forſworn himſelf, and in a manner proclaimed to all the world, that he has no dread of that God, who will revenge himſelf upon thoſe who take his name in vain. For my own part, though forty Plots were laid againſt me, I had rather venture them all, than rely upon a <hi>Salamanca Doctor's</hi> Oath: and if any thing ſtaggers my faith in the belief of the 40000 <hi>Black bills,</hi> and other remarkable paſſages in the Popiſh Plot, next to the contradictions which occur; it is becauſe a Villain of ſo plainly debaucht and profligate a conſcience has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd himſelf in the diſcovery. Which I have endeavoured to make appear manifeſtly to others, as well as my ſelf, from the following Sheets.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF <hi>My</hi> TRAVAILS, CAPTIVITY <hi>and</hi> ESCAPE FROM SALLE, In the Kingdom of FEZ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the year 1664, I was admitted into <hi>Cajus Colledge</hi> in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I continued until 1668; when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing Batchelour of Arts, I obtain'd Letters teſtimonial from our Colledge, and then left the Univerſity. During my ſtay there, I remember <hi>Titus Oates</hi> was entered into our Colledge; by the ſame token that the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>he</hi> both viſited the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the ſame year. He was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for a Canting Fanatical way conveyed to him with his <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Education, and in our Academical exerciſes, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers declaim'd <hi>Oates</hi> always preach'd; ſome of which Lectures,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63264:5"/>
they were ſo very ſtrange, that I do yet remember them. I more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over remember, that he ſtaid not above a year in our Colledge, but removed to <hi>S. Johns;</hi> what the occaſion was, I cannot call to mind: and then he was ſo inconſiderable both as to his perſon and parts, that I appeal to all who knew me, whether <hi>Elliot</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi> could be ſuch intimate acquaintance as <hi>Oates</hi> would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>After I had commenced Batchelour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in 1668, I left the Univerſity; in the beginning of 1669 I had the opportunity of travelling with ſome Gentlemen of my acquaintance, with whom, after a tranſient view of <hi>Flanders</hi> and other of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces, which had been the ſeat of war for ſome years preceding, I had the opportunity to ſee St. <hi>Omers</hi> alſo, where <hi>Oates</hi> was once a School-boy, and no Jeſuit. I remember during my ſtay there, which was three days, S. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> or <hi>Xaverius</hi> or ſome other <hi>Jeſuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Saints day happened, and I with the Gentlemen with me, were civilly invited to Dinner to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge; where, to give the Devil his due, we met with nothing but Learning and Civility to their Country-men and Strangers. From St. <hi>Omers</hi> we directed our Courſe into <hi>France,</hi> directly for <hi>Paris;</hi> whence, after I had gratified my juvenile curioſity with the rarities and remarkable places there, and ſeveral others in <hi>France,</hi> about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of 1669, I was carried into <hi>Italy,</hi> and about <hi>November</hi> we came to <hi>Rome;</hi> where I ſaw that <hi>Great Beaſt of a Whore,</hi> as <hi>Oates</hi> call'd him, a Reverend old Gentleman <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> who then was Pope. He happened to die a little after my coming thither, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my fortune to ſtay there, <hi>ſede vacante,</hi> during the Election of another Pope. I never ſaw the <hi>Scotch</hi> Colledge during my ſtay there, nor any <hi>Scotch</hi> Father, nor any that belonged to the Colledge that I know of: I was frequently indeed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, and I had the happineſs of hearing <hi>Padre Gotinio,</hi> the then Mathematick Profeſſor, diſcourſe very ſatisfactorily upon ſeveral curious ſubjects.</p>
            <p>I ſtaid in <hi>Rome</hi> no longer than the Election of <hi>Altieri Roſpiglioſi</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to the former, which was in <hi>March</hi> 1670: after which an occaſion happening of parting with my Company, I parted alſo from <hi>Rome;</hi> and intending home again for <hi>England,</hi> I came to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> where finding an opportunity of the <hi>Briſtol</hi> one of his Majeſties Friggots, I had a convenient paſſage to <hi>Alicant</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Malaga,</hi> where I embark'd aboard Sir <hi>John Herman,</hi> then Rere-Admiral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> in the <hi>Streights,</hi> who gave me paſſage to <hi>Cales.</hi> About the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> I had a curioſity to ſee <hi>Sevil;</hi> from whence having the convenience of ſome Company, I took my courſe directly for <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal;</hi> there was then reſiding Dr. <hi>Cradock</hi> Miniſter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants there, whom I had ſeen at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi> to whoſe civility, and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemens, particularly Mr. <hi>Bulteel</hi>'s, I was exceedingly oblig'd.</p>
            <p>There was at that time no Veſſel deſign'd for <hi>England</hi> in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> excepting a little Ketch call'd the <hi>John of London,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Oranges and Lemons, and I was very deſirous to return home, ſo that I was obliged to take my paſſage in that ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; ſome who ſeconded my deſires, alledging that I ſhould be more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63264:5"/>
ſecure in her than in a bigger, becauſe ſhe by reaſon of her ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would keep near the Coaſt and ſo out of danger of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and beſides Sir <hi>Edward Sprag</hi> was ſaid then to lye upon the <hi>Portugal</hi> Coaſt with a Squadron of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigots, ſo that theſe Seas would be ſcour'd clear of the <hi>Barbary-Rovers.</hi> Upon which Arguments, I was induc'd to embark aboard that little Veſſel, where I loſt my Freedome.</p>
            <p>It was about the middle of <hi>June</hi> 1670, we parted from <hi>Lisbon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> River, deſign'd for <hi>London;</hi> about three days after, we met Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sprag</hi> with his Squadron, who encourag'd us with the News that no Pirats were in thoſe Seas, he having lain there about a month. Upon which we ſtruck out to Sea, the wind being Northerly and croſs to us all the while; ſo that by the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> we had got no farther than <hi>Cape Finiſterre:</hi> on which day, whilſt the Maſter and I were at breakfaſt, a Boy who ſat at the Helm, cry'd out, <hi>a Sail,</hi> which was the only one we had deſcry'd (excepting Sir <hi>Edward Spragg)</hi> ſince we left <hi>Lisbon:</hi> by our Glaſſes we perceived ſhe had a mind to ſpeak with us, for ſhe had got out all her Sails, and bore down upon us directly before the wind, which methought was no ſign of a Merchant man; therefore I deſired the Maſter to bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Shoar, who refuſed to be perſwaded, alledging, that this was the uſual paſſage for <hi>Hollanders, French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that it was moſt probable, that this Ship which was in view, muſt be a friend, for that year we were at peace with all <hi>Europeans.</hi> About ten a-clock up comes the Ship with <hi>French</hi> colours, aſſoon as ſhe came near us, ſo that we could not eſcape, ſhe pull'd down her <hi>French</hi> and put up her Salle-Colours, and withall gave us a Gun, which oblig'd us to ſtrike. Immediately appear'd upon the Pirats Deck about 200 <hi>Moors,</hi> who commanded us to put out our Boat and come aboard them, which we all (excepting one) preſently obey'd. For our welcome, and to ſhew us what entertainment we were after to expect, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Veſſel and my ſelf were ſtrip'd and ty'd to the Maſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be whip'd, that ſo they might extort a confeſſion where the Money lay hid if we had any; we ſatisfied them as well we could, that they were Maſters of all that we knew of in our Veſſel: and ſo we were releaſed from the Maſt, and put in Irons below deck with our Fellow-Priſoners. There it was that I began to reflect upon my condition, for before (the change was ſo ſudden and the ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth accidents ſo ſurprizing) I had ſcarce leaſure to conſider: it is hard to expreſs my reſentments then; all my fellow-priſoners were lamenting with pitiful crys and tears their miſerable eſtate, which only afforded matter of triumph and inſolence to our cruel and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Maſters; who when they heard us complain of our condition, would viſit us with ſome blows, inſulting moſt intolerably over us, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our dejected heads and ſpitting upon our Faces, not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing us any other Name than Dogs. I muſt confeſs this inhumane uſage was very hard to digeſt at firſt, but a little time, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of our skilful Tutors eaſily reconcil'd us to it; for we found that murmuring did but enhance our affliction, and enrage our croſſes. Our Veſſel was within two or three hours after ſhe was taken, ſent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63264:6"/>
to <hi>Salle,</hi> with twenty <hi>Moors</hi> aboard her, who carried with them all our Proviſion of Beef and Bisket, leaving a little Pork only which we ſoon devoured: after which, we had nothing left to maintain us in life, ſave a ſmall quantity of dry'd Olives and Bisket, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was allow'd us: this ſort of Dieting did indeed bring down our high Stomachs, and made us very tractable.</p>
            <p>We lay in this miſerable condition about forty days, oppreſſed as with many inconveniences, ſo eſpecially I remember with the ſtench and naſtineſs of our lodging: ſometimes in the day we were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come above deck, to ſuck in a little freſh air, and to waſh our ſelves, but this ſmall comfort was ſoon forgot by returning to our irons. There was ſcarce a day almoſt, according to my remembrance, in which we did not either give chaſe or elſe were chaſed; for the <hi>Salle-man</hi> was a good Sailor, and whenever ſhe ſaw a Sail, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made after her, if ſhe found her too ſtrong to grapple with, then ſhe tackt and ſtood away. At length about a month after I was taken, one morning when there was little wind ſtirring, we were call'd up upon the Deck, I thought it had been to refreſh our ſelves, but we found it was with labour and toil, for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great calm all that day, we were oblig'd to tug hard at the Oar till ten at night; at which time we came up with a <hi>French</hi> Merchant laden with Oyl, whom we had been in purſuit of all that day; as ſoon as we came near her, we poor Chriſtians were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to our kennel, and moreover had a Sentinel ſet over us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us. A little after three and twenty <hi>French-men</hi> had the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to make us a viſit, and take up their Lodgings in the ſame quarters. It was but a miſerable comfort methought to have ſuch companions in miſery, and truly the ſight of ſo many dejected ſouls, particularly a Merchant (who loſt 2500 Crowns of Caſh beſides his concerns in the <hi>Cargo)</hi> affected me then with a more ſenſible grief than my own ſufferings; he was a man of too tender a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to endure the ſame miſeries with the reſt; we were all lodg'd equally, and had the ſame ſort of accommodation, that <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and the meaneſt of the Seamen were treated alike: which ſubjected him to ſuch a grief that was too powerful for him, ſo that at length it broke his heart, for he died the next day after we landed.</p>
            <p>Our Barbarous Maſters were well pleaſed with this rich Prize, and reſolved to go home with her for <hi>Salle,</hi> ſo they directed their courſe thither. We fortuned one day to meet with hard weather which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a ſtorm that night. The <hi>Moors</hi> we perceived were in great trouble and amazement, ſo that a conceit entred my head, that if we ſhould all of us with reſolution fall upon the <hi>Moors</hi> who had the management of the Ship above Deck, we might eaſily make her change Maſters, a project which if it had been proſecuted, did not ſeem impracticable, for there were not above thirty <hi>Moors</hi> who underſtood any thing of Navigation or a Sea-man; theſe were above deck, and employ'd; the reſt of the <hi>Moors</hi> were ſurpriz'd with ſo great a conſternation that the Captain commanded them all to go below deck; ſo that if we had reſolutely attacqu'd the Captain with his few Companions, and clapt down the Hatches upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63264:6"/>
reſt, we might have ſucceeded; but this poor-ſpirited-French man and two more, apprehending the Difficulties of the enterprize as inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, declared their reſolution to diſcover all, if we proceeded; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reſt of us ſeemed unanimous, as thinking that we ſhould never find a better occaſion to venture our Lives to regain our Liberty.</p>
            <p>A few days after by break of day, we found our ſelves near two great Ships who put out <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours; this put the <hi>Moors</hi> into a great fright leſt they ſhould fall into their hands, wherefore they made all the ſail they could, and labour'd hard to get clear of them, but to little purpoſe, for the other two Ships gain'd mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly upon the <hi>Salle-man</hi> though it prov'd not to our comfort; for when they came up to her, and every minute ſhe expected to be boarded, all of a ſudden we Chriſtians (who were then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below in irons heartily praying for our Deliverance) heard a ſhout of joy above deck; for the Ships who were in chaſe of us diſcovered themſelves to be <hi>Algerines,</hi> the Admiral call'd the <hi>Springing Tyger,</hi> as I think, and another. Then there was great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing amongſt them, coming aboard each other freely, and mutual treats paſt, and we Chriſtians alſo were permitted to go and viſit our fellow Slaves and Countrey-men; who acquainted us with the News that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frigots were lying then before <hi>Salle,</hi> which gave us ſome hopes if true, and made the <hi>Moors</hi> very wary. That evening we parted from the <hi>Algerines,</hi> and bore directly for <hi>Salle.</hi> At length we came in ſight of the Caſtle, but could diſcern no Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, we therefore made directly for the River, when preſently there ſtarts up a Veſſel that made all the Sail ſhe could at us, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd us to tack about and ſtrike down along the <hi>Barbary-Coaſt;</hi> ſhe put us ſo hard to it, that we were forc't to forſake the <hi>French</hi> Prize, and leave her to be pick'd up by our Purſuer, which was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship call'd the <hi>Holmes-Frigot</hi> of two and twenty Guns, whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I ſaw at my return at <hi>Cales.</hi> Whilſt ſhe was employed in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Prize, the <hi>Salle-man</hi> in the <hi>Interim</hi> made away, and night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, in the dark made her eſcape.</p>
            <p>The next morning, all we Chriſtians were commanded a-ſhoar, becauſe the <hi>Moors</hi> had run themſelves into a Creek ſome twenty Leagues South off <hi>Salle,</hi> where they lay conceal'd from the ſight of the Frigot, though we had her plainly in view all the next day, with the <hi>French</hi> prize at her Stern, with languiſhing eyes and ſad hearts, ſeeing our Deliverance, but not being able to approach it. There they landed us poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtians in number two and thirty, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who were to travel to <hi>Salle</hi> under the guard of a couple of <hi>Moors</hi> only, whom we might eaſily have rid our ſelves from, if we had judg'd it ſafe or convenient: but <hi>Salle</hi> was the only place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we could retreat unto, and theſe were our Guides thither through as deſolate and forlorn a countrey, as barren and dry a land, as ever my eyes beheld. We were above two days in travelling theſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues, where we had not the proſpect of any Town, Village or Houſe all the way, nor could we ſee any footſteps of Husbandry or Civility; the beſt water we met with, was very brackiſh; our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which our Maſters allow'd us, when we parted from the Ship,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63264:7"/>
was all devour'd the firſt day. Our condition indeed, during that journey was the moſt deplorable that ever I was in; for our ſhort Commons and hard Lodging aboard the Ship, had much weaken'd our bodies, we were very hungry and had no meat, exceeding thirſty and for a whole day no water, the Sun was very hot and no ſhelter, the Heavens lookt like Braſs and the Earth like iron, all which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will eaſily convince any that we muſt of neceſſity long to get clear of that curſed Countrey, which threatned us with inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction, and there was no other place of refuge but <hi>Salle;</hi> ſo that our condition of life muſt appear very pitiful, ſeeing we long'd for the place of our Captivity, and panted after our Afflictions. When night approacht, our Guides made us take up our Lodging where there were a few Shrubs, which we ſet on fire to ſecure us from the Lions, and other Beaſts of Prey, as Wild-Boars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which we ſaw ſeveral in our way.</p>
            <p>At length upon the third day we came within ſight of <hi>Salle,</hi> about half a league from which, we met with a garden full of delicate fruits, which if the <hi>Moors</hi> had not freely beſtowed upon us, we had made bold to have took without leave, ſuch was our neceſſity: there we were permitted to refreſh our ſelves for two hours, before we made our publick entry into the City, which was indeed extraordinary; for we were accompanied by ſeveral hundreds of idle raſcally people and roguiſh Boys, who came out of the Town to meet us and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed us with horrid barbarous Shouts ſomewhat like the <hi>Iriſh hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub.</hi> We in the mean time were forct like a drove of Sheep, through the ſeveral ſtreets, the people crouding to gaze upon us and curſe us, for that Civility is a piece of Religion with them. With this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity were we conducted through the Town unto the River, which we were to croſs to another <hi>Salle</hi> ſtanding in the North-ſide; there were we all ſhut up in the Deputy-Governours Court-Yard, where like a pack of tired Hounds, we fell all faſt aſleep upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>At evening we were conveyed to our Lodgings, where we were to repoſe our ſelves that night, a place proportionable to the reſt of the entertainment; it was a large Cellar under the Street archt and ſupported with two rows of Pillars; the light it was furniſhed with, came through three holes in the Street ſtrongly grated; through one of which, by a Ladder of Ropes we deſcended into this Room, called the Kings <hi>Maſmora,</hi> capacious enough to hold 300 perſons, (for very near that number of Chriſtians of ſeveral Nations were ſhut up there at nights) beſides a whole Leyſtall of filth, in which, (whoſoever's lot it is to be there) he muſt wade up to the ancles. There I watcht all night, for ſleep I could not; and though the next day I was to be ſold publickly in a Market, yet the peeping in of the light was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe I was to leave that intolerably noiſom Priſon.</p>
            <p>By Sun-riſing next morning we were all of us, who came laſt to <hi>Salle</hi> driven to a Market-place, where the <hi>Moors</hi> ſitting Taylor-wiſe upon Stalls round about, we were ſeverally run up and down by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who proclaimed our Qualities or Trades; and what beſt might recommend us to the Buyer. I had a great <hi>Black</hi> who was appointed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63264:7"/>
to ſell me; this Fellow holding me by the hand, courſed me up and down, from one perſon to another, who call'd upon me at pleaſure to examine me what trade I was of, and to ſee what labour my hands were accuſtomed to. All the Seamen were ſoon bought up, it was mid-day ere I could meet with a purchaſer; the reaſon was, a boy of the Veſſel wherein I was taken, in hopes of favourable treatment from the Captain who took us, pretended to diſcover my quality to him, aſſuring him that I was a Relation of the now Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> who was then Ambaſſadour from his Majeſty at <hi>Taffiletta,</hi> and was come <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Tangier.</hi> Upon this information, the Captain put a great value upon me, and that was the reaſon why none would med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with me; until about noon <hi>Hamed Lucas</hi> (who is Secretary of this preſent Embaſſy from the Emperor of <hi>Fez</hi> to his Majeſty) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the Captain, and paid down 600 pieces of Eight for me.</p>
            <p>I was pretty well pleas'd with my fortune to fall into the hands of ſuch a perſon, who beſides that he was of a great repute there, ſeem'd to carry in his deportment an air and meen that was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and therefore I hop'd for ſome more favourable treatment from him than from another: but other Chriſtians who had heard of this Patron of mine, pityed my ignorance, as knowing that he was a cunning <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Merchant, and that he bought me with a deſign to extort from me a great Ranſome, though by the harſheſt and cruelleſt uſage imaginable; which I found to be too true a character of him him before night: for after he was come to his own houſe, whither he commanded me to follow him, he preſently makes me ac<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quainted with a piece of his mind and temper; telling me, that he had paid a conſiderable ſum of Money for me, which he did upon the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a Ranſome for my Liberty, proportionable to his expectation and my quality, which he was well aſſured was ſuch, that it would anſwer whatſoever hopes he entertain'd; and he would have me know that I had to do <hi>with a man with a Beard,</hi> and who was too cunning to be impos'd upon, and therefore advis'd me to forego that piece of policy which the Chriſtians frequently make uſe of in concealing their qualities, and diſguiſing their conditions; ſince it would be in vain to prevaricate before him, who was very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of my ſtate, and as well acquainted with my fortunes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as I my ſelf; and wiſh'd me rather to propoſe ſuch a Ranſome as was ſuitable to his expectations, from ſo conſiderable a Captive, for payment of which he would allow me ſufficient time: and if I gave any demonſtrations of ſincerity in dealing with him, I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all ſlaviſh employments; but if I refus'd a complyance with theſe his Propoſals, I ſhould experience the greateſt ſeverity that any Slave in <hi>Barbary</hi> could from his Patron.</p>
            <p>Seeing he profeſs'd himſelf a <hi>man with a Beard,</hi> and one that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be impos'd upon, I endeavour'd all I could to diſabuſe him, and poſſeſs him with a clear notion of the naked truth, profeſſing with all ſincerity, that I was ſo ſenſible of the miſeries of Captivity, that if a Kingdom were at my diſpoſal, I would frankly quit all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to it, in exchange for the happineſs of the Freedom and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63264:8"/>
I enjoy'd in my own Countrey: but that ſuch has been the pleaſure of God to me in the diſpenſing the goods of this world, that he has allow'd me no more than what he ſaw me then poſſeſſour of; ſo that I found my ſelf under ſo much worſe circumſtances than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Captives by how much I ſuſtain'd greater expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and was leaſt able to anſwer them; but that which was the greateſt aggravation of my misfortune was, that I ſhould very much contribute to the calling in queſtion his prudence and judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Town will admire when they ſhall ſee the event, that the wiſe <hi>Hamet-Lucas</hi> was impos'd upon in giving 600 pieces of Eight for a poor Slave, who was not worth a <hi>Maravidi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which laſt words, he was ſo tranſported with paſſion, that he ſhowr'd down a whole torrent of Blows upon me, and lighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily upon a ſtick, he broke my head in ſeveral places, and never ceaſt till he had made me all in a gore-blood; I was not able to ſtir, and the cruel Villain permitted me to lye a little while: afterwards he comes again afreſh, and drags me out of his Houſe into the Streets, and then falls upon me a-new, beating me all along the Streets, to the great grief of my Fellow-Captives, who were of the ſame mind with my ſelf, that I ſhould hardly out-live that night. He brought me at length to a <hi>Black-Moor</hi> who was working in Lime, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with all cruel imperious inſolence imaginable, to ſerve that <hi>Black,</hi> by giving him up Lime with my hands, which I did, till ſuch time as my Patron departed; and then I ſignified to the <hi>Black</hi> that I was very ſick, and by ſigns prayed him to let me leave off that work which had almoſt chok'd me; which by his pitiful geſture I perceive he allow'd. So I lay down upon the ground and fell aſleep; my Patron preſently return'd, and took ſuch a courſe to awake me, that he had very near laid me aſleep for ever; for he gave me a blow in the ſmall of my back, which created ſuch a pungent pain, as quite caſhier'd all patience and all reſpects of ſelf-preſervation; ſo that I vented my paſſion in the moſt raſh inconſiderate expreſſions, the moſt provoking, opprobrious and menacing terms, that my anger and my little <hi>Spaniſh</hi> could accommodate me with, daring him to diſpatch me, for my life then ſeem'd a grievous burthen to me.</p>
            <p>The Covetous <hi>Moor</hi> fearing leſt I ſhould make my words good, and by putting hand to my ſelf, rob him not only of his hopes, but alſo of his 600 Dollars, departs from me with a threatning geſture, which I ſhew'd very little ſence of; for I immediately compos'd my ſelf to ſleep again, being ſo weary that I could have reſted contentedly upon Briars and Thorns. Some-while after the Cruel Dog return'd, and awakening me gently, ſmil'd upon me, asking me if I would drink Water; I anſwered I was like to die for want of it, having drunk none that day: ſo he directed me to a houſe near by, where a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, who gave me ſome in an Earthen Pot, which after I had drank off, ſhe broke the Pitcher. I return'd to my Patron, who made me follow him home, and after a plentiful ſupper which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me, he gave me a Hammock, and ordered one to ſhew me the way to the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> where I remain'd all night.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63264:8"/>
The next day he had provided a <hi>Jew</hi> (who had been in <hi>Europe</hi> and ſpoke good <hi>Latin)</hi> to treat with me, as if my defect in the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> language wherein he was exquiſite, had occaſioned the unſucceſsfulneſs of his Negotiating with me. This <hi>Jew</hi> I found to be a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, who was quickly made ſenſible of the truth of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and withall a man endu'd with more humanity than generally the people of that Religion are, which he evidenc'd by his good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me to this purpoſe; telling me, That my Patron was a man of violent paſſions, and that, though he himſelf was pretty well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of my utter inability to anſwer what my Patron demanded, yet if my Patron ſhould be ſo perſwaded, and find himſelf bilkt in all his great expectations, he would certainly convert his hopes into an extravagant rage, and then put me to ſome cruel death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he advis'd me, as not to ſooth his vain hopes, ſo neither quite to baniſh all: As thus, ſays he, you ſhall give me leave in your name to acquaint your Patron, that you have Relations and Friends who are powerful and rich, though you are miſerable; and you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that rather than you ſhould ſpend all your days un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſſures of a heavy and cruel Captivity, they would make a purſe of 1000 Crowns to ranſome you. This Propoſal, ſays he, though it may not ſatisfy his expectation, yet it will baniſh all deſpair, and ſo you may live till God who has been pleaſed to afflict you by bringing you hither, may be pleaſed in due time to redeem you hence.</p>
            <p>This advice of this charitable <hi>Jew,</hi> I ſo far comply'd with, that I not only gave him liberty to free my Patron from the deſpair of any Ranſom at all, but I reſolv'd to improve it, by promoting his hopes to the higheſt degree imaginable. To this purpoſe, finding after that the <hi>Jew</hi> had acquainted him with the iſſue of his diſcourſe with me, and of my coming up to 1000 Crowns, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his rigor did not abate, but every day he put me to harſher and ſeverer tasks; I one day let fall ſome diſcourſe which encourag'd the conceit he had entertain'd of my relation to his Excellency the then Lord <hi>Henry Howard.</hi> This indeed by all my Fellow-Slaves was lookt upon as a ſtrange piece of policy in that place to blab out my great Relations, where all other Chriſtians by all art and care imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtudy to repreſent their condition mean, and to conceal their Relations and Fortunes ſo much the more as they are conſiderable; and therefore one of them told me, that he never expected to ſee me one of the Privy Council; I anſwered him, that neither did I, ſo long as I was a Captive there: he ſaid, he wiſht me in my own Country in a place there call'd <hi>Bedlam</hi> which was fitteſt for me, and he believ'd my Couſin (for ſo his Slave-ſhip was pleas'd to ſtile him) the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> would be of the ſame opinion; I anſwered him, that I did not queſtion to be delivered from this inſupportable Bondage by my Couſin's means; which afterwards came to paſs after this manner.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians uſually about Sun-ſetting were ſent to a fountain of excellent water without the Town, to bring home in great earthen Jarrs ſome of that water; I alſo was ſent by my Patron: Amongſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63264:9"/>
other diſcourſe which the Chriſtians uſe to have there, I liſten'd to a Seaman diſcourſing of <hi>Mamora</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſon, ſome twenty miles diſtant from <hi>Salle,</hi> at the mouth of a River, and that he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the coaſt, had obſerv'd it very rocky for about eight miles, but the reſt was a fine Sand that reacht as far as <hi>Mamora;</hi> he ſaid moreover that he believ'd a good footman might run a race for his Freedom in three hours, if he had the convenience of a favourable night, and could ſcape a number of Tents which were pitcht all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Countrey 'twixt <hi>Salle</hi> and <hi>Mamora,</hi> who are very indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious to pick up Slaves attempting an eſcape, becauſe the Law of that Land incourages them with half the Slaves ranſome.</p>
            <p>Upon this Diſcourſe it entred ſtrongly into my head, that I ſhould be the perſon who ſhould win this prize; but at preſent it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible by reaſon of my lodging in the <hi>Maſmora,</hi> as alſo by reaſon of my laſſitude at night, being quite ſpent with the toil and labour of the day; but if I could induce my Patron by any arts to be a little kind to me and abate his ſeverity, I thought I might fall into ſome capacity of performing what I deſign'd. Seeing then that the hard uſage beyond other Slaves which I endur'd proceeded, from my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy (as my Patron ſaid) of not confeſſing my ſelf to be a <hi>Conde,</hi> and particularly a near Relation of my Lord <hi>Howards,</hi> (as my Patron was inform'd) and whoſe alliance he more coveted than any others in behalf of his Slave; I reſolv'd to try my fortune a little under the mask of a perſon of great Quality; and this was the reaſon, why I was pleas'd at that time to own an alliance to the great Family of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which ſham though, occaſion'd my Deliverance; ſo that I found it by experience true, what is vulgarly ſaid, that it is good to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a great eſtate or family, though at never ſo great a diſtance; for I am ſure all the relation that I knew I had to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> then, was, that he was at <hi>Tangier</hi> when I was at <hi>Salle,</hi> and ſo near were we then related indeed, and no more. However I wrote a Letter to his Excellency, which my Patron had tranſlated into <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> and ſuch ſatisfaction did he receive from it, that he allow'd me a month in expectation of an anſwer; during which time I ſhould be treated with all mildneſs and civility, only I was to look after his Barb and his Houſe when he was abroad; which employments I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd a happineſs hardly to be expected in that Countrey. My Letter was delivered by my Patron to an <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> by name <hi>Long,</hi> newly ranſom'd, who intended for <hi>Cales</hi> with the firſt opportunity; him did my Patron oblige by promiſe, to deliver my Letter to his Excellency with all expedition.</p>
            <p>The news of my Quality preſently ſpread abroad, ſo that I had ſeveral viſits, and particularly from a <hi>French</hi> Fryer, a very ingenious Learned man, who acquainted me that the next Sunday was S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi>'s day, and that he intended then (having procured permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Patron) to preach at the <hi>French Conſul</hi>'s houſe, and ſo invited me to be his Auditor. I told him I ſhould be proud of the happineſs, if my Patron would give leave; he engaged to uſe his endeavours with his Patron to procure a Licence from mine, which was obtain'd: So to the <hi>French Conſul</hi>'s I went, where after having
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63264:9"/>
heard a ſeaſonable Diſcourſe to Slaves about patience under our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made by the Fryar, the <hi>French Conſul</hi> gave me a Glaſs of Wine or two, after which I returned home. My Patron ſeem'd concern'd at my long abſence, to whom I reply'd that the <hi>French Conſul</hi> had treated me with Wine which was extraordinary good, and which if he underſtood the vertue of, he would renounce <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> to drink of it: He counterfeited a diſpleaſure at my Railery, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he was really well ſatisfied, as who had no antipathy in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the juyce of the Grape; which I had ſeen him before ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drink with a great greedineſs.</p>
            <p>About the dusk of the Evening, he and the <hi>Jew</hi> I formerly mentioned, being together at our houſe, ordered me to go to the <hi>French Conſuls,</hi> and deſire him to ſend to my Patron a quantity of Wine, which I did; but firſt I begg'd of my Patron that I might have ſhare of it, he told me he intended I ſhould; then ſays I to the <hi>Jew,</hi> I muſt requeſt another favour of you, that you would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with my Patron that I may not go to the <hi>Maſmora</hi> this night, for the miſeries of that place will damp all the pleaſures and ſatisfaction of the day preceding. My Patron was ſo complaiſant, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to both our deſires. Away then went I to the <hi>French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi> immediately, to whom having imparted my Meſſage, he ordered ſome ſervants to carry a conſiderable parcel of Flasks of Red wine, <hi>(Syracuſa</hi> I think they term'd it,) to my Patron's houſe. The Gentleman in the mean while arreſting me civilly to drink a glaſs with him before I went to the <hi>Maſmora</hi> as was expected, which I did; withall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him, that I deſign'd alſo to have a ſhare of the wine ſent to my Patron, but my principal aim was, that the ſhould have his doſe, and thereby I ſhould eſcape that night; I told him how my Patron had accommodated me with a ſufficient opportunity, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing my going to the <hi>Maſmora</hi> that night, which if I neglected, I deſerv'd to be hang'd next morning. The courteous Gentleman ſeem'd amaz'd at my reſolutions upon ſuch a deſperate attempt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to diſſuade me from an enterpriſe which carried with it inſuperable difficulties, and which to his knowledge ſome had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain; and had only purchas'd to themſelves thereby heavy ſtripes and multiplied their miſeries, whereas never any one in my circumſtances had accompliſht it; however ſeeing me obſtinately fixt either to eſcape or dye that night, he gave me his friendly advice how to manage both my ſelf and my Patron in drinking; and ſo tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me that he would pray heartily for my ſucceſs, and that he would not commit himſelf to ſleep, till he heard of the iſſue, with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and thankfulneſs I kiſs'd his hands, and departed to my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons houſe.</p>
            <p>At my return, I found him and the <hi>Jew</hi> and four other <hi>Moors</hi> ſet at Supper, which was brought them by ſome Slaves according to their appointment, ſo that this ſeem'd a deſign'd club; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration created in me ſundry anxious ſurmiſes, left there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many in company, my deſigns might happen to the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe'd by ſome one or other of them; and thence it was, that all the while they were at Supper, I was very thoughtful and engag'd in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63264:10"/>
deep intenſe meditation, how to obviate all emergent difficulties, which this unexpected Company might lay in my way; yea ſo penſive was I, that I could not advert their commands, which occaſion'd my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to enquire the reaſon of my extraordinary Melancholy, ſeeing my fair hopes of a ſudden Redemption, and his kind and civil uſage to me, together with the chearful and jovial temper of his Friends, who came to be merry with him, ſeem'd to adminiſter matter of quite different reſentments: At this I rows'd my ſelf out of my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture with ſome kind of confuſion, and humbly beg'd his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for my unſuitable humour, which I told him, proceeded from the conſideration of my Couſin the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadours reſentment of my weakneſs, in diſcovering my ſelf ſo ſoon; and though I queſtion'd not the ſpeedy payment of my Ranſome and my Diſcharge, yet I could not, but with exceeding trouble, reflect upon the reaſon of his diſpleaſure, and the ill conſequences which muſt enſue if he ſhould be angry with me, for whoſe favour and kindneſs I had the higheſt veneration and reſpect.</p>
            <p>At this my Patron bid me chear up, and be merry with them, for ſays he, I my ſelf will write to his Excellency the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, and will excuſe you; I will acquaint him with the true way and means how I came to be inform'd of your Quality, and alliance to his Excellency. I pretended to be extraordinary much affected with this kindneſs of my Patron, which I ſignified by paſſing a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Complement upon him to this effect; <hi>That this favour would out ballance all the miſeries of my Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that if his Excellency my Couſin knew how happy I were in a Patron, he would come himſelf to redeem me with his own Perſon, and would throw himſelf at your Feet, ambitious of the honour of being your Slave.</hi> This <hi>Rhodomontado</hi> was ſo ſurprizing and taking, that he told me, <hi>that if he had not been ſufficiently inform'd of my Quality before, this inſtance of my excellent education had manifeſtly diſcovered me;</hi> upon which, I was forc'd to give over complementing, leſt he ſhould enhance my Quality, and perchance beat me into the <hi>Royal Family</hi> for a lye of my own making, as I had been before, into the <hi>Family of Howard</hi> for a lye of our Ship-boys. However I earneſtly begg'd him to write to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador with all expedition, for if he remov'd my fears of his diſpleaſure, I would be the merryeſt man alive; and then I reſolv'd to caſhier all thoughtfulneſs, both becauſe I would give no occaſion of jealouſy, as alſo leſt too much thinking upon the difficulties (which indeed were very great) might damp my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or ſlacken my indeavours, which I intended to imploy to the utmoſt, that I might that night make my eſcape; leaving the method and means to the management of Providence.</p>
            <p>After theſe complements were over, I ſat down with the Company, and compos'd my ſelf to be as merry and agreeable as poſſibly I could; I ſung ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Songs to them, particularly I remember <hi>Calm was the Evening,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>Mock-Aſtrologer,</hi> which was new when I left <hi>England;</hi> they were wonderfully affected with it, and were very deſirous to have me tranſlate <hi>ha ha ha,</hi> &amp;c. into <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> which made me laugh more heartily than I ſung; they alſo ſung <hi>a la Moriſco</hi> to requite me. I muſt confeſs I never knew any who ſeem'd much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with the ſweetneſs of my voice, neither was I ever ſo vain
<pb facs="tcp:63264:10"/>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63264:11"/>
to expect it; but really when I heard their barbarous Tones and Damnable diſſonant Jangling, I cannot deny a piece of weakneſs which then poſſeſt me, which was a pleaſure to hear mine own ſweet Self chant it. The glaſs in the mean while did not ſtand ſtill, which I principally adverted, for upon the management of that, depended the fortune of that night: therefore though I uſed all art to ſhift it from my ſelf, yet I uſed the ſame that my Patron might never balk it; which at laſt evidenced it ſelf plainly, for he was got very drunk, and truly I thought that then it was not ſafe nor convenient to my purpoſes for his Slave to appear ſober: therefore I counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the humours of a man overtaken with drink with all the artifice imaginable, ſo that I afforded exceeding divertiſement to the ſoberer part of the Company; yet withall the Glaſs was never neglected to be ſent about, which was ply'd with ſuch induſtry, that before midnight all the Company had got as much as they could well carry away, and my Patron abundance more; for my own part I pretended to be ſo much concern'd, that I fell down, and there I lay till ſuch time as the Company pleas'd to depart, when they rows'd me up to lock the doors, which ſeemingly with much adoe I effected; and then I return'd to my Patron with the keys.</p>
            <p>Him I found in a condition, ſuch as a highly provoked revengful Adverſary could hardly wiſh for a more opportune; there was no company in the houſe excepting my Patron, his Barb and my ſelf; the Doors and Avenues were all ſecur'd; the Streets wer clear, and the Neighbourhood huſht up in the ſilence of Midnighte; the <hi>Moor</hi> could hardly either ſpeak or ſtand; all which inviting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſeem'd to court a more reſolved patience than my own to a compliance with this lucky opportunity of Revenge upon an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Monſter, who profeſs'd it his intereſt to deprive me of all the bleſſings of this world, and to make death to me more eligible than life. While I was upon theſe thoughts, the Brute raiſes himſelf up a little, and mutters ſomewhat to me of a not-to-be-mentioned Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, not only unworthy of Chriſtian ears, but the bare mention whereof offers violence to the dictates of Nature, and which my charity would never ſuffer me to believe that it could enter into any mans mind, unleſs I had heard of the Citizens of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Salamanca:</hi> which abominable propoſal did ſo invigorate my reſolution, that immediatly I had made him a Sacrifice to my moſt cruel reſentments of the barbarous uſage I received from him, if by a happy chance the Wine had not got the aſcendent over all his ſenſes, and laid him in a profound ſleep. I laid however hold of his Scimitar, and drew it, and put on the Belt, ſo that if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd, I might have found my ſelf under a neceſſity not to flinch back, but to proceed with all vigor, for my own life's ſake to take away his. But when I reflected upon the many difficulties I was to encounter and overcome before I could eſcape, and the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of my being retaken, and withall the cruelties of a Death that I ſhould ſuffer, if <hi>Hamet Lucas</hi> ſhould be found kill'd by his own Slave; upon theſe conſiderations, I baniſh'd all thoughts of vengeance, and in complement to my own ſelf-preſervation, I gave
<pb facs="tcp:63264:11"/>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63264:12"/>
the <hi>Moor</hi> my Patron his life, as thinking it much more rational as well as generous and <hi>Roman-like</hi> to ſave a Citizens life, though my own, than to deſtroy an Enemy's.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that my Patron was engaged in a deep ſleep, from which in all probability he could not awake in four or five hours, I immediately ſheath'd the Sword, and taking out of his Bags a ſmall parcel of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtols, (which methought, might not be unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to me in another part of the world) together with two Shirts of his, (for indeed I had none of my own) and a pair of Shooes, I put out the Candles, and with all expedition I ſlipt out of a window into the Street, where again I unſheath'd, being reſolv'd to attacque whomſoever I ſhould rencounter in the Streets, and not to part with that Liberty, which, though in a ſmall meaſure, I was then newly made poſſeſſour of, unleſs with my life. I went through ſeveral Streets, and by a favourable providence, I eſcapt all rencounter or diſcovery: I came at laſt to the River-ſide near the Caſtle, where preſently I threw my ſelf in, but after having been a little there, finding my ſelf incommoded in ſwimming, by reaſon of the Sword and other things, I ſwum back to ſhoar, where I ſtripp'd my ſelf, and laid all upon my back kept together by my Breeches button'd about my neck: ſo I committed my ſelf again to the water; but the Tide carrying me upon one of the Ships, I was oblig'd to ſtruggle with all my ſtrength to get clear of it, which maugre all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I could not do ſo effectually, but that I came within hearing of their talk aboard. I conjectur'd then that the reaſon of my ſlow proceedings might be the weight of the burthen I carried, and beſides my arms were a little weary, and I had a great mind to throw my ſelf on my back and eaſe my ſelf; whereupon I unbutton'd and let all my Clothes, Riches and Armour go together, and ſwimming on my back, I at length came to the other ſide of the River, a little weary, and altogether naked and defenceleſs.</p>
            <p>Now the dangers began to crowd upon me, and I had ſo near a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, that I wiſh'd I had never undertook the work, and was entring into conſideration of returning to my former eſtate; but when I reflected on the loſs of my Patrons Scimitar and the Gold, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate eſtate gave me both hopes and courage; I had more than paſt <hi>Rubicon</hi> I thought then, for there was no returning: ſo up I got, and having almoſt rounded <hi>North-Salle</hi> and left it behind me, with a good ſpeed I made away, having no other direction, ſaving the noiſe of the breaking of the Sea upon the Shoar within half a League on my left hand; it was moreover dark, and there was no path or road that I could hit upon, ſo that many times I ſtumbled, and fell over Stones, which cut and bruis'd my naked body. With theſe ſort of divertiſements I entertain'd my ſelf until day-break; when ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſome diſtance before me a Miſt ariſe, and being ignorant of the occaſion, and fearing leſt it might be the effect of ſome Travellers, I turn'd to the left, over a great Bank, on the other ſide of which, I happily fell in upon a Sand upon which the Sea broke, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued about eleven or twelve miles in length; there I had good run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for a while, till ſuch time as I ſaw three <hi>Moors</hi> upon the Sand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63264:12"/>
before me; but having nothing to ſay to them, nor any mind to their company, I turn'd therefore to my right hand over the foremention'd bank, where I fell in upon a path, which I meaſured with all the haſte I could, until I had in view a couple of Tents roar'd up in the path way: theſe I thought it a very unſeaſonable complement to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ſo ſoon in the morning, and therefore endeavoured to decline them, by turning up the bank upon the left hand; upon the ridge of which I was obliged to travail above a mile in great trouble, wading through thick Fuzze and Goſs, which prick'd me with exceeding vexation and ſmart; the <hi>Moors</hi> on either hand of me, conſtraining me to keep this middle courſe, unleſs I would expoſe my ſelf to a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt hazard of being retaken. It pleaſed God that I had left the tent a pretty way behind me, I turn'd therefore down into the path afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, where I exerciſed my feet to the beſt purpoſe that ever I think I did in my life, for about three miles, and then I came within ſight of <hi>Mamora</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſon.</p>
            <p>I was then about two miles diſtance, and being oblig'd to part with the path which I had hitherto followed, and then turn'd away from <hi>Mamora,</hi> I found great difficulty to run with that haſte which my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions required, for the ground was full of ſtumps, and other aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities very afflictive to my naked and wounded feet, which rendred that little laſt ſtage much more tedious than all the reſt of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; beſides laſſitude grew upon me ſo faſt, that I almoſt fainted, ſo that I moſt impatiently long'd to reach the only place of my ſafety, fearing leſt I ſhould founder in the entrance into the Port, after having eſcap'd the great difficulties of a dangerous voyage. There was a hill upon my right hand, which I had a fancy to aſcend, thence to make my deſcent to the Gariſon at pleaſure; the <hi>Moors</hi> kept a kind of a Gariſon there to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from ſallying out to forrage the Country; this I was ignorant of, otherwiſe I had not directed my courſe thither, however this errour was very inſtrumental to my preſervation, for the <hi>Moors</hi> who ſaw me though I did not them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving me direct my courſe towards them, imagined I muſt be a friend, whereas if I had made directly for <hi>Mamora,</hi> they had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intercepted me. When I came to the foot of the hill, being then out of ſight of thoſe who were on the top, I found the ground ſo full of ſmall Snail-ſhels, which cut my feet extreamly, that I thought it more convenient to go along by the foot of the hill, which was much eaſyer: I was got at laſt ſo near the Gariſon, that I could call to the Souldiers, who were very numerous upon the works; I call'd out to them that I was a Chriſtian, and begg'd them to relieve me by admitting me to come in; they wav'd their hats to me, and withall I ſaw a company ſent from the Gariſon, enter a ſquare-Fort which was ſome little diſtance from it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued waving their hats, which I miſtook for a ſign to ſtay there where I was, and make no further advance till ſuch-time as they had ſent out to enquire what I was; I therefore ſat me down there, at length off comes a great Gun from <hi>Mamora,</hi> whoſe Bullet graz'd upon the ſide of the hill above me, which I looking after, ſaw the <hi>Moors</hi> who had miſtruſted my long ſtay, coming down upon me, and then I made
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63264:13"/>
all the haſte that fear could inſpire me with, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time firing at the <hi>Moors</hi> to ſtop their eager purſuit; at laſt with my utmoſt endeavours reacht the little Fort, at the bottom of whoſe wall I fell down quite ſpent, ſo that my ſpirit fail'd me.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers carryed me in a Cloak up to the Gariſon, where the Governour, after having caus'd a glaſs of Wine to be pour'd into my mouth to revive me, queſtioned me what I was and whence I came (for indeed I was ſo cover'd all over my body with blood, ſweat and duſt, that it was hard to diſtinguiſh me from a <hi>Moor</hi> by my colour) I ſatisfied him that I was an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> whom God had been ſo merciful to, as laſt night to beſtow an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of eſcaping from a heavy Slavery in <hi>Salle,</hi> and direct me to this bleſſed place of refuge, for whoſe preſervation and proſperity, all poor Chriſtians at <hi>Salle</hi> offer up their prayers, and I particularly held my ſelf obliged to do, ſo long as I liv'd. The Courteous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Gentleman (whoſe name I am ſorry I have forgot) congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated my Deliverance, and told me I was heartily welcome to that place, and becauſe he ſaw my condition required not much diſcourſe at that inſtant, he recommended me to the care of the Phyſitian, who very charitably procur'd me a few Cloaths, and apply'd to me ſuch things as I had need of: and then committed me to reſt until about noon, at which time the Governour ſent for me to come to him upon one of the Rampiers, to ſhew me ſome Horſemen hunting among ſome Buſhes, and he conceited that I was the game they were in queſt of; I accorded with his opinion, and to confirm him in it, I aſſured him that ſuch a horſe which I pointed out to him, did belong to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Lucas</hi> who was my Patron. The <hi>Moors</hi> were then within reach of the Guns, the Governour therefore commanded to let fly amongſt them, and I upon my requeſt, to honour the departure of my Patron whom I thought never to have ſeen more, had the favour to fire two at him, which though they did no execution that we could perceive, yet we obſerv'd the place was too hot for them, ſo that they made haſte to be gone.</p>
            <p>It is hard to be expreſs'd, what a great ſatisfaction it was to me, to ſee my cruel Enemy (whom but 24 hours before I dreaded as <hi>Indians</hi> do the Devil) flee from me, and endeavour an eſcape out of my reach, with as much eagerneſs, as the night before I did out of his. Though I then ſmarted a little under the ſenſe of my weary and wounded body, yet the thoughts of my Liberty entertain'd me with ſuch pleaſant divertiſements, as are not to be conceived by any but thoſe who are in the circumſtances that I was in, and who can value their preſent Liberty, (which together with health makes life it ſelf comfortable, and without which it is but an uneaſy burthen) by a competition with a hard and grievous Bondage under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, yea, ſuperſtitiouſly bigotiſh Enemies of my God, my Religion, and my own perſon. Yet when I reflected upon the weakneſs of the Gariſon, (which that afternoon I had an opportunity to ſurvey) which was no bigger in circumference than the <hi>Tower of London;</hi> the feeble reſiſtance that 400 diſheartened half-ſtarv'd ſickly <hi>Spaniards</hi> could make againſt an innumerable ſwarm of <hi>Moors,</hi> (who lay about and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63264:13"/>
in a manner beſieged them) ſhould they attaque them, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my fears did a little qualify my joy, and I could not foreforbear wiſhing that my Patron and I were at a greater diſtance. All the night I could hardly reſt, for the <hi>Moors</hi> twice allarm'd us, and the Bells about the walls were ſounding every moment, to keep the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers a wake and to their duty; for ſhould they be remiſs for half an hour only, it had been eaſy methought to ſurpriſe the place, being defended only with a dry Ditch, and pitiful low Walls.</p>
            <p>The next morning early, the wind preſented fair, five <hi>Barca-longa</hi>'s, which had brought proviſion from <hi>Cadis,</hi> were returning home, in one of which I gladly embarkt, bidding adieu to <hi>Mamora</hi> my refuge and place of Deliverance, which ſince about two years agoe (as I heard with ſorrow from <hi>Hamet Lucas</hi> himſelf) was taken by the <hi>Moors</hi> after above a 100 years poſſeſſion of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that he was the firſt man who entred it. We ſail'd along the <hi>Barbary-Coaſt</hi> all the day, nothing occurring remarkable, ſave that in the afternoon, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sea-men acquainted me that we were purſued. It was very ſtrange and ſurpriſing when I beheld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern of us, an innumerable quantity of Fiſh, making after us at full gallop as it were, leaping above the water; they quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took us, and ſo purſu'd their journey, without any concern at our hallooing, as they paſt very near us, on both ſides our boat: they were not ſo long as ordinary Cod, but they appear'd much broader; what the meaning of the frolick ſhould be, I cannot tell, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeem'd more affected with my amazement, than with that ſtrange appearance, ſo that I ſuppoſe this was an ordinary divertment, that that kind of Fiſh affords upon that Coaſt.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> morning, we were got as far as <hi>A-la-rach</hi> another Gariſon belonging to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the Mouth of a River, at which time we heard much ſhooting out at Sea, ſo that we thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to put into <hi>Larache.</hi> This is a ſtrong place, the Walls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing a conſiderable piece of ground, where grow abundance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grapes and rare Fruits. The Town is fortified by two ſtrong Caſtles, well-ſtor'd with great Ordnance; into one of which we were permitted to aſcend, to view a rare ſight at Sea, a very unequal Combat as to number, yet briskly maintain'd by one <hi>Dutch man of War</hi> againſt ſix <hi>Algerines,</hi> whereof the Admiral and Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were two, and the leaſt was of two and thirty Guns. The fight continued till noon, when two great <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> and <hi>Van Ghent</hi> in the <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> and another coming up, the <hi>Turks</hi> thought beſt to make ſail and ſtand away; and then luckily a-head of them, as they were weathering <hi>Cape Spartil,</hi> appeared ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> men of War, Captain <hi>Beech</hi> was Commander of one. The <hi>Algerines</hi> being hemm'd in, reſolv'd rather to venture through the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſo make their way into the <hi>Streights,</hi> than to turn back upon <hi>Van-Ghent,</hi> whoſe great Guns ſtruck a great terrour into them: ſo up they went to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But Captain <hi>Beech</hi> with the firſt broad-ſide diſabling their Admiral, they all together tack'd and run aſhore in the Bay of <hi>Arzilla,</hi> where they were all ſet on fire, abundance of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being reliev'd, and abundance of <hi>Turks</hi> being kill'd. The Governour of <hi>Larache</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63264:14"/>
commanded our <hi>Barca</hi> to go out and bring an account of the action, which we did, and return'd again at night with the news, that the <hi>Algerines</hi> who were deſtroy'd were, the <hi>Springing Tyger,</hi> the <hi>Standing Tyger,</hi> the <hi>Date Tree,</hi> the <hi>Shepherdeſs,</hi> I have forgot the names of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Next day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> we ſet forward for <hi>Cadis,</hi> and upon <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> night we arrived in the Bay. The next morning I apply'd my ſelf to Mr. <hi>Weſtcomb</hi> (ſince Knighted) then <hi>Conſul,</hi> who treated me not ſo much according to the exigency of my condition, as his own Generoſity, inviting me to his own Table daily, during my ſtay at <hi>Cadis</hi> which was about a ſortnight. There I ſaw ſome of theſe very <hi>Moors</hi> Slaves themſelves, who made me ſo; there being fifteen taken, aboard the <hi>French</hi> prize I formerly mentioned, by the <hi>Holmes-Friggot,</hi> and carried to <hi>Cadis</hi> and there ſold: this accident furniſh'd me with a pleaſant opportunity of thinking how the caſe was alter'd. About the middle of <hi>September,</hi> at Sir <hi>Martin Weſtcomb</hi>'s deſire, I obtain'd paſſage aboard a <hi>Dutch</hi> man of War deſign'd for S. <hi>Uves,</hi> from whence I travell'd by Land to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the place where I embarkt ſome four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fifteen weeks before, in that Veſſel wherein I was taken. I went to pay my reſpects to Dr. <hi>Cradock</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bulteel,</hi> who ſaw me when I was at <hi>Lisbon</hi> before, and could hardly be induc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I had been a Slave ſince, unleſs they had been aſſur'd by Mr. <hi>Parry,</hi> then Agent at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to whom I brought a Letter from the Conſul at <hi>Cadis,</hi> recommending me to his favour in procuring me a ſafe paſſage for <hi>England,</hi> and who certify'd him ſufficiently of my eſcape from <hi>Salle</hi> to <hi>Mamora,</hi> ſeeing I had brought Letters from the Governour of <hi>Mamora</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Veraguas,</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Cadis,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Weſtcomb</hi> himſelf delivered up to the Duke.</p>
            <p>After my ſtay in <hi>Lisbon</hi> about a fortnight, Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> the Agent aforeſaid, prevail'd with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul, to grant me paſſage for <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War (there being no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships of any force then in the River, and I was very unwilling, any more to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard my ſelf in ſmall Veſſels.) It was the very ſame Ship which I ſaw at <hi>Alarache,</hi> engag'd with the ſix <hi>Algerines.</hi> In the beginning of <hi>November</hi> I was brought to the <hi>Texel,</hi> (having had no convenience to be remov'd into any Ship in the Channel, by reaſon of a great Storm that hurried us over to the <hi>Holland</hi> Coaſt:) from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> I came to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where hearing, that Sir <hi>John Chicheley</hi> then Envoy from his Majeſty to the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> was returning inſtantly for <hi>England,</hi> I made haſte to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd paſſage for <hi>England</hi> amongſt his retinue, ſo that I return'd to <hi>England</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1670, and never have been out of his Majeſties Dominions ſince.</p>
            <p>After my return I immediately went for <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I fell into the favour of <hi>George Wheeler</hi> Eſquire then Gentleman-Commoner of <hi>Lincoln-Colledge,</hi> who was pleas'd to think my indigent condition a fit object of his charity; with whom and his Father Colonel <hi>Charles Wheeler</hi> I lived in quality of Tutor to his Children from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1670, until <hi>May</hi> 1672. During which time I received Deacon's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, from the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s hands, and at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> following I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63264:14"/>
was ordained Prieſt by the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> In 1673, <hi>William</hi> then Lord <hi>Grey of Wark</hi> admitted me to be his Chaplain, with whom I lived until his Death 1674, after which being invited by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I removed thither, and lived conſtantly in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the execution of my Miniſterial Function, until 1679, when I was call'd into <hi>England,</hi> upon what occaſion will be the ſubject of my following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>This is a true account of my <hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Eſcape,</hi> which I appeal to many thouſands whether or not it agrees exactly, with what I have related theſe twelve years paſt; <hi>Haec meminiſſe juvat.</hi> I cannot indeed diſown a piece of vanity I have had, in frequently reflecting upon this remarkable accident of my life, and ſuch complacency I have had therein, that I have always freely comply'd with any hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome invitation to relate it; for there is a great pleaſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the great Dangers I have paſt (Dangers to evade which, the <hi>Salamanca-Doctor</hi> would I believe have pawn'd all his <hi>True-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> expectations, yea and his <hi>Swearing Faculty</hi> too, which now conſidering the temptations he is under, I am afraid hee'l be damn'd before hee'l part with it.) I have indeed heard many diſcredit the whole Relation, as Romantick, but I never heard any tax me of an <hi>Otiſm, i. e.</hi> inconſiſtency with my ſelf, as if I told one Story by Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and a quite different one again in the day. But now that, <hi>Haggi Hamet Lucas,</hi> (who was my Patron in the place of my <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity)</hi> has by a ſtrange providence come over to this Countrey, and before ſeveral perſons of Quality and Reputation, atteſted the truth of all theſe things by me related, which were within the ſphere of his knowledge; I ſuppoſe there will be but little ſcruple remaining, to unprejudic'd perſons in the belief of the above-written Narrative. Suppoſing it then true, what is there in it, to render me Criminal? Becauſe I am lame muſt I be beaten with my own Crutches? Becauſe I have been unfortunate, is it for that I muſt be miſerable? Becauſe I have made an eſcape from a ſad <hi>Captivity</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> do I therefore deſerve to be hang'd here in <hi>England?</hi> He muſt be a Devil at making of Plots, as well as diſcovering them, who can make ſuch inferences as theſe paſs, who becauſe by Gods aſſiſtance to my own endeavours I have ſav'd my Countrey the trouble and price of my Redemption, will therefore bring me in guilty of Treaſon againſt her; and this calls to my mind the <hi>Salamanca-Doctor.</hi>

            <head>An Account of TITUS OATES HIS DEPOSITIONS Againſt ME.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very hard to conceive, that any thing made after the Image of God, and endu'd with a reaſonable ſoul, (howſoever degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and corrupt) ſhould affect evil only for the love of evil, and covet miſchief for its own ſake; this is ſo great a reproach, and caſts ſuch a diſhonourable reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane nature, that no man can ſuppoſe ſuch a Devil incarnate: and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Titus Oates</hi> himſelf (though we ſhould comply with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and believe all his Depoſitions to have been only the reſult of his own wicked and miſchievous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) had always the hopes of Grandeur and the importunate ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of cunning politick heads, together with a gratification to his Revenge, or ſome natural inclination, to plead as an acquittance from the imputation of ſo Diabolical a temper. And really the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Benedictines</hi> were very uncharitable to him, when he poor Rogue ſeem'd abandon'd by God and Man, and was forc'd to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to get bread, and not having the fear of God before his eyes, had no other deſign to maintain himſelf in life, but by conſpiring the Kings death: for them firſt to turn him away ignominiouſly from S. <hi>Omers</hi> as an <hi>indocible Blockhead,</hi> that could never be brought to turn three Lines of <hi>Engliſh</hi> into tolerable <hi>Latin;</hi> and then to diſown him here in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding he had a Patent <hi>(Riſum teneatis!)</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> to be admitted to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cabals; and in the next place to oblige him without Shooes and Stockings, to go a-begging to the <hi>Benedictines</hi> in the <hi>Savoy</hi> for, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63264:16"/>
Scraps of a dinner; and then for <hi>Corker</hi> and the reſt to bid the Maid ſhut the Door upon him, this is enough to make a man ſo hungry as he was, to be very angry, and to ſwear too: ſo that conſidering the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s temper, the ſatisfaction of his revenge might be alleadg'd as ſome kind of excuſe to qualify the malignity of his Oathes againſt theſe people. And now probably the Readers curioſity is excited to the enquiry upon what occaſion, motive or provocation, the wicked <hi>Doctor</hi> (ſuppoſing the falſity of his Depoſitions) was induc'd to ſwear ſo maliciouſly againſt <hi>me:</hi> for ſatisfaction thereto, he muſt know that <hi>Charles Lord North and Grey,</hi> was the ſole and only occaſion of <hi>Oates</hi>'s ſwearing againſt me; it was to oblige this Noble Lord (for whoſe intereſt it was thought neceſſary to have me diſeſteem'd, and put out of capacity and credit) the curſed <hi>Doctor</hi> pawn'd his Soul, which will appear plainly to have been his deſign not only from the expreſs words of his own Depoſitions, but alſo from the ſaid <hi>Lord</hi>'s acknowledgment upon his Oath, in Court at our Tryal. But how this noble <hi>Lord</hi> became ſo concern'd to appear my Enemy, the Reader will underſtand from what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> late <hi>Lord Grey of Werk,</hi> by his laſt Will and Teſtament, left to his Daughter <hi>Katharine</hi> now <hi>Lady North</hi> two hundred Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys as a Legacy, and his Son <hi>Ralph</hi> afterwards <hi>Lord Grey,</hi> he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſole Executor of his Will; by <hi>Deed</hi> having ſettled his Eſtate upon his Grandſon <hi>Ford</hi> the preſent <hi>Lord Grey of Werk.</hi> This was a very great diſappointment to the <hi>Lord Grey</hi> of <hi>Rolleſtone,</hi> now <hi>Lord North,</hi> who had entertain'd great expectations, not only of being Executor to his Father in Law, but alſo of having a conſiderable part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſettled upon him; though upon what foundation he built ſuch mighty hopes unleſs his own fancy, ſeems very unaccountable. For the Lord <hi>William Grey</hi> had beſtow'd a plentiful Portion with his Daughter; and he always careſs'd his Son and Grand-ſons with a paternal affection, as the props and ſupports of his Name and Family: and why then he ſhould alientate his Eſtate, and beſtow it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name, is very unſuitable to that wiſdom and prudent conduct by which the ſaid <hi>Lord</hi> was always obſerv'd to have manag'd his affairs. Howſoever the <hi>Lord North</hi> left no means unattempted, no Stone unrolled, to find out a <hi>Diſh of Deeds,</hi> as his Lordſhip learnedly phras'd it, but all in vain: at length two <hi>Sons of Belial, William Warren</hi> (who had been for a long time Steward in the <hi>Lord Grey of Werk</hi>'s Family, and then for his infidelity caſhier'd) and <hi>Iſaack</hi> his Son (much about the ſame time and upon the like account, diſcarded the ſervice of the <hi>Lady Dowager Grey)</hi> being both turn'd out of Beneficial employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not having any other ways of ſubſiſtance, they lay hold of this humour of my <hi>Lord North,</hi> reſolving to incourage him in it, and to improve it to two different purpoſes; namely, to procure themſelves a livelihood thereby, and beſides to revenge themſelves upon the <hi>Lord Grey</hi> and the <hi>Lady Dowager</hi> his Mother. To this purpoſe, they inform the <hi>Lord North</hi> that he is much injur'd by the Lady <hi>Dowager Grey,</hi> Executrix to her Husband Lord <hi>Ralph Grey,</hi> pretended Executor only to his Father the <hi>Lord William Grey,</hi> becauſe that the <hi>Lady North</hi> was appointed ſole Executrix, by the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63264:17"/>
laſt Will of the ſaid <hi>William Lord Grey,</hi> and that the <hi>Lord Ralph</hi> had burnt that Schedule wherein ſhe was nominated, and forg'd another, wherein he nominated himſelf, and ſubſtituted it in the place of the other; this they both atteſt upon their Oathes, upon which the <hi>Lord North</hi> commences a ſute againſt the <hi>Lady Dowager Grey.</hi> The Cauſe after ſeveral removes from Court to Court, at laſt center'd before the Delegates. To be ſhort, after a tedious examination of Witneſſes produc'd on both ſides, the <hi>Delegates</hi> having diligently weigh'd the arguments, came to a final determination, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly pronounc'd in favour of the <hi>Lady Grey,</hi> judging that Raſcal <hi>Iſaack Warren</hi> (who confeſs'd himſelf to be a Villain, in betraying his Lord <hi>William Lord Grey,</hi> and in being acceſſory to the forging his laſt Will and Teſtament, before he could be in a capacity to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for <hi>Thomas Lord North)</hi> to be much more a Villain after, and that his Teſtimony involv'd a manifeſt contradiction, and conſequently that he was forſworn. It was, during the tryal of this Cauſe in that Court, that I was ſent for from <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> about <hi>September</hi> 1679, I was produc'd as a Witneſs by the <hi>Lady Grey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had delivered what I knew as to that Cauſe, I prepar'd for my return back to <hi>Dublin;</hi> and accordingly I had took a place in the <hi>Cheſter-Coach</hi> for the <hi>Munday</hi> following. But the day before, as I was preaching at S. <hi>Gyles</hi>'s <hi>Church in the Fields,</hi> in the Afternoon, news came to the <hi>Lady Grey,</hi> that there was a Warrant out to apprehend me as a <hi>Jeſuit;</hi> upon which, I was conveyed home, and commanded to keep my ſelf cloſe, till ſuch time as her Ladyſhip had made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what the matter was.</p>
            <p>At length I underſtood from her Ladyſhip, that the <hi>Lord North</hi> and <hi>Titus Oates</hi> had that morning met at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and after ſome conference, they came where his Majeſty was, and told him for news, that they had diſcovered where one of the moſt dangerous <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was; one that was lately come over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſent as a Spy; one who hid himſelf under a Parſons Gown, and preacht in our Churches ſometimes; at other times he would put on a Cloak and hold forth in a Conventicle, and anon, one might hear him ſaying <hi>Maſs</hi> in <hi>Sommerſet-Chappel.</hi> His Majeſty was aſtoniſh'd at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch a fellow, who at ſuch a time of the day, durſt appear to affront the ſeverity of the Laws which were then moſt rigorouſly put in Execution, and was pleas'd to demand his Name, and enquir'd of <hi>Oates</hi> if he knew him. <hi>Oates</hi> told his Majeſty, that his name was <hi>Elliot,</hi> and that he knew him very well, for one of the moſt miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wicked men in the world, and that he believ'd he had more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in him, than all the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had who were hang'd; nay more ſays he, he is a <hi>Circumcis'd Jeſuit.</hi> God bleſs us, ſays his Majeſty, <hi>What ſort of Jeſuit is that?</hi> A <hi>Jeſuit</hi> who is no Chriſtian but a <hi>Turk,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Salamanca Devil.</hi> And thus they went on, the <hi>Lord</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſtriving to outvy each other in burthening my poor name with all the Infamy imaginable, and that before his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; as if I were unworthy of his protection, or the benefit of the Laws. At length, <hi>his Majeſty</hi> weary of ſuch an odious deſcription, was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63264:17"/>
pleas'd to retire, bidding them get a Warrant to apprehend me; which they immediately did from <hi>Sir William Waller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her Ladyſhip moreover made me acquainted, that there was an <hi>Advertiſement</hi> in the <hi>Gazette</hi> for the next day concerning me, and therefore that it would not be my beſt courſe to ſet forward for <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for that I was repreſented under ſo vile a Character, that the <hi>Mobile</hi> would certainly tear me in pieces. However <hi>her Ladyſhip</hi> bid me chear up and not to deſpond, for I ſhould find friends enough to ſtand by me and defend my innocence, ſo that never a <hi>Lord</hi> nor <hi>Devil-of-a-Doctor</hi> of them all ſhould prejudice me: <hi>her Ladyſhip</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that night ſent and prevented the <hi>Advertiſement</hi> in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> and bid me prepare my ſelf to appear before <hi>Sir William</hi> the next morning.</p>
            <p>About nine of the Clock the day following, I ſaw a Conſtable with ſome <hi>Red-Coats</hi> coming to my <hi>Lady Grey</hi>'s Houſe, and fearing leſt they ſhould affront <hi>Her Ladyſhip</hi> if I ſhould be out of the way, I went and met them at the Gate; I demanded whom they would ſpeak with? The Conſtable told me, that he had a Warrant to ſearch for, and apprehend a Prieſt in that houſe; I aſſur'd him, there was no Prieſt belong'd to that Family except my ſelf: he inquir'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was one, I anſwered that I was, but of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that my name was <hi>Elliot;</hi> and moreover I told him, I thought I was the perſon he was in queſt of. He reply'd that he was of the ſame opinion, and withall commanded me along with him; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired whither I muſt go; he told me to <hi>Sir William Waller,</hi> whoſe Warrant he ſhew'd me. The Honourable <hi>Ralph Grey</hi> Eſquire came to the Conſtable, and deſir'd him to command the <hi>Red-Coats</hi> to keep off, becauſe the People ſeeing them attend a Coach, would be apt to affront us, and withall proffer'd me the honour of his Company: which I with all thankful acknowledgments moſt willingly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And indeed I had reaſon, for if it had not been for his preſence, and the influence of the Right Honourable the Lady his Mother, I had been certainly ſent to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and whither then God knows, for <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, he never begins a buſineſs but he goes thorough-ſtitch with it: he might have ſworn that he ſaw a Letter under my hand, which encourag'd <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> to proceed to murther the King, as eaſily as he ſwore that he ſaw one under my hand, wherein I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that I had received <hi>Prieſts Orders</hi> and ſung <hi>High Maſs</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> I will ſwear he ſaw one as much as the other.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, we took Coach and went directly to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Wallers</hi> houſe in <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> whilſt we were going thither, the Conſtable enquir'd whether ever I had been amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> I told him I had; the Conſtable then ſhook his head, telling Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> that it would go hard with me, for that there was ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt me that I was both a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and a <hi>Turkiſh-Prieſt;</hi> Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> could not forbear laughing, whilſt I was heartily vex'd to ſee my ſelf thus abus'd. When we came to Sir <hi>Williams,</hi> after a little ſquabling, and ſome coarſe complements I was oblig'd to paſs upon his Worſhip, Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> and he withdrew, and after having the Caſe clearly ſtated to him, Sir <hi>William</hi> return'd to me, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63264:18"/>
my pardon, for he underſtood I was a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and had the relation of Chaplain to a very Honourable Family, which he was ſure, would not entertain within their doors any one repreſented under the character that I was; and ſo he profeſs'd himſelf ſorry that upon a miſinformation he gave me this trouble, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> to go to <hi>Oates</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Whitehall</hi> with me, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Conſtable to attend, he ſaid he would preſently follow us, and endeavour my diſmiſſion, which he did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oates</hi> in the mean time, being inform'd that Perſons of great Quality would appear in my vindication, if any danger threatned me, and that the <hi>Lord North</hi>'s deſign of Revenge was too too apparent in the buſineſs, alters his mind, and haſtning down to Sir <hi>Williams</hi> at that time when we were coming to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> he met his Coach follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing us; and going into Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Coach, the firſt thing he ſaid (as a Gentleman then preſent inform'd me) was, Sir <hi>William,</hi> you muſt not meddle with Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> for I have nothing to ſay againſt him: Nor I neither, anſwered Sir <hi>William,</hi> for he is a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and has his Orders about him. A little after our coming to <hi>Oates</hi>'s Chamber, where were abundance of people, the <hi>Doctor</hi> came in, to whom addreſſing my ſelf, I ask'd him if he knew me; he told me, that he remembred me very well at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> about twelve years ago, and that ſince he never ſaw me; he heard, he ſaid, and was inform'd, that I had ſaid <hi>Maſs</hi> in <hi>Sommerſet-Chappel,</hi> but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it was a miſtake: pray, <hi>Mr. Oates,</hi> ſaid I, what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the report you have rais'd, as if I were circumcis'd; <hi>Truly,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>when I was at</hi> Rome, <hi>the Fathers of the</hi> Scotch <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enquir'd whether I knew you;</hi> knew whom, ſays I? <hi>They ask'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>whether I knew one</hi> Adam Elliot, <hi>who had been of their Colledge; I told them I knew youvery well, and that I heard you had been taken Captive by the</hi> Turks; <hi>It may be, reply the Fathers, they have Circumcis'd him.</hi> This is all, ſays he, that I know of the buſineſs. This was a piece of ſuch intolerable impudence, that I could hardly refrain giving him the Lye; for he not only contradicted what he had told His Majeſty the day before (as perſons of the greateſt Quality can atteſt) but he contriv'd a Story, whoſe every Sillable was falſe: for I never was in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> I never ſaw it to my knowledge, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever ſee a <hi>Scotch</hi> Father, neither was I ever reputed a <hi>Scotch-man</hi> whilſt I was abroad; and moreover my Name was never known to be <hi>Elliot:</hi> ſo that knowing theſe things to be falſe, I had reaſon to queſtion whether ever he had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> which I do ſtill. However, I thought it was not convenient to put him out of humour by my contradiction at that time, but I let him go on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, to tell Lyes as long as he pleas'd; at laſt ſeeing him at a pauſe, I ask'd him if he had any thing to alledge why the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable might not be diſcharged farther attendance; his Doctorſhip was pleas'd to ſpeak the word that he might go about his buſineſs, and ſo I was ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>This Lenity of the <hi>Doctor</hi> in cauſing me to be apprehended, and immediately diſcharg'd, was not the effect of his Repentance or good Nature, but of his Cowardice and Fear, as the Reader will preſently
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63264:18"/>
conclude. As ſoon as with convenience I could, I made haſte for <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet not with that ſpeed, but that a Pacquet or two had got over before me, and carried the news of my apprehenſion, and of <hi>Oates</hi>'s Depoſitions againſt me: the News was ſo general, that there was no doubt of the matter of fact; and <hi>Oates</hi>'s teſtimony was in ſo great credit then, that it was judg'd a crime equal to Blaſphemy or Treaſon to call it in queſtion: ſo that even my friends and intimate acquaintance were at a loſs what to think of me; the Diſſenters and Enemies of our Cathedrals (of which I was a Member) did inſult and triumph upon this ſham-occaſion. At length in the very heat of theſe prepoſſeſſions, I landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> upon a Sunday-morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and immediately repair'd to the Church, where I officiated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the duty of my place; moſt people were aſtoniſh'd to ſee me, becauſe I was reported generally to be in <hi>Newgate</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> But the Phanaticks were almoſt diſtracted, to ſee their falſe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence confuted by ſo lively an argument as my appearance; and my not being a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt, or a Circumeis'd <hi>Turk,</hi> they thought would baffle the Doctor's Infallibility, damn the Plot, and confound them all. O! what a great ſcandal it was to them, to ſee me walk the Streets, but much more to hear me diſcourſe freely, as, God help me! I could not forbear ſometimes, when <hi>Titus Oates</hi> came in the way of my fancy. Theſe were affronts that were intollerable, and therefore they watch'd my converſation, and always to enſnare me. At laſt, I unhappily fell into the company of a turbulent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Fellow, a City-Captain, who endeavour'd to raiſe his credit by catching of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts, and he had got a little fame by that way: but now, if he could but entrap <hi>me,</hi> he thought he ſhould gain immortal honour. Amongſt other diſcourſe, he deſired of me to be ſatisfied of the occaſion of theſe reports ſpread concerning me when I was in <hi>England;</hi> I endeavour'd to ſatisfy him all I could, but all would not do, for ſays he, I am ſure Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> cannot Lye, and I am pretty well aſſured, that he ſaid you were a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt and a <hi>Turk</hi> beſides. This inſolent expreſſion provokt me to ſome paſſionate reſentment; ſo that I told him, that <hi>Oates</hi> was a great Lying Rogue, and he was another: this is not to be endur'd by any <hi>True Proteſtant,</hi> ſays the Captain, ſpeak your pleaſure of me, ſays he, but do not blaſpheme the venerable <hi>Doctor;</hi> the <hi>Doctor,</hi> continued I, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with no more truth againſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> than he did againſt me, they died Martyrs: At this, the Captain riſes and runs away to Sir <hi>Robert Booth,</hi> a <hi>True-Proteſtant</hi> L. C. J. of the Kings Bench, and makes <hi>affidavit,</hi> that I ſaid that <hi>Titus Oates was a Rogue, and the five Jeſuits Martyrs.</hi> To be ſhort, I was ſent for by a Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, bound over to anſwer at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> the near approaching term, when I was indicted for theſe very words, found guilty, and fin'd 200 <hi>l.</hi> and impriſonment until I paid it. At the ſame time, comes over from <hi>England</hi> a pretended character of <hi>Adam Elliot,</hi> directed to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Quality in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who was deſired to diſperſe Copies of it; it was ſubſcribed <hi>North and Grey,</hi> and was a baſe, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Libel, ſtufft with lies and impudence; it is <hi>Scandalum Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> any perſon profeſſing Honour and Honeſty, as the Author
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63264:19"/>
of it. He aſſerts upon his honour, that I was expell'd the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that I was a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that I was a <hi>Renegado</hi> and a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan,</hi> that I was a Felon, that I was a Murderer, that I was guilty of Forgery, and particularly that I combin'd with <hi>Ralph Lord Grey of Werk,</hi> and with him forg'd the laſt Will of his Father <hi>William Lord Grey,</hi> to the prejudice of the <hi>Lord North</hi> of above 30000 <hi>l.</hi> This infamous character, howſoever moſt abominably, and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end falſe, yet coming under the ſpecious recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Perſon of Honour, did much prejudice me, eſpecially with the concurrence of my other misfortunes, ſo that I was rendered very odious and vile, inſomuch that my confinement was my beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for if I had walkt the Streets I had been in danger of being ſton'd.</p>
            <p>At length, after this violent ferment of the Peoples hatred by a little time, as is uſual, had begun to abate, the Privy Council upon my Petition, were pleas'd to conſider my condition, as thinking that I had met with very hard meaſure for ſpeaking a few words, (which were by the ſevereſt conſtruction, the reſult only of paſſion and inadvertency) and being pretty well ſatisfied of my good inclinations to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, as alſo to the Government, and my averſion to <hi>Popery;</hi> and withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how I labour'd under the calumnies and ſlanders of a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libel, apparently falſe, and deſign'd out of malice to ruin my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that I had no way to do my ſelf right, ſo long as I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confinement, they were pleas'd to order my releaſement upon Bail until the next Term, and then I ſatisfied the Law, and was diſcharg'd.</p>
            <p>After my departure from <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Lord North</hi> perceiving how much <hi>a propô</hi> it would be to invalidate my teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>viz.</hi> that excellent invention of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> (for though a <hi>Papiſts</hi> Oath may be taken, yet no man ſure will believe one who has renounc't the Chriſtian Faith) he renews his ſollicitations to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> to ſwear againſt me in the Court of <hi>Delegates:</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> who us'd not to ſwear lightly and <hi>in vain, i. e.</hi> for nothing, ſeem'd ſhy at firſt; but having heard that I call'd him a Rogue and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Martyrs, he comply'd with the deſire of his good Friend, the <hi>Lord North,</hi> who at that time; the Reader muſt take notice, was <hi>a Petitioning Lord,</hi> that is, one of thoſe Lords, who ſubſcrib'd and preſented a Petition to his Majeſty for the ſitting of the Parliament, and therefore was by all obliging offices to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd and retain'd. (The Reader is likewiſe deſir'd to take notice, that at the <hi>Lord Stafford</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore, that a certain Lord ſent him a 100 <hi>l.</hi> but he neither tells us <hi>who,</hi> nor for <hi>what,</hi> ſo that whether this remark be to the purpoſe or not, I cannot as yet tell.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oates</hi>'s Depoſitions againſt me upon Oath are as followeth.</p>

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, (as he confeſt to the Deponent;) but for his rude, riotous, whoreing and debauch'd living, they withdrew his maintenance as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to this Deponent.

Theſe are the <hi>Depoſitions</hi> of <hi>Titus Oates</hi> againſt me, which did not flow from a precipitate raſhneſs, or inconſiderate paſſion, but were the adviſed reſult of ſix months deliberation, ſubſcribed by his own hand, and grounded upon the ſame motives of Credibility with his diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot; even his Oath and moſt ſolemn Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dreadful God, to avenge himſelf upon him, who beareth falſe witneſs againſt his Neighbour.

Now I do in the preſence of the almighty and all-ſeing God declare, that what <hi>Titus Oates</hi> has ſworn againſt me, is meer calumny, and malicious wilful detraction and ſlander, and abſolutely falſe; and that whoſoever might excite or encourage the Villain to this baſe and unworthy undertaking, yet certainly the Enemy of Mankind muſt have been mainly concern'd in the wicked contrivance, and the <hi>Doctor</hi> by his ſhameleſs impudent lying and falſe ſwearing, has plainly evidenc'd himſelf to be the Son of a Devil, by manifeſt characters and features lineally extracted from the <hi>Father of Lies</hi> and <hi>accuſer of the Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I expect ſome Readers may probably cut me ſhort, and tell me, that by aſſerting <hi>Doctor Oates</hi> to be forſworn, I inſinuate as if the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot were but a feignment, and a meer whim of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s invention; at leaſt I reflect moſt ſeverely upon his Diſcoveries, for if he can be found but once to have ſworn falſly, the credit of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions immediately ſinks, and every man for the future, will think himſelf oblig'd to disbelieve his Narrative.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that his Maje<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ letters">

               </gap> and Council have declar'd that there is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, and therefore I have reaſon to believe one; for the King is as an Angel of God, and has means of Intelligence that far tranſcend my little ſphere, or any Subjects; ſo that in deſpight of theſe objections <hi>Oates</hi> has laid in the way, I do really believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot; but withall I do declare, I do not believe one ſyllable thereof from beginning to ending, upon account of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> Depoſitions: and if it be criminal to deny it, or call it in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the truth and being of which is aſcertain'd by his Majeſties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in Council, and by the Votes of the Houſe of Lords and Commons in Parliament, then certainly there is abundant matter of Information againſt one <hi>Titus Oates a Salamanea-Doctor,</hi> who for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63264:21"/>
theſe three years paſt, has induſtriouſly endeavour'd to diſcredit it, and by contradicting Oaths, and forſwearing himſelf in ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, has ruin'd his own reputation, and labour'd as much as in him lay, to perſwade the Nation that his Narrative is a Lye, and the Plot a ſham; for which if he be not return'd into the <hi>Crown-Office,</hi> and anſwer for his miſdemeanour at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar,</hi> (as it ſhall be none of my fault if he do not,) yet I hope <hi>there will come a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and really I believe it will be a pleaſant ſight, to ſee <hi>Doctor Oates</hi> brought up by <hi>Topham,</hi> to anſwer at the Commons Bar, the contempt of God knows how many Votes.</p>
            <p>When the firſt diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot had alarum'd theſe Nations with a general conſternation and horrour, as reaſonably it muſt, I confeſs I bore a part; for being in a Country, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were very numerous, and where forty years inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val had ſcarce worn out the footſteps and bloody marks of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and inhumane Cruelty, and execrable Rebellion; methought the Proteſtauts there had all the reaſon in the world to be ſenſible of their Danger, and to ſtand upon their guard, ſeeing ſuch a dreadful Plot was ſworn to be upon the very brink of breaking out here in <hi>England.</hi> But when after all, <hi>Oates</hi>'s Narrative, and his Evidences againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and others who ſuffer'd, produc'd nothing but bare down-right confident Swearing, (a certain and infallible argument of nothing ſo much as his own traiterous diſpoſition formerly) I muſt confeſs my fears began to vaniſh, and ſtrong ſurmiſes to come in their place, leſt the <hi>Doctors</hi> Ears might be in greater jeopardy than our Throats. To ſpeak the truth, the 40000 <hi>Black-Bills,</hi> and the Army of <hi>Spaniſh Pilgrims,</hi> and <hi>Military Commiſſions</hi> from General <hi>D'Oliva,</hi> appear'd always to me ſo monſtrouſly ridiculous, that they offer an intolerable affront to the underſtanding of any man, who has but a very indifferent account of the affairs of <hi>Europe.</hi> I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reconcile if he can, <hi>Oates</hi>'s Depoſitions in <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>pag. 29th,</hi> where upon Oath he delivers to us, yea, and repeats it for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, <hi>That he never ſaw</hi> Langhorn <hi>after he had ſhewed him the Commiſſions;</hi> which there he tells us, was two days after the <hi>April Conſult;</hi> and yet in <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Tryal <hi>pag. 18th,</hi> he ſwears, <hi>he ſaw him twice or thrice after, in July and Auguſt:</hi> this laſt he thought himſelf oblig'd to ſwear, that he might charge <hi>Langhorn</hi> with a new Treaſon contriv'd at a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Conſult, which the Doctor made to be in theſe months at the <hi>Sav<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Theſe two evidences upon Oath are plainly contradictory, I am ſure, they can never both be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to truth. It never abated my honour and dutiful reſpects to His Royal Highneſs, that <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore firſt for him, and afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and notwithſtanding his <hi>Doctorſhip</hi>'s ſwearing through a double Door, yet I have ten times more reaſon to believe the <hi>Doctor</hi> to be a Son of a—, than His R. H. to be a Son of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I have heard much talk, and a great deal of Swearing there has been, about the <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> and a world of Letters brimfull of Treaſon, ſent by the Poſt too, whoſe Date the <hi>Doctor</hi> remembers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely; and yet wiſemen, if they do not think he Lyes, they cannot but admire that he ſhould have never a ſcrip nor ſcroul to ſhew; they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63264:21"/>
wonder he ſhould forget to bring at leaſt a Copy along with him: I would have been more generous my ſelf than <hi>Sir John Gage</hi> was to him, I would give twenty Shillings for the ſight of that Commiſſion, for which <hi>Sir John</hi> gave but ten.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>pag.</hi> he ſwore he never was really a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but a Counterfeit; then in the firſt place, I deſire the Reader to conſider what Religion he could be of, during his reſidence amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; which of the <hi>Whiggiſh</hi> Tribes could he be oblig'd to for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or whether the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would own ſuch a wicked Diſſembler with God and Man, who took all ſorts of Teſts of Oaths and Sacraments, yea, and committed abominable Idolatry, in deſpight of his conſcience; who equivocated beyond <hi>Garnet,</hi> and out-ly'd the Devil. In the next place, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but not granting him to have been then a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> pray Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ask him the next time you ſee him, why he did not carry the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves of the April-Conſult concerning the aſſaſinating his Majeſty, to one of the Secretaries of State, or to ſome Magiſtrate? He ſwears that he carried theſe Reſolves from one Club to another, ſubſcribed by the ſeveral hands of the Perſons, who were at the Clubs; could there a fitter opportunity offer it ſelf to diſcover the Plot, than at a time when he might have ſeiz'd all the Conſpirators coop'd up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? when he might ſo manifeſtly have convinc'd them, by their names and manual ſubſcriptions to the higheſt and expreſs moſt Treaſon i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable? Nay moreover, when a ſmall delay threaten'd His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſacred Perſon with an imminent, if not certain deſtruction. By his ſwearing himſelf to have been at that time no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I appeal to any man, whether he doth not in effect make Oath, that there was no ſuch traiterous Conſult: for it ſeems not probable, that there ſhould be ſuch a horrid palpable Conſpiracy, and ſuch an excellent convenience for Diſcovery, and yet a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſhould conceal it. But above all, I can hardly find in my heart to forgive him, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding His Majeſties pardon) the not preventing the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of His Majeſties ſacred Perſon, by <hi>Sir George Wakeman</hi>'s Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſome other way, by the four Ruffians at <hi>Windſor.</hi> In almoſt all the Trials, he ſticks to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſaw 80 <hi>lb.</hi> told down to be carried to them, and he ſaw a Guinney given for expedition; and yet this bloody Villain never made, nor attempted any diſcovery, when it might have been ſeaſonable: every minute he expected to hear the blow was given, and yet, which is monſtrous, he never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the leaſt prevention. Certainly <hi>Ravilliac</hi> and <hi>Jaques Clement</hi> were better Chriſtians than this Rogue; he Lyes, if he ſays he was then a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> or elſe he Lyes in deviſing this Plot, let him take his Choice.</p>
            <p>At the firſt diſcovery of the Plot, he was pleas'd to allow His Grace the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> a Guard of four ſuch Ruffians as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his <hi>Doctorſhip,</hi> and he made his Grace at that time ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> cauſe, that he appointed him <hi>Fogarthy</hi> for a Phyſitian: but this was in the dawning of the Diſcovery: the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is obſerv'd to make very conſiderable miſtakes by Candle-light, and ſo probably he might then miſtake his Grace for a certain <hi>Noble Peer;</hi> for afterwards, when the Plot was arriv'd to the Noon of its
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63264:22"/>
diſcovery, that People could ſee clearly who it was convenient to ſwear for, or againſt: His Grace was brought in as a favourer of that Religion, which before the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſwore would have murdered him; and God knows how many more were brought in upon the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. All the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were then ſeen tantivying it to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Conventicles</hi> were the only ſtrong Holds and Bulwarks of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion; whereas at the beginning, the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſwears in his Narrative, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by all means to encourage theſe ſeditious Separatiſts, and that the Meeting-houſes were the lurking holes of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the umbrage of the Toleration allow'd them, they abſconded themſelves from the view of the Law. Nay, if the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s friend <hi>Stephen Colledge</hi> had been permitted to finiſh <hi>his</hi> Diſcovery of the <hi>Plot</hi> and his <hi>Raree ſhow,</hi> I do not doubt, but his Majeſty had been drawn into the <hi>Plot</hi> againſt his own Life. The Learned <hi>Doctor</hi> may have read or heard at leaſt, that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> has been before now, charg'd with Treaſon againſt the Soveraign; they had got pretty near the King, when they made bold with the Queen, and however the <hi>Doctor</hi> has not been poſitive as yet to this point, <hi>yet he knows there is a time for all things.</hi> All which arguments, with abundance more too large to be here inſerted, drawn from the intrinſick matter of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Depoſitions, were ſufficient to reſtrain my aſſent to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>'s Oathes, how confident ſoever; eſpecially when I conſidered that he was a perſon no ways eminent for probity or honeſty, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications eſſentially requiſite to all who aim at credit by Swearing: but this villanous <hi>Doctor</hi> is notorious for all flagitious crimes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties imaginable. <hi>Sir Dennis Aſhbourn</hi> witneſſed, that he had one property of the Devil, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he was a Liar from the beginning;</hi> he has ſerv'd an apprentiſhip to the trade of Leeſing from his Cradle, and <hi>Haſtings</hi> his ſome time abode in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Bobbing</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> will verify the old ſaying, <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta,</hi> &amp;c. He has been obſerv'd, wherever he has fortun'd to make his reſidence, to ſow diſſention amongſt Neighbours, even where he pretended to be a Miniſter of peace, a perpetual <hi>Make-bate;</hi> upon which account and ſeveral others, <hi>Sir George Moor</hi> turn'd him out of his Family at <hi>Bobbing,:</hi> and how he behav'd himſelf at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> the Records of that place are a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and are ſo generally known, that I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a recital; only I have heard it wiſht by an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant there, for an experiment, that he would beſtow a viſit upon his <hi>Quondam</hi> Pariſhioners, he verily believ'd, he ſaid that all his Ruffian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Mirmidon</hi> would hardly defend him from the reſentments of the good Houſe-wifes there, who remember what a ſcarcity of <hi>Poultry</hi> was in that Town, when he was their Miniſter. Nay, on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, I never heard any Perſon who pretended to know him, who did not deſcribe him by an evil character: But theſe are Peccadilloes, in reſpect of his monſtrous luſts, which would make a Satyre bluſh, upon which account, he is notoriouſly infamous both by Sea and by Land. I have heard thoſe who were aboard with him report, that he has committed ſuch crimes a-ſhip-board, as have oblig'd the Captain, a Gentleman of very fair conditions, to wave all Civility uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63264:22"/>
upon his Quality, and to order him to be drubb'd, and ty'd neck and heels, and afterwards to be ſet a-ſhore. And there are thoſe living now, who will witneſs that <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> were not the firſt or only Perſons that could charge him with a <hi>Sodomitical</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. As for his Religion, no man can tell what Creed he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. The Reader may have heard of a blaſphemous Villain, who pronounc'd St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> a Creed-making Coxcomb: I am morally certain, the <hi>Salamanca Doctor</hi> has not as yet made publick ſatisfaction to the Church of <hi>England</hi> for his ſcandalous apoſtacy, and that he has made no publick abjuration of the errours of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſometimes he profeſs'd; and I am ſure that for a while he aſſociated with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and was even by them diſliked, being ſcandaliz'd with his contemptuous and blaſphemous talk of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, and he is very well known both by his Non-fenſical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue at the <hi>Weavers Feaſt</hi> (upon theſe words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>By whom alſo he made the worlds)</hi> as alſo by his prating in publick company, to be obſtinate in the <hi>Socinian</hi> perſwaſions, though God knows, he is very little capable to underſtand their arguments: nay, I have heard it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported, that this profane Wretch, made it his buſineſs to go about fidler-wiſe, amongſt places of publick reſort, and ridicule preaching, by a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Cant, and as the Fidlers us'd to preſs into companies, and ſay, <hi>Gentlemen, will ye pleaſe to have a Leſſon of Muſick,</hi> this Mountebank us'd to ſay, <hi>Gentlemen, will ye have a Sermon;</hi> and when the reckoning came to be paid, there was uſually twelve pence left for the Fidlers, and ſix pence for the <hi>Doctor.</hi> This they ſay was one way he had of Living, after he was turn'd from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he laid hold of the Plot. And now I appeal to any unprejudic'd Reader, whether credit ought to be given to his Depoſitions; or whether the Life, fortune, or reputation of a man, ought to be of ſo inconſiderable a value, as to depend upon the breath a Miſcreant, deſtitute of Religion and Morality, an utter Stranger both to faith and good manners.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuppoſing the truth of theſe allegations ſhould not appear ſo clearly to prejudic'd minds; yea, ſuppoſe they all ſhould be falſe, yet I am ſo fully perſwaded of his malicious villany, and falſe ſwearing againſt me, that ſhould the whole world oppoſe me, I am reſolv'd to be <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt the whole world: the glory of God, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Truth, and the vindication of my own reputation, oblige me to expoſe this Enemy of mankind and all that is good, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to all the world, that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> is one of the wickedeſt and moſt malicious Villains in it, who ſhews no dread of a God, nor makes conſcience of an Oath. And this I ſhall demonſtrate and offer a clear proof of, to all unbiaſſed underſtanding perſons, who deſire to be ſatisfied of the truth, in the examination of his Depoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: which though this cunning <hi>ſwearing-maſter,</hi> has couch'd with all artifice, that the truth might not be diſcovered, ſwearing things by ſuch circumſtances, which as they admit of no manner of probation but his own Oath, ſo he thought his falſhood would never be detected, by reaſon of the difficulty of bringing arguments to prove Negatives; yet the Devil who is indebted ſhame and confuſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63264:23"/>
to all his Proſelytes, has taken occaſion to pay a little in hand at preſent to his own child <hi>Titus,</hi> by leaving him in ſome places of theſe his Depoſitions, unguarded of that fence he had provided him with in moſt of his other Lies; ſo that now he lies ſhamefully naked, a foreſworn wretch, expoſed plainly to the view of all who do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut their eyes againſt the light of the truth.</p>
            <p>To ſhew the Reader what truth he is to expect from <hi>Oates</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, <hi>he</hi> begins with a notorious untruth, and prefaceth his falſe Oathes with a ſuitable Lye; he ſtiles himſelf, <hi>Titus Oates, Sacra Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiae Profeſſor,</hi> which rendred into true <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, <hi>Titus Oates a damn'd Liar,</hi> for <hi>Titus Oates Doctor in Divinity</hi> is a contradiction to truth. He has impos'd upon the nation, aſſerting upon the word of a Prieſt, that he commenc'd <hi>Doctor</hi> at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> whereas he has made it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable that he never was there; and beſides, by declaring that he never received Clerical Orders from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he has given all underſtanding men a better proof than his Oath, that he could never be a <hi>Doctor,</hi> no perſon being qualified for that degree in that Univerſity, who is not a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt. It is very unlikely that he ſhould obtain the higheſt honour of Academical preferment in a forreign Univerſity, who never deſerv'd the Grace of the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> amongſt his own Countreymen. The <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Salamanca</hi> are much fam'd for their acuteneſs and exact knowledg in Scholaſtick Divinity, which this blockhead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands as much as he does <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Languages, which his Mother never taught him, and therefore he is a ſtranger to. I have heard of <hi>Angelicus Doctor,</hi> and <hi>Seraphicus Doctor,</hi> but I never heard of <hi>Doctor Diabolicus,</hi> until <hi>Titus Oates</hi> and the helliſh <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot appear'd together; a <hi>Damnable Doctor</hi> created at the <hi>Amſterdam-Coffee-houſe,</hi> or <hi>B—l</hi>'s Club in the Devils name, and ſo let him paſs.</p>
            <p>Having by this prefatory addreſs of a palpable Lye, beſpoke the Readers belief to what follows, he begins and ſwears four abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rappers in a breath: he ſwears I beat my Tutor, that I robb'd a ſtudy of Books, and offer'd to ſell the Books to him; that during his knowledg of me, (which, by his own acknowledgment was only for the ſpace of a year) I was maintain'd by ſome Doctors of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and yet during that time, I was not maintain'd by them, for they withdrew the maintenance, by reaſon of my whoring, drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and laſtly he ſwears that I went a Deer-ſtealing. Theſe are four ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous crimes, by which he begins and aſſaults my Reputation; but becauſe he knew the charge lay obnoxious to be diſprov'd, and the falſity thereof might eaſily be made appear by the teſtimony of the whole Colledge: therefore he has recourſe to the uſual ſhelter of his lies, <hi>viz.</hi> I confeſs'd theſe things to him. And now he thinks he has entrench'd himſelf ſecure againſt the moſt powerful attacks of the plaineſt truth. It was to this refuge, that this impudent forger of falſhoods betook himſelf, when at my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>'s Trial, he was charg'd by that noble Perſon with a manifeſt Lye, in aſſerting that he was divorc'd: he brought himſelf off with a retreat to the old ſconce, <hi>I am ſure,</hi> ſays he, <hi>My Lord told me he was divorc'd.</hi> But I hope the Reader will be ſo juſt, as to qualify this ſort of argument,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63264:23"/>
which if admitted without conſideration, is as apt to deſtroy the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as condemn the guilty: the quality both of the Oath and the Swearer ought to be examined, otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the moſt innocent perſon is expos'd to the malice of every confident Villain. Now the <hi>Doctor</hi> has ſworn againſt me crimes committed in <hi>Cajus</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which the Colledge never ſo much as heard me ſuſpected of; and moreover ſome perſons of known integrity and veracity who were well acquainted with me, and during all the time of my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> knew me intimately, have thought themſelves oblig'd to do me juſtice, and have upon Oath in the Court of <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi> declar'd that they had all reaſon to believe me abus'd by mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſlander, ſeeing, if there had been any ground for ſuch aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they muſt of neceſſity have been made acquainted with it, as who were my fellow-Collegiates, and had the opportunity of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe four times as long as <hi>Oates</hi> can pretend to. My Tutor did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declare and offer'd to make Oath, that he never knew me in the leaſt guilty of any ſuch undutiful carriage, as to beat him or any fellow in the Colledge; he moreover did atteſt, and offer'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Teſtimony of the whole Colledge, that I never was charg'd nor ſuſpected of Robbing a ſtudy, and (whereas this impudent falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs did aver to a perſon of Honour, that I robb'd my Tutor's ſtudy) that he himſelf never had his ſtudy robb'd either by me or any other. As for <hi>Oates</hi>'s other charge, that during his knowledge of me, I was maintain'd by ſome Doctors, and that for my whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, and riotous living, they withdrew the maintenance. The whole Colledge can atteſt, that I reſided in the Colledge till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was Batchelour of Arts, and I deſy the <hi>Doctor,</hi> to produce one <hi>Cambridge</hi> Dun who could charge me with the leaſt Debt when I left the Univerſity; and how then I ſhould be addicted to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive vices, (eſpecially, ſeeing the <hi>Doctor</hi> has been pleaſed to allow me but a very ſmall competency to maintain them) is matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. But his laſt charge is the moſt wild and extravagant of all, <hi>viz.</hi> Deer-ſtealing; I ſolemnly profeſs I never ſaw a Deer, during my being a member of <hi>Cajus</hi> Colledge, I never ſaw any Park, neither knew I where there was any, neither did I know or hear of any who were addicted to that ſport in the Univerſity: and for the truth of what I aſſert here, I refer my ſelf to the arbitration of that Society of which I had the honour to be a Member, and to all perſons in the Univerſity acquainted with me or my converſation, who can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be the only competent Judges or Witneſſes in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
            <p>And now how ſhall I ferret him out of his laſt hole, namely his plea, that I confeſſed my ſelf guilty of theſe crimes to him? there is no way of demonſtrating the falſity of this; but however I have as great probabilities thereof to offer, as the matter will allow, and I hope the Reader will not expect more. As <hi>1ſt.</hi> it is highly improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> ſhould contract a greater acquaintance with me in one year, than any of the Colledge could do in four. <hi>2ly.</hi> That I ſhould defame my ſelf, or unboſome my ſelf to him, who was of the meaneſt repute in the Colledge, who was inferior to me both in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63264:24"/>
years and in ſtanding in the Univerſity, and who beſides was as to his quality, only a poor Sizer, the Son of a Weaver; and as to his parts, the moſt ignorant illiterate Dunce, uncapable of improvement, from whoſe converſe there was not the leaſt proſpect of advantage. And then in the third place, notwithſtanding his preciſe memory, which has regiſtred more Letters than ever <hi>Langhorn</hi> writ, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he can remember the particular hand-writings of a thouſand men, only by ſeeing them put Pen to Paper; yea, notwithſtanding he ſwears he is very well acquainted with my character fifteen years ago, (which is more then I am my ſelf) and that we were ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Comerades; that I truſted him with all my ſecrets: yet he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily cannot call to mind who was my Tutor, yea, he cannot tell whether I was his Fellow-Pupil, for Mr. <hi>John Ellis</hi> was his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which is a pretty fair indication that his memory is not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as his Lying: for if it was defective, where he had ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient helps, it affords reaſon to ſuſpect it too bad to remember where he could have but mean and imperfect aſſiſtances.</p>
            <p>I have been thus prolix in vindicating the reputation of my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger years from this Calumniator's aſperſions, not that I arrogate any ſupererogating obſervation of the Statutes of our Colledg (for I am ſufficiently ſenſible of the loſs of theſe opportunities which I might have improv'd to very happy advantages, under the excellent diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of that learned Society, which I ought never to mention, but with all reſentments of Gratitude and Honour) but that I might ſhew unto the world, how conſiſtent with his principles this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn Villain has been in every particular againſt me, charging me only with thoſe things which are falſe, and of which the ſevereſt Cenſor of manners in <hi>Cajus</hi> Colledge muſt pronounce me innocent; and that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> muſt have been a perfect Stranger both to my converſe and humour. The Bloud-thirſty Murderer makes his next attempt to take away my life, he ſwears he ſaw a Letter ſubſcribed by my hand in the year 1670, directed to the Rector of S. <hi>Omers,</hi> wherein I gave him an account, that I had receiv'd <hi>Prieſts Orders,</hi> and had ſung <hi>high Maſs</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Rome;</hi> this Letter he ſwears he ſaw in the year 1677. If the <hi>Valiant Captain</hi> were alive now, to ſecond the <hi>Learned Doctor,</hi> and ſwear that he ſaw <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> regiſter this Letter, there needs no more to hang me. <hi>Good God! how unſearchable are thy judgments, and thy ways past finding out!</hi> who thus permitteſt the blood-thirſty and deceitful man to go on ſtill in his wickedneſs, and to proſper in his Villanies; in reſpect of which, <hi>Cain</hi> the Murderer was innocent, and a Saint! If the Schoolmen and Doctors of <hi>Salamanca</hi> have given a true notion of the <hi>Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> then I do affirm that there is no hopes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for that damn'd Reprobate, a ſham-brother of theirs, Doctor <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> Oates, who ſins wilfully in deſpite of his conſcience, and ſwears and lyes againſt his knowledg, outbraving Hell-fire, and daring the vengeance of God: for I deſire the Reader to take notice, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke this vengeance of the Almighty to ſeize me immediately, if ever I received any Orders from the See or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or if, ever I received any Eccleſiaſtical Ordination, except of Deacon; <hi>An.</hi> 1671,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63264:24"/>
from the hands of Biſhop <hi>Laney</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> and of Prieſt, <hi>An.</hi> 1672, from Biſhop <hi>Henchman</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> according to the rites of the Church of <hi>England</hi> now by Law eſtabliſhed. Moreover, if ever I wrote any ſuch Letter as <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears I did, to the Rector of St. <hi>Omers</hi> or any other perſon, or if ever <hi>Oates</hi> ſaw any ſuch Letter writ by me. And that I may ſatisfy the Reader as far as I can, in the proof of a Negative, I declare my name was never known to be <hi>Elliot</hi> beyond Sea, as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds can atteſt; and beſides to ſhew that that Rogue's wickedneſs is more my concern than the danger of my life, I will put it to the venture, and gage my life againſt his (if the law will permit,) that he knows not my hand-writing from any other which he never ſaw. If I had received Orders from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> I needed not to be Reordained, our Church holding the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ordination to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
            <p>But becauſe his chief aim in his Depoſitions, was to invalidate my Teſtimony, he is not content to have made me a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but he boldly calls God to witneſs that I am a <hi>Renegado</hi> and a <hi>Mahumetan;</hi> ſwearing, I, <hi>that I was carried a Slave into</hi> Barbary: <hi>2ly, that there, as it was generally and credibly reported, I was circumcis'd: 3ly, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd I gave poyſon to my Patron: 4ly, that after that, I returned to</hi> Rome: <hi>5ly, that I made a Recantation there: 6ly, that he ſaw this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation under my own hand, being well acquainted with my character.</hi> In every of which particulars, I do affirm, and engage my ſelf to prove <hi>Titus Oates</hi> to have ſworn falſely, and I challenge all his friends to undertake his defence from the imputation of having ſworn in ſome of theſe inſtances, maliciouſly and contrary to his knowledge, and in ſome others (to put the beſt conſtruction,) raſhly, and in all falſely.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, <hi>Oates</hi> never ſaw me in <hi>Barbary,</hi> therefore he ſwore beyond the ſphere of his knowledge, and howſoever it be materially true, yet it is formally falſe in him, who ſwears at random, and calls God to witneſs his certainty of the truth in a matter which he cannot know whether it be true or falſe; yea, which he has more reaſon to believe to be falſe than true, according to his own Oath, as afterwards it follows in the Depoſitions, that <hi>after I came to</hi> England, <hi>and when I lived in</hi> Kent, <hi>An.</hi> 1673, <hi>I was much given to ſwearing that to be true, which was not ſo:</hi> then thus I argue <hi>ad hominem,</hi> all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that <hi>Oates</hi> had of my having been in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and a Slave there, proceeded from my own information to ſeveral perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to his hands, and therefore ſeeing I was the ſole author of the Narrative of my Captivity, <hi>Oates</hi> had more reaſon to believe it falſe than otherwiſe. And beſides, the account of my eſcape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo Romantick, that a great many perſons who heard it, thought themſelves oblig'd upon good prudential conſiderations to ſuſpend their judgments, and to doubt whether ever I was in <hi>Barbary</hi> or not; ſo that <hi>Oates</hi> by ſwearing poſitively that I was carried a Slave into <hi>Barbary,</hi> has ſworn to the truth of that which he could not be certain of, and which he had much more reaſon to believe to be falſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond particular, <hi>that there (viz.</hi> in <hi>Barbary) it was generally and credibly reported that I was circumcis'd;</hi> this Oath is alſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63264:25"/>
raſh, and therefore falſe, and is liable to be prov'd ſo, by the ſame means as the former, becauſe <hi>Oates</hi> never was at <hi>Salle,</hi> the place of my Captivity, and conſequently could not certainly know what was generally and credibly reported there. Moreover, whereas he ſwears <hi>it was generally and credibly reported,</hi> it ſeems very probable that (if he ſwears true, and does not contradict his conſcience) he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome of thoſe perſons, whom he knows to be credible; but I challenge him, and all mankind to produce one perſon who ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted or reported that I was <hi>circumcis'd</hi> until about three years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, <hi>Titus Oates</hi> brought this Lye and a great many others into the world. Seeing then he cannot produce one of thoſe many witneſſes whoſe credit he much relies upon, its probable he ſwears maliciouſly as well as falſely, but however it is certain he ſwears at leaſt raſhly to a thing which he did not know, and therefore falſely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſwears I confeſs'd I gave Poyſon to my Patron;</hi> this I deny, and <hi>Oates</hi> is forſworn in ſaying ſo, for I could not confeſs to <hi>Oates,</hi> becauſe I never ſaw him ſince I was at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which was before I rtavail'd; And if he only heard ſo from others therefore <hi>Oates</hi> has ſworn raſhly to the truth of a matter which is falſe, and of whoſe truth he had no means of being certain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He ſwears, that after I had been in</hi> Barbary <hi>I return'd to</hi> Rome: this is falſe, and the <hi>Doctor</hi> in this is alſo forſworn, for I have never been in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor within two hundred Leagues of any part of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince I was in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and the truth of this and the moral impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the contrary will be atteſted by perſons of worth and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable credit and veracity: for in the year 1670, <hi>Doctor Zachary Cradock</hi> now Provoſt of <hi>Eaten,</hi> who was then Miniſter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bulteel</hi> a worthy Merchant who then reſided at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with others, do remember me, and ſaw me at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> in the month of <hi>June,</hi> before I embarkt in that Veſſel in which I was taken; and they can atteſt, that I return'd back to <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> after I had made an eſcape. Sir <hi>Martin Weſtcomb</hi> Conſul of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz</hi> is able to atteſt, that in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> 1670, I arriv'd at <hi>Cadis</hi> from <hi>Mamora,</hi> the place whither I eſcapt from <hi>Salle</hi> in a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Barca-longa,</hi> and that I brought a Letter from the Governour of <hi>Mamora</hi> to the <hi>Duke of Vergauas</hi> Governour of <hi>Cadis,</hi> and that after a fortnights ſtay there, he procur'd me paſſage in a <hi>Dutch</hi> man of war for <hi>Lisbon:</hi> from <hi>Lisbon</hi> I return'd home in another <hi>Dutch</hi> man of war, in which I embarkt about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>Texel,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in <hi>November</hi> about the beginning. I refer my ſelf to the teſtimony of <hi>Dr. Marſhal</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> then Miniſter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Dort,</hi> who was pleas'd to aſſiſt my neceſſitous condition, and Sir <hi>John Chichely</hi> then Envoy to the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> who remembers me, and his ſervants with whom Sir <hi>John</hi> was pleas'd to grant me paſſage from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Oſtend;</hi> whence having been ſtopt there a fortnight by bad weather, I return'd home, and landed at <hi>London</hi> about the latter end of <hi>November</hi> 1670. There are ſeveral perſons of Quality and worth who remember me, and upon Oath can atteſt my reſidence ever ſince <hi>November</hi> 1670, ſo that it is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63264:25"/>
impoſſible that ever I ſhould have been at <hi>Rome</hi> ſince I was in <hi>Barbary:</hi> and beſides the buſineſs in which he engages me at <hi>Rome,</hi> which he ſwears in the next place, requires a time for its performance, which it is impoſſible for any conſidering Reader to allow.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>He ſwears I made a Recantation at</hi> Rome; this he ſwears poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and I ſwear he lyes abominably: and this the Intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be eaſily convinc'd of, by this ſhort demonſtration. Every one who renounces the Chriſtian and embraces the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> faith, is immediately <hi>circumcis'd,</hi> that being the eſſential form of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niitation into that Religion, and an infallible character of all its Proſelytes: if therefore I am not <hi>circumcis'd,</hi> then it is impoſſible that I could have been a Profeſſor of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Law, and conſequently, it is as impoſſible that I ſhould have recanted it at <hi>Rome.</hi> But I am not <hi>circumcis'd,</hi> neither as a Proſelyte nor otherwiſe, which this Rogue's unparallell'd impudence and villany has oblig'd me to prove by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration not altogether ſo conſiſtent, I confeſs, with the gravity of my Profeſſion, yet ſuch as I have no great reaſon to be aſham'd of, ſince providence has made it inſtrumental for diſcovery of the truth, and preſervation of my own life, and reſcuing my fame from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a far greater moral turpitude, than any natural I thank God I am guilty of. <hi>Titus Oates</hi> is therefore palpably forſworn, and to the ſhame and confuſion of himſelf and all who dare ſtand up for him, I can demonſtrate it. But further yet, there are collateral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince the Reader of the falſhood of this his Oath; If I recanted my Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion, how came I to eſcape the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is a harder eſcape than from <hi>Salle?</hi> and this the <hi>Doctor</hi> would be ſure of, if he were there. There are none, whether the <hi>Doctor</hi> know it or no, who turn from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion, to the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or as they term it Heretical, who are received into the boſome of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon a bare <hi>Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> they are beſides to endure a purgatory in the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> much more, if they revolt and apoſtatize totally from Chriſtianity, and moſt eſpecially if they were Prieſts, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſwore I was. The <hi>Doctor</hi> therefore by being ſilent as to this particular, how I got clear of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which muſt have been very remarkable, has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one main argument, that I never deſerv'd it, and therefore that I never recanted, and therefore that he is a malicious lying Rogue.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>He ſwears he ſaw this Recantation ſubſcribed with my own hand, and that he is well acquainted with my character;</hi> every ſyllable whereof is falſe, and he maliciouſly contradicts the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſwearing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his conſcience, for he muſt certainly know, that he never ſaw that which never was. And beſides, if I had made ſuch a Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would have been very notorious, and the News of the Prints at that time: and for a further conviction, I deſire the Reader once more to take notice, that hundreds can atteſt that my name was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known to be <hi>Elliot</hi> beyond Sea, and <hi>Oates</hi> is ignorant by what name I went; and how then he ſhould know my hand, or what I was is next to an impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:63264:26"/>
In theſe ſix foregoing particulars, the <hi>Doctor</hi> is manifeſtly forſworn, and has ſhewn only the pregnancy of a wicked <hi>invention,</hi> without any <hi>judgment,</hi> by improving an innocent if not commendable paſſage of my life, to a crime that is Capital, and making me to deſerve im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and Death amongſt Chriſtians, becauſe I made a laudable attempt to eſcape from a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Bondage and Captivity. It is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that amongſt Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> I ſhould meet with a <hi>faith</hi> worſe than <hi>Punick,</hi> and that <hi>Haggi Hamet Lucas</hi> a barbarous <hi>Moor</hi> ſhould outvye a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Salamanca</hi> in Chriſtianity. But bleſſed be my good God, who hath delivered me from the <hi>paw of the Lion and the Bear,</hi> and I truſt will likewiſe deliver me from <hi>this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtine;</hi> he whoſe eminent providence has appear'd, in my deliverance from the Monſters of <hi>Africa,</hi> from the houſe of Bondage and ſlavery to cruel Maſters, will likewiſe vindicate my Innocence from the falſe ſwearing of this Monſter of men, who by wicked blaſphemies defies the Armies of the Living God.</p>
            <p>He proceeds on in his wicked lying and falſe ſweating, as if it were religion with him never to ſpeak truth, ſwearing poſitively that <hi>An</hi> 1673, when I liv'd in <hi>Kent,</hi> I was given to all debaucheries, <hi>viz.</hi> Whoreing, Drinking, and particularly to Swearing that to be true which was not ſo; in which Depoſitions, he is like himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly falſe, for he cannot ſo much as pretend that ever he ſaw me in <hi>Kent,</hi> and conſequently the Reader cannot but be ſatisſied that he ſwears raſhly and falſely. As for the matter of his Depoſitions, which indeed he knows nothing of, I refer my ſelf to a worthy Gentleman, <hi>Collonel Charles Wheeler</hi> and his Family, with whom I liv'd a year and a half, and to <hi>Sir Thomas Scot and his Lady,</hi> with whom and in the Neighbourhood, I liv'd the reſt of the time during my reſidence in <hi>Kent,</hi> whether ever they heard me ſo much as ſuſpected of theſe crimes: I know theſe worthy perſons are ſuch friends to juſtice, as that they will not ſcruple to give his Doctorſhip the Lye. At our Trial, he ſubpena'd ſome people out of <hi>Kent,</hi> who were ſo far from ſeconding this Villain, that they depos'd much to my advantage; and I am certain, that he cannot produce any who can juſtly charge me with theſe vices, or that ever I wrong'd or defrauded any perſon, or by falſe ſwearing invaded any mans right or good name, crimes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this publick Enemy, and who like the Devil, endeavours to have all others eſteem'd at leaſt, if not to be, like himſelf.</p>
            <p>The laſt Subject of his Depoſitions againſt me, is a Narration of what befel me in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in this, as in all the reſt, it's highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he lies and ſwears falſly: he ſwears he ſaw a Letter from the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> which ſaid that I was endited, and fin'd 200 <hi>lb.</hi> for ſaying that <hi>Oates</hi> was a perjur'd Rogue, and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered juſtly dyed Martyrs, and that there was no <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot: for the only words of my enditement were, <hi>Titus Oates</hi> was a Rogue, and the five <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Martyrs, and not one ſyllable more was alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; ſo that conſidering that Reverend Prelate, who was a perſon of great integrity and juſtice, I have much more reaſon to believe that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> would conclude as he begun, a calumniating, lying, forſworn wretch, than that any thing ſhould be alledged, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenches
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63264:26"/>
upon the veracity and clear reputation of that pious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Depoſitions, in examination of which, I have I hope with all plainneſs confuted the calumnies of <hi>Oates</hi>'s Friends, who gave out that the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſwore only that he was inform'd of thoſe things he depos'd againſt me; whereas it is clear to any man,. (except an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> who ſhuts his eyes and will not ſee) that what he has deliver'd under his own hand and oath is in the moſt material parts poſitive, and to his own knowledge; and I hope I have alſo, with perſpicuity enough, expos'd him forſworn in moſt of his Depoſitions, whom in my conſcience I believe and know to be ſo, in all and every particular. And now at the foot of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I cannot but proſeſs my hearty regret, that ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Serpent, and venemous Viper, whoſe mouth is as an open Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and under whoſe lips is the poyſon of Aſps, ſhould be brought forth and foſter'd in this our otherwiſe happy Iſland, who with bloody Oaths, and execrable blaſphemies rends the bowels of his mother, and labours as much as in him lyes her Deſtruction. It is matter of real grief to me, that he ſhould find entertainment in this Nation, who has expos'd it to the ſcorn and deriſion of them who are round about us. The ſtealing away of the <hi>Grand Lowys</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Farce, was but an imperfect repreſentation of the ſilly ſenſeleſs credulity, with which this ſwearing, lying Raſcal has ſtain'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reputation; he has ſixt a blot upon this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not to be waſht off, by all the blood in his veins. He has diſhonoured the Chriſtian Religion, and particularly he has affected the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> with ignominy and ſhame; he has blaſphem'd God and injur'd man, a deteſtable enemy to both.</p>
            <p>The Reader I ſuppoſe conſidering how I have been damnified and exaſperated by the malice of this wicked Fellow, will not think it ſtrange, if I endeavour'd to do my ſelf right, and apply'd my ſelf for ſatisfaction to the Law; which for a while I reſpited, in conſideration that <hi>Oates</hi> at that time was the King's Evidence, and had his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Majeſties Palace, (which under the Roſe has frequently call'd to my mind one of the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which brought forth Frogs even in the King's Chambers, and Lice in all their quarters.) But afterwards, when I perceived that he forſook his Majeſty and became Witneſs for the Traitor <hi>Colledge,</hi> and that afterwards he was turn'd out of that Royal Entertainment, for his ungrateful deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that thence, he betook himſelf to the ſeditious and diſloyal part of the City, aſſociating chiefly with thoſe who are ſuſpected of High Treaſon, and Capital Miſdemeanours, and that he was by them encourag'd for ſome ſwearing job no queſtion, when time ſhould ſerve; I thought it them ſeaſonable to expoſe him, to which my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, a ſtrange accident did ſeem providentially to concur. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the arival of the <hi>Morocco</hi> Ambaſſadour, I had the curioſity with others to go to ſee theſe people, amongſt whom once I had been Captive; the Secretary <hi>Hamet Lucas,</hi> upon the firſt view, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately knew me, and ſeiz'd me, crying out, That <hi>I was his Chriſtian,</hi> and that he had bought me with his Money, and that I had made an

eſcape from him at <hi>Salle;</hi> which unexpected encounter, together with his confirmation of my formerly reputed Romantick Eſcape, and that he was not poiſon'd, nor knock'd in the head by me, as <hi>Oates</hi> by malicious ſwearing inſinuated, ſeem'd an occaſion which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offer'd into my hands to vindicate my own reputation, and to proſecute this falſe Swearer; which I did by arreſting him.</p>

The words were plainly prov'd by the Honourable <hi>Ralph Grey Eſquire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Durham</hi> a Clergy-man, before whom he had ſpoke them; after which, my Council were proceeding to aggravate the charge by proof, that he had not only ſaid theſe words in ſeveral companies, and more eſpecially before his Majeſty, (as <hi>Captain George Collingwood,</hi> was there in Court ready to atteſt, though not call'd upon, that he heard <hi>Titus Oates</hi> depoſe in his Majeſties preſence, <hi>that I was a Jeſuit, and was ſent over from</hi> Ireland, <hi>under the maſque of a Clergy-man of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to be a ſpy:)</hi> as alſo <hi>that he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly ſwore to the truth of thoſe calumnies and ſlandering expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me;</hi> but the Council of the Defendant, conceded that the words were prov'd ſufficiently, begg'd leave to offer ſomething in mitigation of Dammages: <hi>viz.</hi> ſome proof that <hi>Titus,</hi> if he did ſpeak ſuch words as were prov'd, yet he ſpoke them only jocularly, as who had no malicious deſign. No not he, good man was of ſo tender a conſcience, that he would not diſcompoſe the Hair of a mans head, for a thouſand worlds, (as is clear in the caſe of the <hi>Lord Stafford,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> who ſuffer'd; (the pious <hi>Doctor,</hi> God wot, had no malice againſt them, he only had them hang'd up jocularly, or ſo, (for truly hanging is but an ordinary jeſt with him.) And in order hereunto, the firſt who appear'd to qualify the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s words, and honour the cauſe was the <hi>Noble Peer Charles Lord North and Grey.</hi> It was by many lookt upon with admiration, that his Lordſhip would appear in defence of an already baffled cauſe, and for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63264:28"/>
and patronage of a profligate Villain, abandon'd by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and all his Loyal Subjects. But theſe people were it ſeems but ſtrangers to the Great ſoul of this Noble Lord, who maintain'd a reſolution and courage equal always with difficulties which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable, and a wit ſo tranſcendent which nothing could match but his profound wiſdom and diſcretion, and beſides an eloquence ſo powerful as to be able to rend the rocks, and make the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart to ſplit. Theſe people moreover did not conſider what a ſence of gratitude this <hi>perſon of honour</hi> did entertain, who ſeeing how liberal the <hi>Doctor</hi> had been of his Oathes in his Lordſhips behalf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be even with him, and pay him in his own coyn: his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therefore, after having been ſworn in mitigation of dammages, in behalf of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and againſt poor <hi>Me,</hi> addreſſes himſelf to the Lord Chief Juſtice, and the Jury to this effect. <hi>My Lord, I knew this ſame</hi> Elliot <hi>when Chaplain to the Lord</hi> William Grey, <hi>and my Lord, he then told me, that he was</hi> circumcis'd; <hi>I vow to God this is true, I would not tell an untruth for all the world: and my Lord, to ſhew you cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to believe this to be ſo, he was at that time making Diamonds out of calcin'd Flints. My Lord, he told me, he was a Slave at</hi> Mamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, <hi>where the Blackmores inhabit, I have been there my Lord, and know it very well.</hi> (Here his Lordſhip was interrupted by his Council, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Lordſhip with a miſtake, for that <hi>Elliot</hi> was a Slave at <hi>Salle</hi> and not at <hi>Mamora,</hi> that being the Chriſtian Garriſon whither he eſcapt; but His Lordſhip being mov'd a little with their ſawcy interruption proceeds) <hi>I ſay</hi> Elliot <hi>told me he was a Slave at</hi> Mamora, <hi>he might tell you, who underſtood no better, that he was a Slave at</hi> Salle, <hi>but he knew that I had been in that Countrey, and that I know very well a man cannot eſcape from</hi> Salle, <hi>but from</hi> Mamora <hi>he may eaſily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he told me the truth, that he was a Slave at</hi> Mamora, <hi>and to ſhew you that this is true, he told me he knocked his Maſter in the head, and left him for dead, and the reaſon why he did it, was becaaſe his Maſter had a very handſome woman to his wife, and</hi> Elliot <hi>told me, he had a very great mind to have a bout with her; this upon my honour is true, nay, as I hope to be ſav'd, he told me, ſhrugging his ſhoulders. He told me beſides, my Lord, that he was a Slave at</hi> Rome, <hi>no, I beg your pardon, my Lord, I would not tell an untruth not for all the world, I think he was miſtaken there; he told me he taught Mathematicks in the</hi> Scotch <hi>Colledge, and I believe then that he was a Prieſt. He ſwore againſt me, ay, he ſwore againſt me at</hi> Doctors-Commons, <hi>and truly my Lord, I got</hi> Oates <hi>to ſwear againſt him: that good man was loth to appear, I was forc'd my Lord to Whatdeecallum him, what dee call it, piſh, what dee call it, piſh, you you know well enough what they call it</hi> (at length ſome call'd out <hi>ſubpaena,</hi> and then the Lord went on) <hi>ay, ay, I was forct to ſubpaena that modeſt good man to ſwear the truth. Ile tell you my Lord by what good fortune I met the honeſt Doctor, you know my Lord, there is a gallery in</hi> Whitehall, <hi>you have been there my Lord, and ſo have I, and ſeveral I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this Company; it was not the Stone-Gallery, no, no, I know that Gallery well enough, that is below ſtairs, no, no, it was a Gallery above ſtairs, and yet it was not that Gallery over the Stone Gallery, but another Gallery; and yet now I think on't, it was not in the Gallery, (for I would</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:63264:28"/>
               <hi>not tell a Lye, an give me never ſo much) it was in a Chamber at the end of the Gallery, not ſuch a Chamber which your Lordſhip knows very well, but another Chamber; there it was that I met</hi> Oates, <hi>no I beg your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Lord, I would not tell a Lye for the world, I did not meet the Doctor there, but I'le tell you who I met there, I met my Lord Chancellour there; this is the plain truth as I hope to be ſaved; ſays I to him, pray my Lord Chancellour who can you adviſe me to, that is good at catching a Prieſt; ſays my Lord preſently to me again, there is Doctor</hi> Oates <hi>hard by, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not light upon a better; with that I took leave of his Lordſhip, and addreſſed my ſelf to the Doctor, I ask'd him if he knew one</hi> Elliot <hi>a Prieſt, who had been at</hi> Cambridge, <hi>he preſently told me that he knew him to be a</hi> Popiſh <hi>Prieſt, and that he had been circumciſed, and for the truth of this, the King and my Lord Chancellour will be my Witneſs; God damme</hi> (laying his hand on his Breaſt) <hi>this is all truth.</hi> This eloquent ſpeech in <hi>Oates</hi>'s behalf, by the <hi>Lord North and Grey</hi> I have made bold to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader's patience with, leſt the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſhould tax me with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in omitting any thing that was material in his defence, as this florid harangue was the moſt conſiderable. I remember I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time heard this Noble Peer ſay, that the curious Painter in drawing <hi>His Lordſhip</hi>'s Picture, had obſerv'd a <hi>Je ne ſcay quoy</hi> in his face, I am ſure there are a great many <hi>Je ne ſcay quoy's</hi> in his ſpeech, embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which can hardly be better expreſs'd in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than by a word borrowed from <hi>His Lordſhip, Whatdeecallums.</hi> There is one obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I cannot omit, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the heat of his Rhetorick, <hi>His Lordſhip</hi> overſlipt his deſign, which was to prove <hi>Oates</hi> intended no malice againſt me by his detraction, and ſo to mitigate the damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but inſtead thereof, <hi>His Lordſhip</hi> offer'd His Majeſty and my Lord Chancellour for witneſſes, that <hi>Oates</hi> loaded me with calumnies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the King; ſo that with whatſoever reſentment <hi>His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> may be thought to have utter'd theſe pathetick elaborate periods, yet he really was a Witneſs on my ſide, and confirm'd <hi>Mr. Grey</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, deſtroying the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Plea.</p>
            <p>The next who ſeconded the Lord in behalf of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> was one <hi>Iſaack Warren,</hi> the <hi>Lord North</hi>'s chief evidence againſt the <hi>Lady Grey;</hi> he told the Court, that I had confeſs'd to him privately that I was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and that I did not believe any of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine, which I deliver'd in ſome Sermons I preacht before the <hi>Lord William Grey,</hi> his Lord and mine. In anſwer to this (becauſe he proceeds in the method of his Swearing-Maſter <hi>Oates)</hi> I ſay, that I appeal to all that Noble Family, to which I retain'd, who I am ſure will unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly give him the Lye: the <hi>Lord William Grey</hi> is known to have been a perſon ſo averſe to all that favoured Popery, that if he had ſuſpected me guilty of any tendency that way (as this Fellow ought to have diſcovered me, and there is no queſtion, if he had known, he would) <hi>His Lordſhip</hi> would never have afforded me entertainment under his Roof, which I enjoy'd during his Life. The Reader will be aſtoniſht, when he ſhall know, that this impudent fellow came to the <hi>Lady Dowager Grey</hi>'s Houſe, and offer'd to <hi>Mr. Durham</hi> the ſaid Lady's Chaplain, to be a Witneſs in my behalf againſt <hi>Oates,</hi> and did ſuggeſt ſeveral things very diſhonourable to <hi>the Lord North,</hi> which the ſaid Gentleman told him, he was ſure I would reject, as who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63264:29"/>
knew him to be a very raſcal, and to be forſworn in <hi>the Lord North</hi>'s cauſe, and therefore would not prejudice my ſelf by ſuch a notorious falſe witneſs: his Teſtimony is a ſcandal to truth, and as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of acceptance on my ſide, ſo not deſerving any more confutation on <hi>Oates</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The third who appear'd was <hi>Marſhal,</hi> a remarkable man <hi>the Cauſe,</hi> at <hi>Peter</hi>'s Coffee-houſe in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> I remember I ſaw this Blade once at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> by the ſame token, that I ſav'd him from being beaten or worſe, which courteſie he has now requited, by teſtifying that he ſuſpected me to have been then a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt, becauſe he finds my name was not then <hi>Elliot,</hi> which now I own. He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over teſtified that I told him in <hi>England,</hi> that I had cut off my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons head in <hi>Barbary;</hi> which is falſe; for <hi>Mr. Edward Courtney,</hi> who was then in company, when this Story was ſuppos'd to be told, deſires me to acquaint the world in his name, that he heard me then relate the manner of my eſcape, as he had done formerly, and that I then told them that I left my Patron aſleep, and that he purſued me the next morning: ſo that this zealous Buzzard, though he ſpoke nothing to the purpoſe, (as who croſs'd the deſign of the <hi>Doctors</hi> Plea, and who endeavour'd to render that probable which was impoſſible and a Lye, and which the impudent <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf pretended to the grace to deny,) yet to ſhew his good will, he pawns his ſoul, and put his ears to a hard venture to ſerve the <hi>Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next in place, was one <hi>Codoghan,</hi> or ſome ſuch ugly name, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence; this was very ſurprizing, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> who had given them all to the Devil a great while agoe, ſhould now make uſe of ſuch a Witneſs: he would make application to the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon an urgent occaſion. This Fellow ſwore that when I was at <hi>Dublin,</hi> I ſuſtained a bad Reputation; which I grant; and may thank the <hi>Doctor</hi> for it; yet notwithſtanding, I have Certificates of my fair and honeſt deportment in that place, from the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Chriſts-Church,</hi> and thoſe who were concern'd to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my converſation, more to my advantage, than <hi>Oates</hi> or this <hi>Iriſh</hi> fellow, or all their Relations can produce, for theirs.</p>
            <p>After him comes a holy Siſter, a <hi>True-blew-Proteſtant-Hoſiers</hi> wife, one Mrs. <hi>Kedley</hi> forſooth, who lives at the ſign of the <hi>Swan</hi> at the corner of <hi>Fryday-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide;</hi> this zealous woman thinking it hard that the <hi>Doctor</hi> who had ſworn ſo much for the Nations good, ſhould be expos'd to danger for want of an Oath or two, proſtitutes her little modeſty at his ſervice; ſwearing that travailing from <hi>Cheſter</hi> to <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Cheſter-Coach,</hi> ſhe heard me tell a Story of an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from Slavery, and that I ſaid I kill'd my Maſter; She ſwore moreover, that I ſaid I was <hi>circumcis'd;</hi> and withal, ſhe had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to bluſh, though ſhe wanted the grace to repent. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Court of the improbability of this Womans Depoſitions, I produc'd a Gentleman Mr. <hi>Shorter,</hi> who travail'd in Company, with that Woman and me all the way, who teſtified that he heard me tell the Story of my, eſcape during our journey, five or ſix times, and that it appear'd ſo ſtrange to him, that he imprinted it in his memory, and hath ſince told it above a hundred times he believ'd: he ſwore that he never heard me ſay I kill'd my Maſter or Patron,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63264:29"/>
but that I might have kill'd him if I would, and that I ſaid my Patron purſued me the next morning: he moreover declar'd, that he never heard the word <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or any thing relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, mentioned by me, and that it ſeems highly improbable, that I ſhould declare to that woman that I ſhould be <hi>circumciſed,</hi> ſeeing I profeſs'd my ſelf a Clergy man in Orders, when firſt I enter'd the Coach; and that I was girded with a Canonical Girdle, and all the way demean'd my ſelf as a perſon under that character.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to bring up the Rear of this goodly Company, comes Brother <hi>Sam. Oates,</hi> the Son of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Mother; he would fain have disprov'd Mr. <hi>Grey</hi>'s Teſtimony, and at the ſame time <hi>the Lord North</hi>'s; but it was obſerv'd here, as alſo at <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Trial, that this fellow had not been taught his Leſſon well enough. To be ſhort, he is a mere blockhead, and will never make an Evidence worth a farthing, notwithſtanding all the examples and Copies <hi>the Doctor</hi> has ſwore before him.</p>
            <p>I had forgot two Witneſſes more, Clergy-men, whom the <hi>Doctor</hi> had ſubpaena'd out of <hi>Kent,</hi> but ſeeing they teſtified againſt him, and to my advantage, I will not reckon them in the number.</p>
            <p>This is an impartial account of what the <hi>Doctor</hi> alledg'd in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of dammages, which howſoever true it ſhould be, yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it cannot influence the Readers judgment ſo, as not to believe the <hi>Doctor</hi> to be forſworn in his <hi>Depoſitions</hi> againſt me; for though I ſhould be ſo fooliſh and ſilly as to give my ſelf the Lye, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no deſign raiſe an ill report of my ſelf, and ſay that I am a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt or a <hi>Turk,</hi> and that I recanted <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Notwithſtanding it ſhould be true that I thus falſly abus'd my own reputation, and ſlandered my ſelf, yet <hi>Titus Oates</hi> is not a whit leſs guilty of being forſworn, in ſaying he knows theſe falſe things to be true; though he and his Council endeavoured to mitigate his Fine, yet they pretended not a word in alleviation of his crime and guilt in ſwearing falſly, and lying moſt malitiouſly. To conclude, they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely admit what I have plainly prov'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> is a great enemy to the truth, a malitious Calumniator of his Brethren, and a forſworn Villain: and now I proſeſs in all ſincerity, that I do not ſerve any <hi>Popiſh</hi> or ſiniſter ends, in expoſing this Enemy both of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; I aim only at. what every man claims, <hi>the Liberty of the Subject,</hi> my Birthright, a vindication of my Name and credit from the oppreſſive calumnies of a Ruffian, and to ſerve the intereſt of truth, and the glory of that God, who has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbid evil to be done, that good may come of it; or that the Teſtimony of a falſe witneſs, and notoriouſly forſworn wretch ſhould be accepted, though we were ſure thereby to rid the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of its greateſt plagues, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Phanaticks</hi> both together.</p>
