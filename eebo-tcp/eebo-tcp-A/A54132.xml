            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>INTRODUCTION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere is no <hi>LAW</hi> under Heaven, which hath its Riſe from <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> that forbids Men to <hi>Deal Honeſtly and Plainly</hi> with the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages in Matters of higheſt Importance to their Preſent and Future Good; On the Contrary, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates</hi> of both enjoyn every Man that Office to his Neighbour, and from <hi>Charity</hi> among private Perſons, it becomes a <hi>Duty</hi> indiſpenſible to the Publick: Nor do Worthy Minds think ever the leſs kindly of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Humble Monitors; and God, he knows, that oft-times <hi>Princes</hi> are Deceived, and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> Languiſh for Want of them. How far the Poſture of our Affairs will inſtifie this <hi>Addreſs,</hi> I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Judgment, and the Obſervation of every intelligent Reader.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that there are few <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in the World more <hi>Divided within themſelves,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Intereſts</hi> lie more ſeemingly croſs to all Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, then that we live in, which renders the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s Task hard, and giveth him a Difficulty, ſome think inſurmountable.</p>
            <p>Your Endeavours for a <hi>Uniformity</hi> have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; Your <hi>Acts</hi> not a few to Enforce it; but the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> whether you intended it or no, through the Barbarous Practices of thoſe that have had their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, hath been the Spoiling of ſeveral Thouſands
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98326:4"/>
of the <hi>Free Inhabitants</hi> of this Kingdom of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forfeited Rights. <hi>Perſons have been flung into Goals, Gates and Trunks broak open, Goods diſtrained, till a Stool hath not been left to ſit down on; Flocks of Cattel driven, whole Barns full of Corn ſeized, Parents left without their Children, Children without their Parents, both without Subſiſtence:</hi> But that which aggravates the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, is, the <hi>Widdow's Mite</hi> hath not eſcaped their Hands; they have made her <hi>Cow</hi> the Forieit of her <hi>Conſoience,</hi> not leaving her a <hi>Bed</hi> to lie on, nor a <hi>Blanket</hi> to cover her: and which is yet more Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and helps to make up this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> the poor <hi>Helpleſs Orphans Milk</hi> boiling over the Fire, was <hi>flung away, and the Skillet made part of their Prize;</hi> that, had not Nature in Neighbours been ſtronger then Cruelty in ſuch <hi>Informers</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> to open her Bowels for their Relief and Subſiſtence, they muſt have utterly periſht. Nor can theſe in human Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments plead <hi>Conſcience</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> to thoſe Laws that have been made againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> ſince their Actions have abundantly tranſcended the ſevereſt Clauſe in them; for to <hi>ſee the Impriſon'd</hi> has been Suſpicion enough for a <hi>Goal;</hi> and to <hi>viſit the Sick,</hi> to make a <hi>Conventicle: Fining</hi> and <hi>Straining for Preaching and being at a Meeting, where there hath been neither;</hi> and <hi>Fourty</hi> Pound for <hi>Twenty,</hi> at pick and chooſe too, is a Moderate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with ſome of them. Others thinking this a Way too Dull and Troubleſom, alter the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and turn, <hi>Have you met?</hi> which the Act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, to, <hi>Will you Swear?</hi> which it intendeth not: ſo that in ſome Places it hath been ſufficient to a <hi>Primunire,</hi> that men have had Eſtates to looſe; I mean, ſuch men, who <hi>through Tenderneſs refuſe the Oath,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98326:4"/>
but by Principle love the <hi>Allegiance</hi> not leſs then their Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Finding then by Sad Experience, and a long Tract of Time, That the very <hi>Remedies</hi> applyed to cure <hi>Diſſenſion</hi> increaſe it; and that the more Vigorouſly an <hi>Uniformity</hi> is coercively proſecuted, the Wider Breaches grow, the more Inflamed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are, and fixt in their Reſolutions to ſtand by their Principles; which, beſides all other Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies to thoſe that give them Trouble, their very <hi>Sufferings</hi> beget that <hi>Compaſſion</hi> in the Multitude, which rarely miſſe of many Friends, and makes a Preparation for not a few <hi>Proſelytes;</hi> ſo much more Reverend is <hi>Suffering,</hi> then making men to ſuffer <hi>for Religion,</hi> even of thoſe that cannot ſuffer for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if yet they have any Religion to ſuffer for. Hiſtories are full of Examples; The <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Religion made it more Illuſtrious then its Doctrine. Perhaps it will be denyed to <hi>Engliſh Diſſenters,</hi> that they relie upon ſo good a Cauſe, and therefore a Vanity in them to expect that Succeſs. <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> it ſelf, reputed the fouleſt <hi>Hereſie</hi> by the Church, was by no Artifice of its Party ſo diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the ſevere Oppoſition of the <hi>Homouſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conteſts naturally draw Company; and the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are juſtified in their Curioſity, if not Pitty, when they ſee ſo many Wiſer Men buſie themſelves to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a People, by whom they ſee no other ill then that for <hi>Non-conformity</hi> in Matters of Religion they bear Indignities patiently.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort; If all the <hi>Interruptions, Informations, Fines, Impriſonments, Exiles</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> the great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy

<pb facs="tcp:98326:10"/>
the great <hi>Intereſt</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> that the People ſhould have a ſhare in the <hi>making of their own Laws;</hi> where 'tis otherwiſe, they are no <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Free-men,</hi> but <hi>Slaves,</hi> and thoſe their <hi>Enemies</hi> for making them ſo. <hi>Leges nulla alia cauſa nos tenent, quam quod judicio populi recepta ſunt;</hi> The Laws (ſaith <hi>Ulpian)</hi> do therefore obliege the People, becauſe they are allowed of by their Judgment.

It makes Men <hi>diligent,</hi> and encreaſeth <hi>Trade,</hi> which advances the Revenue; for where Men are not <hi>free,</hi> they will never ſeek to improve, becauſe they are not ſure of what they have. 2. It frees the Prince from the <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie</hi> and Hate of his People; and conſequently, the Troubles and Danger that follow; and makes his <hi>Province</hi> eaſie and ſafe. 3. If any Inconveniency attends the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of any Law, the <hi>Prince</hi> is not to be blam'd; 'tis their own Fault that made, at leaſt conſented to it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to the <hi>third Fundamental,</hi> and by plain Evidence prove it to have been a material part of the Government before the <hi>Great Charter</hi> was enacted.</p>

                  <p>Here are the 3 <hi>Fundamentals</hi> comprehended &amp; expreſt, to have been the Rights and Priviledges of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ownerſhp,</hi> conſiſting of Liberty and Property, in that it ſuppoſes <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> to be <hi>Free,</hi> there's <hi>Liberty;</hi> next, that they <hi>have Freeholds;</hi> there's <hi>Property.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. An Influence upon, and a real <hi>Share in the Judicatory Power,</hi> in the Execution and Application of Law.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſubſtantial Part, thrice provided for in thoſe ſixteen Lines of the great Charter by us rehears'd: 1. <hi>That no Amercement ſhall be aſſeſſed, but by the Oath of</hi> good and honeſt Men of the Vicinage. 2. <hi>Nor we ſhall not paſs upon him, nor condemn him, but by</hi> Lawful Judgment of his Peers. 3. <hi>Or by the</hi> Law of the Land, which is <hi>Synonymous,</hi> or a Saying of equal Signification with Lawful Judgment of Peers; for <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> and <hi>Lawful Judgment of Peers,</hi> are the <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> or eſſential Qualities of theſe Chapters of our <hi>great Charter,</hi> being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, <hi>Omni ſoli &amp; ſemper,</hi> to all and every Clauſe thereof alike.

                  <p>Theſe Things being ſo evidently prov'd by long Uſe and ſeveral Laws, to have been the firſt Principles or

Fundamentals to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> free Government; I take leave to propoſe this Queſtion; <hi>May the free People of</hi> England <hi>be juſtly diſſeized of all or any of theſe fundamental Principles, without their Individual Conſent?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. Through the <hi>Brittiſh, Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Times, the People of this Iſland have been reputed and call'd <hi>Free-men</hi> by <hi>Kings, Parliaments, Records</hi> and <hi>Hiſtories;</hi> and as a <hi>Son</hi> ſuppoſes a <hi>Father,</hi> ſo <hi>Free-men</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> This Qualification imports a ſupream Right, ſuch a Right as beyond which there is none on Earth to disfree them, or deprive them of it; therefore an unalterable fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Part of the Government.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It can never be thought, that they intruſted any <hi>Legiſlators</hi> with this Capital Priviledge further then to uſe their beſt Skill to ſecure and maintain it, that is, ſo far as they were a Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government; they never delegated or impower'd any Men, that <hi>de jure</hi> they could deprive them of that Qualification? and <hi>a Facto ad Jus non valet Argumentum,</hi> for the Queſtion is not, <hi>What</hi> May <hi>be done?</hi> but <hi>what</hi> Ought <hi>to be done?</hi> Overſeers and Stewards are impower'd, not to alienate, but preſerve and improve other Mens Inheritances. <hi>No Owners</hi> deliver their Ship and Goods into any Man's Hands to give away, or run upon a Rock; neither do they conſign their Affairs to Agents or Factors without Limitation. All Truſts ſuppoſe ſuch a Fundamental Right in them for whom the Truſts are, as is altogether indiſſolvable by the Truſtees: The <hi>Truſt</hi> is the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> of the People; the Limitation is, that it ſhould not be invaded, but inviolably preſerved according to the Law of the Land.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If <hi>Salus Populi</hi> be <hi>ſuprema lex;</hi> the Safety of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the higheſt Law, as ſay ſeveral of our ancient famous <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Law-Books;</hi> then ſince the aforeſaid <hi>Rights</hi> are as the Sinnews of this free <hi>Body politique,</hi> or that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Cordial without which this free People muſt needs

                  <p n="4">4. The Eſtate goes before the Steward, the Foundation before the Houſe, <hi>People</hi> before their <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> and the Creator before the Creature. The Steward lives by preſerving the Eſtate; the Houſe ſtands by Reaſon of its Foundation; the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> depends upon the <hi>People,</hi> and the Creature ſubſiſts by the Power of its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Every <hi>Repreſentative</hi> in the World, is as the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature of the People;</hi> for the People make them, and to them they owe their Being: Here is no <hi>Tranſeſſentiating</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiating</hi> of Being from People to Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, no more then there is an abſolute transferring of a Title in a <hi>Letter of Atorney;</hi> The very Term <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> is enough to the contrary: Wherefore as the Houſe cannot ſtand without its Foundation, nor the Creature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without its Creator; ſo can there be <hi>No Repreſentative without a People,</hi> nor that People <hi>free,</hi> which all along is intended (as inherent to, and inſeparable from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People) <hi>without</hi> Freedom; nor can there be any <hi>Freedom</hi> without ſomething be Fundamental. In ſhort, I would fain know of any Man, how the Branches can cut up the Root of the Tree that bears them? How any <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> that is not only a meer <hi>Truſt to preſerve Fundamentals,</hi> the Peoples Inheritance; but, that is a <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> that <hi>makes Laws,</hi> by Virtue of this Fundamental Law, <hi>that the People hath a Power in Legiſlation</hi> (the 2d <hi>Principle</hi> prov'd by me) can have Power to <hi>remove</hi> or <hi>deſtroy</hi> that Fundamental? The <hi>Fundamental</hi> makes the People <hi>free,</hi> this <hi>free People</hi> make a <hi>Repreſentative;</hi> Can this <hi>Creature</hi> unqualifie its <hi>Creator?</hi> What Spring ever roſe higher then its Head? The <hi>Repreſentative</hi> is at beſt but a true <hi>Copy,</hi> an <hi>Exemplification;</hi> the <hi>free People</hi> are the <hi>Original,</hi> not cancellable by a <hi>Tranſcript:</hi> And if that <hi>Fundamental</hi> that gives to the People a Power of <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> be not annullable by that <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> becauſe it makes it what it is; much leſs can that <hi>Repreſentative</hi> diſſeize Men of their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> the firſt Great <hi>Fundamental,</hi>

Fact, if it can; if not, however, let Silence cover it.</hi> 'Tis true, there was a Statute obtained in the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> in Defiance of the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> which authoriz'd ſeveral Exactions contrary to the free Cuſtoms of this Realm; particularly in the Caſe of <hi>Juries,</hi> both ſeſſing and puniſhing by Juſtices of Aſſize and of the Peace, without the fining and Preſentment of 12 <hi>Free-men; Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> were the great Actors of thoſe Oppreſſions, but they were <hi>hang'd</hi> for their Pains, and that illegal Statute repealed in the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> c. 6. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is plain; That Fundamentals give Rule to Acts of Parliament, elſe why was the Statute of the <hi>8th Edw.</hi> 4. c. 2. of <hi>Liveries</hi> and <hi>Information</hi> by the Diſcretion of the Judges to ſtand as an Original; and this of the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> repealed as illegal? for, therefore any Thing is unlawful, becauſe it tranſgreſſeth a Law: But what Law can an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> tranſgreſs, but that which is Fundamental? Therefore <hi>Tryal</hi> by <hi>Juries</hi> or Lawful Judgment of <hi>Equals,</hi> is by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> confeſt to be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Part of our Government: And becauſe Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> is generally eſteem'd a great <hi>Oracle of Law,</hi> I ſhall in its proper Place preſent you with his Judgment upon the whole Matter.</p>

                  <p>I know it is uſually objected, That <hi>a great Part of the</hi> Charter <hi>is ſpent on the Behalf of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and other Things now aboliſht; and if one Part of the great Charter may be repeal'd or invalidated, why not the other?</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The Reaſon of the alteration of any Law, ought to be the Diſcommodity of Continuing it; but there can never be ſo much as the leaſt <hi>Inconveniency</hi> in continuing of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property;</hi> therefore there can be no juſt Ground for <hi>infringing,</hi> much leſs <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating</hi> the Law that gives and ſecures them.</p>

It is humbly beſeecht of thoſe <hi>Superiours,</hi> that it would pleaſe them to conſider what <hi>Reflection</hi> ſuch ſeverity juſtly brings upon their Proceedings; and remember, that in their ancient <hi>Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> it was not to define, reſolve and <hi>impoſe Matters</hi> of Religion, and <hi>ſacrifice Civil Priviledges for it;</hi> but, to maintain the <hi>Peoples Properties,</hi> according to the ancient Fundamental <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> and to ſuper-add ſuch <hi>Statutes</hi> only, as were conſiſtent with, and <hi>preſervative of thoſe Fundamental Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this Head; My plain and honeſt Drift has all along been neither more nor leſs then this, to ſhow that <hi>Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is no real Part of the old <hi>Engliſh Government;</hi> and to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle <hi>Property</hi> from <hi>Opinion,</hi> the untoward Knot the <hi>Clergy</hi> for ſeveral Ages have tyed; the which, it is not only the Peoples <hi>Right,</hi> but our Superiours <hi>Intereſt</hi> to undo: for it gauls both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Prince. For, where <hi>Property</hi> is ſubjected to <hi>Opinion,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> interpoſes, and makes ſomething elſe requiſite to enjoy <hi>Property,</hi> then belongs to the Nature of <hi>Property;</hi> and the Reaſon of our <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is not our Right by &amp; Obedience to the <hi>common Law,</hi> but Conformity to <hi>Church-Law;</hi> a thing dangerous to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for 'tis an Alteration of old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tenure, a ſuffering the <hi>Church</hi> to trip up &amp; ſupplant the <hi>State,</hi> &amp; a making People to owe their Protection not to the <hi>Civil,</hi> but <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Authority.: For let the <hi>Church</hi> be my <hi>Friend,</hi> and all is well; make her my <hi>Foc,</hi> and I am made her Prey; Let <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſay what ſhe will for me, my <hi>Horſes, Cows, Sheep, Corn, Goods</hi> go firſt, my <hi>Perſon</hi> to <hi>Goal</hi> next; and here's ſome <hi>Church Trophys</hi> made at the Conqueſt of a peaceable <hi>Diſſenter:</hi> This is that anxious Thing; May our <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> pleaſe to weigh it in the equal Scale of <hi>Doing as they would be done by.</hi> Let thoſe Common <hi>Laws</hi> that fix and preſerve <hi>Property</hi> be the Rule and Standard.

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> However adviſable it may be in the Judgment of ſome wiſe Men, to prevent, even by Force, the ariſing of any <hi>New Opinions,</hi> where a Kingdom is univerſally of another Mind; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if it be odious to the People, and inconſiſtent with the Intereſt of the Government; it cannot be ſo, where a Kingdom is of <hi>many Minds,</hi> unleſs ſome One Party have the Wiſdom, Wealth, Number, Sober Life, Induſtry and Reſolution of its ſide, which I am ſure is not to be found in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that the Wind hath plainly ſhifted its Corner, and conſequently oblieges to another Courſe; I mean, <hi>England</hi>'s Circumſtances are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, and they require <hi>new Expedients</hi> and other ſorts of <hi>Applications.</hi> Phyſicians vary their Medicines according to the Revolution and Commixture of Diſtempers. They that ſeek to tye the Government to obſolete and inadequate Methods (ſuppoſing them once apt, which Cruelty in this Caſe never was) are not Friends to its Intereſt, whatever they may be to their own. If our <hi>Superiours</hi> ſhould make it their Buſineſs ſo to prefer <hi>One Party,</hi> as to depreſs the <hi>reſt,</hi> they inſecure themſelves by making them Friends to be their Enemies, who before were one anothers. To be ſure it createth <hi>Hatred</hi> between the Party advanced, and thoſe depreſt; <hi>Jacob</hi>'s preferring <hi>Joſeph,</hi> put his Brethren upon that Conſpiracy againſt him. I will allow that they may have a more particular Favour for the National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (if they can think ſhe deſerves it) then for any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but not more then for all other Parties in <hi>England:</hi> that would break the <hi>Ballance,</hi> the keeping up of which will be, to make every Party to owe its Tranquillity to their Prudence and Goodneſs, which will never fail of Returns of Love and Loyalty; for ſince we ſee each Intereſt looks jealouſly upon the other, 'tis reaſonable to believe, they had rather the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhould lodge where it is, while univerſally <hi>impartial</hi> in their Judgment, then to truſt it with any one ſort of themſelves. Many inquiſitive Men into humane Affairs, have thought, that the Concord of Diſcords hath not been the infirmeſt Baſis Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can riſe or ſtand upon: It hath been obſerved, that leſs Sedition and Diſturbance attended <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98326:23"/>
conſiſted of many Nations, then the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, that were of one People; It is Marvelous, how the Wiſdom of that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſecured them to his Deſigns: <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith, <q>that his Army for Thirteen Years, that they roaved up and down the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, made up of many Countries, divers Languages, Laws, Cuſtoms, Religions, under all their Succeſſes of War and Peace, <hi>never Mutined:</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Malvetzy</hi> as well as <hi>Livy</hi> aſſcribes it to that Variety, well mannaged by the General. By the like Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>Jovianus</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius Magnus</hi> brought Tranquillity to their Empire, after much Rage and Blood for Religion. In Nature we alſo ſee, all Heat conſumes, all Cold kills; that three Degrees of Cold, to two of Heat, allay the Heat; but introduce the Contrary Quality, and over-cool by a Degree; but two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Cold to two of Heat, make a Poyz in Elements, and a Ballance in Nature. The like in Families: It is not probable, that a Maſter ſhould have his Work ſo well done, at leaſt with that Love and Reſpect, who continually <hi>ſmiles</hi> upon one Servant, and ſeverely <hi>frowns</hi> upon all the reſt; on the contrary, 'tis apt to raiſe Feud amongſt Servants, and turn Duty into Revenge, at leaſt Contempt. <hi>In fine:</hi> It is to make our <hi>Superiours</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion leſs then God made it; and to blind their Eyes, ſtop their Ears and ſhut-up their Breaſts from beholding the Miſeries, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cries and redreſſing the Grievances of a vaſt number of People, under their Charge, vext in this World for their Belief and inoffenſive Practice about the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the Intereſt of Governours to be put upon no Thankleſs Offices, that is, to blow noCoales in their own Country (eſpecially when it is to conſume their People, and it may be, themſelves too) not to be the <hi>Cat's Foot,</hi> not to make Work for themſelves, or fill their own Hands with Trouble, or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with Complaints: It is to forbid them the Uſe of <hi>Clemency,</hi> wherein they ought moſt of all to imitate God Almighty, <hi>whoſe Mercy is above all his Works;</hi> and renders them a ſort of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners</hi> to the People, the moſt remote from the End and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Office. In ſhort; It is the beſt Receipt that their Enemies can give, to make them uneaſie to the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98326:23"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It not only makes them Enemies, but there is no ſuch Excitement to Revenge, as a rap'd Conſcience: He that hath been forc'd to break his Peace, to gratifie the Humor of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt have a great ſhare of Mercy and Self-denyal to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give that Injury, and forbid himſelf the Pleaſure of Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Authors of it: For Revenge, in other Caſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable of all, is here lookt upon by too many to be the next way to their Expiation. To be ſure, whether the Grounds of their Diſſent be rational in themſelves, ſuch Severity is unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable with them; for this is a <hi>Maxim</hi> with Sufferers, Whoever is in the Wrong, <hi>the Perſecutor is never in the Right.</hi> Men, not conſcious to themſelves of Evil, and harſhly treated, not only reſent it unkindly, but are bold to ſhew it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Suppoſe the Prince, by his Severity, conquers any into a Compliance, he can upon no prudent Ground aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of their Fidelity, whom he hath taught to be Treacherous to their own Convictions. Wiſe Men rarely confide in thoſe whom they have debaucht from Truſt, to ſerve themſelves: At beſt it reſembleth but forc'd Marriages, that ſeldom prove happy to the Parties. In ſhort: Force makes Hypocrites; 'tis Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion only that makes Converts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Partiality, of ſacrificing the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of all Diſſenters, to the Promotion of a ſingle Party, as it is the lively Repreſentation of J. Calvin's <hi>Horrendum Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of Predeſtination; ſo the Conſequences of the one belong unto the other, it being but that Ill-natured Principle, <hi>practiſed;</hi> Men are put upon the ſame deſperate Courſes, either to have no Conſcience at all, or to be Hang'd for having a Conſcience not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable; for, let them be Virtuous, let them be Vitious, if they fall not in with <hi>that Mode</hi> of Religion, they muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated to all Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Intents and Purpoſes. Strange! that men muſt either Deny their Faith and Reaſon, or be deſtroyed for acting according to them, be they otherwiſe never ſo Peaceable. What Power is this? But that men are to be protected upon Favour, not Right or Merit; and that no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church-Dreſs ſhould find Acceptance, is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98326:24"/>
ſevere. That Father we juſtly blame, that narrows his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love to ſome one of his Children, though the reſt be not one jot leſs Virtuous then the Favouriter: Such Injuſtice can never flow from a Soul acted by Reaſon; but a Mind go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Fancy, and enſlaved to Paſſions.</p>

                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> conſider <hi>Peace, Plenty</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> the three grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to any Country to <hi>honour</hi> the Prince, and <hi>love</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the beſt Allurements to Forreigners to trade with it, and tranſport themſelves to it, are utterly loſt by ſuch Inteſtine Jars; for inſtead of Peace, Love and good Neighbourhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Animoſity and Conteſt! One Neighbour watcheth another, and makes him an Offender for his Conſcience; this divides them, their Families and Acquaintance: Perhaps with them, the Towns and Villages where they live, moſt commonly the <hi>Sufferer</hi> hath the <hi>Pitty,</hi> and the <hi>Perſecutor</hi> the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Multitude; and when People ſee Cruelty practiſed upon their Inoffenſive Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by a Troubleſom Sort of Men, and thoſe countenanced by a Law, it breedeth Ill <hi>Blood</hi> againſt the Government. Certainly, <hi>haling People to Goals, breaking open their Houſes, ſeizing of their Eſtates,</hi> and that without all Proportion, leaving Wives without their Husbands, and Children without their Fathers, their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Relations, Friends and Neighbours under Amaze and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is almoſt as far from the Peace of a well-govern'd Kingdom, as it is from the Meekneſs of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>

                  <hi>Plenty</hi> will be hereby exchanged for <hi>Poverty,</hi> by the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many <hi>Thouſand</hi> Families within this Realm, who are greatly Inſtrumental for the carrying on of the moſt <hi>Subſtantial Commerce</hi> therein, Men of <hi>Virtue, good Contrivance, great Induſtry,</hi> whoſe Labours not only keep the Pariſhes from the <hi>Trouble &amp; Charge</hi> of maintaining them and theirs, but help to maintain the <hi>Poor,</hi> and are great <hi>Contributors</hi> to the <hi>Kings Revenue</hi> by their Traffick: I his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Severity will make more <hi>Bankrupts</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in 7 Years then have been in it upon all other Accounts in 7 Ages; which <hi>Conſequence,</hi> how far it may conſiſt with the Credit &amp; Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Government, I leave to better Judgments.</p>
               <p>This Sort of great Severity that hath been lately, and ſtill is uſed amongſt us, is like to prove a great Check to that Readineſs, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98326:24"/>
otherwiſe we find in Forreigners to trade with the Inhabitants of this Kingdom; for if Men cannot call any Thing their own under a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Exerciſe of Conſcience from the National Way of Religion, may their Correſpondents prudently ſay, <hi>We will not further concern our ſelves with Men that ſtand upon ſuch tickling Terms; what know we but ſuch Perſons are ruin'd in their Eſtates by Reaſon of their</hi> Non-Conformity, <hi>before ſuch Time as we are reimburſt for Money paid, or Goods delivered: Nay, we know not how ſoon thoſe who are</hi> Conformiſts <hi>may be</hi> Non-Conformiſts, <hi>or what Revolution of Councils may happen, ſince the Fundamental Laws, ſo jealous of the Peoples Property, are ſo little ſet by with ſome of their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; for though we are told of very worthy and excellent Laws for the Security of the Peoples Rights, yet we are alſo told, that they all hang at the Churches Ear; and no</hi> Church-Conformity, <hi>no</hi> Property, <hi>which is, no</hi> Church-Man, <hi>no</hi> Engliſh-Man; <hi>ſo that in Effect the Rights of their Country depend upon the Rights of their Church; and thoſe Churches are ſo numerous, and have taken their Turns ſo often, that a Body knows not how to mannage one's ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely to one's own Affairs in a Correſpondence with any of them: For in King</hi> Henry <hi>the eight's Dayes</hi> Popery <hi>was the only</hi> Orthodox Religion, <hi>and</hi> Luther, Melanchton, Oecolampadius, Calvin, <hi>&amp;c. were great</hi> Hereticks: <hi>In</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth's Time, they were Saints, and</hi> Popery <hi>Idolatry: A few Years after Q</hi> Mary <hi>makes the</hi> Papiſts <hi>Holy Church, and</hi> Proteſtancy <hi>Hereſie: About ſix Years complcats her Time, and Q.</hi> Elizabeth <hi>enters her Reign, in which</hi> Proteſtants <hi>are good</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>and the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the Whore of</hi> Babylon: <hi>In her Reign, and King</hi> James'<hi>s, and</hi> Charles <hi>the firſt's, ſprung the</hi> Puritans, <hi>who divided themſelves into</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians <hi>and</hi> Independents; <hi>the Biſhops exclaimed againſt them for</hi> Schiſmaticks, <hi>and they againſt the Biſhops for</hi> Papiſtical <hi>and</hi> Anti chriſtian: <hi>In the</hi> long Parliament's <hi>Time the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>drives out the</hi> Biſhop; O.

take Place of Severity, and Property the room of Puniſhment of Opinion; for that muſt be the laſting Security, as well as that it is the Fundamental Right of <hi>Engliſh</hi> People.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a further Conſideration, and that is, the rendering juſt and very good Debts deſperate, both at home and abroad, by giving Opportunity to the Debtors of Diſſenters to detain their Dues: Indeed it ſeems a natural Conſequence with all but Men of Mercy and Integrity, <hi>What ſhould we pay them for,</hi> may they ſay, <hi>that are not in a Capacity to demand or receive it; at leaſt to compel us?</hi> Nay, they may plead a ſort of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to their <hi>Creditors,</hi> and ſay, <hi>We had as good keep it; for if we pay it them, they will ſoon looſe it; 'tis better to remain with us, then that they ſhould be pillag'd of it by Informers;</hi> though Beggary and Want ſhould in the mean time overtake the right Owners and their Families. Nor is it unworthy of the moſt deliberate Thoughts of our <hi>Superiours,</hi> that <hi>the Land already ſwarms with Beggars,</hi> and that there is no ſo ready Courſe to encreaſe their Number, as the ſevere Proſecution of Diſſenters; ſo that though they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>Suffer,</hi> the Kingdom in the End muſt be the <hi>Looſer:</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a <hi>Decay of Trade,</hi> &amp;c. this driving away of <hi>Flocks of Sheep,</hi> and <hi>Herds of Cattel,</hi> ſeizing of <hi>Barns full of Corn,</hi> breaking open of <hi>Doors and Chiſts,</hi> taking away the <hi>beſt Goods</hi> thoſe Inſtruments of Cruelty can find, ſometimes <hi>All,</hi> even, to a <hi>Bed,</hi> a <hi>Blanket,</hi> wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apparel,</hi> and the very <hi>Tools of Trade,</hi> by which People honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour to get their Bread, till they leave <hi>Men, Women</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deſtitute of Subſiſtence,</hi> will neceſſitate an extreme Advance of the <hi>Poors Rate</hi> in every Pariſh of <hi>England,</hi> or they muſt be <hi>Starv'd.</hi> Oh that it would pleaſe them that are <hi>in Authority</hi> to put a Stop to this <hi>Inhuman Uſage,</hi> leſt the <hi>Vengeance of the</hi> Juſt God <hi>break forth further againſt this poor Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Safety,</hi> another Requiſite to an happy Government, muſt needs be at an End, where the Courſe oppugn'd is followed: And it is but ſome prudent Forreigners proclaiming Liberty of Conſcience within their Territories, and a Door is opened for a Million of People to paſs out of their Native Soil, which is not ſo extremely improved, that it ſhould not want two or three hundred thouſand Families more then it hath, to advance it, eſpecially at this Time of Day, when our Forreign Iſlands yearly take off ſo many neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98326:26"/>
Inhabitants from us: And as of Contraries there is the ſame Reaſon; ſo let the Government of <hi>England</hi> but give that prudent Invitation to Forreigners, and ſhe maketh her ſelf Miſtreſs of the Arts and Manufactures of <hi>Europe:</hi> Nothing elſe hath hindred <hi>Holland</hi> from truckling under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and being ruin'd above thereſcore Years ago, and given her that Riſe to Wealth and Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> Nor is this Severity only Injurious to the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> but the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> World: For beſides that it calls the Sincerity of their Procedings againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> into Queſtion, it furniſheth them with this ſort of unanſwerable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory: <q>
                     <hi>The</hi> Proteſtants <hi>exclame againſt us for Perſecutors, and are they now the very men themſelves? Was Severity an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Weakneſs in our Religion, and is it become a valid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theirs? Are not our Actions</hi> (once void of all Excuſe with them) <hi>now defended by their own Practice? But if men muſt be reſtrained upon prudential Conſiderations from the Exerciſe of their Conſciences in</hi> England, <hi>why not the ſame in</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Germany, <hi>where matters of State may equally be pleaded?</hi>
                  </q> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whatever Shifts <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may uſe to palliate theſe Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, they are thus far condemnable upon the Foot of <hi>Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> Such Procedure is a great Reflection upon the Juſtice of the Government, in that it enacts Penalties inadequate to the Fault committed, viz. <hi>That I ſhould looſe my Liberty and Property, Natural Endowments, and confirmed Civil Priviledges, for ſome Error in Judgment about Matters of Religion; as if I muſt not be a Man, becauſe I am not ſuch a ſort of religious Man as the Government would have me, but muſt looſe my Claim to all Natural Benefits, though I harmonize with them in Civil Affairs, becauſe I fall not in with the Judgment of the Government in ſome Points of a ſupernatural Import; though no real Part of the ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Perhaps inſtead of going to the Left Hand, I go to the Right: and whereas I am commanded to hear <hi>A. B.</hi> I rather chuſe to hear <hi>C. D.</hi> my Reaſon for it, being the more Religious Influence the latter hath over me, then the former; and that I find by Experience, <hi>I am better affected, and more Religiouſly edified to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98326:27"/>
Good Living.</hi> What <hi>Blemiſh</hi> is this to the Government? What <hi>Inſecurity</hi> to the Civil Magiſtrate? Why-may not this Man Sell, Buy, Plow, pay his Rent, be as good a Subject, and as true an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> as any <hi>Conformiſt</hi> in the Kingdom? Howbeit, <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Goals</hi> are very ill Arguments <hi>to convince ſober Mens Underſtandings, and diſſwade them from the Continuance of ſo harmleſs a Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> But there is yet another Inconveniency that will attend this Sort of Severity, that ſo naturally follows upon our Superiors making <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Doctrine and Worſhip of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> or Inlet to all Property, and Ground of Claim to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Civil Priviledges, to wit, that they make a Rod, for ought they know, to whip their own Poſterity with; ſince it is Impoſſible for them to ſecure their Children to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; and if it happen that any of them are never ſo conſcientiouſly of another Perſwaſion, they are lyable to all the Miſeries that may attend the Execution of thoſe Laws: Such a <hi>King</hi> muſt not be King; ſuch <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> muſt not ſit in Parliament; nay, they muſt not adminiſter any Office, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo inferiour, within the Realm, and they never ſo virtuous and capable; their very <hi>Patrimony</hi> becomes a Prey to a Pack of lewd <hi>Informers,</hi> and their Perſons expoſed to the Abuſe of Men, Poor or Malicious.</p>
               <p>But there are three <hi>Objections</hi> that ſome make againſt what I have urged, not unfit to be conſider'd. The firſt is this: <hi>If the Liberty deſired be granted, what know we but</hi> Diſſenters <hi>may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Meetings to inſinuate againſt the Government, inſlame People into a Diſlike of their Superiours, and thereby prepare them for Miſchief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Objection</hi> may have ſome Force, ſo long as our Superiours continue Severity; becauſe it doth not only ſharpen and excite Diſſenters, but it runs many of them into ſuch Holes and Corners, that if they were diſpoſed to any ſuch <hi>Conſpiracies,</hi> they have the ſecureſt Places and Opportunities to effect their Deſign. But what <hi>Diſſenter</hi> can be ſo deſtitute of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Love to common Safety,</hi> as to expoſe himſelf and Family, by plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98326:27"/>
againſt a Government that is kind to him, and gives him the Liberty he deſires, and could only be ſuppoſed in common ſenſe to plot for. To be ſure, <hi>Liberty</hi> to Worſhip God, according to their ſeveral Profeſſions, will be, as the Peoples <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> ſo the Governments greateſt <hi>Security;</hi> For if men enjoy their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> and their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is the nobleſt part of it, without Moleſtation, what ſhould they object againſt and plot for? Mad Men only burn their own Houſes, kill their own Children, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves. Doth <hi>Kindneſs</hi> or <hi>Cruelty</hi> moſt take with men that are but themſelves? <hi>H. Grotius</hi> with <hi>Campanella,</hi> well obſerv'd, that <hi>a fierce and rugged Hand was very improper for</hi> Northern <hi>Countries.</hi> Engliſh men <hi>are gain'd with Mildneſs,</hi> but <hi>inflamed by Severity:</hi> And many that do not ſuffer, are as apt to compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate them that do. And if it will pleaſe our <hi>Superiours</hi> to make Tryal of ſuch an <hi>Indulgence,</hi> doubtleſs they will find <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> to enſue. The Practice of other <hi>Nations,</hi> and the Trade, Tranquillity, Power and Opulency that have attended it, is a Demonſtration in the Caſe, and ought not to be ſlighted by them that aim at as high and honourable things for their Country: And if we had no other Inſtance then our own <hi>Intervals of Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> they were enough to ſatisfie reaſonable men, how much more <hi>Moderation</hi> contributes to publick Good, then the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People for their Religious Diſſent; ſince the one hath ever produced <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity;</hi> the other, greater <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> and <hi>Diſſenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Objection,</hi> and by far the more weighty, runs thus:</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The King and Parliament are ſworn to maintain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Church of</hi> England, as eſtabliſht, <hi>&amp;c. therefore to tolerate other Opinions, is againſt their Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Were the Conſequence true, as it is extreamly falſe, it were highly unreaſonable to expect Impoſſibilities at their Hands. Kings and Parliaments <hi>can no more make Brick without Straw,</hi> then Captives: They have not ſworn to do things beyond their Ability. Had it been in His and their Time and Choice, when the <hi>Church of England</hi> had been firſt diſturbed with diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Opinions, it might have reflected more colourably a kind of Neglect upon them: But ſince the <hi>Church of England</hi> was no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98326:28"/>
ſooner a <hi>Church,</hi> then ſhe found ſome ſort of <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and that the utmoſt Policy and Severity of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles the 1ſt,</hi> were not ſucceſsful towards an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Uniformity; Why ſhould it reflect upon them, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath not yet rid her ſelf of Diſſenting Parties? Beſides, it is Notorious, that the late Wars gave that Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Differing Perſwaſions to ſpread, that it was utterly impoſſible for them to hinder, much leſs during the ſeveral Years of the King's Exile, at what time the preſent Parliament was no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor the generality of the Members of it ſcarce of any Authority. Let it be conſidered, that 'twas the Study of the Age to make People <hi>Anti-Papiſtical</hi> and <hi>Anti-Epiſcopal,</hi> and that Power and Preferment went on that ſide: Their Circumſtances therefore and their Anceſtors are not the ſame; They find the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Divided into ſeveral Intereſts, and it ſeems a Difficulty inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable to reduce them to any one Perſwaſion; wherefore to render themſelves Maſters of their Affections, they muſt neceſſarily govern themſelves towards them on a <hi>Ballance,</hi> as before expreſt; otherwiſe, they are put upon the greateſt Hazards, and extreameſt Difficulties to themſelves and the Kingdom, and all to perform the Uncharitable Office of ſuppreſſing many Thouſands of Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Inhabitants for the different Exerciſe of their Conſcience to God: This is not to make them reſemble Almighty God, the Goodneſs of whoſe Nature extends it ſelf univerſally, thus to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his Bowels, and confine his Clemency to one ſingle Party of Men: It ought to be remembred, that <hi>Optimus</hi> went before <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> of old, and that Power without Goodneſs is a frightful Sort of a Thing.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> I deny the Conſequence, viz. <hi>That the King is therefore oblieged to perſecute Diſſenters, becauſe he or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath taken an Oath to maintain the Church of</hi> England: For it cannot be ſuppoſed or intended, that by maintaining Her, they are to deſtroy the Reſt of the Inhabitants: Is it impoſſible to protect her <hi>without knocking all the reſt on the Head? Do they allow any to Supplant her Officers, Invade her Livings, Poſſeſs her Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Exerciſe her Authority? What would ſhe have? Is ſhe not Church of</hi> England <hi>ſtill, in the ſame Regency, inveſted with the ſame Power, bearing the ſame Character? What Grandeur or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98326:28"/>
hath ſhe loſt by them? Are they not manifeſtly her Protector? Is ſhe not National Church ſtill? And are not the greateſt Offices, Civil, Military and Maritin conferr'd upon her Sons?</hi> And can any of her Children be ſo inſenſible as either to challenge her <hi>Superiours</hi> with Want of <hi>Integrity,</hi> becauſe they had not performed Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities? or to excite them to that Harſhneſs, which is not only deſtructive of many Thouſands of Inhabitants, but altogether injurious to their own Intereſt, and diſhonourable to a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church? Suppoſe Diſſenters not to be of the viſible Church, are they therefore unfit to live? Did the <hi>Jews</hi> treat Strangers ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely that had ſo much more to ſay then her ſelf? Is not the <hi>King Lord of Waſtes and Commons as well as Incloſures? Suppoſe God hath elected ſome to Salvation, doth it therefore follow he hath repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated all the reſt? And becauſe he was God of the</hi> Jews, <hi>was he not therefore God of the</hi> Gentiles? <hi>or were not the</hi> Gentiles <hi>his People, becauſe the</hi> Jews <hi>were his peculiar People?</hi> To be brief; They have anſwer'd their Obligation, conſented to <hi>ſevere Laws,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their <hi>Execution,</hi> in that they have ſtill preferr'd her above <hi>Every</hi> Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> to render her more Powerful and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, till they have good Reaſon to be tired with the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Conſequences of thoſe Endeavours, and to conclude, that the <hi>Uniformity</hi> thereby intended, is a thing Impracticable.</p>
               <p>And I wonder that theſe men ſhould ſo eaſily forget that great Saying of King CHARLES the 1ſt (whom they pretended ſo often and with ſo much Honour to remember) in his Advice to the preſent King: where he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beware, of Exaſperating any Factions, by the Croſſneſs and Aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome Mens Paſſions, Humours, or Private Opinions, imployed by You, grounded only upon their Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Leſſer Matters, which are but the Skirts and Suburbs of Religion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98326:29"/>
wherein a</hi> Charitable Connivance <hi>and</hi> Chriſtain Toleration <hi>often Diſſipates their Strength, whom Rougher Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Fortifieth, and puts the Deſpiſed and Oppreſſed Party into ſuch Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations as may moſt Enable them to get a Full Revenge upon Thoſe they count their Perſecutors; who are commonly Aſſiſted with that Vulgar Commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which attends all that are ſaid to Suffer under the Common Notion of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we have not only the King's Circumſtances, but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Counſel, who ſaw not the End of one half of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending a Charitable Connivance, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Toleration of Diſſenters.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. But it may be further alledged, <hi>This makes way for</hi> Popery <hi>or</hi> Presbytery <hi>to undermine the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and mount the Chair of Power and Preferment, which is more then a Prudential Indulgence of Different Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet there is not any ſo probable an expedient to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe Fears, and prevent any ſuch Deſign, as keeping all Intereſts upon the Ballance; for ſo the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> makes at leaſt ſix Parties againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at leaſt five againſt <hi>Presbytery;</hi> and how either of them ſhould be able to turn the Scale againſt five or ſix, as free and thriving Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts as either of them can pretend to be, I confeſs I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: But if one only Intereſt muſt be tolerated, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98326:29"/>
implies a Reſolution to ſuppreſs the Reſt, plain it is, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ventures her ſingle Party againſt ſix grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intereſt, and thereby gives <hi>Preshytery</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> by far an eaſier Acceſs to Supremacy, eſpecially the latter, for that it is the Religion of thoſe Parts of <hi>Europ,</hi> which neither want Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Ability to proſper it. So that beſides the Conſiſtency of ſuch an Indulgence with the Nature of a <hi>Chriſtian-</hi>Church, there can be nothing more in Prudence adviſable for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> then to allow of the <hi>Ballance</hi> propounded; in that <hi>firſt,</hi> no Perſon of any real Worth will ever the ſooner decline her; on the contrary, it will give her a greater Reputation in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo hating Severity: and next, it gives her Opportunity to turn the Scale againſt any one Party that may aſpire after her Power and Indowments: And ſhe never need to fear the Agreement of all of them to any ſuch Deſign, <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> not being more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable then <hi>Presbytery</hi> in Power, even to an <hi>Independency</hi> it ſelf; and yet between them lies the narroweſt Difference that is among the Diſſenting Intereſts in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But this ſeems too large, and yielding; and therefore to find a <hi>Medium,</hi> ſomething that may compaſs the happy End of good Correſpondence &amp; Tranquillity, at leaſt ſo to fortifie the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as that ſhe may ſecurely give Law to all other Religious Intereſts, a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> is pitcht upon, and diligently purſued by both <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> at leaſt ſome of each Party.</p>
               <p>But if it becomes wiſe men to Look before they Leap, it will not be unadviſable for them to weigh the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of ſuch an Endeavour: For, in the firſt place, there is no one People I know in <hi>England,</hi> that ſtands at a greater Diſtance from her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as it is maintain'd by her preſent Sons, then the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> particularly about <hi>abſolute Reprobation, the Perſon of Chriſt, Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Juſtification;</hi> and he muſt be a Stranger in the <hi>Religious Conteſts</hi> of our times that knows not this.</p>
               <p>In the next place, None have govern'd themſelves with a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Denial and more peremptory Contempt of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the whole Diſcipline and Worſhip of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have ever done; let them put me to prove it, if they pleaſe, even of their <hi>moſt reverend Fathers.</hi>

                  <hi>3dly,</hi> Who knows not that their reciprocal <hi>Heats</hi> about theſe very things, went a great way towards our late lamentable Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? Now if the ſame <hi>Principles</hi> remain with each Party, and that they are ſo far from repenting of their Tenaciouſneſs, that on the contrary they juſtifie their Oppoſition to one another in theſe matters, how can either Party have <hi>Faith</hi> enough to rely upon each other's Kindneſs, or ſo much as attempt a <hi>Comprehenſion?</hi> What muſt become of the Labours of Bp. <hi>Witgift, R. Hooker,</hi> Bp. <hi>Banckroft,</hi> Bp. <hi>Lawd, &amp;c.</hi> in Rebuke of the <hi>Presbyterian Separation;</hi> and the Names of thoſe leading Diſſenters, as <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, Dode, Bradſhow, Rutterford, Galaſpee, &amp;c.</hi> ſo famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the preſent <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and that for their <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Church?</hi> This conſider'd, what Reaſon can any render, why the <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> ſhould ſo ſingularly Provide for, and Confide in an <hi>Intereſt</hi> that hath already been ſo <hi>Deſtructive</hi> to theirs? On the other hand, With what Prudence may the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> imbrace the others <hi>Offer</hi> that intended it not in Kindneſs to them, and who they muſt needs think, cannot but ow Revenge, and retain deep Grudges for old Stories?</p>
               <p>But <hi>4thly,</hi> The very Reaſon given for a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> is the greateſt that can be urged againſt it; namely, <hi>The Suppreſſion of other diſſenting Perſwaſions.</hi> I will ſuppoſe a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of it, to be an <hi>Eradication of</hi> ALL <hi>Intereſts;</hi> the Thing deſired: But if the two remaining Parties ſhall fall out, as it is not likely that they will long agree, what can the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> have to Ballance himſelf againſt the Ruling Power of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy?</hi> or the <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> to ſecure himſelf againſt the Aſpirings of <hi>Presbytery?</hi> They muſt either all become <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> or <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> elſe they will commix as <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> which made ill <hi>Leggs</hi> for the <hi>Image</hi> in <hi>Daniel;</hi> Nor, is it to be thought, that their <hi>Leggs</hi> ſhould ſtand any better.</p>
               <p>But ſome are ready to ſay, that <hi>Their Difference is very minute.</hi> Grant it; Are they ever the more tolerable for that? Certainly, <hi>Forbearance</hi> ſhould carry ſome Proportion with the Greatneſs of the Difference, by how much it is eaſier to comply in ſmaler mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: He that diſſents <hi>fundamentally,</hi> is more excuſable then thoſe that ſacrifice the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord of a Society</hi> about little <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;</hi> for there cannot be the ſame Inducement to ſuſpect men

of <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> in an <hi>Eſſential</hi> as <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> Non-<hi>Conformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, How far can this Accommodation extend with <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to the <hi>Church of England?</hi> Or, on what better Terms will the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> conform to her Diſcipline and formal Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, then thoſe upon which <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> offer'd to preach the Goſpel at <hi>Rome?</hi> viz. <hi>That if the</hi> Pope <hi>would give him Leave to preach at</hi> Rome, <hi>he would be contented to preach in a</hi> Fool's <hi>Coat.</hi> I queſtion if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> can go ſo far, I am ſure he could not; and as ſure, that <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> hop't by preaching there in a <hi>Fool's Coat,</hi> to inculcate that Doctrine which ſhould <hi>un-Mitre</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and alter his <hi>Church,</hi> the very Thing the <hi>Church of England</hi> ought to fear: For <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> intended to preach in a <hi>Fool's Coat</hi> no longer, but till he had preacht the People <hi>Wiſe</hi> enough to throw it off again. So the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they may conform to certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (once as <hi>ſinful</hi> to them, as a <hi>Fool's Coat</hi> could be <hi>ridiculous</hi> to <hi>Peter du Moulin)</hi> that they may the better <hi>intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their</hi> Alterations <hi>both in Doctrine and Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which ought to go a great Way with our Superiours in their Judgment of this Matter, is not only the Benefit of a <hi>Ballance</hi> againſt the Preſumtion of any one Party, and the Probability, if not Certainty of their never being overdriven by any one Perſwaſion whilſt they have others to more then poiz againſt the growing Power of it; but the Conceit it ſelf, if not altogether impracticable, is at leaſt very difficult to the Promotors, and an Office as thankleſs from the Parties concern'd. This appears in the Endeavours uſed for a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Homouſians</hi> under one <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy,</hi> related not only in our common <hi>Ecclefiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> but more amply in the Writings of <hi>Hilary,</hi> an Enemy to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi>'s <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtory. Theſe publick Teſts, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Creeds were many, <hi>Nice, Ariminum, Sirminium,</hi> &amp;c. in order to agree both Parties, that neither might ſtigmatize the other with the odious Crime of <hi>Hereſie;</hi> but the Conſequence of all this Convocation and prolix Debate was, that neither Party could be ſatisfied, each continuing their former Sentiments, and ſo grew up into ſtronger Fractions, to the Diviſion, Diſtraction, and almoſt Deſtruction of the whole Empire; recover'd a little by the prudent Moderation of <hi>Jovianus,</hi> and much improved, not by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98326:31"/>
a Comprehenſion, but <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of <hi>a Seaſonable Liberty of Conſcience</hi> by <hi>Theodoſius Magnus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo in <hi>Germany</hi> about the Time of the Reformation, nothing ſeemed more ſincere then the Deſign of Union between the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians:</hi> For <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> themſelves by the earneſt Endeavours of the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen;</hi> came together; but the Succeſs was ſo ſmall, notwithſtanding the <hi>Grave</hi>'s Mediation, that they parted ſcarcely Civil; To be ſure, as far from Unity as Controverſie is. <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Cardinal Cajeten</hi> met for a Compoſure of the Breach betwixt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and the <hi>Pope;</hi> but they were too wide for thoſe Conferences to reconcile, no <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> could do the Buſineſs. A ſecond Eſſay to the ſame Purpoſe was by <hi>Melanchton, Caſſander</hi> &amp; others; the Conſequence of it was, that the Parties were diſpleaſed, and the Heads ſuſpected, if not hated of their Followers: Nor had <hi>Bucer</hi>'s Meeting with <hi>Julius Pflugg</hi> any better Succeſs. And how fruitleſs their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances have been, that with greateſt Art and Induſtry have of a long Time endeavoured a Reconciliation of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> is well known to thoſe that are acquainted with the Affairs of <hi>Germany;</hi> and ſuch as are not, may furniſh themſelves from thoſe publick Relations given by thoſe that are employed about that Accommodation; where beſides a dull and heavy Progreſs, the Reader may be a Witneſs of their Complaint, not only that both Parties are too tenacious, but that they ſuffer Detraction for their good Endeavours, each Side grudging every Tittle they yield, and murmuring as if they were too hardly born upon. And if Perſons ſo diſintereſted, and worthy in their Attempts have had no better Iſſue, I cannot ſee how thoſe who ſeem compell'd by Worldly Intereſt more then Conſcience to ſeek and propagate a <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> eſpecially, when it determins in the Perſecution of the rejected Perſwaſions, can with any Reaſon expect from God or Good Men any better Succeſs to their Deſign.</p>

               <p>I am now come to the laſt, which to be ſure, is not the leaſt Part of my Anſwer to the Queſtion propounded, viz. The <hi>Sincere Promotion of general and practical Religion,</hi> by which I mean the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> or moral Law, and <hi>Chriſt's Sermon upon the Mount,</hi> with other Heavenly Sayings, excellently improved, and earneſtly recommended by ſeveral Paſſages in the Writings of his Diſciples, which forbid <hi>Evil,</hi> not only in <hi>Deed,</hi> but <hi>Thought;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn <hi>Purity</hi> &amp; <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as <hi>without which no Man,</hi> be his Pretences what they will, <hi>ſhall ever ſee God.</hi> In ſhort, General, True and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite <hi>Religion</hi> in the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>'s Definition is, <hi>To viſit the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the Fatherleſs, and to keep our ſelves,</hi> through the Univerſal Grace, <hi>unſpotted of the World:</hi> This is, as the moſt <hi>ſacred,</hi> ſo the moſt eaſie &amp; probable <hi>Way</hi> to fetch in all Men profeſſing God &amp; Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that every Perſwaſion acknowledges this in Words, be their Lives never ſo incongruous with their Confeſſion; And this being the <hi>Unum neceſſarium,</hi> that One Thing only requiſite to make Men happy here and hereafter, why ſhould Men ſacrifice their Accord in <hi>this great Point</hi> for an Unity in minute or circumſtantial Things, that perhaps inobtainable, and if it were not, would ſignifie little or nothing, either to the Good of Human Society, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Comfort of any individual in that World which is to come? No one Thing is more ſenſeleſs and condemnable among Men, then their Uncharitable &amp; Mutinous Clamours and Conteſts about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, indeed about Words &amp; Phraſes, whilſt they all verbany meet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98326:32"/>
in the moſt, if not only neceſſary Part of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: For nothing is more certain, then if Men would but live up to one half of what they know in their own Conſciences they ought to practiſe, their Edge would be taken off, their Blood would be ſweetned by Mercy and Truth, and this unnatural Sharpneſs qualified; they would quickly find Work enough at home; each Man's Hands would be full by the Unrulineſs of his own Paſſions, and in Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his own Will; and inſtead of devouring one another's <hi>Good Name, Liberty,</hi> or <hi>Eſtate, Compaſſion</hi> would riſe, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Deſires</hi> to be aſſiſtent to one another in a better Sort of Living. Oh how decent, how delightful would it be, to ſee Mankind (the Creation of one God, that hath upheld them to this Day) of one Accord, at leaſt in the weighty Things of God's <hi>practical Law!</hi> 'Tis Want of <hi>Practice,</hi> and too much <hi>Prate,</hi> that hath made Way for all the <hi>Incharity</hi> and <hi>Ill living</hi> that is in the World. No Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what Men <hi>ſay,</hi> if the Devil keep the Houſe: Let the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> the <hi>Principle of Divine Life</hi> (as a great Man lately call'd it in his Speech) but be heartily and reverently entertained of men, that <hi>teaches to deny Ungodlineſs, and converſe Soberly, Righteouſly and Godlily in this preſent evil World;</hi> and it is not to be doubted but <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> and a very <hi>amicable Correſpondence</hi> will follow. Men are not to be reputed <hi>Good</hi> by their <hi>Opinion;</hi> nor is that, nor ought it to be offenſive to the Government; but Practice is what muſt <hi>ſave</hi> or <hi>damn,</hi> temporally or eternally. Chriſt in his Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Great Day, doth not tell us that it ſhall be <hi>Well</hi> SAID, or <hi>Well</hi> TALKT, but <hi>Well</hi> DONE <hi>good and faithful Servant:</hi> neither is the <hi>Depart from me</hi> YOU, directed to any but the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Iniquiry. Error</hi> now is brought from the Signification of an <hi>Evil Life</hi> to an <hi>unſound Propoſition,</hi> as <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is from <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and well living to an <hi>Unintelligible Way of Wrangling.</hi> And a man is more bitterly harrac'd for an <hi>Erroneous Propoſition,</hi> though the Party holding it thinks not ſo, and the Party charging it denies all Infallible Judgment in this World (ſo that it may as well be true as falſe for all him) then for the <hi>moſt diſſolute Life.</hi> And truly it is <hi>high Time,</hi> that Men ſhould give <hi>better Teſtimony</hi> of their <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> for <hi>Cruelty</hi> hath <hi>no Share</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's Religion,</hi> and <hi>Coertion</hi> upon Conſcience is utterly inconſiſtent with the very Nature of his Kingdom: He rebuked that Zeal, which would

have <hi>Fire</hi> from Heaven to devour <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> though it came from his own Diſciples; and forbad them to <hi>pluck up the Tares,</hi> though none had a more gentle or infallible Hand to do it by: He preferr'd <hi>Mercy</hi> before <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and therefore we may well believe, that the Unmerciful Sacrifices ſome Men now offer, I mean, <hi>Impriſoning Perſons, ſpoiling of Goods, and leaving whole Families deſtitute of common Subſiſtence,</hi> are far from being grateful to him, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came into the World, and preacht that Heavenly Doctrine of <hi>Forbearing,</hi> and <hi>Loving of Enemies,</hi> and laid down his moſt <hi>Innocent</hi> Life for us, whilſt we were Rebels, that by ſuch peaceable Precepts and ſo patient an Example the World might be prevailed upon to leave thoſe Barbarous Courſes: And doubtleſs, very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table will their Condition be, who at the Coming of the great Lord ſhall be found Beaters of their <hi>Fellow Servants.</hi> In vain do Men <hi>go to Church, pray, preach, and ſtyle themſelves Believers, Chriſtians, Children of God, &amp;c.</hi> whilſt ſuch Acts of Severity are practiſed, and any Diſpoſition to <hi>moleſt</hi> harmleſs Neighbours for their Conſcience, ſo much as <hi>countenanc'd.</hi> A Courſe quite re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pugnant to Chriſt's Doctrine and Example</p>
               <p>In ſhort; the <hi>promoting</hi> of this <hi>General Religion</hi> by a ſevere <hi>Reprehenſion and Puniſhment of Vice,</hi> and <hi>Encouragement of Virtue,</hi> is the <hi>Intereſt of our Superiours</hi> ſeveral Wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that it meets with, and takes in all the Religious Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Kingdom; <hi>Penal Laws for Religion is a Church with a Sting in her Tail;</hi> take that out, and there is no Fear of the Peoples Love and Duty: And what better Obligation or Security can the Civil Magiſtrate deſire? Every Man owns the <hi>Text;</hi> 'tis the <hi>Comment</hi> that's diſputed: Let it but pleaſe him to make the <hi>Text</hi> only ſacred and neceſſary, and ſo leave Men to keep Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with their own Meanings and Conſequences, and he not only prudently takes in all, but ſuppreſſeth nice Searches, fixes Unity upon Materials, quiets preſent Differences about Things of leſſer Moment, retrives Humanity and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Clemency, and fills the Kingdom with Love and Reſpect to their Governours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Next,</hi> A Promotion of general Religion, it being in it ſelf practical, brings back again ancient <hi>Virtue:</hi> Good Living will thrive in this Soil; Men will grow Honeſt, Truſty and Temperate; we may expect good Neighbourhood and Cordial Friendſhip; one

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> Benefit is, that Men will be more <hi>induſtrious;</hi> more diligent in their lawful Callings, which will encreaſe our Manufacture, ſet the Idle and Poor to work for their Livelyhood, and enable the ſeveral Countries with more Eaſe and Decency to maintain the Aged and Impotent among them. Nor will this only make the <hi>Lazy conſcientiouſly induſtrious,</hi> but the <hi>Induſtrious</hi> and <hi>Conſcientious Man Chearful</hi> at his Labour, when he is aſſured to keep what he <hi>Works</hi> for, and that the <hi>Sweat of his Brows</hi> ſhall not be made a <hi>Forfeit</hi> for his <hi>Conſcience.</hi>

               <p n="4">4.
