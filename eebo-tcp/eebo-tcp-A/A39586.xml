            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Honourable Sirs;</opener>
            <p>AS the horrid mischiefs (unavoidably) accompanying all Wars (though upon never so just grounds undertaken) are such and so many, and so recently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented throughout this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Kingdom, as no man can without horror think, much less dilate on a Theam so lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Tragical: even so the manifold blessings derived from a firm and honourable Peace, are so obvious to each understanding, as I may not presume to trouble men of so great judgement as you are, with any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereupon. Therefore to proceed briefly to the purpose; Be pleased to understand, That the Kingdom is advertised from all parts, of a free and noble dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> to grant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and safe conditions of Peace unto this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nation: to the acceptance whereof, I dare assure you of their willing and real inclinations; In order whereunto, I do in this, and other the Provinces
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109012:3"/>
behalfs, request your safe Conducts unto each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, with Blanks to Meet, Elect, and Authorize Members of the said respective Provinces, to meet with the Members so to be Elected by other the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, at some convenient place within this Province, and thence to Authorize Commissioners to present Proposals to such as are or shall be thereunto Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude on such Transactions as shall be agreed upon. Your Garrisons, in each Province, being so obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, as the Members may not with safetie come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the afore-said Purpose. Unanimitie in this kind among the Provinces, being much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable to a general quiet, than the particular address of any Province apart. This, I hope and expect, will produce that so much and so passionately desired a Settlement, which ought to be the prayer and wishes of all honest and wel-affected persons. Sir <hi>Richard Barnewall</hi> Baronet, and Colonel <hi>Walter Bagenall</hi> are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and imployed by the Assembly of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to solicit the Contents hereof; to whom I shall request you will be pleased to give full credit in what they shall offer in that particular and other matters, it being the sence of this Province, I should signifie so much unto you; to which subscribes,</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe said Commissioners, having on the eleventh of this instant <hi>March,</hi> received a Letter, or Paper directed unto them, bearing date the 20. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1651. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing on the behalf of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> safe Conducts unto each Province with Blanks; to Meet, Elect, and Authorize Members of each Province, to meet in some conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place, for offering Proposals to such as are or shall be Authorized by the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> for the settlement of this Nation. Which said Paper, or Letter is subscribed by one <hi>Garald Fitz-Gerald,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of an Authoritie, which the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners cannot in Dutie and with Honour to the <hi>Parliament</hi> acknowledge; Yet for the satisfaction of those that may seem to be concerned therein, They do Declare,</p>
            <p n="1">I. First, That the Settlement of this Nation doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109012:4"/>
of right belong to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> onely, the consideration whereof, is at present before them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, That in the Settlement thereof, the <hi>Parliament</hi> will make distinction between such Persons as have lived peaceably according to their duties, or (being misled) have since submitted to their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Protection, and those who have Acted or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted the Murthers and Massacres of the Protestants, and those that adhered to them during the first year of the Rebellion, and likewise such Persons as now being in Arms and Opposition to the said Authoritie, shall not timely submit thereunto. And therefore the said Commissioners cannot in justice give way to any Act, so much to the prejudice of the People of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as may involve those that are peaceably minded, with them who continue in Hostilitie.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, That to grant safe Conduct and Blank Passes unto such as are in actual Hostility against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to meet together from all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to communicate Counsels, is an Act, to which the said Commissioners cannot in prudence consent.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, That for such Persons as now are in actual Hostilitie against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay down Arms, and submit to the Authoritie thereof, upon timely Application made to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Ministers here, on behalf of particular Persons or Places, such moderate terms will be consented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as Men in their condition can in reason expect.</p>

            <p>BY your Lordships of the 14. instant, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose unto me the entertainment of a Treatie, in order to a Settlement of this Kingdom; and do desire my safe Conduct for such Commissioners, as you shall think fit to imploy unto me, for the carrying on of that matter. Whereunto, upon advice with the Commissioners of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers General and Field-Officers of their Armie, I have thought fit to give you this return: That the Settlement of this Nation doth of Right belong to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> to whom we leave the same, being assured they will not therein capitulate with those who ought to be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, yet stand in opposition to their Authoritie: but if the Lord have that mercie in store for any who are at present in Arms against them, as to incline their hearts to a submission to that Government, which he by his Providence hath placed over them, upon timely Application made to their Ministers here, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of particular Persons or Places, such moderate terms will yet be consented unto, as men in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
