            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE chief intention of publishing these discourses is, to suggest to devout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons some few, but copious, heads for their Meditation. To which purpose it is not amiss to premise:</p>
            <p>That in meditating on any action or passion of our Saviour; consider his person doing or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it, not as man, but God and Man. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which will produce affections in you diverse from the other; both full of Benefit. When you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider him as Man; you will more admire and love, in human infirmity, his innocence, and all his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical virtues, and merits; and compassionate his indign sufferings; and, these being for you also, in representing to your self such his human weakness, it will render them far more dearer unto you; and your gratitude much more to him. As he is man, you will have a more familiar confidence in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will toward you: more interest your self in, and indeavour to imitate, what he did and suffered; and more firmly believe, that it shall be done unto you (if being like him) what was done by God to him.</p>
            <p>But again, when you consider him as God; not a
<pb facs="tcp:54224:3"/>
word, not an answer, not a circumstance of any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his, passeth without your admiration, and deep reverence of it; you will be astonisht that such Majesty and power should so low descend for your sake; and be infinitely more ready to fear, to praise, to love, to admire, to sacrifice all you are, and have, unto him: and then grieve, comparing it with his, i. e. Gods love to you, that it is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable: you will discover new wisdom in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very passage of his story: and his sufferings, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, mildness, it will still greaten to you as his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doth. You will not only make your addresses with more caution to him; but also more expect strength and protection from him; and in every thought of him will bend your soul, to fall down, adore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and fear such a divinity. And in this meditation will say; Lord depart from me for I am a sinful man: as in the former; Lord I will follow thee whither soever thou goest.</p>

            <p>But here, much of these Laws by so ill a Register<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in so long time being more and more defaced and worn out, (for <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law</hi> was added because of the overflowing of transgressions against the Law <hi>natural, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>till Christ should come:</hi> The effects of which Law Mosaical among the Jews, the rules of Philosophy (being only the Law of nature revived by the wisest of other nations) in

            <p>But here again, his Laws being neither obeyed so far as understood; nor understood so far as they obliged; after a long space of his tolerating the unbelief and imperfection of the veiled Jew 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 13, 14, 16.</hi> and his <hi>winking at</hi> the ignorance and idolatry of the Gentiles, and his <hi>suffering them to go on in their own ways: Act. 17. 30, 14, 16.</hi> and he having now sufficiently educated his Church in the pedagogism of the Law and of Ceremonies, after about 2000 years more, in the full and due time <hi>Eph. 1. 10. 1 Tim. 2. 6.

This thing being necessarily to be effected in some determinate age, in some particular Nation and Country; unless perchance the unreasonableness of our unbelief will have him for our fuller satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to act over and over again that great work, in all places; and in each of them too at all times; and that we will not in this one thing allow to as firm <hi>relations,</hi> as posterity is capable of, (I mean the <hi>Gospels</hi>) that credit, which wee so easily yield to the Histories of all other famous actions and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the world.</p>
            <p>Which Relations of these four Evangelists, and<note place="margin">§ 3.</note> three of them ocular witnesses, common and used in the beginnings of Christianity, are shewed to be most true. 1.

exactly agreeing with, and fulfilled in, the History of <hi>Jesus</hi> (even as they were interpreted by the learned Jews before the coming of the Messias) in so many punctualities of his life and death; and especially in the time of his coming; which was to be under the second Temple, <hi>Hagg. 2. 7, 9.</hi> But this Temple was destroyed by <hi>Titus;</hi> And when the Scepter was departed first from the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for this King was then to be sent when the others failed;) But this happened first in the time of <hi>Herod,</hi> the first stranger King, after both <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Levi's</hi> rule deposed; and when also the Roman Empire, under whose yoke the Jewes were now faln, was first perfected and at its height in <hi>Augustus;</hi> in whose times our Saviour came. 3. From the plain<note place="margin">3.</note> prophecies contained in these Relations, as <hi>Matt. 24.</hi> &amp;c. concerning the perfecution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian profession; the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and Temple; and dispersion of the Jewes; set down in them long before the event. 4. As likewise from<note place="margin">4.</note> those heavy curses which the world hath seen to fall upon all the enemies of Christ, and the primitive Christians; as, upon the Jewes (the desolation of which Nation beareth witness to this day in all Countries to the truth of the Gospel); upon <hi>Herod</hi> the Great; His son <hi>Archelaus; Herod</hi> the Tetrarch, <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s brother that beheaded <hi>John; Herod A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 12, 23.) that killed <hi>James;</hi> it being observed by <hi>Josephus</hi> (a stranger to this cause) that of <hi>Herods</hi> very numerous race within 70 years none were left, but all extinguished in a most miserable manner; and upon the Roman Emperors, so long as the persecutions endured i. e. till <hi>Constantine's</hi> time, most of whom suffered unhappy ends. 5 From the<note place="margin">5.</note> then, (by the Heathen confessed) cessation of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

And also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempered with much brutish liberty and sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity indulged to the flesh, which much easilier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines mens affections to it. <hi>Nova secta ita tanden se late diffundit, si portam luxuriae &amp; voluptatibus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periat.</hi> And again; 2.

So that though our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our came but in one appointed time, yet all times, that did not see it, notwithstanding want not the greatest reason that can be had from the evidence of History to beleive it. And he that requires more would leave no place for the exercise and merit of Faith: which otherwise would have been as worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as that feeling one of St <hi>Thomas,</hi> which suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a reprehension from our Saviour. But Gods pleasure it is, as well for the trial of our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to heavenly things, as for his greater glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our service of him, and advancement of our future reward, to give grounds of belief sufficient, not coactive and uncontradictable; and to make us walk only by Faith here, not by sight: that our adherence might be so much more esteemed, by how much we had less evidence, tho all may have evidence enough. See <hi>Jo. 20. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 8.</hi> Else, let us also require, that God should also shew his personal presence amongst us; and when he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to our necessities, do it by Angels visible; and alwaies present to us a prospect of the Joyes of Heaven, as the Devil did to our Saviour the glories of this lower world; and then let him blame us if we do not reverence, trust in, and ferve, him.</p>

Thus, on Thursday night in the Garden he went forth, and met those who sought for him <hi>Jo. 18. 4.</hi> and freely told them who He was without their need of a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to disclose him; and, when they were startled and recoiled upon it, a second time he told them it. <hi>Jo. 18. 8.</hi> Brought before the High Priest and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and there examined concerning his Doctrine, he told them, he had ever publickly declared it in their Synagogues, in the Temple, and that they could not want witnesses enow, if any thing were condemnable therein. <hi>Jo. 18. 20.</hi> When asked again more particularly (not to inform their Faith, as he well knew <hi>Luk. 22. 68.</hi> but, as they used formerly, to intrap him for his life,) whether he was the Messias?

Upon this his confession, which they thought sufficient to dispatch him, being brought by them before <hi>Pilat</hi> the Judge to receive his sentence; and there, upon their accusation, asked again; whether he was the King of the Jews? which was a Title equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the Messias, or Christ, but somewhat more odious, they conceived, to a Roman Governor: Here our Lord both freely professed to him, that he was so: <hi>Matt. 27. 11.</hi> and also informed Him, to prevent mistakes, of what nature his kingdome was; <hi>Viz.</hi> that it contained nothing in it prejudicial to any terrence or temporal <hi>Monarchy; as clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,</hi> in that he had no humane forces or Servants to fight for Him that he should not have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hands of the Jews, i. e. the chief Priests, Scribes and Pharisees. <hi>Jo. 18. 36.</hi> Yet asked by him a second time; whether, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54224:17"/>
said, as that the Governor both professed his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and washed his hands, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. 24, 25. and sought all means to release Him, <hi>Jo.</hi> 19. 12. even by exercisiing some cruelties on him himself to have preserved him from greater, <hi>Jo. 19. 1, 4.</hi> and after this when out of the surprisal of a contrary fear, he most unworthily and cowardly pronounced sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon him, or rather yeilded him up to the sentence of the Jews: <hi>Matt. 27. 24.

            <p>Now as the irreversible doom from Gods eternal<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> justice, of sin, without which undergone it could not be blotted out, was death; so it was also to be the death either of the sinner himself; or of as worthy, or a more noble person in his stead, that should take the guilt of the others sin upon him; God out of his infinite wisdom, and mercy to man leaving this outlet of commutation of the person, that so observing his former decrees by the death of his Son, he might save his creature from destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Again not breaking these, had he yet been any way held by death and Satan; since, tho the ransom was paid for sins past, yet their dominion would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained still in us for producing more; How could he deliver us from this dominion, from which he could not save himself? In which terms the Devil once began to insult over him on the Cross: <hi>thou that savest others, &amp;c.</hi> How could he rescue us from death, being himself detained in it; how by his spirit in us destroy sin, if that spirit could not raise him from the punishment of sin; for all our spirit and life is only from and in him.

By earnestly desiring and so chearfully entertaining all sufferings, and that cruel passion, (tho he shewed, how easily he could have avoided it, when at his speaking but one word to them, his apprehenders went backward, and fell to the ground <hi>Jo. 18. 6.</hi> till by his own leave (like <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>) they took and bound him): also that he had the full sense and reluctance of nature towards it, that we have (without which his sufferings had not been so meritorious) in that passionate deprecation of it in the Garden, where he in his own person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto his Disciples the battel of Sense to shew them the victory of the Spirit, calling it his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, his Eucharist.

And when as he had power at any time to have laid down his life; yet by his former avoiding stoning and precipitation preserved he himself for a more open shame and greater torments.

Tho with a velleity (if you will) now, (as when he praied in the Garden for himself, or for his enemies when on the Cross, <hi>Luk. 23. 34.</hi>) he desires or wisheth mercy even for all, even for those who shall never receive any. <hi>Velleity</hi> I say, <hi>qua hoc vellet, si aliud non obsiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> but his intercession with an absolute will (which is alwaies conform to his Fathers, and so alwaies fulfilled by his Father) is not general and for all; (so we might think it frustrated) but for those that are, or will be rightly disposed, and are, or are to be, of his Church; (even as the High Priest carried in before the Lord only the names of the twelve Tribes.) <hi>I pray for them,</hi> saith he, <hi>I pray not for the world, Jo. 17. 9.</hi> not for those, who have the devil for their Father, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 8. not for the man of sin, and those persecutors of his Church; Against whom we may imagine he now deprecates his Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So our praiers are called <hi>Incense,</hi> and the <hi>morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice. Rev. 5. 8. Ps. 141. 2.</hi> Our praise the <hi>calves of our lips.</hi> See <hi>Heb. 13. 15.</hi> comp. with <hi>Hos. 14. 2.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54224:69"/>
former; so both those mortifications and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the flesh by our selves, whether for the wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, or for the prevention of sin, and killing of our brutish lusts now instead of slaying of beasts, or our patient and contented undergoing those sent from God for sin, are no mean sacrifices: see <hi>Ps. 51. 16, 17. Thou delights not, &amp;c. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, &amp;c.</hi> And those sufferings in the flesh from others, (for righteousness sake, or for the glory of God, or for the benefit of our Brethren,) when we instead of the blood of Beasts, offer up our own to God; and undergo Martyrdom for his sake, this is the highest sacrifice of all, and so St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls his. <hi>2 Tim. 4. 6. Phil. 2. 17. 2 Cor. 12. 15.</hi> And these sufferings also our Savior presents to God, as he doth those of his own body; for we also are his body, and as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers up himself, so us, to the Father. <hi>Tota congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio societasque sanctorum, universale sacrificium offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur deo per sacerdotem magnum.</hi> Aug.

Phil. 1. 23.</hi> And then this love to the Deity of the Temple, will naturally produce the service of it; <hi>In his Temple doth every man speak of his glory, Ps. 29. 9.</hi> eternal singing of praise, and giving of glory unto him; even like those inflamed <hi>Cherubims, that rest not night nor day</hi> nor no more do the Saints, <hi>Rev. 7. 15.</hi> crying one to another alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately <hi>Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus.

            <p>To conclude: the last act of our Savior, as High<note place="margin">§. 19 <hi>This High Priests (at the last day) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the people.</hi>

Lev. 9. 22.</hi> So, unto them that look for him, shall Christ, who was once offered to bear the sins of many, appear a second time here without sin, (i. e. bringing us full remission hereof) unto our final salvation. <hi>Heb. 9. 28.</hi> For tho before it was noted, how he (staying there) blessed us from the Sanctuary; yet 'tis not a compleat blessing, till his return; when coming forth with his face shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like <hi>Moses,</hi> from the glory of him before whom he stands, he shall also glorifie us (not only in soul, but in body) like himself: and take and carry us in with him into the Sanctuary to see his glory and his Fathers glory, <hi>Jo. 17. 24.</hi> and to be for ever with them. <hi>1 Thess. 4. 7.</hi> Which coming forth, and glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the great God and our Savior therefore all the Saints (as the Israelites did of old) are said by the Apostle to love, to look for, and patiently to wait for. <hi>1 Cor. 1. 7. 2 Tim. 4. 8. 2 Thess. 3. 5.

(Not that all things forced by his overuling power, do not still yield subjection unto God (<hi>for who hath resisted his will?)</hi> but that he chose rather to found his kingdom over Creatures of reason in another way; i. e. in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, free, and chosen submission unto him; which might be to them an obedience of more reward; and to their Soveraign of greater honor: (but they straight abused it to his great dishonor and their own shame;) to repair therefore this kingdom of his Father again, in the way God first established it, i. e. in mans free submission to, and elected ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of, God.</p>

For these and many more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons foreseen by this the wisdom of the Father, He emptied Himself of all his eternal glories; forgat his Creation of all things; laid aside his Crown, his right to any thing, so rich, and having all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor and having nothing.

should rebestow all these upon him as a reward to a Creature, of yielding obedience to his Commands, and exercising all sinless patience in all temptations; according to those promises of a kingdom upon the like patience and obedience made to man.</p>

should we think that the law given at <hi>Sinai</hi> did not well accord with the Gospel, that was then also preached? <hi>Heb. 4. 2.</hi> Nay, that more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Gods will, the giving of the law to <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. whilst other nations walking in darkness were not so dealt with, <hi>Ps. 147. 19.</hi> is quoted as a great priviledg and favour to that people by the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 3. 2. -2. 18. -9. 4.</hi> (where the Apostle reckons among benefits not only the promises, and one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but <hi>the Covenants</hi> and <hi>the giving of the law</hi>) and rejoyced in, as such every where by the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>Ps. 119. -147. 20.</hi> which rendred them (I mean the sons of faith not of works) much more holy and less sinners, then generally the Gentiles were: see <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. being a <hi>lantern to the feet</hi> of the children of the spirit; as a letter of condemnation to those of the flesh: and in that it is said <hi>to bring nothing to perfection, Heb. 7. 19.</hi> being intimated to have the power to advance men some steps toward it. For tho the law was not the Gospel; nor the ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the letter the same with that of the spirit; nor that of <hi>Moses</hi> with that of Christ; yet one was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient and a precognitum unto the other. And it was first in order to receive the precept, to tell us what is to be performed; and then the spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to perform it, (tho without the spirit also we never perfectly know it.) Therefore the first law-giving was to <hi>Adam</hi> as soon as created; and to it answered especially the divulging of the Gospel to <hi>Abraham:</hi> again the law was set forth again, and as it were reprinted by <hi>Moses</hi> at <hi>Sinai;</hi> and to it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the manifestation and last edition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel by Christ coming in the flesh. Yet tho thus the law is before the Gospel in order of nature, yet not in time: for even <hi>Adam</hi> himself as he had an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54224:108"/>
command to observe, (which was the letter of the law) so had he the spirit to enable him for it; and that the same spirit which is to us restored by the Gospel.</p>

These two ministrations therefore of the law and of the spirit are opposed, for their effect: one taken single, by itself without

the other, serving only for conviction and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation, &amp;c. and for the persons by whom they came; one by <hi>Moses,</hi> the other by Christ; but not for the time, or for the time also; but not as if in time (I mean since <hi>Adams</hi> fall) the one preceded the other for their absolute being, but only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the clearer manifestation first of the one, then of the other; at several times.

As we find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law from the beginning, a double genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one sons of God; and the other of men: one righteous and the other wicked; and in Abrahams time <hi>one born of the bond-woman, another of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman;</hi> now those born of the free-woman are only such as are made free by Christ, see <hi>Gal. 4. 31. -5. 1. one born after the flesh; the other after the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or by promise.</hi> (Now the spirit is the promise of the Gospel, as well as the Messias, and comes only by the Messias) one <hi>ex operibus,</hi> the other <hi>ex vocan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, Rom. 9. 11.</hi> which two generations, (from the beginning) were also shewed in the opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the elder</hi> and <hi>the younger;</hi> (as in <hi>Cain</hi> whose race was gigantick in comparision of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Gen. 6. 4.</hi> and Abel, or Seth: Ismael, Isaac: Esau, Jacob: Ham and Shem, &amp;c.

And both St. Paul and St. James, treating about the point of justification, take their examples out of the old Testament; instancing, how it was in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham amongst the Hebrews, and Rahab amongst the Gentiles. See <hi>Rom. 4. 1. &amp;c.

qui suscepere donatum.</hi> The other Serm. 1. in die Pentecost. <hi>Cum in die Pentecostes discipulos Domini spiritus sanctus implevit, non fuit inchoatio muneris, sed adjectio largitatis. Quoniam &amp; Patriarchae &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetae &amp; Sacerdotes, omnesque Sancti, qui prioribus fuere temporibus, ejusdem sunt spiritus sancti sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione vegetati; &amp; sine hac gratia nulla unquam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituta sacramenta, nulla sunt celebrata mysteria, ut eadem semper fuerit virtus charismatum, quamvis non eadem fuerit mensura donorum.</hi> Indeed the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old Testament considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as separate from, or opposite to, the merit of Christ and the grace of the Gospel, were of no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for expiating sin, or conferring grace. We find the Sacrifices also instituted in Levit. for lesser sins: those of ignorance; those offending against some legal rites, and ceremonies; those damaging our neighbor in some smaller matters, joyned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; but not for expiation of the great ones, murder, idolatry, blasphemy, or adultery; and for these lesser sins we may not imagine them expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the guilt, or sin in it self (save as they foresigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the merits of the Sacrifice on the Cross, and thus strengthned the faith of the offerer in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to come: for which faith obeying Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in offering to him these Types thereof, the merits of the Sacrifice of the Cross was applied to him for remission of his sin, great, or little) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the legal immundicities, or some temporal penalties due thereto; which sacrifices therefore were of themselves <hi>quotidiana peccatorum accusatio,</hi> but not <hi>solutio,</hi> as St. Chrysostom in Heb. Hom. 17. Therefore also where we find discourse in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of remission of sin, as in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 18. chap. the legal Sacrifices are not proposed as any remedy
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54224:111"/>
thereof; and many times spoken of in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament as unprofitable thereunto. And what is said here of the common, and ordinary Sacrifices, is to be said for those more solemn ones, offered once a year, on the great day of expiation, which are extensible only to the same ends, and purposes, as the ordinary Sacrifices were. Again, these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices also for the expiation of the exteriour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundicity, and punishment of the lesser sins (for which they were ordained) in this came short of that all-sufficient Sacrifice of our Lord: that they neither procured such indulgence from God for any future sin of the same kind, but so many sins as were committed, so many several Sacrifices were to be slain, and offered: nor procured from him any grace, or special assistance of his Spirit for the prevention of such future sins. But left those for whom they were offered as liable to the same sins, as they were before, whereas our Lords one oblation made satisfaction for all future sins as well as past; and also procured from God the plentiful effusion of the Holy Spirit, and Grace for preventing of a relapse into sin for the future. This then was the great weakness, and unprofitableness of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Sacrifices of the Law. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle calls them but <hi>beggarly elements, Gal.</hi> 4. 9. and in the 9. and 10. chapter to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>denies they could take away sin,</hi> &amp;c. and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places speaks against the unprofitableness of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, &amp;c. (as also many things are said in the old Testament in disparagement of the sacrifices under the law.) But as Estius 4. Sent. 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. 28 s. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks well notes. <hi>Quae ab Apostolo</hi> (and so I may say of those things said by the Prophets) <hi>contra Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos proprie dicta sunt, qui Christum solum justificato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem

            <p>And the same thing may be said of John Baptists<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> baptism, which, tho certainly as relating to the blood of Christ we cannot imagine that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, in its effects to the former Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred before or under the law to those who died not having the opportunity of receiving our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours after it; yet first considered in it self, and as the Jews looked upon it as an external washing only coming from John it was, as he told them, only a Baptism <hi>of water, not of the spirit.</hi> He administring no more then the external sign only; but Christ, that came after him, the inward Grace, for that measure thereof, that was in Johns Baptism, as in other old-Testament-Sacraments, received.

To those <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 33. see the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; and our Saviours reason for not swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 37. Which reason [<hi>of its coming of evil</hi>] argues that it was never lawful; and (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) alwaies forbidden; either by the positive, or the natural, divine law.

And see this in St. Paul not unfrequent. To that <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 38. see <hi>Prov. 20. 22. -24. 29. Lev. 19. 18. Tooth for tooth</hi> (for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique revenge) is still lawful; but private never was. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 24. And see <hi>Lam. 3. 30.

Now concerning these precepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove quoted we may not think that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or unpractised till the time wherein we find them registred.

            <p n="3">3. The same way of salvation anciently, (as now)<note place="margin">§. 21. <hi>The same sufferings; and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and undergone.</hi>

Self-denial, taking up the Cross, mortification, affliction, as they are the portion of the godly under the new, so were they under the old Testament: and the same promises of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deliverance, temporal happiness and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54224:115"/>
that were to the righteous under the old, are also to the Saints under the new. And as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of the wicked is observed to be prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous since our Saviours coming, but endless destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct on after it; so it was before. And they are Gods constant waies, from the beginning never chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; first affliction, then deliverance; first evil, then good to the godly: first prosperity, then ruin; first good, then evil, to the impious. But who so will uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally discern these paths of God by his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, must first perfectly see the goodness and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the heart (where their chief seat is) to distinguish between the good and the bad; and then must see the joyes and afflictions of the heart (where their chief seat is) to distinguish between the truly temporally happy, and the miserable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these he must see to what place the soul goes when it leaves the body; and to what place also the body goes when it leaves the grave: for t e rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>Matt. 16. 26.

Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally we learn from those ancienter Saints, sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,<note place="margin">Consider the old Testament mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> dust, and ashes, fasting, lying on the ground, &amp;c. (see Davids humiliations, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 16.) so far as some that will hold only on the liberty of the new, reject these as humiliations proper only to the old Testament. The austerities of the Prophets were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great: the self-denial of Abraham and Moses, &amp;c. not to be parall'd. 2. That temporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54224:116"/>
were the portion of piety under the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that this book taught men so; see the witness that the new bears to it, chusing rather to recite it as an old, then teach it, as a new credend. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>5.</hi> quoting <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36. quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 24. <hi>Jam. 5.</hi> 11. chusing an example of<note place="margin">Temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the godly.</note> sufferings out of Job. And now for the history of old times. Consider how that old-Testament-Piety began in Abel; and how it ended in those men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>35.</hi> &amp;c. How the <hi>children of promise</hi> were at first the servants of their Brethren, as at last their Masters.

Consider the afflictions of Moses (yet those chosen by him) of David; and those not less after, then before, his coronation. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 12. see the sad complaint of <hi>Psal. 44.</hi> notwithstanding vers. 17. lastly, consider the design of holy Jobs histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry divulged most early to lesson all posterity, not to adjudge prosperity only to the godly, nor affliction to the wicked. But it was so with single<note place="margin">Of nations godly.</note> persons, but not so with nations; because they had promises of temporal happiness then upon holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, first: and have they not so still? Doth not God still temporally bless both persons and nations that fear and serve him? the preachers tell them so. And for righteous men are there none now that may say with David, <hi>Psal. 16. 6?</hi> But if temporal prosperity be the promise of the law, and affliction the lot of the Gospel; then, as then we argue Israel Gods people, when prosperous, we must argue them so still: because now most distressed. Nay further, them then not to be Gods people, because no nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

seems to have suffered more then the Israelites, (not to a final extirpation of them, for whom mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is in the last place reserved, but for all manner of tyranny and oppression over them) if we do but together with their short felicities in Joshua's, and Davids, and Solomon's time, &amp;c. consider their condition in Egypt, after in the wilderness; in the time of the Judges; under the invasions of the kings of Syria, Babylon, Egypt, Antiochus, Romans. For as the temporal prosperity of those, who are Gods people, depends only on the continuance of their holmess (God judging here those more, whom he will not judge hereafter; and visiting the sins of his servants almost alwaies with temporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tho he deals not so with others, because re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for future and greater punishments) so they never continuing long without offending God, it comes to pass that they never long abide tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happy. And we see the very life of holy men not unoften ending in the temporal punishment of some sin, as good Josiah's and Moses's, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30. comp. with 32. Only the certain comfort to these whether men or nations, is; that Gods judgments alwaies end to them in mercies; mercies everlasting.

               </gap>ies to him in this world? And when I consider the temporal condition of the greatest sufferers; (tho 'tis true 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 19.</hi> to the eye of men, and the little enjoyment of any good things of this life, <hi>they are of all men most miserable</hi>) yet in such condition, for the present, also they seem of men the most happy (only if you suppose their hopes to be true): for I find them, tho not freed from adversities; yet alwaies sure of protection in, and deliverance from, them. See S. Pauls words 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17, 18. agreeing with the doctrine of <hi>Ps.</hi> 37. and <hi>Ps.</hi> 34. 19. So that his bonds assured with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54224:117"/>
such mercies made others bold, and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 12. &amp;c. and their joyes solid and true and not counterfeit, and far exceeding, and making them even senseless of their sorrows: see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and when I look on their life ending in a violent, painful, and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death, yet when I consider the wages for it; it seems that it ought not to be called an affliction, but an extraordinary service; undertaken for to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a greater reward eternal, then others shall have who take not the same pains. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35, 26. But concerning temporal prosperity of Saints two things we must note. 1. That it is not for the most part so constant as the wicked's is (see the reason before) because all men sinning; the just God punisheth in this world those of his servants, &amp;c. (the reason of this because he punisheth them not hereafter:) but (according to the qualification inserted <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 30.) interlined with afflictions; and consists more in protection in and deliverance from, then vacancy of, all crosses (yet which things make it to them infinitely more pleasant; as war and conquest is, then a constant peace: and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a feast then constant satiety): and that it is a happiness as succeeding evils; so succeeded by them, like the condition described, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. but good and peace alwaies the last. <hi>Ps.</hi> 37. 37. 2. That when it is, it is more secret, and within, and less discerned; whereas that of the wicked is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and specious, and obvious to the eye. So that the world sees much more of the one and much less of the other then indeed there is. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point from the premises I think we may safely pronounce. 1.

First these seem to follow necessarily<note place="margin">Eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the wicked.</note> upon concession of the other; sins being our own, more then righteousness is; and therefore if this in us obtains a reward, the other will punishment. Again this punishment is not a temporally miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, (as appears before); oftner undergon by the good then the bad; nor can it be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death; because there is no more undergon by the profanest, then the holiest; and is so far from deterring the unbelievers of future torments, from sin; as 'tis made an argument for it. [<hi>Let us eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to morrow we dy, Esai.</hi> 22. 13. 1 <hi>Cor. 15.</hi> 32.] I may go further, Neither could the loss of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to come tho greater, yet unknown and a far off, sufficiently sway most men to loose and forego a pleasure present and acquainted; (the worth of the one being counterpoised by the nearness of the other.) Yet more; Neither could the danger of incurring of some future pains make men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the pursuit of some present delights; if all their joy must be bought with some sorrow; It seeming to them no wisdom to be in pain to avoid it. Tis therefore the wisdom, and also mercy of the Lawgiver, to appoint a penalty so high, as may abundantly serve to deter men from the fault: and this can be only future pains; not only great, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The severity of which, by how much it seems to us super-proportioned to sin, so much more
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54224:120"/>
is it necessary and justified; since neither the fear thereof can yet keep the most men from sin, and many also for fear of these escape sin here; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to heaven, who upon a less penalty would have entertained the enticements of vice; and lost the promised reward, and voluntarily as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for present delight a future misery, had it not been so unmeasurably great. 2. Tis plain, that the wicked of the old world suffer eternal torments, see <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 22, 24. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 10. comp. with <hi>5, 6.</hi> and with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Jude</hi> 7. where the unclean false teachers are threatned with the same destruction to come, as the divels, the old world, or the Giants, Sodom, Cain, Core, &amp;c: And hence it follows that either from the evidence of Conscience, or of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or of Scripture, these were sufficiently made known unto them. For tho Gods bounty may be greater then his engagement, yet not his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then his threats; least he should seem to hide the hook of our misery, only to make us swallow the bait of sin. But thirdly, <hi>Did not Israel know,</hi> &amp;c.
