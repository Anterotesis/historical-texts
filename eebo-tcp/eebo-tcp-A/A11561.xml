            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

without all doubt immortall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will ouerrunne and lay waste your most stately and goodly buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

And shall the mighty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible Lyon of the tribe of Iuda, roare ouer his chosen children and subiects, and shall not this same vile dust and ashes of ours fal in peeces with a sorrowfull contrition? God
<pb facs="tcp:6079:4"/>
is your good king, therefore trust in hym wyth a true, faythfull, and duetifull obedience: God is your graund captaine, &amp; vnder his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you shall easily vanquishe and captiuate the monstrous armies of Satan: God is your louing father, take heede and beware, least other neighbour Countries steale awaye your blessings fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, whilest you hunt after wandering flesh, in this worldly forrest: God is your wise schoolemaister, and one whyle hee teacheth you with gentle instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and soft precepts, sweeter than honny, and the honny combe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he intreateth you sharply, and correcteth you for your mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold offences.

What shoulde I say more? He selleth you all goods without siluer or golde, and yet you wil not harken vnto my voyce, saith the Lord of Hostes. How long will you flee, when I follow you, howe long will you stop your eares, when I call you? saith the Lord of hostes. O London, London, Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, heare what the Angell of God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the iudgement seate of the Lambe, I haue made <hi>Thamesis</hi> like vnto the Riuers of Paradise, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> are not to bee compared with it, her streames are of siluer, and her sandes of gold, her springs are water of life, and who so drinketh of them, shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry: her bathings make the blinde

to see, the lame to goe, the dumbe to speake, the deafe to heare, &amp; I haue remoued all hinderaunces which woulde stay hir pipes &amp; conduites, the venemous poyson of the great Dragon could not infect it, nor the hotteissuinges of any Serpentes could defyle it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Rulers delighted to rowe in her with Barges, &amp; my Seers builded their houses neere vnto her, she hath beene Queene of all Riuers, because her vertues and effectes are incomparable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Ministers and seruauntes haue I sent in to her, to cast their nettes and catch of her fish, I lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to eate of that broode, and to be serued with her young fishes at my Table, but they laboured all night, and tooke nothing. For <hi>Thamesis</hi> is made a dwelling place for water Snakes, shee is full of infectious woormes, shee shall no more be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the Queene of waters, if I send once agayne, and receiue no fish of her, she shall bee made like the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waters of Gomorrha, sayeth the Lorde of hostes. Nowe my good Countrymen, can you heare thys Embassage and Reuelation, and not marke it? Or can you marke it, and not remember it? Then laye it closely vp in your breastes. Goe to, for Gods sake, and your owne sake, let vs laye our heades and ioyne handes together, let vs sende our humble supplication, and letters of submission vnto our mercifull God, and craue a pardon of his Grace, least he come sodaynly in his wrath, and vexe vs in his sore displeasure. Hee hath sent manye myracles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, my beloued brethren, to chaste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your vnchast misdemeanors. Do you not remember that horrible punishment, wherewith he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb facs="tcp:6079:6"/>
a sister of yours in Woodstreet who very desperately forsweared her selfe in bargaynyng? For as her periurye stincked in the nostrels of the Lord, so her periured tongue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as her fundament. A great example, and notable Admonition, for all buyers and sellers, not to lye, and forsweare, and face, and glose, to gaine the fraile and corruptible money, and loose the penny of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Yet for all this Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ceaseth not, but his hande is stretched out still. Doe you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Lea</hi> an olde man in London, dwelling in Byshopsgate streete, blasphemed the sacred name of God, and forsweared himselfe in the Guildhall? Which haynous trespasse begat in him so forcible a compunction and remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that like to that mad Caine and furious fratricide hee cruellye
<pb facs="tcp:6079:7"/>
shortned his owne dayes, and so wounded his bowels with a rustye knife, that presently without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce hee gaue vp the Ghost. A worthy Caueat for all such, as doe prophanely, and vnreuerently take Gods holy name in their mouthes. Yet for all this Gods anger ceaseth not, but his hande is stretched out still. For when Mystres <hi>Saunders</hi> a Tenaunte of yours, had a long tyme acquainted her selfe wyth the conueyaunces and deuises, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vnhonest Gossyps are famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly accustomed, God woulde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare her payment no longer, but brought her and her wicked compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and adherentes to the gallows, that all other amorous strumpets, and whoorish bloudsuckers might see a fayre warnyng before theyr eyes. Yet for all this Gods heauye wrath ceaseth not, but his hande is
<pb facs="tcp:6079:7"/>
stretched out styll. Doe you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what Tokens haue been sent you within fewe yeeres? By blazing tayles of Starres in the Firmament, by fierie exhalations and excursions in the Element, by extraordinary diseses &amp; infirmities, by shaking your Theatre, by other and other sygnes of dislikyng and rebuking your inordinate kynde of liuing. Yet for all this Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie wrath ceaseth not, but his hand is stretched out still. Do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that most dreadfull and tragicall Earthquake, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the huge and solide foundation of the Earth, to shake and totter vp crepple? Beware least the same and downe lyke a drunken man or Earthe gape suddainely and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you vp quicke, as Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than &amp; Abyram were deuoured for gainesaying the omnipotent worde
<pb facs="tcp:6079:8"/>
of God, which descended from the holy hill of Sinai. Yet for al thys, gods anger ceaseth not, but his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is stretched out still. Do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the infortunate and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mischiefe, that so lately befell to them, which had more desire and delight to visite Paris garden, than Paules Crosse, &amp; to heare the beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye cryes of Beares &amp; Dogs, rather than the comfortable voices of gods preachers, which pronounce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glad tydings of the gosple? the people sat downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play, and many men &amp; women were partly killed, &amp; partly maimed in one hower. Learne therfore and take heede, for there is a plague gon out from god, &amp; his hand is stretched out still. For marke, I praye, what a rare and lamentable Example he shewed vpon two adoulterous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the thirde daye of February,
<pb facs="tcp:6079:8"/>
being Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day, in the yere of Christ 1583. Ther was a man aboue three score yeres old, named <hi>William Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star,</hi> who had bin somtimes of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable wealth, (carying presently a great countenance of honestie) hee was by occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Haberdasher, who either by licentious &amp; prodigal spending or ydle labouring, or gods curse (for he was by credible reporte lately become an vsurer) fell into so low an estate, that the Parishioners where he dwelt, because he had born al offices amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; had bin in good countenaunce and credite, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted and assigned him a chamber ouer the porch on the southeast part of <hi>Sainct Brydes</hi> church by Fleetstreet, rather than he shoulde be destitute of a dwelling place. This <hi>Brustar</hi> had put away his owne wife vppon a disagreement whych happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte them, at two sundrie times,
<pb facs="tcp:6079:9"/>
for he woulde neuer agree with hir, and oftentimes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the neighbors reprehended him for vsing hir so hardly, he made aunswere, that the ende of them both shoulde proue, whiche was moste faultie, hee or his wife, &amp; as I am crediblye enformed, he retayned a woman whiche was one <hi>Breames</hi> wife, whome hee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hadde bayled oute of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> vnder a pretence to reforme hir vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural manners, and bring hir to goodnes, but it proued cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, for they two oftentimes met vnlawfully and vngodly togither, and incurred therfore the danger of God and man. Yet neuerthelesse I am enforced of necessitie to except y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holy, holy, holy, pope of Rome, who hath neither shewed himselfe like to God in goodnesse, nor to man in wisdome and gouernement, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a seducing and erronious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,

But let him alone, hee is hatching more cockatrices egs. If <hi>Brustar</hi> had beene an inhabitaunte of Rome, as hee was of London, he might haue

receiued an <hi>Absoluote</hi> for all his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, and played the <hi>Bigamus</hi> at his pleasure by auctoritie &amp; priuiledge. Upon sunday last in the afternoone a litle before euening prayer, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish being assembled togither to the seruice of their Lorde and Maister Christ Iesus, espyed a smoke some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnlike common smoake, to is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue out of <hi>Brustars</hi> chamber: they by &amp; by suspecting some harme, made no smal haste to his dore, which they found fast shut: then the neighbors caused a ladder to be set to his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window, where they found his key, neuerthelesse they burst open the dore: when they were entred in, beholde what a grieuous spectacle the Lord had laide before their eies, to make reporte thereof vnto theyr brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; fellow citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <hi>Brustar</hi> that olde fornicatour lay starke deade on a settle by the beddes side, his right

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton abuses, for she also lay deade by him bending ouer the smal panne of coales towards him, and hir heade on his right thigh, so that the skirts of hir garments were burnt, hir ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were burnte to the bones, the neather partes of hir bodie burnt to the breaste, and al hir hinder partes to the shoulders, very horrible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde: both hir legs were burnt, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hir lefte foote from the anckle downeward. A straunge euente that so small a fire shoulde consume so much flesh, the tenth part wherof had bene able to drench and quenche

euerie coale in the panne. (A wonder not much vnlike that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the burning of one Gardiner in Spaine, a sparcle of whose fyre set on fire a goodly tall faire shippe of the kings, lying then in the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you may reade more plentifullye in Maister Foxes Ecclesiastical Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.)

Concerning these persons, you heare howe lewdly and vngratiously they missused the holy Sabaoth, &amp; what a <hi>requiem</hi> god gaue them for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

My people of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is like to a childe, yea, euen that goodly people, the people of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is like a dead block vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, saith the Lord of hostes.

But if you will yet remaine like vncircumcised Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, I will sende a two edged sword, to strike of the heads of your proud and disdainful Goliahs, saith the Lord of hostes. And because I could not find one Phinches emong you, I was constrained to be bothe iudge and tormentour my selfe, and I smote <hi>Brustar</hi> and hys Concubine wyth fyre, wherewith they would haue warmed themselues, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes I dydde choake the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
