            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO THE
States General of the United Provinces,
FROM
Prince WALDECK,
Who Commands Their Army in
FLANDERS:
Giving an Account of the Happy Succeſs they had againſt
the <hi>French</hi> Army, Commanded by the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres,</hi>
on the 11/25 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> inſtant, 1689.</head>
            <head>Publiſhed by Authority.</head>
            <p>THis Morning a good part of your Lordſhips Army being gone to Forage, we had
news, that the Mareſchal <hi>d'Humieres</hi> with his Army, which he had reinforced
ſome days before with 6000 Men, was on his March, or which we immediately
advertiſed the Foragers by firing ſeveral pieces of Cannon, as had been agreed
on. In the mean time the Enemies Vanguard attackt the Village <hi>Forge,</hi> where 800 Men
were poſted under the Command of the Engliſh Colonel <hi>Hodges,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel
<hi>Goes,</hi> and the Major of the Regiment of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> This attack laſted about 2 Hours, but
our Men defended themſelves very bravely, till Major <hi>de Roo</hi> (who was ſent to give
notice thereof to the Lieutenant Generals <hi>Webbenum,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marleborough</hi> and
<hi>d'Huby,</hi> who were with the Foragers and to bring them back) came to their Aſſiſtance
with ſome Horſe; whereupon our Men ſeeing the whole French Army advanced towards
them, retired Fighting till they came to a Hill near the Town of <hi>Walcourt,</hi> in which was
poſted a Batalion of <hi>Lunenburghers</hi> of <hi>Linſtan's</hi> Regiment, who were afterwards reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with the batalion of Colonel <hi>Holle.</hi> The French attack'd the ſaid Town very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
with many battalions, and ſeveral pieces of Canon, which laſted two hours and a
half. Lieutenant General <hi>Aylna</hi> advanced with 3 Regiments towards the Town, of
which he detached that commanded by Brigadier <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> and the Lieutenant-Generall
the Earl of <hi>Marleborough,</hi> followed with the Guard <hi>du Corps,</hi> and two Engliſh Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In the mean time Major General <hi>Slangenburg,</hi> advanced with a Detachment of
Foot to the other ſide of the Town, which obliged the Enemy to retire in Confuſion,
leaving behind them their Cannon and Ammunition, and a great many killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the number whereof is not yet certainly known, amongſt which are three Captains
of the French Guards; and Monſieur <hi>d' Artagnan</hi> Commandant of the Guards, with
ſeveral others, are taken Priſoners. In their Retreat came two Drummers from the
Enemy, to deſire a Ceſſation to bury their dead; who ſaid, <hi>That ſix Battalions of the
Guards, who likewiſe made the Attack, were, for the moſt part ruined.</hi> On our ſide none
of any Conſideration are kill'd beſides Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Graham</hi> of the Engliſh, the
Major of the <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> Dragoons, and a Captain Lieutenant: and a Captain, and ſome
Foragers, were taken: And in the Town there were very few kill'd or wounded. The
French retired to their Camp, and our Troops kept their Ground till Night. The Velt
Mareſchal Count <hi>de Naſſau,</hi> with all the other Generals and Officers, behaved themſelves
as could be wiſh'd: and all our Troops ſhewed a great Courage and deſire to come to a
Battle, and particularly the Engliſh, who were engaged in this Action, behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very well, And a great Succeſs might have been expected had the Scituation of the
Countrey ſuffered us to follow the Enemy.</p>
            <p>I Congratulate your Lordſhips upon the good Succeſs of this Rencounter, which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
