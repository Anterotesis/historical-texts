            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon persual of Mr <hi>Ascham's</hi> Book you left with mee, I find not my selfin my understanding therby convinc'd of the Necessity or Lawfulness of Conforming unto, or Complying with an unjust prevailing Power, further than I was before perswaded, it might be Lawful or Necessary so to do: <hi>viz.</hi> As paying Taxes, and Submitting to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things (in themselves not unlawfull) by them imposed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; such as I had a Lawful Liberty to have done in the same manner, though they had not been so Commanded, and seem to mee in the Conjuncture of present Circumstances, prudentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to preserve my self or my Neighbour from the Injuries of Those that would bee willing to make use of my Non-submission, to Mine or His ruine; so as it be done with these Cautions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without Violation either of Duty to God, or any other just Obligation, that lie's upon mee by Oath, Law, or otherwise.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly in the case of Necessity otherwise not to be avoided.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Without any explicite or implicite Acknowledgment of the Justice and Legality of their Power: I may submit to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (to the <hi>Force)</hi> but not acknowledge the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (the <hi>Autority)</hi> or by any Voluntary Act give strength, assistanc, or countenance thereunto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Without any prejudice unto the claime of the Oppressed Party that hath a right, Title; or casting my self into an Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of lending him my due and bounden Assistance, if, in time
<pb facs="tcp:95780:3"/>
to com, it may bee usefull to him towards the Recovery of his Right.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where I may reasonably, and <hi>Bonâ Fide</hi> presume, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Power, (to whom my Obedience is justly due) if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew the present Condition I am in, together with the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Necessity of the present Case, and all of Circumstances thereof, would give his willing Consent to such my Conformity and Compliance.</p>
            <p>So that, upon the whole matter and in short, I conceive I may so far submit unto the Impositions, or comply with the Persons of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing usurped Power, unjustly commanding things not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unlawfull; or make use of their Power to protect one from others Injuries, As I may submit unto, comply with, or make use of an High-way Thief, or Robber, when I am fallen into his hands, and lie at his Mercy.</p>
            <p>As for Mr <hi>Ascham's</hi> Discourse, though it be handsomly framed, yet all the Strength of it to my seeming (if he would speak out) would be in plain English these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That self-preservation is the first and chiefest Obligation in the World, to which all other Bonds and Relations (at least between Man and Man) must give place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That no Oath, at least no imposed Oath, at what Terms soever exprest, binde's the Taker further than hee intended to binde himself thereby; and, it is presumed, that no man intended to binde himself to the prejudice of his own safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two dangerous and desperate Principles, which evidently tend 1. to the taking away of all Christian Fortitude and Suffering in a Righteous Cause: 2. to the Encouraging of daring and ambitious Spirits to attempt continuall Innovations, with this Confidence, that if they can by any wayes (how unjust soever) possesse themselves of the Supreme Power, they ought to be submitted unto: 3. to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing unto the Oppressed Party all possible wayes and means, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Miracle, of ever recovering that just Right, of which hee shall have been unjustly dispossessed: And (to omit further instancing) 4. to the bringing in of Atheism, with the Contempt of God and all Religion, whil'st every man, by making his own Preservation the Measure of all his Dutyes and Actions, maketh himself thereby his own Idol.</p>

               <hi>Am sorry so strict a Censurer could finde any words to commend (as hee saith) the handsome frame of a booke, whose Deductions hee doth not like: And I had rather have accompanied so great a Judge to the tryall of its Basis and Principles, then he left by him thus suddainly groping in the Darke, when every devious step hath a Precipice, yet heare the way (as layd out in that Booke) affirm'd to be both generally good, and generally bad.

I should not have mentioned him at all (the maine of whose booke relates to severall other Authors of a different Historicall seene) did not I finde him (as I shall here shew) contradictory both to friend and foe, to himselfe, to the Principles of the Parliaments first engagement, to this Dr. to</hi> Boxhornius, <hi>and to the learned</hi> Grotius. <hi>Besides hee pretends onely to answer two Chapters of our Author, not taking Notice of the last Additionall Chapters. But by the rules of all Logick it is no way of answering an Argument, but a kind of denying a Conclusion, if the Respondent only turne aside to prove a Proposition contrary to the deductions of the first Position asserted. For by that means hee answers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of anothers, but only proves something of his owne, and so le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Author of the Exercitation saith, <hi>p.</hi> 10. 12. Government must be delivered by Custome or Law, But I would hee could informe <note place="margin">Vide Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Hist. H. 7. p. 144</note> us by what Positive Law <hi>Nimrod</hi> and others in Heroicall seizures enterd into Government at first, and whether our <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, entring into the Government when by Law he stood accus'd of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, could this way be own'd, or any from him to be Lawfull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95780:4"/>
By <hi>Lawfull,</hi> the Doctor here understands that which is <hi>Legall</hi> (which relates but to private Justice and its Tribunals) so that by <hi>Lawfull Commanders</hi> he understands those onely, who legally derive their Authority continuedly from those who were originally authors of it: by which they who have <hi>Ius ad regnum</hi> succeed uninterruptedly (as <hi>Boxhornius</hi> saith) <hi>In locum ultimi, &amp; injus primi;</hi> which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple (tho it hath such great assertours) is of no security to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Princes and Governours, making our Obligations in oaths of Allegiance as uncertaine, as the right so specified in them is, and may shake all the Kingly Titles and Crownes in Christendom; as the Exercitation doth sufficiently by his not clearing himselfe, <hi>p.</hi> 2. Where hee saith, Princes are rightly invested with soveraignty, 1. Immediatly by God. 2. Mediatly by his committing it to the people to Elect. 3. When God by a Reservation of his Power still <note place="margin">Exer. p. 2.</note> in terposeth to designe the Person.</p>
            <p>Tho this bee well said, yet it is not enough. For first it provides not for Peoples obeying a Capitall family in Genarchaship, of which our Author treats <hi>Chap. 11. parte.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what shall we say to such Governours who were not originally design'd immediatly by God, nor mediatly by such a free choice of the People as he requires, and as was scarcely ever practiz'd since <hi>Nimrods</hi> entry?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, seeing according to him God still reserves the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of designing Persons to Goverments, but that the publique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his will by Prophecy and Miracles is ceas'd, what then doth that Author but allow men to undertake to change Governours and Governments by virtue of Private spirit and Revelation, which we are not able alwayes to confute, no more then others are able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to prove to us, and after this how will that Author bee ever able to prove a certaine usurpation in his sence? To avoyd these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and enquiries, our Authors, or rather St <hi>Austins</hi> Principle is safer both for Princes and people, <hi>viz. That we obey those who plenarily possesse us, and force us not to the practice of things in themselves impious.</hi> They who according to <hi>Hosea</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 4. <hi>Set up Kings, but not by God,</hi> are accountable for it; but doth it follow that wee of the People during that uncertainty might not obey them?</p>
            <p>The like inconsonancies hath he to this purpose, <hi>p.</hi> 3. Where speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the manner of the Peoples consent to make a true
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95780:5"/>
Title in a Prince; he saith it matters not whether it be antecedent or Consequent to Possession.</p>
            <p>For first, if it bee with the unjust dispossession of another (which hee ought Principally to have spoken to) then the Peoples subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent consent cannot make the intrusion Lawfull to the intruder.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what will he say to <hi>Boxhornius,</hi> who maintains the same Cause with him, and argues that the Peoples consent, tacite or expresse, antecedent or subsequent to anothers Possession, cannot take away the right which the Heirs of a successive Prince have to Governe, tho their father might bee justly ejected? Because (saith hee) the Originall Compact was in consideration of the first blood, not of the particular persons governing. But by these loose arguments they doe but perplex one another, more then us: and for <hi>Boxhornius</hi> it is sufficient that he makes the Hollanders his Countrymen rebells still, and this King of Spaine likewise but an Vsurper, if he derive not every way a right from the first blood in compact. Wherefore according to the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, for obeying the King being, we suppose our governour to bee Lawfull, and then proceed to make Lawes and to conforme to them.</p>

            <p>It is agreed by all, that <hi>in things</hi> unlawfull, the Consideration of the Persons (lawfull or unlawfull) weighs not at all; For in that Case we must obey God the supremest Magistrate rather then man.</p>
            <p>But when Lawfull things are commanded, then three things are in Consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some say, that to legitimate our Obedience we must first assure our selves of the Legality of the Persons Commanding; and then we may obey them in all Lawfull things, otherwise in nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Author hath asserted in severall Chapters, That in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd state of the World, wherein Interest (which makes false Gods, and Counterfit Lawes for Heaven) makes and maintaines many Princes by the like fictions (as they who would bee own'd as the of-spring of the Gods) and Princes themselves oft not permitting the tryall of their Rights, require as much faith for Civill, as for Religious Interests, <hi>Hee</hi> asserts (I say) that such an Originall and Legall assurance being a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impossibility, it is best and enough for our present Obedience, to informe ourselves, Whether the kingdome bee plenarily possest by those <note place="margin">p. 1. c. 7, 8.</note> who in present exercise immediate command over it. And if so, then we may obey them in the lawful things above specified. For hee hath shewed that all Governours are but Ministeriall for the quiet practice of the rules of Right, and that therefore, they enter not into the definition of Justice. Besides for arguments sake he saith, that a thing should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as Civilly Lawfull, it is not alwayes necessary that it should enter, <hi>Sine dolo out vitiato principio,</hi> provided it bee not Irrationall when it is entred, or unjust as a custome: Every circumstantiall errour makes not a false Church, nor every sin an untrue beleever.

For this Reason Christ and his Apostles bad us not so much beware of Illegall and false Princes, as of false Prophets; because at the day of Judgement wee shall all be examined concerning the things themselves done here in the flesh, not under what Politicall Titles and formes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Censurer stands ballancing betwixt these two waies of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and for want of that Christian fortitude which he speakes of, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly onely pretends to a station of Neutrality, although really hee is most consonant with our Author, nor any way opposite to his publike Assertions, or to present Obedience.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Cases wherein the Censurer allows Obedience to a <note place="margin">The Cases of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> supposed unjust Authority.</p>
               <p>First, He directly saith, he can pay taxes, and conform to other things imposed by those who unlawfully and plenarily possess a Kingdom.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here he leaves us in the dark, by not naming those other things, which may be (for ought we know) all those other things asserted by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Howsoever he sufficiently acknowledgeth the present Authority, and so fals off from those of the first opinion: But how he conceives he hath liberty to pay taxes and other duties without being commanded l under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Secondly, he saith, he can obey in things not unlawfull in themselves; Which is the utmost of what our Author asserts, especially in the <hi>Chapter of Politicall Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he can conform to what in the Conjuncture of present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95780:6"/>
may seem prudentially necessary for his own, and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours preservation from Injuries: He approves not of a Non-obedience, which might be made use of to his own danger.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But for assuring his Obedience in these three Generall heads (which comprehend the whole state of Subjection) he must have these five <hi>PROVISO'S,</hi> which I shall examine, only to see how far they are opposite either to Reason, or to the Book which he Censures.</p>
            <q>Those three Cases of Obedience are allowable then only, when they <note place="margin">Provis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

            <p>The same is asserted largely by our Author, shewing how things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves just and necessary, are not displeasing to God: as also how Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory Oaths alwaies have tacite conditions innate to them, in regard of their uncertain futurition: That the condition of Politicall Oaths, is to obey whom God permits plenarily to possesse Kingdoms, which is the sense in which Kings themselves understand them. Though such Oaths may be violated by Princes, who at the expence of the Peoples bloud, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute <hi>de jure ad regnum,</hi> yet that ended, the poor People in submitting to changed Titles, violate no former Oaths. For the matter of such Oaths <note place="margin">Sanderson praelec. 7. sec. 7.</note> and Laws (as the Censurer himself hath taught it) is consumed to them, and as I may say, dyes to them like fire, rather by extinction, than by corruption. Otherwise all the World should be obliged to Morall impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities, which the Censurers Book of Oaths will not allow. For that were to be ever restless among our selves, till we brought God to our bent; as if we could force him to continue such Persons and Governours only, as we approve of best our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <q> The second <hi>Proviso</hi> gives allowance only in Cases of extreme Necessity.</q> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> Which our Author likewise asserts to be that alone which Originally makes, interprets, and finally abrogates Laws and Goverments Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to them, and so becomes the <hi>Caesar</hi> of <hi>Caesars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q> The third is, When he may reasonably presume, that the Power to which his Obedience is justly due, upon consideration of his present exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, <note place="margin">3.</note> would (if he knew them) dispence with his present Obedience to a prevailing Power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author asserts thus much and more <hi>(Chap. 10. p.</hi> 2.) not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, especially when the supposed Governour derives such an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute clear right as is here pretended. This <hi>Proviso</hi> for self-Preservation, runs to the end of all the Circumstances of Subjection to a new Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour; and may be (as he saith) as <hi>reasonably</hi> presumed from all <hi>right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers</hi>

            <p>The Author of the Exercitation, <hi>p.</hi> 58. fals highly foule on the Dr. here, and will not allow him this <hi>Proviso,</hi> saying, <hi>Such a presumptive releasment is groundless, and highly impious, and is but his own act, &amp; that cannot be a discharge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor &amp; our Author here speak not of the extremities of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, but of a whole Nation, in which Case <hi>Posito sed non concesso</hi> that Princes had such an inalienable right of Property in People, &amp; that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were for the person governing primarily, yet the presumption were good, and would discharge a man <hi>in foro interiori,</hi> though not <hi>in exteriori,</hi> where (for reasons of state) <hi>summum jus</hi> is somtimes <hi>summa injuria.</hi> I wonder What expresse Letter of the Law there was to Authorize our Saviours pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Corne in another mans field, or <hi>Davids</hi> eating the shew-bread, or <hi>Sampsons</hi> killing of himselfe? whom <hi>Iosephus</hi> excus'd, because when hee saw he could live no longer but with a reproach to God, he conceivd hee might then anticipate his death. <hi>Vid.

            <p>The exercitation <hi>p.</hi> 60. saith, The <hi>Oath of Allegiance prevents such a Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obliges during life to doe all that possibly may be done for such an absent Prince.</hi> Our Author <hi>chap.</hi> 9. Proves that wee are bound to doe the utmost of all our Morall not of all our Naturall endeavour, and that not during life, but during Possession, which is the scope of that Promissory Oath. Otherwise what will he say to our late Kings Oath, with the now King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> contrary to that which he took with the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> as King of <hi>Portugall?</hi> and what will he say to those Cases which our Author puts to him <hi>chap.</hi> 9. concerning those who in frontire places fall somtimes into the possession of one Prince and Allegiance, and somtimes into another quite contrary? In opposition to our Author the Exercitation delivers a strange Doctrine, affirming, <hi>That when such Enemies prevaile they can pass no Obligation upon men so reduced, as thereby to make them indebted to them for their lives, because they were unjust enemies.</hi> According to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95780:7"/>
this, there will be no faith kept betwixt Enemies (who oft presume one as much as another of the justice of their Causes) neither were Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, releast upon their Paroles, bound to keep them, and that brave Roman releast at <hi>Carthage</hi> upon his faith to return again from <hi>Rome,</hi> did not only a sottish, but an unjust act in keeping it. But saith he in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Author <hi>p.</hi> 60. a new life cannot be given, and so consequently no new Obligation, and our Author cannot really prove his life another then it was. R. When a mans life is given, it is civily, though not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally taken to be another: and if it be a contradiction to say a man can in no consideration be said to have a new life, because it is naturally still the same, then I am sure he contradicts the whole current of the Gospell, which tells us how we may become <hi>New Creatures,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. did but prevaricate, when he said, It was no longer he that did such things, because the old man was dead in him; which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as if the former individuall soule of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were changed for another.</p>
            <p>But that Author to maintaine himselfe in these streights asserts this as his Principle for all, <hi>p. 56. That peoples oaths are all absolute and irrespective, and have no implications of if's or and's, &amp;c.</hi> From whence (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great sufferings for the Parliament) he must directly condemne their first ingagement against the King, and so he doth plainly, saying, <hi>p.</hi> 13. That it is unlawfull to resist or fight against any just Magistrate, as he understands just in Title, and yet <hi>p.</hi> 56. he calls KING CHARLES The late invasive Prince. Secondly he therby upbraids the Covenant, which provided for the preservation of the King but conditionally, in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion and Law.

Our Author <hi>chap. 9. p.</hi> 2. hath shewn how impossible it is that any Promissory Oath can be absolute and irrespective, and so hath this Doctor (the Censurer) also <hi>praelecti. p.</hi> 7. §. 7. And the Exercitator at last with more contradiction confesses p. 61. That such an Oath may be indeed suspended, but not dissolved: Whereas it is a known Maxim, <hi>Obligationes non sunt inpendenti,</hi> the Obligations of <note place="margin">See Mr A. p. 2. c. 3. sect. 2.</note> Promises cannot be suspended: <hi>quia annus &amp; dies debentur,</hi> we owe time, which may suspend the adimpletion of a Promise, but not its obligation. Otherwise we must allow (though he would not) reservations for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall allegiances for the same people, for the same actions, and the same time, which is as contradictory, as if we would have severall Centers for the same equidistant Lines in a Circle, and that in <hi>Holland</hi> they owe allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance both to the States, and to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in <hi>Portugall</hi> to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to the new King.</p>

               <q>The fourth Proviso of the Doctors is, when this may be without prejudicing the oppressed party in his dues, and without disabling our selves to help him in his recovery afterwards.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Notion is fitted only to distract people, by putting them in a way how they should do nothing in present with faith, only that they might thereby act any thing afterwards with madness; Yea, though every thing both in Religion and Nature be more favourable for Peace then for War. This is indeed a refind Chimaera, as if People could in a State live half by themselves, by their own Laws, and their own Militia, and so be taken into no plenary protection or possession, by which they may be exposed in a Moment to certain ruine. For non-obedience can expect nothing but non-protection; as King <hi>Iames</hi> in his Apology objected to <hi>Pius Quinius</hi> when he absolved his Catholique Subjects from their Allegiance, upon a pretence that he was an Hereticall, and therefore an unlawfull King: To which the King replied, That what truth soever there might be in this his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95780:8"/>
unlawfulness, yet it was never asserted in the Church before, That Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Obedience to any temporall power was against faith and salvation of souls: a Doctrine which this Censurer doth ill now to second a Pope in against a Protestant King.</p>
            <p>Nay, though it were true That one Prince or Power commands to the prejudice of an other ejected, yet the peoples obedience, when necessary, is not unlawfull, but in submitting their <hi>Tutela</hi> is <hi>inculpata.</hi> For it is easie to understand how we may have a right to receive what another may not have a right to give; as a Necessary alms begd and received from one who got his riches by wrong and oppression: as also in borrowing mony upon biting Usury, when a man cannot by Morall diligence get it other waies. As for the dues here mentioned, I shall speak to them in the next. Proviso.</p>
            <p>Here I must observe that the Author of the Exercitation hath an expresse Chapter against no other Author which I know of but the Doctor in this <note place="margin">Chap. 32</note> his forth <hi>Proviso,</hi> highly blaming him for giving way to the temporizing reservations of Allegiance during the intervall and prevalency of another Power: at which Power some profess themselves so much scandalized, that they cannot see how they may with a good Conscience ever go to Law in the present Courts of Justice for their debts and rights. But for their ease this Exercitation hath found out an excellent expedient for them (tho not moulded from that equity whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caesar)</hi> which is, <hi>That they may now recover their dues in those Courts, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they give not such titles to the Iudges and Officers as they should give to the Lawfull Magistrates.</hi> I wonder whether this Gentleman thinks the like exception and scruple might not have been made against their Courts du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Parliaments first War with the King, when Judges and every thing else was regulated here, only by his name, and absolutely against his Will. Such another expedient for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> would set all right in their justice too; For I beleeve the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath made no more Judges in <hi>Scotland</hi> then the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> hath done in <hi>England.</hi> But the grand Case of Conscience <hi>p.</hi> 10. will tell this Gentleman (how truly let him look to it) that his expedient salves not half the difficulty; and that after he hath received that which he judges in himself is <hi>j<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stly</hi> his own, by the might and power only of an unjust Court, yet he hath not his own: because a thing in itself just is not recovered by their help justly: For Justice and Judgment is then only just, when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from the Just Legall Magistrate, and Justice, as he saith <hi>p.</hi> 26. looks upward, as well as downward.</p>
            <p>

            <p>I know not to what purpose this Criticisme is inserted to weigh against the consequence of such important Cases and Arguments, unless it be to indispose people by perplexing them. Though the difference betwixt those two Greek words, be no more then is betwixt <hi>Potentia</hi> and <hi>Potestas,</hi> or as is more Critically betwixt <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> yet our Author <hi>p. 2. ch.</hi> 11. §. 9. proves that the inequality of force, or <hi>Potency</hi> is the originall ground of ruling, as well as <hi>Impotency</hi> is of subjection. For which reason Master <hi>Hobbes</hi> his supposition, That if there were two Omnipotents, neither could obey one the other, is very conclusive.</p>

If hee speak as a Casuit he cannot argue <hi>Prescription</hi> for the cleare right of one against the present Possession of another. For Prescription of it selfe proves only a Comparative right, as one may bee some what better then the other, onely because ancienter.

In the midst of these rounds which he runs, I wonder what fixt rules he would give for the reception of Embassadours (when they must first prove their Masters Titles) for the limits and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Empires, &amp;c? The Lawes of Nations must and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine these, and not the Municipall Lawes of any one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; But <hi>p. 53. he professeth he knowes not what the Lawes of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or of War meane, if they derogate or vary from other humane Lawes,</hi> as they indeed doe, War beginning there where other Law ends, and reciprocally, and if he knowes not this it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mr Seldens</hi> not <hi>Grotius</hi> &amp;c. faults, but his owne. For want of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95780:10"/>
this he censures <hi>Grotius</hi> very impertinently for saying, <hi>That if one Compeer unjustly invades the others rights, he may by the Law of War lose the exercise of his own rights.</hi> This Gentleman <hi>p.</hi> 54. think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mitigate the rigour of this, heightens it; <hi>For saith he, it is not necessary that his right should be lost, but that he make reparation, and according to the justice of the Scripture he ought but to make a fourefold restitution of damage.</hi> But I pray you what difference is there betwixt losing a right, and not having that without which no satisfaction can be made, nor any readmission may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Princes are still little beholding to him for these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For after a War, and the desolation of Countries, how can an invading Prince satisfie for the reall dammages which are so many? Or for the Personall injuries or murthers of so many, of which there can be no Compensation at all?</p>
            <p>The assertion of our Authors ninth <hi>Chapter</hi> not being this, <hi>That meere violent extrusion takes away a Soveraigns right,</hi> I have nothing to do to follow the Arguments of the Exercitation <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. as if they were positive answers to our Author; I shall only vindicate him in two places where the Exercitation would fasten Contradictions on him.</p>
            <p>Our Author saith, that we are bound to own Princes so long <note place="margin">Ch. 10. p. 2. sec. 3.</note> as it pleases God to give them the power to command us, and when we see others possest of their powers, we may then say, that the King of Kings hath changed our Vice-Roy; and yet speaking of Antichrists Dominion, he saith, it can by no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription become lawfull, neither can a Christian submit himself to it without wounding his faith; which saith the Exercitation is a Contradiction.</p>
            <p>I answer with King <hi>Iames,</hi> that we speak here only of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Obedience in Temporall things, and as the Pope is a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prince he may have Allegiance due to him, (upon which account severall Protestant Princes have received his <hi>Nuncios)</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his spirituall Capacity may be denied him. Thus they who in his Country may not go to his Churches, may safely obey him in his other Laws and Courts, in which assertion there is no Contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95780:11"/>
Secondly, Our Author saith, that the Obedience which the Israelites owed to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> ought not to be a generall rule for subjection, which contradicts the former Position, as the Exercitation conceives, but erroniously.</p>
            <p>First, because they were given up as a prey to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because they were warned by Prophets so to obey, whereas we now of this Age neither have them, nor Miracles to warrant us.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have shewed you what consonancy there is betwixt the Censurers <hi>Positions</hi> and <hi>Provisos</hi> with our Author.</p>
            <p>But lest so much truth might unawares do some harme, and that interests might not be changed with opinions, he laies the Book aside, and falls roughly on two Assertions, which yet he saith our Author hath not spoke openly to.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The first concealed opinion of our Author, or rather the Doctors <note place="margin">uppositions. 1.</note> own supposition is, That no Oath binds the taker further then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bind himself thereby, and it is presumed, that no man inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bind himself to the prejudice of his own safety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Who can sufficiently wonder at the Doctors great errour in this assertion? Seeing the fourth Chapter in the second part of our Author is expresly &amp; <hi>in terminis</hi> writ to prove the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; shewing that a Promissory Oath is to be taken in the Principalls or Propounders sence; <hi>sine subticentiâ aut amphibolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giâ.</hi> Because a Promise is a Pact for transferring somthing to another, as to a Principall, whose sence we are bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if our sence tells us that such or such is his sence, and no further, unless we will our selves.</p>
            <p>As for our Ministers former Subscriptions to Episcopacy, and their swearing since to extirpate it in Covenant, our Author <hi>ch.</hi> 8. hopes Mr. <hi>Chittingworths</hi> Vindication to be sufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second tacit supposition is, that self-preservation is the first and chiefest obligation in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author affirmes it to be the first, as in the State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>p. 2. c.</hi> 11. but not the chiefest for many Civill and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obligations which derogate from that afterwards, especially
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95780:11"/>
where the Question is directly of Christ come in the flesh. Yet he affirms <hi>p. 2. c.</hi> 11. that most civill bonds made betwixt man and man are but for better securing self-preservation: and that men bound to venture their lives, are not therefore bound to lose them. Because the Obligation is of all our Morall, not of all our Naturall endeavours: and upon this ground he saith, <hi>chap. 8 p.</hi> 2. that Souldiers most strictly sworn to a Prince, may in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>rout take quarter: because to dye for him, is to do nothing for him, but fruitlesly to cease to do any thing at all, either for the glory of God, or for the good of our surviving Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Yea, this very Doctor saith, Praelec. 7. sect. 7. That Fathers may disinherit their Children, and Children their Fathers, though they swore never to do so, viz.</hi> If they seek to destroy one another; which according to him involves full forfeiture of rights, even to Publique Parents notwithstanding former Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>And as if the Doctor were nere resolved to say plainly <hi>by whom it is that Princes cease to reign,</hi> he himself affirms in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that in the like conjuncture of Circumstances he can likewise allow himself the same Prudentialls to prevent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which might otherwise happen to him by such changes, and yet he will not openly allow so much to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which as King Iames in his Apology saith is a doctrine full of blood, unnecessarily keeping poore people either from quarter or Protection, Kingdomes from Peace, authorityes from setling; and in the search of uncertaine rights (which this Doctor makes necessary for just actions) hee makes us feele trepidation in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, see Crownes tottering on Princes heads, finde Atheisme in our actions, and desolation in our Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sine, seeing no man knowes better then hee (who is so great a Master of Reason) that if he had brought never so many more <hi>Incommoda,</hi> and those true ones, yet hee could not by that Logick have overthrowne one Positive Argument of our Author; I could therefore wish, that by answering that which was publisht so long before any chang of government
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95780:12"/>
here, hee had made his reasons more publique then his scandall. Unlesse (after so many Precepts of Christ and his Apostles, the practicall Obedience of them, and of all the rest of the World ever since) hee can shew wherein our Authors assertion of Publique Obedience, is more chargeable with Novelty, or the contempt of God, then St <hi>Austins</hi> which he wrote in the same termes, and in relation to the like changes and confusions, <hi>viz. Quid interest sub cujus imperio vivat homo moriturus, si illi qui imperant ad impia &amp; iniqua non cogant? Nam quid intersit ad incolumitatem bonosque mores quod alij vicerunt, alij victi sunt, omninò non video. That is, What matters it under whose government hee who is dayly dying lives, if they who command force him not to the practice of impious things? For I cannot any wayes perceive what advantage it is either to our safety, or integrity of life and manners, that some are conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, others are conquered.</hi> Aug.
