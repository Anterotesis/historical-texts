         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In Anſwer to the Wardens Speech.</head>
            <p>BRothers and Commanders of this never too civill ſociety,
Before I give fire to thoſe Squibs and Crackers I am to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
my courteſie thinks it fit to preſent the complement
of your poore ſervant, for your generall choyce of me to
ſhake my locks before you this day for the honour I confeſſe,
of the Cavaleiry; which I doubt not (by that unaccuſtomed
quality amongſt you cal'd patience, and upon condition you will not
outſwagger me) but to finiſh as well as the maddeſt rorer here preſent.
And for teſtimony of my acknowledgment of your favours, and as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to the worke in hand here is a health of three glaſſes, when that
is gone round I will proceed you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut the buſineſſe it ſelfe in as new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyn'd
aſſeverations as my vapouring Genius can performe.</p>
            <p>You are now to conceive in what time and upon what occaſion this
diſcourſe is grounded. The time is now, juſt now that I have received
my pay, newly repaired my thredbare outſide, and once more do enjoy
that miraculous bleſſing of cleane Linnen, before my Fether and Scarfe
be ruffled, or the dew of Heaven hath fallen upon them, my pockets fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
my braine inſpired with raptures and enthuſiaſmes inſinuated by
the corroborative vertue of this excellent and never too much admired
Cavary. The occaſion, ſince high treaſon and hanging matters are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
but market-talk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only but a game at Shittlecock, wherein the bold
world dare toſſe betwixt King and State every idle feare, and frivolous
ſuggeſtion which fancy or imagination doth prompt and frame, in their
halfe loſt wits, and this kind of deſperate communication growne more 
cuſtomary then the French tongue or faſhion. Why ſhould not we as
<pb facs="tcp:65812:3"/>
well as all the world beſides take ſome liberty to prate of great matters
to little purpoſe. And therefore as theſe two glaſſes more ſhall enable
me, I will goe forward with ſuch matters as the heate of my blood and
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vertigo in my braine ſhall drop into my language.</p>
            <p>My Antagoniſt the Warden begins his Cinquepace with the Liturgy
of the Church, wherein his Scotch Bagpipe whines you out his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathys
thereunto in ſuch abominable out of tune chords that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraleld
harmony rather begets ridiculous mirth then any ſolitude or
ſoul-ſympathizing pleaſure. Now touching this ſubject, I muſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
confeſſe (Gentlemen) but pardon me for it, that the time hath been
I have ſeen the inſide of a Church, although not often nor lately, and
there although the Organ did exceed the noiſe of the voices, whereby
not a plaine ſyllable more then <hi>O</hi> and <hi>yaw,</hi> he and <hi>aiſe,</hi> could be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
yet I verily beleeve the Vicars and ſong-men doe meane well
by their ejaculations and gaping upwards and ſhakeing their gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beards.
And although the Organiſt doe as a Praeludium to the Antheme
play Sellengers-round, yet I muſt tell you that it is done with ſo much
diviſion both on the treble and baſe keys, that no body but himſelfe
can tell what to make of it, unleſſe he tell it to a friend as once he did,
which friend began imediately to dance, and being ask'd by a Vicar
what he meant (quoth he) to ſerve God as he was never ſerv'd in his life,
but let that paſſe. I have ſeen books with good plate covers, guilt Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
Pluſh Carpets, &amp;c. and ſo farre am I from thinking any hurt of all
this, that I muſt acknowledge I have many times wiſht this kind of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urgy
in mine own chamber, that I might have made much of it, and uſed
it more frequently then I did. Now for forme or eſſence of worſhip, I
know (Gentlemen) you will eaſily give me credit, and not ſtand upon
that needleſſe trouble of proofe, that I have been no extraordinary ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
therein, nor much addicted to the diſcourſes thereunto pertaining,
whereby I cannot but hope you wil pardon me if I do not give you
ſatisfaction in it. But concerning the VVardens church which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
you may pleaſe to underſtand, that before I was in ſervice, in
regard I owed ſome money in towne, I took occaſion to walk without
my Periwig or my Sword, which I left with my then Landlord for his
ſervice, thereby to obſcure my ſelfe from my Tobacco-Grocer, my Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draper,
and my Thimble-merchant, and others into whoſe booke I had
(by many faithful perſwaſions and honeſt proteſtations) dam'd my
ſelfe in a matter of foure Nobles. And having likewiſe at that time by a
woful miſchance gotten an imperfection in my noſe, whereby I could
<pb facs="tcp:65812:3"/>
not chuſe but ſpeake the right tone, I was by this meanes generally taken
for a Round-head, and being on a time invited to the duties I went along
with the party, who conducted me into a chamber one paire of ſtaires
&amp; a halfe below ſtaires, which preſented it ſelfe a Cellar, and a Kitchin,
where there were a matter of twenty perſons of both ſexes. The men
ſaluted me with welcome deare brother, I wiſh you had brought along
with you a yoke-fellow that might be edifyed: The women told me
they ſhould be glad to diſcover unto me the path wherein I was to tread,
and ſo preſented me with a cup of Muſcadine and Egges, and thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the ſalutation, for being all very hungry the Bibles were preſently
ſaid under the Dreſſer, and the meate brought to the table, and thus
far, nere a man breathing could complaine of their Liturgy; marry after
dinner which was finiſhed in leſſe then foure hourres, they fel to (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
call it ſinging, but) howling the 119. Pſalm, the ſuddain ſqueaking
whereof frighted me out of the houſe, and hath made me looke thus
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>dly ever ſince. Now for theſe reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſee no hurt in the Liturgy,
and therefore as I love it, ſo deep wil I drink to the ful confirmation and
continuation thereof.</p>
            <p>The next thing which his Wardenſhips wiſedome flys upon as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
as a Hauke, or a Puſſatd ſeiſes a Paitridge or carrion, is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
of which kinde of Militia I will not ſpeake one word, it was ſo
well done, (if not over done by the Warden himſelfe) but I will
dilate upon our owne Militia, that of us the Cavaliers, and Gentlemen
of this preſent ſociety, In which you muſt underſtand, I meane not the
Cavaliers that belaboured themſelves ſo bravely at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> nor
they that now attend at <hi>Yorks,</hi> for ſuch as they are a thought too
great to be jeſted withall, and are or may be our paymaiſters: no, I
meane us the new made Gentlemen of the times, us that have woon
our Armes by feats of Crivalry done in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where
we did nothing at all, and I ſay what though we cannot prove the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
from our anceſtors. Tis no matter, the greater glory hangs upon
our Swords, and the world ſhall ſtudy new haroldry purpoſely to
enable us with the Armes of the Gentry. Thou <hi>Tom Trimwell</hi> waſt Sir
<hi>Iohn Sucklins</hi> Taylor, in making the doublets didſt reduce as much
ſhavings as made thy ſelfe a ſuit, ſo becauſe a Troper and art now a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier.
Thou Maſter <hi>Fawne</hi> waſt thy Captaines man got his caſt clothes,
and are now a formall Cavalier, haſt the garbe, the othes, the vapours,
and all things in a Taverne pertaining to the function, I my ſelfe was a
Gentleman before indeed, for I was gentleman uſher to the Lady at
<pb facs="tcp:65812:4"/>

hath beene famous with ſo many of them, by her Commendations I was
made a Corporall, and am therefore an abſolute Cavalier: And now
Gentlemen that we may perfectly attribute the title to our ſelves, If
there be any amongſt us that beares the name of any great Family in
the Kingdome, let him pretend himſelfe of the ſame houſe, and bloud,
twill carry it amongſt thoſe that cannot contradict it, Or beſides by the
adding, diminiſhing, or exchanging a letter or ſillable of your owne
names into other mens it is eaſily done: And therefore he whoſe name
is, <hi>Perſon</hi> may call himſelfe <hi>Percy, Barton</hi> may change to <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

ſupply'd with exceſſe of ſwaggering, and domincering, a kind of teſty
pragmaticall bearing, and ſcorning to anſwer any man that queſtion's
your birth, all eaſiy wayes to preſerve your ſelves under the title of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,
which very bare title is enough to make you of that Militia,
which ſervice we hope will not be much more difficult then that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
the Warden mentions, ſo long as one Array continues at <hi>Yorke,</hi>
and th' other at <hi>London,</hi> and howſoever well their protectors doe agree,
yet I hope their Armies may never come nearer then they are, and that
partly for the Common-wealths ſake, and partly for our owne ſakes,
for truly theſe meeting ſervices are not halfe ſo comfortable as thoſe ſix,
or ſeaven ſcore miles diſtance, And to be a warrier, a Cavalier a Scldate,
and lie in a fetherbed, eate and drinke like Epicures, not to be lowly,
why it almoſt as eaſie a perfection as to be a Round head, although
the Round-head be far unfit to be a Cavalier, for ſurely the ſteele Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
would chafe his eares to peeces, there being no haire to defend
them. Beſides the noyſe of the Guns would runne like an Axell through
his eares, and turne his head round about it, for you know hee's
giddy already; No, no we are the men that muſt charge at diſtance, and
ſtand for the good of that party that will pay beſt, and doubt not to
defend them bouldly againſt to reſiſtance, But I will end this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
leſt my cock-braines ſhould hurry mee into ſuch circumſtances,
as would bring me into queſtion without redemption.</p>
            <p>The third diſcourſe his grave frenzy throwes him on is the
extirpation of the Papiſts that giving Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that leavies
their great Legacies in the hands of the Prieſts to bee diſtributed
to charitable uſes, and make their children beggars for their better
inortification, if they but dare to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, let us alone with them now
their armes are taken away, Mary if the Proteſtant Jeſuit were but as
<pb facs="tcp:65812:4"/>
well tam'd as they are there would be no uſe for us in <hi>England,</hi> we
might even trudge as Volunteers to the other Kingdome, where we
ſhould hardly find ſo good entertainment; and yet we ſhould make
prety worke with them, if they were but diſarm'd as the papiſts here
are. And Gentlemen, when the ſeditions are appeaſed let us expect no
other imployment. But this Diſcourſe tends to my next argument,
therefore I will touch it but ſparingly, onely ſix glaſſes to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
before we come that we may have the eaſier ſervice; if we
be cald, I pray you pledge it, that it may be knowne we can wiſh
them miſchiefe thus farre off, and that at a neerer we might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on to doe ſomething too upon any reaſonable odds in Armes and
Amunition.</p>
            <p>Then my adverſary proceeds to beat out the quinteſence of his
noddle, Would that imployment of beating out had been mine, I
would have done it to ſome purpoſe. But that is of the Iriſh expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which I will ſay nothing of the benefit thereof, more then
appertaines to our ſelves, which conſiſts of theſe conveniences, naked
Armes appearing out of Shamy doublets like Pedlars or Glaſſe-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
with halfe breeces, footleſſe ſtockins, and over them drawne a
paire of Leather-buskins, which in former daies had been boots of a
decent wearing, and neere to the primitive nakedneſſe. For dyet,
think not ſcorn of mouldy Bisket, and a fat Coult boild in his own
skin, if you can catch it: for want of dyet that precious vapour of
<hi>Virginia</hi> in a leaguer pipe is a ſingular prevention to ſtop the yawning
of the hungry ſtomack; and grudge not now and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently
ſtarv'd to death for want of theſe commodities too; and the
ſports and recreations that belong to this imployment of ſtanding
centinell foure long houres in a froſty night, or lying <hi>per deiu</hi> in a
trench of cold water, which is a ſoveraigne provocative to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
malady called the Belly-ach, and yet there may be better
accommodations if the Adventurers will but bring in their money
faſt enough; but in caſe they do not the aforeſaid ſolaces and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are like enough to enſue. Now Gentleman, you know we are
