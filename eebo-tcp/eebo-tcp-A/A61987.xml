            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch are the rare perfections, and admirable guifts of Wisdome, Prudence, Valor and Justice, wherewith the bountifull hand of Gods Divine Majesty hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued your Majesty; As in the depth of your most provident judgement, we doubt not but you foresee what concerneth both the spirituall, and temporall government of all your Kingdomes and Dominions. Notwithstanding your Graces most afflicted subjects, and devoted servants, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of <hi>England,</hi> partly to prevent sinister informations which happly may possesse your Sacred Eares, before our answer be heard; Partly as men almost overwhelmed with persecutions for our consciences, we are inforced to have speedy recourse in hope to have speedy redresse from your Highnesse, and to present these humble lines unto your royall Person, to plead for us some commiseration and favour. Alas what allegiance, or duty can any temporall Prince desire, or expect at his vassals handes, which we are not addressed to performe? How many Noblemen, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen most zealous in the Catholique Religion, have endured some losse of land and living, some exile, others impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, some the effusion of bloud, and life, for the advancement of your blessed Mothers right unto the Scepter of <hi>Albion?</hi> Nay whole finger did ever ake, but Catholiques for your Majesties present Title and Dominions? How many fled to the Court of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65148:3"/>
themselves as hostages for their friends, to live and die in your gracious quarrell, if ever any adversary had opposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against the equity of your cause? If this they attempted with their Princes disgrace to gain your Majesties Grace, what wil they doe nay what will they not doe, to live without disgrace in your Majesties favour?</p>
            <p>The many of this Realme if we respect Religion (setting petty Sects aside) consisteth upon foure parts. 1 <hi>Protestants</hi> who have domineered all the former Queenes dayes, <hi>Puritans,</hi> who have crept up apace amongst them, <hi>Atheists</hi> or <hi>Polititians,</hi> who were bred upon their brawles in matters of Faith, and <hi>Catholikes</hi> who as they are opposite to all, so are they detested of all, because er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was ever an enemy to truth. Hardly all or any two of the first can be suppressed, therefore we beseech your Majesty to yeild us as much favour as others of contrary Religion (to that which shall be publiquely professed in <hi>England</hi>) shall obtaine at your hands; For if our fault be like, lesse, or none at all, then in equity our punishment ought to be like, lesse, or none at all.</p>
            <p>The Gates, Arches, and Pyramides of <hi>France</hi> proclaimed the present King <hi>Pater patriae &amp; pacis restitutor,</hi> that is, The Father of his Countrey, and the restorer of peace; because that Kingdome being well neere torne in peeces with civill Warres, and made a prey to forreigne foes, was by his provident wisdom, and valour, acquitted in it selfe, and hostile strangers expelled: the which he principally effected by condiscending to tollerate them of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Religion, to that which was openly professed.</p>
            <p>Questionlesse (dread Soveraigne) the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> through the cruell persecution of Catholiques, hath beene almost odious to all Christian Princes and Nations, Trade and traffique is exceedingly decayed, Wars and blood have seldome ceased, subsidies and taxes never so many, discontented minds innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; All which your Princely Majesties connivance to your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65148:3"/>
humble suppliants the afflicted Catholiques will easily redresse, especially at this your Highnesse first ingresse. <hi>Si loquaris eis verba levia, erunt tibi servi cunctis diebus,</hi> If you speake comfortable words unto them, or if you hearken unto them in this thing they will be servants unto you, or they will serve you all their dayes. For enlargement after affliction resembleth a pleasant gale after a vehement tempest, And a benefit in distresse doubleth the value thereof.</p>
            <p>How gratefull will it bee to all Christian Princes abroad, and honourable unto your Majesty, to understand how Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> severity is changed into your royall clemency, and that the lenity of a man hath reedified what the mis-informed anger of a woman destroyed? That the Lyon rampant is passant, whereas the passant had beene rampant? how acceptable shall your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be to all Catholique Princes, and Countries, who are now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most abhorred of all, when they shall perceive your Highnesse prepareth not Pikes, or Prisons for the professors of their Faith, but permitteth them Temples, and Altars for the use of their Religion? Then shall we see with our eyes, and touch with our fingers that benediction of <hi>Isaiah, Ch.</hi> 14. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. in this Land, that swords are turned into mattocks or ploughes, and launces into sythes; And all Nations admiring us will say, <hi>Hi sunt semem cui be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedixit Dominus</hi> (that is) these are the seed whom the Lord hath blessed.</p>
            <p>We request no more favour at your Graces hands, then that we may securely believe, and professe that Catholique Religion which all your happy predecessors professed from <hi>Donaldus</hi> the first unto your late blessed Mother martyred. A Religion venerable for antiquity, majesticall for amplitude, constant for continuance, irreprehensible for doctrine, inducing to all kind of vertue, and piety, diswading from all sinne, and wickednesse. A Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by all primitive Pastors, established by all Oecumenicall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65148:4"/>
Councells, upholden by ancient Doctors, maintained by the first and best Christian Emperors, recorded (almost alone) in all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Histories, sealed with the bloud of millions of Martyrs, adorned with vertues of so many Confessors, beautified with the purity of thousands of virgins, so conformable unto naturall sense and reason, and finally so agreeable unto the Text of Gods sacred Word and Gospell. The free use of this Religion we request if not in publique Churches at least in private Houses, if not with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, at least with tolleration without molestation: assuring your Grace that howsoever some <hi>Protestants,</hi> or <hi>Puritans</hi> incited by morall honesty of life, or innated instinct of nature, or for feare of some temporall punishment, pretend obedience unto your Highnesse Lawes, yet certainly the only Catholiques for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake observe them. For they defending, that Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and statutes oblige no subjects under the penalty of sin, will have lesse care in conscience to transgresse them, then those who are principally tormented with the guilt of sin. But Catholikes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing merit in obeying and immerit in transgressing the Lawes of their Soveraignes cannot but in soule be grievously tortured with the least violation, or prevarication thereof.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (most mercifull Prince) we your long afflicted Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in all dutifull subjection protest before the Majesty of God, and all his holy Angells, as loyall obedience, and immaculate alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance unto your Grace, as ever did subjects in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> unto your Highnesse progenitors; And intend as sincerely with our goods, and lives to serve you, as ever did the loyallest <hi>Israelites</hi> King <hi>David,</hi> or the trustiest <hi>Legions,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>
            <p>And thus expecting your Majesties accustomed favour, and gracious bounty, we rest,</p>

            <p>MAy it please Your Majestie, I have beene too long silent, and I am afraid, by my silence I have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the duty of the place it hath pleased God to call me unto, and your Majestie to place me in: And now I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave leave that I may discharge my conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and my duty to Your Majesty: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beseech you Sir to give me leave freely to deliver myselfe, and then let your Majesty do with me what You please. Your Majesty hath propounded a tolleration of religion. I beseech You Sir, take into Your considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Your act is, what the consequence may be: By Your act You labour to set up that most damnable and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the whore of Babylon. How hatefull will it be to God, and grievous to Your good Subjects, (the true Professors of the Gospell) that Your Majesty, who hath often disputed and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly written against those wicked heresies, should now shew Your Selfe a Patron of those doctrines, which Your Pen hath told the world, and Your conscience tels Your Selfe, are superstitious, idolatrous and detestable?</p>
