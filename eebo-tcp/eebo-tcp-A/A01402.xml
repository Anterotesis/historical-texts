         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Affinity doth sometimes shew a catalogue
of kinsmen, but a blank of friends. For it is
not the similitude of titles or names, but
the resemblance of like true and tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

right, and naturall affinity consists.</p>
               <p>Affinity of faire words and false hearts, are
like <hi>Tantalus</hi> his apples, they are euer
hanging round about him, but he may die
for hunger, before he shall taste them. Or
they are like the apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that are
faire without, and dust within. Good for

who would, but cannot feed vpon them.</p>
               <p>Affinity is pleased, when the children and

but if vngracious, they are more

               <p>Affinity with needy and penurious friends,
is like a stemme, that hath many suckers or
vnder-plants; which are still drawing the
iuyce away from the great and maine root,
but themselues neuer bring forth a handful
of fruit.</p>
               <p>Affinity hath that priuiledge, that in lordly
houses, and of inheritors, there ought to
be the haunts of brothers, cosins, nephews,
vnckles, and all other of his kin; bearing
good will to their affaires, &amp; supporting
their necessities: in such wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there are some brothers, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,
and nephewes so tedious in speech, so
importunate in visiting, and so without

               <p>Affinity makes men presume in offences:
but heere lies the danger, when kinsmen
<pb facs="tcp:2948:6"/>
fall out indeed, they are at deadly food,
and commonly irreconcileable: therefore
a care must be had of the occasion, and a

               <p>Affinity setteth whole families many times

               <p>Anger bringeth hastie spirits in danger of

if it be too late, it is subiect to derision.</p>
               <p>Anger and excesse of meates, are great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to health. For meats doe corrupt the
humors, and anger consumeth the bones:
so that if men did not eate ouermuch, and
would not be ouer-angry, there should be
little cause to be sick, and much lesse of
whom to complaine. For the whips that
do most scourge our miserable life, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
excesse, and deepe anger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:7"/>
Anger, made great <hi>Alexander</hi> (like the least
part of himselfe) kill his minionized friend
<hi>Clytus:</hi> for, had it been drunkennesse, hee
would haue tapt out his hart bloud before
he heard him speake: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drunkennesse is
an afternoones madnesse, and can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
aduisedly. But it was bold, through
friendly reprofe from <hi>Clytus,</hi> stird <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
to ire; ire increasing by exasperation,
became furie; furie enflamed by the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
of desperate rage, could not be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
but with the life-bloud as it were of
his own (or one he lou'd as his own) hart.
Whereupon ensued too late repentance;
which grew to such excesse of sorrow, as
diuided the King (as mad) from himselfe;
and almost life from the King; who would
haue made his proper hands reuenge vpon
himselfe that improper act, had not his
friends watchfull care matched his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
carelesnesse.</p>
               <p>Anger makes men sad, melancholy, heauy,
sorowfull, and of an euill colour: whereas
those that be mery &amp; glad, be alwaies fat,
whole, and well coloured: so that without
comparison, there be more which growe
sick by anger they entertaine, then of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2948:7"/>
meates they feed vpon.</p>
               <p>Anger must not reuenge euery iniurie; for
so shall a man neuer want worke, neuer
want woe, but shall put his peace and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
in the power of euery enemy, vassal,
or boy. He that wil goe to law vpon euery
wrong, shal sildom gaine either credite or
coine by the bargaine. After he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
his rest, imployd his cogitation,
spent his time, mony, friends and paine,
turnd slaue to his Lawyer, and his owne
passion to haue his will on his aduersary,
hee shall be a great looser by such a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Hee that will liue in the world and put vp
no iniuries, is like him that sits and fights
with a hiue of Bees: hee may crush, &amp; kill
many of them, but were much better to let
them alone. For he shall be sure to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
stung, in body or minde, in goods
or good name.</p>
               <p>Anger of a Superiour prouoked by iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
may with conscience and credite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to moderate castigation: but must
take heed of tormenting, least the offender
inforced to repell outrage and violence,
returne a mischiefe in his owne defence:
<pb facs="tcp:2948:8"/>
or at lest discredite his Superiour by an
out-cry or vproare, if he can do no more.</p>
               <p>Anger must needs be auoided in officers of
authoritie. For they ought to be honest in
their liues, vpright in iustice, patient in
iniuries, measured in their speech, iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that they commaund, righteous in
iudgement, and pittifull in execution.</p>
               <p>Anger is many times so beastly, that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
or ministers of iustice, doe disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
misuse, shame and despise such as
come to audience: so that the sorowfull
sutor doth more feele a rough word they
speake, then the iustice they dilate.</p>
               <p>Anger is no other thing but an inflamation
of the bloud, as <hi>Aristides</hi> saith, and an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the hart. <hi>Possidoniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

caused of the fume of the gall, &amp; the heat
of the heart. And <hi>Macrobius</hi> saith, that
anger groweth of some occasion, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinesse
of euill condition.</p>
               <p>Anger hath certaine priuiledges, or if you
will, notes of discouery: not to belieue
our friends, to be rash in attempts, to haue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2948:8"/>
the cheekes inflamed, to vse quicknesse
with the hands, to haue an vnbrideled
tongue, to be fumish and ouerthwart for
small causes, and to admit of no reason.</p>
               <p>Anger put vs to the triall of reason, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wee differ from beasts. For they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

               <p>Anger not onely transformes vs into fooles,
but also makes vs to bee abhorred of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Anger is sometimes a touchstone of vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:

               <p>ATheisme maketh men worse then
beasts, or diuels. For they belieue &amp;
tremble, when men neither feare God, nor
the diuell, and therefore deserue a double
hell.</p>
               <p>Atheisme maketh Witches and Coniurers
hells agents; and he that seeketh to them
for help, goeth to the diuell by atturny.</p>
               <p>Atheisme bringeth men to disobedience:
for they are neither comforted with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
from God, nor terrified with the
punishments from hell; whereas yet the
Oxe yeelds his necke to the yoke, the
hound is at commaund of the huntsman,
and the hawke stoopes down to the lure.</p>
               <p>Atheisme and blasphemy are the high-way
to hell, and maketh lies and stabs agents
for the gallowes.</p>
               <p>Atheisme maketh plenty of oathes, and hee
that trusts them, is like him, which talks
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2948:9"/>
to the winde, and may haue aire for his
answere.</p>
               <p>Atheisme is the studie of the damned, and
the diuell is author of the doctrine: for
although men belieue there is no God, &amp;
so by consequence no diuell: yet therein is
the cunning of the diuel more apparant, to
harden their harts against the truth.</p>
               <p>Atheisme is disputable, whether it proceed
from pride or ignorance: for although
Idolaters are not properly called Atheists,
because they worship a dietie in the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
deceit of representments; yet was
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> host destroied for hardnesse of
hart, &amp; contempt of religion. So we may
say of the worlds inundation, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               </p>
               <p>Atheisme made the Giants war against the

               <p>Atheisme can yeeld neither reason for the

for if there be no world after death, nor
other life to be expected, how miserable
is man to endure affliction, &amp; how wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

               <p>Beauty in a foole is a disgrace to nature;
and for an old man to dote on a faire face,
is a discredite to wisedome. For a gray

               <p>Beauty in a woman that is honest and not
proud, is like faire weather in haruest, both
to comfort and profit.</p>
               <p>Beauty of nature is vertue, and the due of

               <p>Beauty blinds a vaine eye, musick drownes

grace doth blesse an humble soule.</p>
               <p>Beauty is the witch of nature, as gold is the
god of the world: so that a woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beauty hath few followers, as a man
without money hath few friends.</p>
               <p>Beauty is much blemished, when a vvoman
wanteth her teeth, and a man his beard:
but vertue in the one, and wisedom in the
other, ouercommeth natures imperfection
and defects.</p>
               <p>Beauty that is painted, resembles an idole,
and hee that worshippeth it is an idolater.
For as the one is made artificiall to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2948:10"/>
of the deitie: so the other is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by cunning to the disgrace of nature.</p>
               <p>Beauty that breedeth loue is the forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of reason, and their wits are troubled
with the studie of idlenes.</p>
               <p>Beauty in a strumpet, is a faire ripened fruit
to please the eye, but if it be rotten at the
hart, it cannot relish the taste.</p>
               <p>Beauty of women ouercomes the weaknes
of husbands; whereupon <hi>Themistocles</hi> son
merily vpon a day brake out into this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
speech, touching his mothers power in
the state; What I will, my mother will,
what my mother will, <hi>Themistocles</hi> vvill,
and what <hi>Themistocles</hi> will, the people of
Athens will.</p>
               <p>Beauty is one of the three things, that alters
the condition and nature of man: for <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
obserued, that pride, women, and
wine, ouercame all the world.</p>
               <p>Beauty of <hi>Apame</hi> in <hi>Esdras,</hi> ouerawed <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
greatnes. For as hee tooke her in his
armes to gaze vpon, shee would take the
crown off his head to play withall: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
putting it on her owne, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
on his.</p>
               <p>Beauty is held a diuine grace, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:2948:11"/>
ancient Phylosophers much esteemed. For
<hi>Socrates</hi> named it the tyrant of short time:
<hi>Plato</hi> a priuiledge of nature: <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
a silent deceit: <hi>Theocrites,</hi> a delightful
hurt: <hi>Carneades,</hi> a solitarie kingdom: <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi>
said nothing was more gratefull:
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> a tongue-tied eloquence: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
the glory of nature: and <hi>Ouid,</hi> a grace
of God.</p>
               <p>Beauty of the world pleaseth the eye of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but the contemplation of heauen
rauisheth the soules of the Elect: so that
there is great difference in outward and
spirituall beauty.</p>
               <p>Beauty and comlinesse euen make beasts
proud: for when a horse is young, vvell
shaped, perfectly managed, and richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned,
he is as proud of his own beauty:
as his master, that hath him to serue his
turne.</p>
               <p>Beauty of a new house may consist in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
building, &amp; faile in seruiceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance:
when an old Castell is stronger
for defence, and will endure to the owners
profit.</p>
               <p>Beauty of the proudest is momentary: for
age &amp; sicknes are her enemies, that many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2948:11"/>
times they preuent her ostentation with
vntimely accidents.</p>
               <p>Beauty sooner ouercommeth old men, then
enflameth youth: for old wood doth soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
burne then greene sticks. But then it is
strange, how ridiculous they make their
grauity, which should rather be imploied
to study in bookes for wisedome, then
looke on babies for recreation.</p>
               <p>Beauty of a curtisan is a meere trap to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
one, and a worse danger: for the one
peraduenture catcheth but our goods, or
bodies; but the other rauisheth both our
senses and harts.</p>
               <p>Beauty is a very <hi>Lamia</hi> of wit: for <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratius,
Nigidius,</hi> and <hi>Ouid</hi> writ many
bookes of the remidies of loue, and vsed
none themselues. So they all three died,
persecuted, and banished, not for those
offences they committed in <hi>Rome,</hi> but for
the loues they attempted in <hi>Capua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beauty of curtizans cannot be auoided, but
by flying the conuersation, and eschewing
the occasion: for in causes of loue; wee

               <l>The hand of Grace to pay kind Natures debt.</l>
               <p>BEnefits without all exaction require all
thankfulnesse: we must therefore blesse
God for his bounty; be ioyfull in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and faithfull in our loue toward him
for both.</p>
               <p>Benefits haue sometimes a taste of bribery,
and there is a fault both in the giuer &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer;
if honour be thereby purchased.</p>
               <p>Benefits of magnificence are not measured
by the smal desert of the receiuer, but the
noble bounty and disposition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder:
so <hi>Alexander</hi> giuing a citie to an
inferior person, who thought it ouermuch
for his merit, answered him, that though
it was too much for him to receiue, it was
not too much for <hi>Alexander</hi> to giue.</p>
               <p>Benefits growe weary euen in common pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
when men bee ingratefull: but to
make comparisons for good turnes, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
an euerlasting hatred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:2948:13"/>
Benefits that are weake make a mans tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
greeuous, and when they seem wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
perforce, they lose a grace in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation;
whereas a timely reward is like
raine to a barren land, or a pleasant shewer
in a distempered drought.</p>
               <p>Benefits haue an excellent sound in their sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
&amp; <hi>Etimologie:</hi> for being deriued
of <hi>bene-faciens,</hi> or doing well, they must
needs do well, that bestow good turnes, as
they doe not amisse, that deserue them.</p>
               <p>Benefits makes beasts remember their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors:
For in the story of <hi>Andronicus</hi>
the slaue, when he was to be cast into the
Lions denne at Rome, the principall and
strongest amongst them, not onely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from hurting him himselfe, but
kept others apart from any outrage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. And this was the cause; this
Lion he had healed long before in <hi>Affrica,</hi>
when he ran from his M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. and hid himselfe
in his caue, which now remembred him in
requital in Rome, when he was there to be
deuoured. The story is in <hi>Aulus Gelius,</hi> and
enlarged by <hi>Gueuara</hi> in his Epistles.</p>
               <p>Benefits bestowd without desert shew some
want of iudgement, but receiued without
<pb facs="tcp:2948:14"/>
requitall, or thankfulnesse, absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
an vnmannerly and ill conditioned
man.</p>
               <p>Benefits in time are the true blessings of
friendship, otherwise, they may come
when wee need them not, and so lose the
grace of acceptation: or too too late, and
so lose the life of their effects: thus an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frost is ill for fruit, and great raine noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
in haruest.</p>
               <p>Benefits from God are blessednesse in this
life, and eternitie hereafter; which vvho
will attaine to, must giue much, take little,
seeke nothing, and be thankfull whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
falls out.</p>
               <p>Benefits from the suns light are not helpfull
to the blind, &amp; litle profiteth riches where
the miser is: we must therefore do good,
while we liue, &amp; bestowe our good, where
we may doe good.</p>
               <p>Benefits of good are quickly forgotten, and
nature is corrupted, where the drosse of
the earth drawes a man to the diuell.</p>
               <p>Benefits sometimes make a man proud and
elated, when a man requited for a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
supposeth by and by his owne worth
extraordinarie; and so either vilipendeth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2948:14"/>
the recompence, or esteemeth better of
himselfe, then he deserueth.</p>
               <p>Benefits after death makes the graue thank
a man for his bountie, and he that is mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in life is a steward for hell.</p>
               <p>Benefits receiued for flattery, are worse
then punishments suffered for truth.</p>
               <p>Benefits are excellent trialls of mens dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
for he that taketh in worth a smal
reward, shall bee sure of a greater: but
hee that growes proud of a great one,
shall want a small one; and hee that cares
for none at all, meanes neuer to impart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to others.</p>
               <p>Benefits wherein Courtiers reioyce, are as
they are bound to serue Princes, they haue
licence to craue of them: as they endure
many encombrances, so they hope for
great preferment: as they toile in many
iourneys, so they participate of diuerse
pleasures: as they endure night watches,
they are glad of daily newes: as they spend
their owne substance, so they supply their
home necessities: and as they wearie out
their toilsome bodies, so they recreate
their disquieted mindes, and at last accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their degrees growe forward to
preferment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:15"/>
Benefits multiplied to temporall prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
&amp; loued after with continuall greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
shew some token of following mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap.</p>
               <p>Benefits tie vs to obseruation, and keepe
an honest man from speaking his minde:
so somtimes vertue is betraied to wealth,
and conscience made a slaue to respect.</p>

               <p>COuetousnesse maketh rich heires for a
time, but he that is blest of GOD, is
happy in his posteritie for euer.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes is a spirituall idolatry, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
misery, a rich mans beggery, a wise
mans mockery, a proud mans theeuery, a
poore mans tyranny, a great mans infamy,
and a meane mans disquiet.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes eateth vp the beauty of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
the honor of a kingdome, the

               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:2948:15"/>
Couetousnesse fills the Vsurers chest vvith
trash, the poore mans eyes with teares, the
good mans eares with wroth, the mouth
of the distressed with curses, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
hands with soules.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse is base in a King, vncomely
in a Court, dishonourable in a Captaine,
prophane in a Churchman, vnnaturall in a
whore, miserable in a Gentileman, vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
in a foole, and dangerous in a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
himselfe.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse is such an enemie to the
magnificence of Princes, that <hi>Titus</hi> the
Emperous vvas vvont to say, he had lost
that time, vvherein he did not some good
turne, or bestowed a reward.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse is so great an enemie to
the happinesse of life, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
cryed out, there vvas nor life, nor delight
in life, but to be liberall, and to requite
good turnes.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes is so contrary to the nature of
a noble &amp; valiant Captaine, that <hi>Theopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
the Thebane gaue his shooes off his

buy bread, saying plainly, thogh I haue no
mony, it is better that I goe barefoot, then
<pb facs="tcp:2948:16"/>
thou an hungred.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse is an enemy to charitie, the
inuenter of vsury, the plotter of misery,
and the breach of amity.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse feedes vpon prodigalitie,
liues in penury, delights in scarsitie, and
dies in misery.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse makes the whores spring,
and the bawds haruest, the vsurers Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,

               <p>Couetousnesse makes the Lawyer vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable,
the Iudge vncharitable, the
theefe vngracious, and the hangman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes made <hi>Laban</hi> a deceiuer, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi>

               <p>Couetousnes is the roote of all euill.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes should be so far from the hart
of Kings, that they must not onely abhor
it in others, but not practise it themselues.
For thus one way <hi>Galba</hi> lost his life and
Empire; and another way <hi>Dionisius</hi> the
tyrant reprehended his sonne for keeping
certaine iewels hee had: saying, Sonne, I
gaue thee these iewels to bestowe, and not

               <p>Couetousnes is contrary to all other vices,
for euery other vicious man hath some tast
in his sinnes, &amp; intemperate humors: but
the most vnfortunate couetous niggard is
tormented with that, which others doe
possesse, &amp; takes no comfort in that, which
he hath himselfe.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse is euer accompanied vvith

cary away his mills, the cattell eate vp his

the hunters breake his fences, the thieues
rob his treasure, &amp; the family spends more
then he is able to maintaine.</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse is a wicked and secret thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie:
for how euer a miser keepeth his
goods from others, he robbeth nature of
her blessings, and debarreth himselfe euen
of necessary substance.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes seeketh euer to hoord vp: wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
that no man craue of him: hideth
his head from spending: keepeth his hands
from giuing: dares not stirre out of dores,
nor cannot sleepe for disquieting himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:2948:17"/>
with mistrust and despight.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes is so terrible an enemy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,
that no honest man will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him, no man will talke, no man
will accompany, no man giueth any thing,
no man enters his doores, neither will any
man fetch fire at his house. For who will
hope to receiue good from him, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
afforded to doe himselfe any?</p>
               <p>Couetousnesse keepeth the heart in fear, the
minde in care, the body in trauaile, and
the soule in sinne.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes makes the woe of nature, the
want of rest, the wonder of reason, and
the way of hell.</p>
               <p>Couetousnes debarreth the possessors from
all loue and friendship: for who will be a
friend to him, that is an enemy to himself?
who will remedy his necersity, that neuer
succoured others? who wil send him a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that neuer gaue an almes? who will
succour him, that suffered others to starue?
who will giue him wood, that warmes
himselfe with straw? who will lend him

nay, who will wish him well, to vvhom
God hath threatned to do vengeance.</p>

Couetousnes is worse, then honest pouerty:

               <p>Cruelty and pride are sometimes compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which make rash &amp; bloudy officers:

               <p>Cruelty and fire haue both one condition:

               <p>Cruelty offereth wrong and reuengeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury;

               <p>Cruelty is the effect of rage and madnesse,

               <p>Cruelty and Enuy many times are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
especially in old women, who past
the world themselues, speake ill of al spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
exercises for vanities, because they
cannot bee agents in the businesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>Crueltie keepeth men from all assurance or
hope. For when a man shall vse crueltie
for charitie, which in this world in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and loue to God hee oweth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how can he expect any fauour in the
world to come of his heauenly father?</p>
               <p>Cruelty is euer accompanied with forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of Christian dutie; when furious &amp;
firie Iudges execute the lawes extremity,
whereas true iustice is full of humanity, &amp;
a noble minde replenished with pitie.</p>
               <p>Cruelty possessing the heart of the proud,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2948:19"/>
makes pouerty be put to the height of her
patience.</p>
               <p>Cruelty in men of power without mercy, in
punishing the poore distressed creature,
pulls down more mercilesse plagues from
the mighty Creator, vpon the head of the
oppressor.</p>
               <p>Cruelty makes a Tyrants frownes to bee
feared, when the threats of a coward are
smally regarded.</p>
               <p>Cruelty makes the crying of children pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the teares of the aged lamentable, the
complaint of the orphan miserable, the
wringing of the widowes hands wofull,
and the confusion of a Common-wealth
execrable.</p>
               <p>Cruelty is seene both in fire and water,
which haue their force and course to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
strong holds: yet when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
they destroy one another.</p>
               <p>Cruelty breedes curses, when a man remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the marke of his neighbours land;
how then can he think to be blessed, when
hee would wring him out of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
               <p>Cruell hearts are more harder then stones:
for they are pierced with drops of water,
<pb facs="tcp:2948:20"/>
when the other are not moued vvith the

               <p>Curtesy sheweth, that a Gent: is of good

his own do serue him, wherupon curtesy &amp;
friendly behauiour is more honor to him
that vseth it, then to whom it is done.</p>
               <p>Curtesie, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> is vnited to
magnanimitie, and then it consisteth in
three speciall things; salutations of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
relieuing the oppressed, and kinde v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

               <p>Curtesy sometimes leadeth a man to pietie:

when God called him to account, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer

               <p>Curtesie and kindnesse is naturally inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

               <p>The Courtier that is all for shew and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
is the onely professor of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
master of curtesie, vaine promiser, idle
protester, seruant of folly, and scholler of
deceit: for in one word; he neither perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2948:21"/>
what hee commonly sweares, nor
remembers in absence, what hee hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
protested: so that his oaths and
words are like smoake and aire: and his
deeds and actions meerly shadowes, and
farre from substance.</p>
               <p>The fantastick courtier is an antick inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of fashions, and so subiect to newfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes,
that ere a sute of apparell is worne
on his backe, hee is deuising another to
please with varietie.</p>
               <p>A courtier is not a name incident to euery
one that followes the remooues: for so
you shall haue many sluttish groomes, and
slouenly vnder-seruants: but is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat
to such, as either are voluntary for
the Kings honour, or their owne prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
or in place of eminence, fit to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on men and women of Honor.</p>
               <p>A courtier is sometime taunted with the
tearme of effeminate, and carpet Knight,
because they know not how to tread, but
on rushes of a chamber; nor where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
themselues, but on a beds side, or
wanton places of rest.</p>
               <p>A courtier must needs be hansome in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell;
neither ouer-garish, nor ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine:
<pb facs="tcp:2948:22"/>
but orderly comely, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
fashionable, according to some
priuat occasions, or publique solemnities.</p>
               <p>A Courtier must be seruiceable to Ladies &amp;
women of Honour, dutifull to high offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
gracefull amongst Councellers, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
amongst equalls, affable to inferiors,
and curteous to all.</p>
               <p>A courtier depending on a faction in pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
is like a man that laggeth on a cart
going vp an hill; which if hee hold fast,
will in time draw him vp with the same:
but if it roule downe the hill, hee must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let goe his hold, or sinke to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
with it.</p>
               <p>A courtier hoping for preferment by order
of seruice, must not onely giue attendance
accordingly, but endure with a great deale
of patience; yea somtime with despight, to
see an inferior person preferd before him.</p>
               <p>A courtier is sometimes terrified with
wants, and losses of time: for wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
say, A young courtier, and old beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
therefore it is wisedome to preuent
the worst, and policie to prouide before
wants knock at the dore indeed.</p>
               <p>The meaner courtiers life may many times
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2948:22"/>
be resembled to Humble-bees, which flie
abroad the pleasant fields all day, and
then retire to a cowshard at night: so
they frequent the pallace, and sometimes
are in presence of the King; but how they
lie and rest in their lodging, it is pittiful to
relate, and barnes &amp; stables are good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
places.</p>
               <p>Courtiers are bad pay-masters; and vvhen
the money is once in their purses, it is
hardly got out againe. For how euer they
sweare and protest, they dispence with the
time, &amp; make their creditors attend their
leisure.</p>
               <p>A Courtiers life is as bad as the Merchants:
for he trauels and leaues his wife at home,
longing for the end of a progresse; and
this takes a long iorney, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
when he would: in both, discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
doth many times diminish loue; and
while their husbands are troubled with
the affaires of the world, their wiues are
delighted with the pleasures of their bed.</p>
               <p>A courtier scorneth to be counted vnciuill;
yet esteemeth it a grace to bee braue and
high minded: so that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pride is in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
men may be vicious, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> familiarity
<pb facs="tcp:2948:23"/>
breeds contempt, it is an error to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
thus are Courtiers the corrupters of
vertue, and mock-apes of time.</p>
               <p>Courtiers are companions of souldiers: &amp;
and how-euer they are curious and dainty
in the pallace, they are noble and brauely
disposed in the field.</p>
               <p>Courtiers are companions with Schollers:
for without learning &amp; obseruation, they
cannot practice humanitie and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
and vnlesse they study and read hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
they will faile in discourse &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,
the principall end of a courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
life.</p>
               <p>A Courtier &amp; Citizen are many times eye-sores
to one another: &amp; so foppish vve are
by custome, that we thinke derision a kind
of vertue. Thus when a Gentleman repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
his seruant, hee threatens him with
playing the merchant with him: &amp; when
the trades man vpbraides his, he saies, he
hath serud him like a gentleman. So fares
it with the women; She is but a Lawyers
Lady saith the Citizen: she is but a Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Lady saith the Lawyer. Again, These
Merchants are cutthroats, cryes the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier:
These Courtiers are cosoners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines

               <p>Courtiers of the vainer sort, are puzzeld in

water, when they eate themselues high

so they admonish vs, how to liue, what to

               <p>Clergy men are sometimes so corrupted,

&amp; may not preach out of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
because they goe visitations; nor
cannot preach at others times, because

disquieting the auditory.</p>
               <p>Clergie men, if they be ambitiously bent,
beeing once beneficed are neuer conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:

a staire of degrees, which leadeth to a
roome, into which they must goe: and
thus they ascend higher &amp; higher, as they
still sue for better place and better.</p>
               <p>Clergy men of the common sort, suppose
they liue sufficiently religious, if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:2948:24"/>
Clergy men, that liue religiously according
to their profession, are worthy of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

that cures the body, must haue a fee, surely
he, that saueth the soule, deserues a reward.</p>
               <p>Clergy men are some way resembled to
burning tapers, who consume themselues
to light &amp; pleasure others: so should they
weary themselues, and tire out both body

               <p>Clergy men haue beene and are many times

               <p>Clergy men discredite their profession, and
and make euen rascalls vilipend it, when
they see them faile both in life and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
Nay, vvhen they giue ill example

an extreame enmity: for they were buried
with their backs turned one against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
<pb facs="tcp:2948:36"/>
so that, if in life they were enemies,
after death they scarce remained friends.</p>
               <p>Death amongst diuerse Nations had as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
entertainements. For the <hi>Hircanes</hi>
washed their dead friends bodies vvith
wine, and afterward annointed them with
oyle, which they kept to eate and drinke.
The <hi>Massagetes</hi> drew forth the bloud, and
did drinke it, burying the bodies. The
<hi>Caspians</hi> burnt the bodies to ashes, which
they did afterwards drinke in wine; so
that the entrailes of the liuing, was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher

no man, without one aliue were ioyned
with him; which if any friend denied, a

And so in many other Nations,
according to the seuerall conditions of
life, they had as many deuises of buriall.
Yet death is but the priuation of life in all.</p>
               <p>Death of good children woundeth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

is the woe and misery of marriage; so that
in such a case, it were better to be honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

liue to be continually tormented.</p>
               <p>Death eternall, and life abreuiated, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <p>Death makes an end of all liuing creatures,

Death is so much the more grieuous to the
rich, by how much they made more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

bid his soule to liue at rest, what a terror is
it to haue it taken from him that night?
But life is irksome to the miserable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot liue, as they should, nor
die when they would.</p>
               <p>Death of sutes proceeds from denialls; and

Ministers: the one receiues money

or by corrupt examples of their

               <p>Death is often wrought by meere conceit
of a faint heart, as the fight of a drawn

               <p>Death is sweet to a quiet conscience, when

               <p>Death that is honorable, is farre to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

life that is vntainted, cannot but end with
a glorious death: in both, necessity must

               <p>Diseases are a bridle to the flesh, and pull

Diseases are not easily and lightly cured,
when the patient is either inordinate or
vnrulie, the Physitian ignorant, or vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
and the medicine ill compounded,
or vntimely.</p>
               <p>Diseases that continue are grieuous to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:

               <p>Diseases are not cured in one body so soone

preuenteth that distemprature, which

               <p>Diseases of cruelty, are the gowt, collick,
toothach, stone, and strangury; but of

               <p>Diseases are bred by infectious aire, as a

               <p>Diseases of the minde are bred by opinion,
which beguiles vs with a false taste of true

               <p>Diseases and wounds are of one nature, &amp;
both resemble the conditions of sin: for

               <p>Drunkennesse is many times cause of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

diuerted him from offending. But he was

               <p>Drunkennesse misconstrueth kindnes, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh

forsweareth his owne senses.</p>
               <p>Drunkards sinne against God, who forbids
the abuse of his good creatures; against
the poore, that want them for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessary

which they fill with manifold diseases;
against their own soules, which they defile
with their swinish sinnes; against their
whole persons, which they turne out of
men into beasts; and against their eternal
saluation (if they repent not) and forsake

in a lasciuious citie; yet excused the
same, and hoped of reformation of all, till
it came to drunkennesse. For when he was
told of he was fallen into this filthie vice

               <p>ELoquence is the beauty of learning, if it
proceed from wisedome; and in the eare
of vertue truth is the best Orator.</p>
               <p>Eloquence that ouerthroweth the speaker,
is as bad as an ill perfume, that poisons
the braine.</p>
               <p>Eloquence with beauty, maketh nature
gracious, and wit honourable.</p>
               <p>Eloquence of heathen men, hath corrupted
the heart of christians; but venomous is
that breath, that poisoneth men in their
soules.</p>
               <p>Eloquence of liuely words cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in dead lines &amp; letters: for he that
giues, what he sales in writing, binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2948:42"/>
to lose his credit.</p>
               <p>Eloquence was so forcible in <hi>Demosthenes,</hi>
that he had many times mony offered him
to hold his peace, when other men lookt
for great rewards to debate the matter.</p>
               <p>Eloquence was so much laboured amongst
the Philosophers, and Orators of <hi>Athens,</hi>
that <hi>Damonidas</hi> florishing in the time of
<hi>Pisistratus</hi> the tyrant, on a day he said vnto
the Senate of <hi>Athens,</hi> All men may freelie
come &amp; speak with me in their affaires, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Philosopher <hi>Damonidas;</hi> who
may write vnto me, but not come &amp; talke
with me: for he holdeth such efficacy in his
words, that he perswadeth to what he wil.</p>
               <p>Eloquence is rather the gift of God, then
the perfection of learning: for many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men haue attaind to great knowledge,
who for want of elocution, haue lost their
honors, and memorable renowne.</p>
               <p>Eloquence applyed to purpose containeth
great efficacy, which king <hi>Philip, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
father knew very wel: for besieging a
certaine citie, he came to this parlee, that if
they would suffer <hi>Theomastes</hi> to enter, and
make an Oration, he then would depart,
and raise his siege. Sure <hi>Theomastes</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:2948:43"/>
great eloquence in his words, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perswasion in his speech: for they not
onely rendred themselues, and opened
their gates, but acknowledged king <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
for their Prince, as hee did the Orator
for preuailing. Thus had eloquence more
force in words, then the King in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Eloquence hath secret enemies, Folly and
Ignorance: the one cannot vnderstand
the secret; &amp; the other cannot learne the
qualitie.</p>
               <p>Eloquence and Wisedome are not alwaies
companions: for many times a ridiculous
matter passeth in the eloquent deliuery; &amp;
weake thrusts pearcing the heart, dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

               <p>Eloquence and discretion must needes be
obserued in writing letters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and to a man delighted with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
and volubility of speech.</p>
               <p>Eloquence maketh a man desire glory, and
then he writeth with aduisement, &amp; spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
with iudgement: and as you see the
plough-man reuiew his furrow to straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
what is amisse: so must a wise man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
his writings, to make them seeme
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2948:43"/>
more meet and orderlie.</p>
               <p>Eloquence in writing a letter is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when it is pleasant to read, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
to be noted.</p>
               <p>Eloquence and honesty are sometimes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:

               <p>Eloquence is no way auaileable with God:

               <p>Folly setteth all men on worke against the

               <p>Folly speakes much, and knowes little:
reads much, vnderstands little: spends

hee must needs be little worth.</p>
               <p>Folly makes a wise man in hope of a nigh

a by-way, let him thanke himselfe, if it
prooue a wry-way.</p>
               <p>Fooles &amp; villaines are commonly exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>Folly cannot hide herselfe from discouery:
for though she apparrell herselfe neuer so
demurely, looke soberly, goe grauely, and

to no purpose, and euen in the manner of

               <p>Fortune is painted blinde, as if she saw not,

               <p>Fortune is figured naked, and cares not to

her power.</p>
               <p>Fortune resembles a woman, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

               <p>Fortune standeth on the globe of the world,
as if she commanded all like an Empresse:
and so she shewes her imperiousnes.</p>
               <p>Fortune is the fiction of idlenes, and fancie

               <p>Fortune bringeth high floods to lowe ebs,

men not to misse their passage, but take
time while time is, and the tide as it falls.</p>
               <p>Fortune is a tearme profanely abused: for
what the heathen called a deitie, as <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:50"/>
Fortune is inexorable; for she will not heare
the best prayers, nor be mooued with the
greatest teares; it is not sighes can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole

so she shewes her crueltie.</p>
               <p>Fortune flies the encounter of sury: for

               <p>Fortune maketh order out of confusion: for
as <hi>Christopherus Laucius</hi> said; Fortune is
an influence, which proceedeth from the
reuolution of the heauens; and shee, as

               <p>Friends in their absence are vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;

               <p>Friends are parted by vnkind breaches, as

               <p>Friends that are kinde, are sweet compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:

               <p>Friends that haue sound hearts, haue sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

               <p>Friendship is delicatly expounded amongst

Friends may be trusted, when they haue
beene tried; strangers when they are
known; dogges when they be muzled;
women when they be in sight; and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
when they are vnder ground.</p>
               <p>Friends are so priuiledged, that sometimes
we may labour for their good, when we
cannot speake for our own. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
there was a law amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>
much vsed, and obserued; that vpon paine
of death, none should presume to approch
the tent where the Emperour did eate and
sleepe: which yet in the time of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>relius</hi>
a certaine Greeke did infringe, and so hee
was taken and condemned to die: but the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly, spake with a loud voice: If
this man did come to sue for any thing for
himselfe, let him die; but if for his friend,
hee shall liue.</p>
               <p>Friends that are sildome seene, and much
lesse spoken and conuersant withall, are
lesse familiar, but more sure; in that they
loue not for rewards, but for vertue and
goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Friends before they make a perfect combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
must obserue these circumstances
<pb facs="tcp:2948:52"/>
If our friend be poore, we must giue him;
if he be rich, we must serue him; if hee be
fauoured, we must worship him; if hee be
wilfull, we must obey him; if he be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
wee must beare with him; if hee be
vicious, we must dissemble with him; and
if he be malicious, we must beware of him.</p>
               <p>Friends in their wants may be perilous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, &amp; in their importunities tedious.</p>
               <p>Friends that are old and acquainted, once
changed for new, make men resemble lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
children, who refuse an old angel for
a new counter; and cry to goe from their
true parents, to strange nurses.</p>
               <p>Friends are thus farre vnprofitable, that
they are the thieues of time; and come to
seeke vs, not to do, what we think good,
but to perswade vs to what they thinke
conuenient.</p>
               <p>Friends, though they be kinde, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
troublesome to suffer; as enemies
are perilous to endure.</p>
               <p>Friends remedy in aduersities, comfort in
necessities, beare with imperfections, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
transgressions, &amp; endure in troubles.</p>
               <p>Friends canot be rightly so named, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord
their persons for priuate respects,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2948:52"/>
and deny their goods vpon plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses.</p>
               <p>Friends are (in some Philosophy) denied to
be in the plurall number: for as long as a
man hath but one heart, hee can haue but
one friend: who beeing vnited in loue, are
as it were one minde and soule in two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Friends that are vnkinde, are vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but an vnquiet wife is intollerable.</p>
               <p>Friends come in at all houres, yea into all
places: for sure to whom I haue afforded
my hart, I will neuer deny him my house.</p>
               <p>Friends are priuiledged aboue kindred: for
a man may haue many kinsfolks, but few
friends: yea kindred doe daily encrease,
but a friend once lost, is hardly recouered
againe; and once dead, neuer recalled.</p>
               <p>Friends, so farre as they impouerish not our
estates by lauish expences, may command
our purses; but a great discretion must go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern
our passions. For hee cannot well be

               <p>GEnerositie is a speciall prerogatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all people. For to be descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of noble parents, is commonly a signe
of noble conditions: and as you see a faire
Diamond made more rich by Art and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belishing;
so is vertue more gracious in a
Gentleman, then in an Artificer.</p>
               <p>Generositie teacheth her possessors so to
recreate themselues, that thereof rise none
offence; neither to themselues by immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
exercise, nor to others, by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
abuses.</p>
               <p>Generositie ought to vse none but honest
recreations, performed with moderate &amp;
harmelesse cariages, in due and seasonable
times, directed to honourable and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ends.</p>
               <p>Generositie is a great helpe to perswade the
people a man is thereby more worthie to
be a Prince: but that kind of ambition is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2948:53"/>
subiect to great malice, and supplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
so that many haue lost their liues, for
feare lest their noblenesse in blood, and
good conditions should preferre them to
high and honourable places.</p>
               <p>Generositie teacheth men to be temperate
in feeding, sober in drinking, liberall in
giuing, considerat in receiuing, short in
sleeping, reposed in speech, affable in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
patient in hearing, prompt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
gentle in chastisement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne
in pardoning.</p>
               <p>Generositie teacheth men neuer to be idle,
or ill-doing; not to be a follower of wine
or women, or euery effeminate fashion;
not to brawle with any man; not to hurt
enemies, nor to be vngratefull to friends.</p>
               <p>Generositie is of so delicate a condition,
that in any matter of controuersie, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
may be admitted; but contention
vtterly condemned: for noblenesse and
despight did neuer accompany in one gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
person.</p>
               <p>Generositie maketh knights and souldiers
of so valiant a courage, noble minds, and
worthy demeanors, that they are neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with choler, but in the field against
<pb facs="tcp:2948:54"/>
enemies; nor angry with their friends, but
for desperat vices.</p>
               <p>Generosity teacheth knights and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in the time of war not to write from
their owne houses, but the campe: euerie
man in his owne ranke; the priest praieth,
the husbandman ploweth, and the knight
fighteth.</p>
               <p>Generositie doth not account him a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which is onely descended of noble
bloud, in power great, in iewels rich, in
furniture fine, in attendants braue: for all
these are found in Merchants and Iewes.
But to be a perfect Gentleman, is to bee
measured in his words, liberall in giuing,
sober in diet, honest in liuing, tender in
pardoning, and valiant in fighting.</p>
               <p>Generosity hath preheminence of Honour:
for <hi>H.</hi> 8. answered a man, that desired to be
made a gentleman, that hee could make
him a noble man, but not a gentleman.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman vvithout meanes, is a painted
bardge without oares; faire to looke on,
but there is no vse of him, neither in calm,
nor storme. While hee is tied to his post,
and stayes at home, hee either rots as hee
stands for want of rowing, or trimming;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2948:54"/>
or else takes in such soule water of euerie
vice, that floweth vnto him, as either in
short time corrupts within him, or spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sinks him.</p>
               <p>But if you vntie his rope or chaine, and lose
him from home, hee is not able to strike
one stroake towards the staires of a faire
fortune, though it be neuer so nigh him:
especially, if the least winde or tide of any
opposition be against him; but is carried
downe the streame of head-long passion,
without sterne or reason, or hand of friend
to stay or direct him. So that if some luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie
and vnlookt-for <hi>Neptune</hi> ioyne not
with <hi>Venus,</hi> to hale him in, and land him
in the lap of some lustie Lady, or rich
widow, he is driuen into some dirty ditch,
where hee rots, if not vnseene, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
yet vnpittied and vnrespected for
all his rich painting.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman without meanes, is like 2
faire house vvithout furniture, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant,
saue onely an idle house-keeper:
vvhose rearing was chargeable to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and painfull to the builder, and all
ill-bestovved, to make a mock-begger,
that hath no good morrovve for his
<pb facs="tcp:2948:55"/>
next neighbour. Who may knock, and
haue no answer; or if he enter, he may goe
into the kitchen, and be neuer the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
into the celler and be neuer the wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
vp into the chamber, and lie downe
on the floer, &amp; come out againe as much
the neere for his need, as he came in. It was
cost cast away vpon a faire fruitlesse
frame, that brings in no rent, but is stil in
reparation, or running to ruine.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman without meanes is a prettie
plant, but without rinde, without roote,
without leaues, without fruit. He is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
creature that can weare his clothes in
good fashion, if his Mercer &amp; Tayler will
trust him. Hee can borrow with as plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pittifull perswasion, and put off
payment with as pretty inuention, and
soader euery allegation, with as fast and
firme oathes as any man. His minde rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to the Court, and cloth of State,
but his horse tyres ere he comes at Court
gate. Hee salutes, and sweares as courtlie
as any man, and weares bad clothes in the
best fashion.</p>
               <p>Hee is a louing and frequent friend to his
wealthy neighbor or country-man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2948:55"/>
he meets him: and not ouermuch
reserued towards any free-hearted, and
openhanded Gentleman. Hee is of a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowly
condition, and comes to a feast (and
that with the soonest, if it be of free cost)
vpon the first inuitation: and to any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meeting (if the shot be not high, or the
guests ouer-fine) he failes not to come. He
feeds as choicely &amp; freely, drinks as sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and soundly, and talkes as boldly and
brauely as any in the roome: and yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inuited,
vpon necessary occasion to dine at
home, he can eate as moderatly, and fit as
soberly, as any other man.</p>
               <p>He shall weare a cloake, &amp; a paire of boots
as long, borrow your horse as often, and
ride him as well as the best in the towne:
and shal as respectiuely diet him, &amp; shooe
him, as if he were his owne. Hee can hold
vp the lower salt, with festiuall and timely
table talke, in competent, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sort: and (barre distinction, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
speaking) he wil ouer-argue a scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in his owne profession. Hee can hold
your cardes, or play your game; fill, and
light, &amp; taste your Tobacco with as good
iudgement as the Merchant that bought
<pb facs="tcp:2948:56"/>
it, and sold it: and if it be not of the right,
he can tell you, where you shal buy it.</p>
               <p>He can hold a trencher hansomly for neede,
vpon an extraordinarie occasion: and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a token, or message, and deliuer it, that
no man shall mend it. You shall neede no
better Intelligencer to bring home all the
newes from the Burse &amp; Poules, and other
publique places, to be repeated at dinner.
None shall sooner spy out a fit match for
your sonne, or daughter: doe your person
and state more credit, or sooner clap it vp,
vpon loane of your nagge, and reasonable
profit.</p>
               <p>Take him to a play, and trouble not his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
with the water-man, entrance, or

               <p>Yea, you shall finde him able (or forward)

or man to conclude a merry meeting,
or to set downe the conditions, place, and

               <p>You shall finde him in the Cock-pit, in the
vpper ring: he offers a <hi>Iacobin,</hi> but at next
dangerous blowe, layes halfe a crowne; if
it be sixe to one. He can mew or man your
hawke; enter &amp; traine your hound; shew
you where to hunt, when the hounds goe
counter; how to breake the fault; follow
the game; and lie, if not run, as fast as the
huntsman; who if hee call him not vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, yet of his owne accord hee will
rise before dinner.</p>
               <p>Hee layes not many wagers, but stands as
tightly on his reputation, and hath his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree
as perfect as any man; and can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
recount, what a royall house-keeper
his great grandfather was in euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
He sowes his crop, and carries in
his corne, with the best expedition. But
as he neuer lends his neighbour his teeme:
so is he, neither at season, sheep-sheere or
<pb facs="tcp:2948:57"/>
haruest, beholding to any man. His rent
to his Lord, at the due day is neuer vnpaid;
his houses are neuer in reparations; no
idlenesse or disorders are euer seene in his
seruants. He discommends the vanitie and
varietie of costly clothes, as the foxe did
the grapes. Hee railes on Vsurers, the
dearth, bribery, and corruption of the
times. He abhors Bayliffes, Sergeants and
Sheriffes. Hee hates collections for any
vses. He hunts on Sondaies, and wrangles
for tythes; yet he sildome or neuer goeth
to law with his neighbours. His fences are
so good, that no mans cattle can come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his ground: and his own are so ringed,
and yoakt, and lawde, that they neuer tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
on any other man.</p>
               <p>He is alwaies in pursute of some good wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
but scornes to make his way by base
briberie: onely the maid shall be made, by
faire promises, and kinde kisses. His own
mothers maid shall giue her word, that he
is good for propagation and breed: none
so good to plant a colony and people a
country.</p>
               <p>The dislike of his owne, inclines him to
seeke better fortunes in other countries:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2948:57"/>
and bar stormy winter, dry byscuit bread,
and cold water, no man shall trauaile a
league further. He well approues necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
warres, for those that haue bodies fit
for cold and hard beds, short commons,
and sharp swords: but onely desperation
of meanes driues himselfe to the vvarres;
yet not vnlesse hee want hart to be hangd
at home, for taking of purses. VVhich
should not seeme so, by the often quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
hee entertaines with his inferiors, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equall hazard of life and lands: saue
that onely respect of reputation, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
with-holds him, from fighting vpon
vnequall tearmes, with base companions.
And as for his betters, hee is very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and discreet in forbearing them; and
bearing their iniuries, who may be his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors.
Hee lesse feares to offend God
then his rich idols, to whose deitie he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the incense of all his indeauours: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
euer superstitiously anxious to delight
their eyes, tickle their eares, obserue their
desires, sooth their humors, second their
opinions, applaud their speeches, picke
their thanks, by finding, and aggrauating
the faults of their seruants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:58"/>
This weake &amp; worthlesse luie, must either
not liue, or lie down, or else leane to some
substantiall rich oake or other, as his sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant,
parasite, or iester; or else as his
beadesman, or bayliffe, to goe afield with
victuals to his woaders, or weeders, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke
their labours. The top of his
hope is to attaine to the chamber of some
Court-fauourite, grand Councellor, graue
Iudge, or great Officer. Where beeing
soone slypt into his satin sute, silke stock,
treble ruffe, and beauer hat; he is not long
in learning his occupation, and the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
hee is to haue, whose cause hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and whom hee admits: knowing
that the profit of his watchful prouidence
heerein, will in short time, enable him
with means, to impropriate a prety punk,
and purchase good lands.</p>
               <p>But if this, &amp; all other meanes faile, why yet
with a little labour, he would proue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
excheator, a prowling promooter, or a
good land-spaniel, or setter for a hungry
Courtier, to smell him out a thousand
pound sute, for a hundred pound profit.
But to say the truth, the onely ordinarie
vocation he is most naturally apt vnto, &amp;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2948:58"/>
hath dexteritie in; that he likes, and likes
him, that he liues by, and liues in, is the
Art of cheating.</p>
               <p>For conclusion, this beggerly Gentleman,
is too proud to be a seruingman, to poore
to be a Merchant-man, too weake to be a
husband-man, too wastfull to be a tradse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
too lazie to be an artificer, too idle
to be a scholer, too tender to be a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
and yet hath matter in him, to make
him fit for all this, with good moulding
in tract of time. For full and finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of this indigent gentleman; he
is a rationall creature, potentially apt for
any thing, but actually good for nothing.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman without manners, is like a

               <p>An vnmannerly Gentleman, is like an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parboyld
pastie of tainted venison, which
graceth the table, and pleaseth the guests,
as it comes out of the oven; but beeing
cut vp, forth-with fills their noses, and
<pb facs="tcp:2948:59"/>
offends their stomacks: so that that, which
ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> delighted their eyes, doth now loath
their appeties. It was ill imployed cost,
of pepper and salt in the seasoning, and
butter and creame in the crust. Right so,
the out-side of an vnmannerly gentleman,
seemes an obiect of worth, where hee is
vnknowne: but if you taste him, or try
him, by more neere commerce, or inward
conuersation, you shall finde him, for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
prating, for impudent lying, for
scornfull scoffing, for rude rayling, for
quaffing and quarrelling, for swaggering
and swearing, for bawdery and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
of so riotous and rotten; so contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and stinking a condition, that of all
others, you may least endure him: as the
sweetest and best meats once corrupted,
yeeld of all other, the most vnfauourie

               <p>The first sight of an vnciuill Gentleman, is
the best; the further you see him, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you like him; the neerer he comes, the

layd out on the education of so costly a

after the sedation both of forren and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick

Citie prospered, the Country thriued, and
all sorts of people thought it the greatest
glory to liue in the florishingest showe:
wherevpon it is recorded, that a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
sonne hauing been imploied in some
seruices, vvhere example had raised his
spirits to immitation, demaunded of the
King, as a recompence to be made a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
The King, neither angry nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
quickly dispatched him with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
he could not: For though Princes
can raise men to Honor, noblenesse, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and authoritie: yet lay it not in their
power to enlarge vertue, good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the renowne of ancestors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
and wherein a true Gentleman is best
known, and shines most brightly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
my friend (quoth he) with what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of prosperitie canst thou florish thy
estate? And it like your Maiestie, the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
replyed, my inheritance is raised on
the degrees of fortie pounds a yeer. Alas,
<pb facs="tcp:2948:60"/>
said the King, the times are now corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and that may keepe thee as an honest
man, but will neuer maintaine thee for a
Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Generosity disclaimeth vilenes, sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
niggardlinesse, maliciousnes, lying,
and cowardlinesse; so that in a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
though there may be found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to be reprehended, yet there ought
not to be contained any thing, worthy of
reproach and infamy.</p>
               <p>Generositie is more aduanced by noble and
vertuous auncestors, then by wealth or
inheritance: for to descend of noble
bloud, doth not onely honour vs, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokes
vs to be vertuous.</p>
               <p>Generositie doth lead vs to honour, and
teach vs to amend our estates; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie
doth tempt vs to be desperate.</p>
               <p>Generositie doth cause vs to attend and be
seruiceable to all Ladies and Gentlevvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but especially to forbeare them in
matters of contention, and with curteous
demeanor to perswade them to the right.</p>
               <p>Generositie was so esteemed amongst the
<hi>Romans,</hi> that the law <hi>Prosapia</hi> ordained,
that when contention did arise for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2948:60"/>
Consulship, then those which descended
of the <hi>Siluians, Torquatians, Fabricians</hi>
should be preferred.</p>
               <p>Generositie is an ordinance of GOD: for

               <p>Grauitie must not dally with a matter of
importance, nor encline to derision, when
a man in distresse stands at his triall for his
life.</p>
               <p>Grauitie may be dissembled by corrupt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
to the abuse of iustice, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of sutors, who haue confidence in
the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Grauitie in religious men hath a due of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
when they studie Gods glorie,
their own saluation, and the peoples edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
but to make grauitie onely a step
to vvorldly preferment, is the diuels po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
               <p>Grauitie is the fame of a Matron; the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a Bishop; the comlinesse of a
Iudge; the maiestie of a Commaunder;
the cunning of a Scholer; the hope of a
Physitian; the dignitie of a Lawyer; the
honour of a Councellor; the louelinesse
of age; and the deceit of youth.</p>
               <p>Grauitie cannot endure scurrulous foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
idle Iesters, inconsiderat talkers, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
ribaldry, wanton enterludes, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
behauiour, lasciuious demeanour,
<pb facs="tcp:2948:65"/>
and childish exercises.</p>
               <p>Grauitie sometimes couers ignorance; and
although pride may be suspected, yet it
tempers it from violence and rage.</p>
               <p>Grauitie is commonly a companion to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
for from a Countesse to a country-wench,
if she but seeme to serue God, she
will shew it in a sober looke, and decent

               <p>Grauitie keepes both men and vvomen
from outward burstings out of follie;
and indeede shadowes manie imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Grauitie is much abused, when an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer

               <p>Grauitie is assumed on a sudden in the

               <p>HOnour, that breedes forgetfulnesse of

               <p>Honour that is gracious, is gotten by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and noble merit: and is neuer at full
height, till vertue bring it to heauen.</p>
               <p>Honour in his true definition is a certaine
reuerence, which one man yeeldeth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
extraordinarily, for his vertuous
merit, and worthy desert: so that it should
not be wealth, but vertue, which should
make an honourable man.</p>
               <p>Honour is more great, that maintaineth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
then that, which obtaineth for it
selfe: as wisedome, which is imployed for
the good of the Common-wealth, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that, which aymes at a mans priuate
ends.</p>
               <p>Honour is persecuted by the enuious, riches
<pb facs="tcp:2948:66"/>
and liberalitie by the couetous, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
by the vicious: so that no man aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to honor, can behaue himselfe so wel,
but he shall be sure to be watched by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
eyes.</p>
               <p>Honour hath certaine markes of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
both in high titles of dignitie, and
many ceremonies of attendancie: and
this they receiue by imitation, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of scripture. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the friend of GOD: <hi>Moses</hi> the man
of God: <hi>Iosua</hi> the great Captaine: <hi>Gede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

               <p>Honour in some cases is inferior to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie:
for the auncestrie of bloud must
needes haue preheminence ouer a familie
newly erected. Whereupon I remember
a story of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight: who beeing
entreated to make a clowne a gentleman;
answered suddenly, hee could make him a
noble man, or person of Honour, as in
the estimation of the Common-wealth it
passed currant: but a Gentleman must
boast of his famous auncestors vertues,
and his owne worthy merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2948:66"/>
Honour without desert is like a word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
substance, sense, or wit: and both may
be incident to a foole.</p>
               <p>Honour cannot consist in riches; for so
clownes may be honourable: but in truth
there can be no true honor in the loue of
the world. For <hi>Diogenes</hi> being asked who
were the most noble; answered, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers
of riches, glory, and pleasures of
this life, and the patient endurers of the
contrary. And <hi>Socrates</hi> said, that true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
consisteth in the due temper of the
body and the minde.</p>
               <p>Honour, though it be neuer so glorious,
cannot be greater then <hi>Salamons,</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons,</hi>
then the Lillies of the field.</p>
               <p>Honour maketh worldlings happy in their
titles: but heauen is the ioy of the blessed.</p>
               <p>Honour of a Soulder consisteth rather in
pitying captiues, then subduing of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
this made <hi>Scipio</hi> so famous in <hi>Spayn,</hi>
who hauing a virgine of incomparable
beauty brought vnto him, when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
how she was betrothed to a Prince,
he not only abstained from her, as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
his owne honor, but gaue the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
which her father brought to redeeme
<pb facs="tcp:2948:67"/>
her; with as much more of his own vnto
her husband in dower.</p>
               <p>Honour is truly established, when vertue is
embraced; but both must depend vpon
graue and good actions.</p>
               <p>Honour may be graced by fortune, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
may be great: but the vertuous are
truly wise and honourable, and the godly
truely noble.</p>
               <p>Honour without desert is like a painted
post without life: or a fantasticall idol
without a spirit, or a flower without any
sent.</p>
               <p>Honor is most famous, when men are borne
of gentle parents; rise to liue in great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
die in glorious libertie; are buried
with ensignes of vallure; and leaue a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of their fames and glories to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.</p>
               <p>Honor of the world is a meer chance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
but to be truly vertuous, the gift of
God, and delight of his Saints.</p>
               <p>Honour is neuer so out of countenance, as
when men of noble eminence descend to
base actions, and practice vile conditions.</p>

               <p>Humilitie brought saluation to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,

               <p>Inuections need small oratory: for to rayle

               <p>Ignominy is no other then a feareful shame
for some base and degenerating courses
taken in our liues: as when a noble man is
auaricious, cruell, vnciuell, a receiuer of
bribes, and scornfull: a souldier to begge
or pilfer: a gentleman to proue a pandor,
and such like. In all which, the great man
must not presume on his power, nor the
meane man be desperat of his pouerty.</p>
               <p>Ignominy or reproach done to noble Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
stirre vp reuenge, and is not paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without bloud. Thus was <hi>Narsetes</hi>
reuenged on the Empresse <hi>Sophia:</hi> &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others despighted with scorn &amp; taunts,
incited to strange courses, to reintegrate
their honours. The former story is thus;
When <hi>Narsetes</hi> gouerned the Western
Prouices for the Emperor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and
had been famous for many noble exploits;
his enuiers suggested, that he ambitiously
sought the Empire: whereupon hee was
enforced to passe from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Asia;</hi>
where appearing before the Empresse <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:2948:73"/>
shee thus taunted and defamed him;
Sith thou <hi>Narsetes</hi> art lesse then a man, &amp;
halfe a woman, beeing an Eunuch, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
thee leaue the gouernment of the
Empire, and get vp to weaue, where my
maidens knit caules. Which words made
so forcible impression, that hee changed
countenance, the teares brake from his
eyes, and his choler thus vented his griefe;
<hi>Serene</hi> Princesse, I would you should cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
me as a Lady, but not defame me like
a woman: It grieues me not so much for
that you haue said, as the occasion you
haue giuen mee to make you answere; I
therefore presently depart for <hi>Italy,</hi> but to
weaue, knit, and frame such a toile, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou maist comprehend, nor thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
vndoe.</p>
               <p>Ignominy is neuer more aggrauated, then
when women are cruell, which should be
pittifull; nor more deserued, then vvhen
subiects are disloiall, who ought to be
faithfull.</p>
               <p>Ignominy is like an Adder in a path, from
whose very sight a man would start back:
but not be tainted with the poyson vpon
any condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:74"/>
Ignominy maketh taunts so fearefull, that
euen mean men haue answered great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
distastingly to saue their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

It is true great Prince said he, because
I rob but with one or two ships, I am ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
defamed; but thou that fillest the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont</hi>
with mighty nauies, art therefore a
mighty Emperour, and Monarch of the
world. Thus againe was the <hi>Lady Mary</hi>
of <hi>Padilia</hi> reproued for her ambition and
treason, when the commons reuolted in
time of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. Emperor in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
If histories deceiue vs not, saith the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<hi>Mamea</hi> was proud: <hi>Medea</hi> cruell:

read of none that hath been disloyall and
a traytresse, but your Ladiship.</p>
               <p>Ignominy is worse then blowes: for they
punish but for a time, or at most our life
time; but shame and reproach continueth
after death: yea, maketh our posterity dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable

               <p>Idlenesse againe is the sister of doltishnesse,
both enemies to Art: vvhereas exercise,
conference, &amp; experience make both arte

Idlenes is cause of lazines, diseases, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of weakenesse and great labour, and then
rest and idlenesse is a refreshing to nature,
and recouery of strength.</p>
               <p>Idlenesse worketh contraries against kinde:
for commonly idle men sleepe a daies, and
walke a nights: but woe be vnto them that

               <p>Idlenesse is called the graue of the liuing, &amp;

               <p>Idlenesse is a priuation of goodnesse, and it
is ill to doe nothing, worse to doe bad, and
worst of all neuer to repent and amend.</p>
               <p>Idlenesse maketh a foole miserable, when
trauell maketh a wise man honourable.</p>
               <p>Idle men amongst the Philosophers were
banished, the couetous hated, the traitors
hanged aliue, the vicious were buried, and
the lasciuious were whipped.</p>
               <p>Idle Bees gather no hony, and so become

               <p>Idlenes is to bee hated as vnprofitable, and
wickednes to be abhorred as damnable.</p>
               <p>Idlenesse causeth sleepe out of season, which
must be auoided: for sleepe is a kinde of
death, and therefore so much as you take
from sleepe, you adde vnto your life.</p>
               <p>Idlenesse is the mother of pouerty, the rust of
reason, the enemy of health, the spring of
malice, and the fountaine of vices: whereas
labour is the improuer of wealth, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer

               <p>Idlenes many times begets frenzy, and then

               <p>Idlenes sleepes out the morning, to the losse

               <p>Idlenes is hatefull; yet better lie still, then

whereupon <hi>Thales Milesius</hi> hath
taught vs, that the most ancient of al things
was God, for that he was alwaies: the most
beautifull thing, the world: for that it was
the worke of God: the most capable, was
place, because it comprehended all other
things; the most profitable, hope: for that
all other things gone, it onely remained;
the best thing vertue, because without her,
there could no good bee spoken off; the
most swift, the minde of man; for in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
it runneth through the world; the
most forcible, necessity, because it goes
<pb facs="tcp:2948:80"/>
beyond all other actions, and accidents:
the most easie, to giue counsell to other:
the most hard, for a man to knowe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
and most wise, <hi>Time:</hi> for that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,

               <p>Knowledge more delighteth in the food of

<hi>Charles</hi> the 4. Emperour, entring one day
into the schoole of <hi>Prage,</hi> and there stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then foure houres, to heare the
disputations of excellent scholers; vvas
told by some of his Lords, that it was time
to goe to supper: whereupon he replyed,
Ye that loue your bellies, get you to your
victuals; for I am better pleased thus to
increase my knowledge with these dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

               <p>Knowledge teacheth vs, that bookes are
faithfull counsellers: for <hi>Alphonsus</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi>
was wont to say, that without fear,
enuy, flattery, hope of reward, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passion whatsoeuer, they did faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell him whatsoeuer he demanded. And
<hi>Cicero</hi> called them deerly beloued books,
a pleasant houshold: for if he would, they
would talke with him, if not, they were
silent at his commandement: they were

rash, cruell, rauening, nor malicious: but
euery way affording satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Knowledge most deceiueth a man, when he
is proud of his own conceit, and so grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>Knowledge doth not consist in much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

               <p>Knowledge teacheth men both secrets of
Art, and wonders of Nature. By it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

suspition, winde, and loyaltie:
the first, where it once entreth, neuer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
the second, neuer entreth, where it
cannot get out: and the third, where it
once goeth away, it neuer returneth.</p>
               <p>Knowledge leadeth to vertue, vertue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation,
estimation to honour, honour
to obseruation, obseruation to loue, loue
to heauen; and these be the steps of the

the same, by her qualities and powers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth

               <p>Knowledge of Philosophy is a good studie;

               <p>Knauery makes the heart false, and a face of

both a griefe to the honest, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>Knauery boasteth of shifting wit, and yet
endeth with beggary; while a vertuous
heart is sull of grace, and either obtaineth
temporall blessings, or is contented with
that which it hath.</p>
               <p>Knauery is meer fraud &amp; mockery of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
when vnder colour of loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
a man either discouers his friends se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,

too shallow, and all men to abuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and cosen other in their calling.</p>
               <p>Knauery is an ouercunning of wit and craft,
which hath twenty tricks to cosen others;
but at the last, of all others coseneth the
author most. Yet an ideot is a disgrace to
nature, and is neither profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or any other.</p>
               <p>Knauery of one man troubleth a whole
towne. For as the windes doe make the
seas to worke, which now doe tosse, now
sinke the boat: so when knaues practice
their intended plot, the trouble or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
lights on some mans pate.</p>
               <p>Knauery is an instrument out of the diuells

as his workman will apply it vnto: It is
neuer idle, and yet not wel imployed: it is

his labour.</p>
               <p>Knauery still tendeth to deceit, and yet is

the dogges? O, quoth the fox, I beleeue
the dogges haue not heard of it, &amp;c. But
by this meanes, his knauery was detected,
and he went without his prey.</p>
               <p>Knauery makes a villaine laugh euen going
to hanging, and as we say, breake a iest of

matter of griefe and displeasure, at euery

               <p>Knaues can doe great euil out of a little wit,
when honest men can do little good wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>Knauery is commonly either in wicked

sullen silence dissembles, when most

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2948:85"/>
vvith vvomen: man may sinne by
himselfe, by and with his owne wife,
with beasts in abhominable prostituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
with their own blouds and kinred in
incestuous maner: with other mens wiues
in adulterous copulation: with all sorts in
filthy licenciousnesse: and in all, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
GOD, and confound themselues in
body and soule.</p>
               <p>Lechery corrupted the vprightnes of <hi>Lot,</hi>
weakened the strength of <hi>Sampson,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooll'd
the wit of <hi>Salomon,</hi> prophan'd the
holinesse of <hi>Dauid,</hi> confounded the peace
of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; brought a curse on <hi>Baal Peor</hi>
for seducing the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Lechery weakneth the body, shortneth the
life, corrupts the mind, impouerisheth the
state, infameth the credit, dulleth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
dampeth the hart, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the soule.</p>
               <p>Lechery is so fearefull a temptation, that as
a Father of the Church writes, <hi>Paul</hi> was
stung with the loue of a virgin, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him in the seruice of Christianitie:
how then can a man be safe alone with a
bad woman, but he shall fall into the snare
of the diuell. And if the choice Apostles
<pb facs="tcp:2948:86"/>
haue entred this combat of concup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>scence,
how shall worldly men, and obsceane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
preuaile in the same?</p>
               <p>Lechery, after <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
is the ruine of the body, the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life, the corruption of vertue, the
breach of the law, and the effeminating of
manhood.</p>
               <p>Lechery named the first whore, made the
first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

bred the first bastard.</p>
               <p>Lechery was begot by ease and idlenesse, is
maintained by pride and wantonnesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies
by want and weaknesse, and dies in
shame and filthinesse.</p>
               <p>Lechery is an enemy to virginitie, the death
of honesty, the breach of amity, and the
nurse of iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Lechery is remedied with fasting, and the
body tamed with exercise: and if a man
would be continent, hee must auoide the
occasions, and meanes of the act.</p>
               <p>Lechery is naturally attended with shame
and feare: for the violentest man in his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingest
heat, would be loath to be seene,
and afraid to be known in such an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
action.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:2948:86"/>
Lechery will proue an vnprofitable plea in
Gods law: for if he could not be excused,
that said, he had maried a wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not come; hee cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that is with a whore, and therefore wil
not come.</p>
               <p>Lechery makes age doat, youth mad, a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
a commaunder, a free man a slaue, a
foole ciuill, a woman impudent, a valiant
man temperat, a coward valiant, a beast
fond, and a tyger milde.</p>
               <p>Lechery breeds a painfull pleasure, a woful
repentance, a miserable delight, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
reward.</p>
               <p>Lechery is in plaine tearmes extreame lust,
vnlawfull loue, brutish desires, beastlie
wantonnesse, and the itch or scab of old
concupiscence: so that when a lasciuious
man hath as it were no abilitie to sin, yet
the polluted hart hath a good will to bee
sinning.</p>

               <p>Loue is a hidden fire, a pleasing wound, a

               <p>Loue of many, like a diuided flame or

               <p>Loue is commonly both praised and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <p>Loue is in his glory, when it is enamoured

Goat; the third a serpent: signifying, that
loue was fierce and proud as a Lion in the
beginning, libidinous and luxurious like a
Goat in the midst; and in the end, full of
poyson like a Serpent.</p>
               <p>Loue of goodnesse begins in the loathing
of euill, as the declining from good breeds
inclination to ill: but both good and ill
cannot agree in a godly soule.</p>
               <p>Loue hath not her perfect obiects or best
conditions, if men loue the world, which
is so full of deceitfull flatteries; or their

               <p>Loue relieueth the miserable, and sendeth

               <p>MErchant is a worthy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths
man, for how euer priuate commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:2948:92"/>
may transport him beyond his owne
bounds: yet the publicke good is many
wayes augmented by mutuall commerce,
forren trading, exploration of countries,
knowledge of languages, encrease of naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
instruction and mustering of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
diuersity of intelligences, and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of forren treasons.</p>
               <p>Merchant is onely traduced in this, that the
hope of wealth is his principall obiect
whereby profite may arise, which is not
vsually attained without corruption of
heart, deceitfull protestations, vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
idle oathes, paltry lyes, pedling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
simple denials, palpable leauing his
friend, and in famous abuse of charitie.</p>
               <p>Merchant must bee cunning in diuers artes,
nay: neede both learning and iudgement,
especially Arethmaticke, Cosmography,
morallitie, Rhetoricke, vnderstanding to
make vse of time, and place, and skill in his
profession to knowe what is cheape to bee
bought abroad, and deerely soulde at
home? where ready money serues the
turne, and exchange of commoditie sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the want, how hee shall be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
how long, and how many times wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2948:92"/>
because in some places they are
tied to precepts, and limited to procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>
               <p>Merchant is no common freeman ouer the
world, as we suppose: for euery countrey
hath her seueral restraints, he that trauels in
the East, may not goe into the streights, he
that goes into Indy, cannot trade into Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,
not he that sends to Turkey haue busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in Stode, or other places of our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
marts, except he be free of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and haue serued accordingly in his
prentiship.</p>
               <p>Merchant is a ciuell and conuersable man,
rich in money, delicate in apparell dainty
in diet, sumptuous in furniture, elloquent
in discourse, secret in his businesse, carefull
in his losses, watchfull for his profit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all, sparing in his lending of money.
Merchant continuing his estate, may setle
his fortune, and augment his credit: but if
he once turne Gentleman before his time,
hee is like a gamster that plales at a game
he knowes not for a great deale of money:
wherein I will giue you onely one reason,
whereas before hee imployed his time to
get wealth, he now spends it in consuming
<pb facs="tcp:2948:93"/>
his substance: and whereas before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his owne element, and so had
some lustre, he now is counted but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder,
and purchaseth onely vanitle.</p>
               <p>Merchant committeth this error in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

when all that he labours for, is to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

both in name and libertie.</p>
               <p>Merchant is a substantiall commonwealths
man, how euer some pedlary fellowes, and
paltrey brokers haue abused the title.</p>
               <p>Merchant must take heede of keeping his
word and credit: for if he faile at his daies,
and absent himselfe from the common
place of entercourse, as we cal it the Bursse,
let him be neuer so rich, he looseth a good
opinion, and hazardeth his reputation for

               <p>OEconomick in one briefe definition
teacheth all good rules of house-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and orderly gouerning of a family:
yet there bee some house-keepers, which
keepe as ill houses as they doe ill orders;

the strumpet and vagabond in Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,

the matchiauilian and murtherer in
Hell.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick maketh mariage the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and foundation of a familie: for as a
shippe cannot be gouerned without a rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
so cannot a house be ordered without
an ouerseer, which must needes bee man
and wife, subordinate one to the other: he
to play the good husband abroad, and she
the good housewife at home, and both to
consent in a sweete harmoney of mutuall
helpe to maintaine their familie.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick hath great necessity and neere
affinitie with nurture and ciuilitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the wife must haue grauitie in speech
and action: wisedome in gouerning, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in suffring her husband, loue to bring
vppe her children, affabilitie to conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
diligence to lay vppe and saue, and
friendlinesse in entertaining, and dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
neighbours and friendes when they
come.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick teacheth the maried man to
be reposed in speech; milde of conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
faithfull wherein hee is trusted; wise
wherein hee giueth counsell; carefull for
the prouision of his house; diligent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2948:104"/>
his goods; suffering in the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of his wife; and carefull in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp his children, maidens, and men.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick warneth, that men &amp; women
too young attempt not mariage or hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,
lest their wiues are broken and
spoiled in their childbedde; their strength
weakned; their children multiplied; their
patrimony consumed; ielousie inflamed;
honesty and honor stained; the houshold
vnprouided; the substance consumed; &amp;
the man and wife finally seperated, after
long discontent, and great want.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick must first of all prouide for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and then preuent prodigality: for
after money is gone, and wants are come,
it will be too late to spare, when the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
is at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick is opposed &amp; incumbred with
manyu inconueniences in maried folkes,
wherein if fortune cannot be preuented,
wisedome must mittigate the extremitie;
as commonly, a milde and modest maiden
is a poore one; a rich one proud of her
dowrie; a faire one of her beautie, and is
to be watched; a foule one is nastie, and
is to bee loathed; a wise and comely, is
<pb facs="tcp:2948:105"/>
both wilful and costly; a semster, a singer,
or dauncer, and no housekeeper; a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
irksome and imperious; and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
one iealous. Besides, if thou make
thy wife tarry at home, she will complain;
if she walke at libertie, the neighbours wil
talke of thee; if thou chide, shee will be
sullen and dumbe; if thou be silent, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall be heard for her chime; if she
haue the laying out, the stocke goeth to
wrack; if thou dispose thy owne money,
she scorns to come for euery peny; if thou
keepe thy house, thou art suspicious; if
thou tarry abroad, thou art vicious; if she
be trim, shee must abroad to be seene; if
she be but in ordinary fashion, thou art a
base minded miserable man: and so may I
goe infinitely on the inconueniences and
crosses, that are incident to housekeepers
and maried folkes.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick is blessed, when the wife is
modest; a housekeeper, no babbler; not
fretting, fuming, nor of any ill condition:
for the impudent, prating, angry, scolding
and fighting woman, maketh her husband
either a sheepe or a lyon; discrediteth her
kin; is blamed of her friends; hated of her
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2948:105"/>
seruants; slouted &amp; auoyded of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick giueth warning that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
be not rigorous, especially vvhen
they be new maried to their wiues: for as
the wife is the honour and happiness of her
husband in respect of her chastitie: so the
husband is the hell of his wife, in regard of
his cruelty.</p>
               <p>Oeconomick giueth warning, that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
be not ouer ielous: for how-euer a
man may sometimes shut the dores, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
his wife from the window, bar her

because euil is vnpunished, malice
couered, iustice hindred, vice nourished,

that they cannot shew forth their efficacy,

or so vtterly banished, that they sildome

               <p>Offices are commonly a way for the Prince
to know the condition of the subiects: for
as the touchstone trieth currant and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
mettals: so doth the integritie or
iniquitie vsed in offices, try the disposition
of magistrates; and by them, the opinion
and conuersation of the subiect. For good
Princes make good lawes; good lawes
raise good magistrates; good magistrates
ouer-see good executions; and good exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
detaineth the inferior sort in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

in loue to the country, in due respect

               <p>Offices are still subiect to this error; that
such as should obtaine them by order of
place, are commonly shut out by fauour or
reward: insomuch that Princes cannot
sometime eate or sleepe in quiet for such

their eares. Which makes me remember
a story of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Naples;</hi> who

partialitie, not onely conserue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
but augment the reputation

               <p>Offices abused by wicked magistrates,

               <p>Officers that are wise, are the pillers of

               <p>Offices obtained by money, and not to be

               <p>Officers ought to be thankfull to God, and

of ingratitude: &amp; the poore doth reuenge
iniuries with teares.</p>
               <p>Officers in the administration of iustice, are
gouerned by learning and wisedome: for
learning, to giue sentence; &amp; prudence, to
gouerne; both which are two such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
as many desire, but few obtaine.</p>
               <p>Offices amongst martiall men are bestowed
by order of discipline, and knowledge in
the warres: otherwise shall the vnexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
hazard the businesse in hand, and

               <p>OAthes haue been of great antiquitie:
for euen heathen Princes made their

<hi>Abraham,</hi> who durst not offend God in
the breach of the same.</p>
               <p>Oathes haue assured damnation to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
for God did sweare in his wrath, that
they should not enter into his rest.</p>
               <p>Oathes must not be made but by the name
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2948:111"/>
of God, and then are they as dangerous to
be broken, as if you should rebell against
him: so then as you vvould auoide the
name of traytor toward an earthly Prince,
you must take heed of the condemnation
of rebel against the Prince of all Princes.
Oathes were foreseene by Gode himselfe to
come to corruption, and growe to abuse:
therefore was the law proclaimed, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vs in obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; to limit our tongues,
to curbe our vanitie; to suppresse our idle
talke; to condemne our prophanation;
and aboue all to limit vs, how farre wee
might sweare, and must be silent.</p>
               <p>Oathes are many times abused, euen to the
eating them vp; as a man will sweare by
the bread, and eate it; by the drinke, and
drinke it: but when hee comes to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
he will refuse it.</p>
               <p>Oathes are very forcible amongst most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuell
people: for in Ireland to sweare by
their hand, their fathers hand, their Lords
hand, by <hi>Oneales</hi> hand, &amp; such like, are as
forcible, as if they called heauen and earth
to witnesse.</p>
               <p>Oathes taken in vaine, are the more to bee
condemned; because of the greatnesse of
<pb facs="tcp:2948:112"/>
the sinne, and the easinesse to auoide it: for
of all other sins the naturall man can yeeld
you a reason, or if you will an excuse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
swearing: which being voluntary,
and not restrained, is the more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
because of the presumption, and
vnnecessary transgression.</p>
               <p>Oathes vnnecessary are in themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
but in their violation abominable:
so that to so sweare is wicked, but to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
damnable.</p>
               <p>Oathes are meerely accoustomary wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
or wicked coustome, and thereby odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
euen to the naturall and ciuill honest

               <p>Oathes haue tied all men to obseruation: yet
<hi>Euripides</hi> hath a saying, that in cases of
loue and soueraingtie an oath is not to bee
trusted, nor man to bee beleeued: for so
sonnes haue ouerreached their fathers, and
depriued them both of libertie and of life.
Oathes are the more dangerous, by how
much God is most holy, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to haue his name vnhallowed at any
time, much lesse by ordinary and audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
custome.</p>
               <p>Oathes are the more fearefull, by how much
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2948:112"/>
the casue is most friuolous: for you shall
heare euen vagabonds, roagues, and boies
sweare with horrible libertie for trifels,
and slender occasions: yea in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
discourses as they goe in the streetes,
and walke in the fieldes.</p>
               <p>Oathes and drunkennesse doe commonly
goe together, and being fearefully vnited,

               <p>Pleasures are dangerous in their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
yet is moderate mirth a recreation of
body and minde; musicke a diuine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hunting a martial imitation, hawking
a Princely pasttime, riding manly and
gracefull contentment, and if skilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
an honourable ornament: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
such like exercises followed in their
fit and seasonable times, increase health
and strength and agilitie in mens bodies,
delight in their minds and relish and adapt
both to better businesse.</p>
               <p>Pleasure hath two great enemies; an ouer
eager desire, and continuall feare: for what
we desire to enioy, we are affraid to loose.
Pleasure of hunting consisteth in three cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:2948:114"/>
the Deer, Fox, and Hare: but sinne hath
the eescore times three, which to hunt from
our soules is happines to our selues, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
ioy to the holy Angels.</p>
               <p>Pleasure is but a further degree of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
whence a willing trauaile is more
pleasant then a forced ease.</p>
               <p>Pleasure hurteth the flesh more then exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
as pride enuenometh the spirit aboue
other more painfull sinnes.</p>
               <p>Pleasure breedes a lamentable sorrow: or a
dangerous mutiney, when the misery of
a whole common-welth, breeds the mirth
of a few.</p>
               <p>Pleasure is wretched that breedeth sorrow,
but it is a blessed sorrow that bringeth ioy.
Pleasure of riches in Christian mindes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in commendable spending, not in
couetous hoording: for if the poore starue,
the neighbour be needy, the orphane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
and the widowe shed teares; what
pleasure can it bee to thee to haue many
bagges lying by thee, and see them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
and pine away in their necessitie.</p>

               <p>Poetry was gratious, when <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> made
a loue song, and with spirituall influence
described heauenly secretes as <hi>Dauid</hi> sung
his Psalmes, and draue away the diuell by
the sound of his Harpe.</p>
               <p>Poetry in his vse is an admirable vertue, and
a rauishing contentment: For it raiseth the
honour of renowne, illustrateth the actions
of famous men, eterniseth the memory of
merit, and quickeneth the very spirit of the
reader to the same prosecutions: againe it
sendeth vice to hell, maketh miquitie a
monster, keepeth vs from sinne for feare of
shame, and compareth the odiousnesse of
impiety to deepe pits, whence it is more
easier to keepe ones selfe from falling in,
then once fallen to come out againe.</p>
               <p>Poetry in his abuse is a meere excrement of
an idle frency, a drunken fury, a scorne of
wise men, a popular iollitie, a common
<pb facs="tcp:2948:115"/>
may-game, a storehouse for balladmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
an lnne for rimers, and an idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
pastime: liuing in pouertie, and
dying in contempt.</p>
               <p>Poetry animated by musicke are dangerous
companions amongst working spirits, and
barbarous nations: witnesse the bardes
and rimers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> whose Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren

and horrible tumults.</p>
               <p>Poetry and pouertie march hand in hand
commonly, though at first they scorned to
take reward: yet at last it grewe so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that without reward they could not
liue by the occupation.</p>
               <p>Poetry now adayes marcheth with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
for whereas ancient poesie studied
to make vertue famous, the moderne ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours

honesty an idle word, and a simple orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but ribaldry a witty mirth and

               <p>Poetry seasoned with piety and learning is

               <p>Pouertie is subiect to many miseries: yet
not to bee scorned, lest haughty pride
make a man worse then humble pouertie.
Pouertie is borne with patience, when feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
is corrupted by plentie, and he which
is armed with vertue, can endure miserie,
when, he which is fraughted with vices, can
not moderate prosperitie.</p>
               <p>Pouertie may come by worldly troubles,
and as you call it, vnfortunate mischances:
but wretched is that wealth, which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the wofull wracke of others.</p>
               <p>Pouertie that comes by prodigalitie, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:2948:116"/>
to be derided with scorn, then relieued
by pitie: and meriteth so much the more
reproch, by how much the more intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
the prodigall liued in his former
iollitie.</p>
               <p>Pouertie will try the honesty of disposition,
and patience the discretion of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Peuertie hath an inward griefe, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is, endured with constancy, but vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
is hard to bee concealed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
or indured of others.</p>
               <p>Pouerty maketh men rob the rich, and to
excuse it by necessity: but the rich that
robbe the poore, haue no excuse for
their auarice and tyranny.</p>
               <p>Pouerty triumphs to see the miserable diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of rich mens goods. For one part is
giuen to flatterers, another to Lawyers, a
third to Physitians, a fourth to vnthrifts,
and the last to funeralls: so that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
haue his goods, his children his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the graue his body, the wormes his
flesh, and the diuell his soule: from most
of which pouerty is exempted.</p>
               <p>Pouerty comes by fruitlesse paines: for hee
that plowes the seas, or sowes the sands,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2948:116"/>
may haue his seede well washt, and a cold
haruest for his lost labours and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paies.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is no vice: yet a wofull inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
for friendes forsake vs in our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as crowes leaue the fleshlesse carkas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that are eaten vp to skinne and bones.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is a pitifull spectacle, and more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
then a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ster: for men giue mony
to see nouelties, but runne away from
poore mens complaints and necessities, as
from infectious leprosies or ruinous wals.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is subiect to so many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
to be suffered of mightier men then
themselues, that poore men may not think
on reuenge of their former wrongs, but
rather on defence from further iniuries
and mischiefes: as in this example ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.
A poore countrey man hauing lost
a calfe, made a vowe to <hi>Iupiter</hi> to sacrifice
vnto him a lambe, if he would doe him the
grace to shew him the thiefe that had stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
it: whereupon looking vp and downe,
he saw a Lion feeding on the same; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
much more affrighted, hee lift vppe his
hands a new to heauen, and cried: O god,
whereas I promised thee a lambe to helpe
<pb facs="tcp:2948:117"/>
me to finde the thiefe that stole my calfe,
I will now being found, such as he is, giue
thee a bull to deliuer me out of his clawes,</p>
               <p>Pouertie is troublesome in it selfe: but when
other mischifes are added, it is much
more grieuous and irksome. For when a
poore man had a shrewe to his wife: one
day in a fury he had happned to anger her,
and shee for want of her will hanged her
selfe on a figge-tree in his garden; at the
sigth whereof much amazed, hee ranne to
his neighbours being as poore as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and wept extreamely: but at last
brought them to the spectacle, which they
perceiuing asked, why he was so foolish to
weepe, when they would faine haue a graft
of the same tree to set in their owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is a good helpe to knowledge: for
<hi>Diogenes</hi> was wont to say, that a Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
could not study without an emptie
belley, thinne diet, want of money, poore
apparell, and a good wit; yea, Phylosophy
perswaded to pouertie, and maintained all
the principels of the scorne of wealth and
prosperitie.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is a part of the play which we acte
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2948:117"/>
in this world, &amp; as <hi>Epictetes</hi> said: if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a Comedy can adapt the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his boyes to such seuerall parts, as
shall well befit their natures and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to grace the enterlude; so that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a beggers sonne shall play the King,
and a Gentlemans a vagabond and rogue:
shall not the God of heauen dispose of his
creatures, as best befitteth their abilities,
either to try their moderation in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
or patience in aduersitie? since
without controuersie, it is onely God that
permitteth pouertie as a triall or chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or else sendeth it as a plague or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>Pouertie bursteth foorth into some extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which may be pardoned: but inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and causelesse mutineys are not to bee
endured.</p>
               <p>Pouertie and riches haue denominations
and effects contrary to themselues in some
persons: for the widowe was rich in her
mite, when the rich were poore in their
plentie.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is the greatest profession in the
world; for all men are beggers from the
richest to the meanest, for some begge one
<pb facs="tcp:2948:118"/>
of another, but all of God.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is miserable, if it ouercome pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
as wealth is wicked if it breed pride.
Pouertie in a good scholler is as pitifull a
spectacle, as a rich foole is a scornful.</p>
               <p>Pouerty comes through a licentious wife,
pilsering seruants, vnthrifty children, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tious
neighbors, &amp; combersom friends.</p>
               <p>Pouertie followes a carelesse spender, as a
long sicknesse brings the body to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
               <p>Pouertie is fittest for a begger and a godly
life: yet many honest men would not aime
at such a marke, nor walke in such a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
               <p>Pouertie hath more reliefe by the hand, then
the tongue, as God is more honoured
with the heart, then the lippe.</p>
               <p>Pouertie makes hunger a good sawce, but
too much takes away the stomach.</p>
               <p>Pouertie without redresse, is like a naked
body without a raiment: and both finde
but cold comfort in compassionate words;
For a word without a substance, is like a
small light, that maketh the little yeelde a
great shadow.</p>

vpon a time demaunded his opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the benignity of nature; made this
answer; that nature had prouided a helpe
for all her imperfections: as for lechery,
mariage, or fasting: for hunger &amp; thirst,
meat and drink: for couetousnesse, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2948:121"/>
for wrath, patience, and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
but for pride, he saw no helpe: so
that it was a thing not onely hurtful vnto
nature, but hatefull both to God &amp; man.</p>
               <p>Pride apparrels the wicked with costly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
makes them thinke their speech
like the voice of Angels; and swallowes
the praise and popular applause of men
with greedinesse: but let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that of <hi>Herode,</hi> who was eaten vp with
lice and wormes.</p>
               <p>Pride threw the bright starre <hi>Lucifer</hi> out of

darknesse of the earth presume too high,
lest he fall into the like precipitation.</p>
               <p>Pride maketh the minde greedy of power,
and then can they neither abstaine from
things forbidden, nor containe themselues
within the compasse of moderation.</p>
               <p>Pride causeth a man, that hath the eyes of
his soule shut vp from the light of grace,
to mount vp so high vnto vanitie, that he
falls down head-long into hell: as a blind

               <p>Pride is the enemy to grace, the scorne of

               <p>Pride bred the fall of Angels, the mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Pride bedecketh the body, deformeth the

to go in braue apparrell, runnes ouer head
and eares in the Mercers bookes, til stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at the heape of his debts, hee falls
headlong into a cold and comfortlesse,
poore and penurious prison.</p>
               <p>Pride made the Painters complection, the

the fooles correction, and the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
conclusion.</p>
               <p>Pride, or a proud man in gay apparrell, is
like a prety virgin, who playeth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
Queene amongst other mayds; puts

will all that day scarce speake, nor looke
vpon her fellowes; but at night when she
puts off her apparrell, then she bids them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2948:122"/>
all good night, and goeth home perhaps
to some poore cottage, from whence shee
came in the morning. So I say is it with a
proud man; who all the daies of his life
from the brauery of his purse ouerlooketh
all his poore friends and neighbors: but
at the night of his dayes, when he must be
stript out of his richest ragges, and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his graue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perhaps hee bids them
all good night, when he is going not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

but it may be to hell, from whence he shal
neuer returne.</p>
               <p>Pride is vnprofitable for a Commonwelth,
when the superfluitie of one night serues
the necessity of many: and the disgrace of
a Common-wealth, when a man shal care
more to satisfie his owne vaine-glory, and
outward vanity, then respect the profit of
his country, the praise of vertue, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of humilite, the example of sobriety,
the times necessitie, the complaints of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie.</p>
               <p>Pride hinders charitie, endures no equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
loues flattery, murmureth at superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
triumpheth ouer inferiors, and wil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of no humble thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:123"/>
Pride robbeth the heart of wisedome, the
mind of vnderstanding, the spirit of grace,
and the soule of saluation.</p>
               <p>Pride, or a proud man that is cladde in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
like the Knight of the Rainebow, or
bedawbed in gold like the calfe of <hi>Horeb,</hi>
feeles neither the burthen of sinne, that
lyeth heauy on his soule, nor the weight of
a whole lordship, that hangeth heauy on
his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Pride ingrafted by nature, is somtimes tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
in a great estate: but if the same
party come to deiection, then doth pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
expose his pride to the greater hate and
contempt.</p>
               <p>Pride is many times augmented by honour,
as we say, Honors change manners: so that
a man otherwise well disposed, when hee
comes to preferment, not onely alters the
course of his life, but the qualitie of his
very soule.</p>
               <p>Pride without controuersie, is the diuells
hooke to pull sinners neerer to him: and
can catch a man a farre off without anie
other baite, then the hast of him, who of
his owne accord doth come too fast on.</p>

by recounting, if he euer had any greater in

               <p>Remembrance is a great officer in Princes

               <p>Remembrance in some sence is an enemy to

               <p>Remembrance is an instinct of nature euen

came to the Citie of <hi>Monaco:</hi> where when

indeede, and not able to hold out:
some of the Ladies and best sort of women
went to the Emperor, and falling on their

and so put in practise a most memorable

professions are darkned, in a sort, as when
a man discourses of a Countrey hee is not

are; how the Citizens liue; how the

what able men are in the same; what ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
maintained; what souldiers flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;
what exployts they haue performed;
and this is commonly the first question.</p>
               <p>Souldier in the best common-welth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a nosegay, which is worne all
day, while the sweetnes &amp; freshnesse doth

               <p>Souldiers must neither attempt any thing

               <p>Souldiers are true Christians, and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

therefore, that we may neither faint, nor

               <p>Souldiers of the world through liberty and

and glorious in filthy idlenesse, they
are roagues and vagabonds: in the one

               <p>Souldiers and saylers are brothers in good

               <p>Shifting is the mother of cleanlinesse, and

houses be not cleansed they will be dusty.</p>
               <p>Shifting is a most necessary thing in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

the great concourse and continuall

               <p>Shifting is the onely brauery and credite of
a Courtier, for if he be not able to change
his apparrell sometimes thrice in a day, he
is ous of countenance, and at least thrice
a weeke out of credite, but yet I would
not haue him make this shift to pawne his
winter cloaths in summer, and his summer

               <p>Shifting brings confusion to a mans fortune
for he that taketh no certaine course to

               <p>Sorrow filleth the heart full of greefe, and

               <p>TRoubles are incident to an honest life:
but sometimes they are so many and so
<pb facs="tcp:2948:152"/>
heauy, that they make honesty weary, &amp; to
sell her freehold: but troubles to confirme
constancy in honesty are gracious trials.</p>
               <p>Troubles are tokens of Gods fauour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<hi>Policrates</hi> the tyrant was affraide of
nothing so much, as the sicklenesse of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
because he had neuer any trouble or
mischance in the world, which made him
cast his rich iewell into the sea, because he
would haue some crosses: but a fisherman
hauing taken an extraordinary Dolphine,
brought it to the King, who found his
iewell in her belley: whereat amazed, hee
presently swore, there was some great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
and trouble toward him, which fell
out accordingly: for that night there was
a conspiracy against him, and he lost his
life.</p>
               <p>Troubles are like sea-markes to direct vs
in the channell of saluation, least wee fall
on the rockes, and shelfes of worldly cares
and couetousnesse: or sincke ouer-head
with cares into the gulphes and skirts of

which we are often preserued by profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>Troubles that are sudden and not foreseene,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2948:152"/>
puzell our very thoughts; and perturbe
our vnderstandings with pensiue cares:
therefore is premeditation a great point

               <p>Troubles make men-trust in God, and then
they cannot be deceined, whereas hee that
trusteth in man, shall be sure to be abused.</p>
               <p>Trouble is of greater power to restraine the
act, then satisfie the desire: for the body
may be weary of sinning, when desire is
neuer satisfied with sinne: as the drunkard
that can drinke no more, yet cals for more
wine; and the lecher vnable to satisfie his
lust, yet loues to rub and scratch his scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey

               <p>Troubles are comforts to none, but such as

So imprisonment is pleasing onely to

               <p>Trouble of a disquieted minde can no more
be concealde then the cough, or a woman
with childe, it filles with frowardnesse and
griefe, and both will forth.</p>
               <p>Trouble is the common place of the poore,
they are euer in it, and for want of meanes,
there is great disquiet: but an vnruly wife
is a quotidian feauer, and a continuall

A Gentleman of <hi>Naples,</hi> whose

farre exceeding his maintenance: and yet
had the fortune by secrete supportation to
hold vp his head in the sea of the world in
despight of enuious eyes. Thus one night
he lodged in the house of a baron, a friend
of his, where waking somewhat early: he
fell to make his prayers vnto God for the
remission of sinnes, and worldly meanes,
which a certaine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lying in the next chamber, answered with
a lowde voyce! oh thou prodigall childe,
thou art borne a yonger brother, and to

but if thou wilt maintaine a number
of idle followers (whereof thou art ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious)
learne to be thrifty, &amp; spare in time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or thy prayers will not be heard, whereat
the Gentleman seeing his vanitie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted some error, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Indeed I spake too lowde to let thee
heare me: and haue committed a greater
folly to suffer thee to liue vpon me.</p>
               <p>Vanitie of apparell sheweth the pride of
heart: the weaknesse of wit, the fantastick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2948:155"/>

or vnrulinesse of affection, the superfluitie

               <p>Vanitie of discourse and foolish table-talke
maketh men often ridiculous, as appeareth

prepared to their viands: the maister of
the house began to rouse his shoulders in
a rich chaire, and himselfe as richly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
spake to a kinseman of his somewhat
abruptly, and then leauing him, he also
spake to the former Gentleman: and then
againe to his cousin, whereat all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

matter worthy to be vttered: but he gaue

the trouble of reason, the encrease
of number, the delight of vanitie, the pride
of beautie, the abuse of loue, the breder of
iealosie, and the deceite of trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
               <p>Woman is the wonder of nature: for shee
maketh two bodies one flesh, and two
hearts one soule: so that the husband and
wife truely louing, so conspire in all their
actions, that they haue in a manner, but
one motion: for loue maketh vnion, as
hate doeth seperation and deuision.</p>
               <p>Woman is a necessary ill, a pleasing yoake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowe:
and a strong supportation, to
weake meanes of house-keeping; for as in
a teeme, except the oxen be ioyntly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and draw together: the plough or cart
cannot orderly goe forward. So in house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,
except man and wife doe louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree, and ioyntly labour in their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
places to maintaine &amp; increase their
estates, all will quickly be ouerthrowne;
for a diuision of loue and action, makes a
dimunition of substance, or rather a dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2948:166"/>
Woman againe is a purgatory on earth, and
with contrary humors quencheth the hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
loue, and breaketh the hardest heart;
for if she be honest, she will be imperious,
if faire, she wil be venerious: if foule, she is
loathsome: if a wanton, full of fraude or
treason: if proud, costly aboue thy ability:
if witty, impudent to shame thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or make
thee weary: if sheepish, she will neither
increase thy commoditie, nor gouerne thy
family: if familiar and affable, she will bee
foolish and tell all: either she hath no good
qualitie, or such as are quite ouermatched
by the contrary.</p>
               <p>Woman that prooueth a good wife, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
continueth a good mother, so that
the husband hath ioy, the children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
the seruants contentment, and all the
house establishment.</p>
               <p>Woman must auoide all occasions of bad
rumors: for it is not enough that shee bee
honest, but that she bee so reputed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
because the honour of a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
on his wiues loyaltie, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
of children, on the report of her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honestie.</p>
               <p>Woman is the weaker vessell, and therefore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2948:166"/>
must man beare with the infirmitie of his
wife, as she endure the impatience and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of her husband.</p>
               <p>Woman is the author to her husband of
much good or ill, as she is indued with the
grace of God, or the malice of the diuell.</p>
               <p>Woman faire, and proude, and wanting wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
is a looking-glasse of vanitie, and
a miror of inconstancy, idle, fantastick, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of nouelties, disdainfull, chargeable,
a daintie feeder, a gadder, a talker, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
way irregular.</p>
               <p>Woman is seldome pitied in her teares: for
they commonly proceede either from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or deceit; anger, that she cannot bee
reuenged: deceite, that shee cannot haue
her will in wantonnesse and libertie.</p>
               <p>Woman is endued with the same vertues as
man: for there hath beene as valiant, wise,
godly, magnaninous, pollitick, iudicious,

               <p>A whore hath many significant names,
as filth, curtisan, queane, strumpet,
puncke, light-hus-wife, concubine, leman,

               <p>A whore is like a horse-leach: for as it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

playes the whore with our substance, and

a miserable besotted man, till she haue fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

till shee hath emptied the bones of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2948:167"/>
and the purse of money.</p>
               <p>A whore is knowne by the boldnesse of her
face, pride of her eies, wantonnes of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
vnconstancy of her lookes, gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

licenciousnes of her words, leawde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
her actions.</p>
               <p>A whore is of the nature of Astrology,
an art of all men embraced and practised;
so a whore is railed and reuiled of euery

courted and embraced for her wanton al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements,
and pleasing delight.</p>
               <p>A whore studieth for nothing but wealth,
brauery, and expences: yet she is neuer the
neerer to attaine to any setled estate, nor a

               <p>A whore is not to bee trusted with a secret,

               <p>A whore bringeth a foole into the house of
slaughter, and he that goeth into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is like an Oxe led by the Butcher.</p>
               <p>A whore cannot bee better compared then

fallen to recouer out: so it is more easie to
absent thy selfe and neuer remember her,
then by her company to content and satiat

               <p>A whore is compared to coales taken out
out of the fire, which either burne a man or
besmeere him: so doe whores either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
our estates, or our credites.</p>
               <p>A whore amongst many other hath one

she will laugh and sing, and at his intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>A whore reprehended for her incontinencie
standeth more stiffely then any other on

               <p>A whore supposeth to redeeme and wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away

know that the sacrifise of a theefe, is as if

A whore hath this vsuall impediment, that
she cannot repent. For while youth lasteth
shee is loath to leaue her profitable sport,
and when both faile, she sees that of a yong
whore she may turne an old bawd, and so
still liue by the trade.</p>
               <p>A whore that is mercenary, will hardly bee

               <p>A whore thinkes her selfe excellent wittie,
when she can practise disloyaltie cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ouerreach her friendes by her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie.</p>
               <p>The finest whore is but a filthy dripping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,

great preferment by cheerefull and pleasant

Contrariwise, rude and vnciuill fashions
make men both odious and combersome:
for though there bee no lawes nor punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

a principall corrector in his kinde, and
maketh them vnsociable to mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces,

not talke too fast, nor too much, as many
talkatiue fellowes, who out of vanitie loue
to heare themselues speake, and trouble all
the company; there is another fault like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be redressed, and that is interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
another mans discourse, which must
not bee: for nothing mooues a man sooner
to anger, then when he is suddenly cut short
of his wil, and his pleasure, be it neuer so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
&amp; of smal importance: If any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be in a redinesse to tell his tale, it is no
good manners to enterrupt him, nor to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against him, although hee entermin
gled some lie or fiction in his discourse: nor
must you diuert the hearers from any mans
discourse to a new begunne speech, and tale
of your owne; for as the interrupting of a
man is, as if you should take him by the
sleeue, and stop his course beginning to run,
so to aske abrupt questions in the midst of
a tale, or offer to beginne another discourse,
when a man is telling a story or such like, is
as if you should shuffle stones against him
which goeth. For euery man in his owne
conceit thinkes he can tell his tale well, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for modesty sake he deny it: yet men
must take heede of ouer much talking; for
<pb facs="tcp:2948:181"/>
he must runne into some errors, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
many faultes, that talkes too much, and
he that talks all the talke to himselfe, would
after a sort prefer himselfe aboue them that
heare him, as a master would be aboue his
schollers, and therefore it is not good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for a man to take vpon him a greater
state, then doeth become him.</p>

               <p>Wee must not also bee ouermuch silent:
for to vse silence in place where other men
walke too and fro, is in manner as much a
fault, as not to pay your scot and lot as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men doe; therefore it is good manners
for a man to speake, and likewise to holde

               <p>Wee must also vse a manner of grace in
our speech and actions; For it is not enough
for a man to do things that be good, but he
must also haue a care he doe them with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good grace: and a good grace is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:2948:181"/>
else, but such a manner of light as I may call
it, as shineth in the aptnesse of things set in
good order, and well disposed one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
and perfectly knit and vnited toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without which proportion and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

               <p>Wee must not offend any man with our
vices; for as they be foule and filthy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
so they produce shamefull effects,
and turne to our losse and reproach; it shall
then be necessary for Gentlemen, and men
of good behauiour to haue a regard to this
measure, I speake of in going, standing, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
iesture, apparell, port, silence, rest and
action; for a man must not apparell himselfe
like a woman: as in their haire and beardes
frisled and curled with bod-kins: their face,
necke, and handes painted or starcht; their
perfumes so hot as a daintie strumpet, and
themselues meerely effeminate and woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.
As for apparell spoken of before, wee
must vse them according to the fashion,
and our calling: for we must not take vpon
<pb facs="tcp:2948:182"/>
vs to alter custome at our will: for time doth
beget them, and time doth also weare them
out: yea, wee should apparell according to
the countrey we liue in, for what peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is allowed in <hi>Verona,</hi> perchance would
not be suffered in <hi>Venice.</hi>

               <p>We must not run, nor goe too fast in the
streete, least it make one sweate and puffe,
which is too vnseemly for a Gentleman, nor
yet are we to goe so soft and demurely as a
maide: neither should we shake the armes,
or writh the body, mince it: or walke with
high gate, and lifting vp the leg, nor stampe
with the feete, nor goe as it were splay-foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor stroake vp the stockins in going,
nor stare in ones faee, nor looke vp too high
nor muse too lumpishly, nor doe any thing
vnseemely when wee would bee professed
Gentlemen, who should be masters of true
ciuilitie, good manners and curtesie.</p>
               <p>Many other things I could here relate: as
a table, wherein a true life is pensilled our,
and delineated for example and immitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but because it would bring mee along,
<pb facs="tcp:2948:182"/>
as it were into a confused iourney, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
from trauelling in vnknowen waies, and
wading further in the deepe, then I shall be
able to recouer the shore; and so I leaue with
these few cautions, and abbreuiated princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and hope you haue the discretion
to retire to greater volumes,
and better direction, if
these be not fully
satisfactory.</p>
