            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Here are means propoſed, with ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

Lord onely that can cauſe the ſoule to ſee this
light, and love, ſo as to live in it, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered

give thee wiſdome to know the truth, and to
receive thy own portion, without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<pb facs="tcp:103276:6"/>
faith makes great afflictions to be as none, it
maintaines the ſoules ſtrength and comfort.
Chriſt lives in our hearts by faith, by it wee
obey God: faith makes Chriſts yoke eaſie and
ſweet; the fruition of God is all the ſoule can
deſire; faith helps the ſoule to this, it puts the
ſoule into poſſeſſion of heaven while the body
is on earth; by it we view the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to know its worth, to enjoy the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer
and purchaſe it ſelfe, by faith we know
our ſelves to be happie, even then when to a
carnall eye we ſeeme moſt miſerable; by faith
we can part with the ſweeteſt outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and welcome death, becauſe wee know
we leave the worſt place and things, and goe
to better; they that live by faith, live upon
God himſelfe, and are feaſted in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
banquetting houſe, where there is all the
deſirable dainties, and enough. Eate then O
friends, drinke, yea, drinke abundantly O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
becauſe it is the pleaſure of our ſweet
Lord Jeſus that his doe ſo, it's their portion,
duty, and priviledge, to digeſt, refreſh, and
make their ſoules merry with his dainties, to
enjoy himſelfe in them, that ſo their joy may
be full.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is the will of Chriſt that
<pb facs="tcp:103276:7"/>
thoſe who have found reſt and peace in him
ſhould take his yoke upon them, as appeares,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 38, 39. Here is added the Saints
dutie and ſervice to Chriſt, and the rather, for
now is the time the love of many waxeth cold
to God and man, Religion is eſteemed of many
to be but a bare notion, or a little ſpeculation,
nothing of practiſe, iniquitie abounds, many
depart from the faith to needleſſe diſputes and
principles, that deſtroy the foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
no law, no tranſgreſſion, no ſinne, all
alike, as appeares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. So that many
run the round, began at nothing, and end in
nothing, ſo that many in ſtead of ſubmitting
to the yoke of Chriſt, cavill againſt it, ſo that
few will ſubmit unto it, notwithſtanding it's
holy, juſt, light, eaſie, ſweet, and a law of love.
Call perſons to obey Chriſt, and men are apt
to think it legall and ſlaviſh, but if men were
to worke for life, it were ſo indeed, we cannot
doe any thing to procure the pardon of ſinne,
we only deſire ſuch as have received mercy and
life from Chriſt, to act from the ſame life and
power, according to the word of Chriſt, to
Chriſt againe out of love and thankfulneſſe;
ſurely ſuch as have received mercy from him,
vehemently deſire to obey him, eſteeming it a
<pb facs="tcp:103276:7"/>
great priviledge to be imployed in his ſervice;
alſo <hi>in keeping his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands, there is great
reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. By nature we are prone to
deſire libertie, and abuſe it; we need to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
that we uſe not our libertie as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. to ſloath and eaſe, &amp;c.
Libertie to ſinne is no libertie, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
bondage that can be to have a free heart
to ſerve God, and the lets outwardly removed
is ſweet libertie to enjoy God, is libertie to be
ſet free by Chriſt from ſin, Satan, hell, is to be
freed indeed; and though we have nothing to
doe to be ſaved, we have ſomething to doe for
his glory, which is to be our meat and drinke,
therefore let no difficultie hinder thee in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thy Lord, ſay not it is impoſſible, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Luk. 1. 6. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 13. 19. Preſſe after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the neerer the better, watch and pray
to prevent ſinne, to doe good, make it thy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
to keepe Chriſts commands. Indeed all
have not the like time to ſpend herein, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
of outward things, hinders many that
they cannot doe what otherwiſe they might
and would, one wants time, another a heart,
another both, we ſhould conſider whether we
ſpare that time for theſe things we might, we
can and will ſpare time for what we liſt and
<pb facs="tcp:103276:8"/>
love, though they be things of leſſe moment;
conſider <hi>Song</hi> 8. 6, 7. Were we ſo full of love,
wee could not but ſpare ſome time, not onely
from our recreation and idle viſits, but from
our ſleepe and callings, wee would redeeme
time, and cut off needleſſe expences too by time;
that time is ſweet and precious, in which the
ſoule beholds God, and glory, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him: when wee conſider how
farre ſhort we come of our dutie, we may ſay
with griefe and ſorrow, <hi>Lord, what is man,</hi>
a very vanitie; And notwithſtanding wee
come farre ſhort of what we ought to doe, wee
are not to ſit downe diſcouraged, but to live
by faith in all infirmities above infirmities,
beholding and enjoying thy joy and peace
with God: when thou art at the worſt, as
knowing no infirmitie can leſſen the love of
God to thoſe who are his, yet are wee to take
notice wherein wee come ſhort with griefe,
looking up to him by faith for more ſtrength,
to ſerve him better, eſteeming it a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be circumſpect in all our actions to
God and man.</p>
            <p>There be ſome other ſever all things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this Treatiſe, which I truſt will be of
uſe to ſome: and as for the directions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:103276:8"/>
the Scriptures, they have been obſerved by
many to be neceſſary to cut off many errors.
I have added ſome other things: my whole
aime and ſcope in all I have written, is, firſt,
to ſuſtaine, comfort, and incourage the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
ſoule from ſinking in deſpaire, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their many and great ſinnes: ſecondly,
to withdraw the ſoule from the life of its own
hand, to the life of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for
ſalvation. Thirdly, that the ſoule might know
and live in the aſſurance of the love of God,
which will fill the ſoule full of life, ſweetnes,
and joy. Fourthly, that the ſoule ſhould obey
Chriſt, and live to his glory, and ſuffer for
him. Fiftly, to prevent errors, and to recall
ſuch of the Lords, who have through miſtake
fallen into them by the wiles of Satan. You
are not to expect vaine Philoſophy, nor inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
words of the wiſdome of man; for here
it is not: I have deſired and endeavoured to
make the truth appeare by the evidence and
demonſtration of the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> as that
which is moſt ſafe and profitable for our ſoules
to venture themſelves upon; and ſeeing they
are to be our onely rule, ſearch the Scriptures
to ſee whether what I have declared be ſo or
no, and I truſt you ſhall find it true and ſweet,
<pb facs="tcp:103276:9"/>
(though others, through miſtake, may call it
error.) Now the Lord of heaven and earth,
enable thee and all his to looke up to him to be
taught by him, to enjoy him, and to walke ſo
before him, that they may honour him, and
that their joy may be full.</p>

               <p>4. There is nothing in him that can
helpe him; if he follow his own heart, he

<hi>We were ſometimes darkneſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>5. Conſider mans heart is not to be

               <p>1. Many in ſtead of living upon God,
live upon a deceived heart, as <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 5, 6. 7.</p>

               <p>3. Others live upon corrupt reaſon.</p>

hypocrite.</p>
               <p>5. Many live upon the report of others,
which appears by this, that if men ſpeak
not well of them, they are greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

it appeares their life is in it; it was no

               </p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103276:13"/>
they have been, therefore they have hope;
it's well when men grow better, yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence

               <p>7. Others live upon duties, and as they
are increaſed, their hope and confidence
in God is increaſed, but if their duties
faile them, their hope and comfort is
gone; by which it appeares, they live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what they doe, and not upon God;
theſe count their duties, which is <hi>their

Phil. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>8. Some live upon their peace, they

of ſalvation; but as ſoone as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
joy, which was ſenſibly felt, leaves
them, their confidence went with their

               <p>11. Others upon raviſhments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſies
of glory, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>12. Many live upon the ordinances of
men, and ſtand ready reſolved to be of
any Religion the Authority will impoſe

their perſons and purſes, the more it ſhall
have of their hearts.</p>
               <p>13. Yea and many there be that live
upon the ordinances of God, without
God, theſe ſo they may frequent the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;
they are ſatisfied, though they
ſee not God in them, and be never the

               <p>14. Others live upon their confidence
of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>15. And ſome live upon creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,

To beleeve in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 23. and <hi>to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

               <p>A falſe foundation and a falſe life goe

               <p>A man is prone to follow the adviſe

               <p>The reaſon is:</p>

               <p>If any reply that Chriſt in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

that all perſons whoſoever will are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to come to Chriſt to drinke, &amp;c. But
what Scripture ſaith, Chriſt is offered to
any perſon, much leſſe to all the world?
<hi>God ſo loved the world, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
in him, ſhould not periſh, but have
everlaſting life.</hi> This is a declaration of
what perſons God will ſave: the word of
God is a declaration of the will of God;
now for to declare a thing, and to offer
it, is not one thing; for one may declare

hath, and yet not offer any of them, nor

give that to another, which he never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

               <p>This is a ſecret,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1</note> and you muſt not

               <p>It's one of Satans deceits to tell a ſoule
that God hath no mercy for him,<note place="margin">2.</note> when
the ſoule hath obtained mercy, or when

               <p>It is certaine,<note place="margin">3.</note> theſe thoughts come
from Satan, becauſe they are contrary to
God in his word, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>It's the nature of unbeliefe,<note place="margin">4.</note> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
and curious to find out any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that it may ſeeme to doe well in
not harkening to what God ſaith in his

               <p>We muſt not hearken unto Satan,<note place="margin">5.</note> nor
yeeld to him, but reſiſt him; meddle not
with election, fix thy eye upon Chriſt, as
a ſutable good for thee, who is able to
ſave thee, and wait upon him in the uſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103276:32"/>
of his meanes, till he ſhall give thee faith,
that by it thou mayſt know thy ſelfe to

               <p>But I have uſed the meanes,<note place="margin">6. Ob.</note> and yet I

               <p>Are you ſure you have uſed all Gods

them? and have your ends been all good

in a right manner, meaſure, time, in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
humilitie, which I queſtion; and
have you not reſted in the uſe of means?
have you ſet God above his meanes, and
expected his bleſſing upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they could doe no good? If
thou haſt not uſed them all in faith, ſay
not, thou haſt uſed the meanes; what are
all meanes without faith? they are as a
ſhadow without the ſubſtance, <hi>Heb. 11. 1.
The word they heard profited them not, for
want of faith,</hi> Heb. 4. 2.</p>
               <p>It is no good reaſon to ſay,<note place="margin">2.</note> becauſe
God hath not anſwered me, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, therefore he never will conſider,
<hi>Iſa. 64. 4. Iſa. 8. 17. They which had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

               <p>There be many that doe ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the meanes,<note place="margin">3.</note> and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
them, and in what they doe:
that it is juſt with God, yea a mercy to
blaſt all, to ſhew their emptineſſe, that
we might look and long for Chriſt, to
bleſſe the meanes, and be all in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
               <p>Men beleeve not that faith is the gift
of God,<note place="margin">4.</note> and the Spirits work, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29.
ſo that they goe not to God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
for faith, but endeavour to make a

               <p>If thou haſt a will that onely Chriſt

               <p>Conſider God may have mercy for
thee,<note place="margin">6.</note> though thou knoweſt it not; for
mens ſinnes are firſt forgiven, before they

for if men ſhould beleeve, that their ſins
are forgiven before they be forgiven, they
ſhould beleeve that which is falſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103276:33"/>
can any mans beleeving make that

declares to us our pardon; but our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
neither pardons nor procures the

               <p>I have waited a long time,<note place="margin">Obj. 7.</note> and many
have received mercy ſince, but not I.</p>
               <p>Even the Lords ſervants have waited

               <p>If God have given thee a heart to wait
upon him,<note place="margin">2.</note> thou art bleſſed; <hi>Bleſſed are all
they that wait for him,</hi> Iſa. 30. 18. Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in holding out, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tediouſneſſe of the time deferred,
courage in breaking through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>I am now old in yeares,<note place="margin">Obj. 8.</note> and if God

               <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> though it be thus with thee, yet
mercy may be thy portion at laſt, if mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               <p>You may not ſet a time to God,<note place="margin">2.</note> in

Tell me, what qualifications had they

               <p>As in nature none can worke before

Chriſt muſt be in thee before thou
canſt beleeve: the ſoule muſt beleeve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can finde any ſanctification, or
workes at all in it ſelfe, yea without any
regard to workes in any meaſure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
for there is nothing to be done

ſee <hi>Rom. 4. 5. &amp;</hi> 5. 8. 10.</p>
               <p>Thou hungereſt and thirſteſt after a
righteouſneſſe of thine own,<note place="margin">5.</note> and wouldſt
eſtabliſh it, but it muſt be renounced.
I confeſſe, this ſelf-deniall is very hard;
oh, how hard is it for the ſoule to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off its own bottom of workes, and of
ſelf-concurrence! ſtrip them of all that
is their own, and yee take away their
lives; they muſt and will have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſome humbleneſſe, and brokenneſſe
of heart, ſome teares, ſome good workes,

they muſt have, for they think it cannot
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103276:35"/>
be, that they ſhould be accepted, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſaved, and they to doe nothing
at all themſelves for it: therefore as ſoone
as they begin to eſpie a flaw in what they
doe, <hi>for who can ſay his heart is cleane?</hi> Job
25. 4. they betake themſelves to breake
their hearts, to make God amends for all,
and thinke if they can but attaine unto
ſuch a deep meaſure of humiliation and
ſorrow for ſin, then they think they have
an evidence for heaven: but alas, this is
no evidence, ſave onely of great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
in that they ſee not death in their

who worke ſo hard for life, <hi>Thou haſt

Iſa. 50. 11. When we ſay our good works
are not the way to life, men eſteeme it a
grievous error, yet Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the
way,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. Are thy works Chriſt or
no? if no, then they are not the way, for
Chriſt ſaith true, and if Jeſus Chriſt is
to be unto us <hi>all in all,</hi> Col. 3. 11. Our

beſt workes are to be unto us nothing at

God, but declare us to be what wee are
made by God: the Papiſts doe good
works to be ſaved, but we abhorre it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is condemned by God, therefore
all thoſe who expect and hope for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
becauſe they leave their ſinnes, as they
ſay, and do many good works; conſider
what I ſay unto thee, Alas, poore ſoule,
thou art ſtill in the ſtate of nature, in
the gall of bitterneſſe, thou art not quite
plucked up off of thine own ſtocke of
ſelf-workes, and ſelf-concurrence with
Chriſt, and therefore art not planted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, thou art ignorant of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God, which is the cauſe why
thou goeſt about to eſtabliſh thine own
righteouſneſſe, and ſo long as thou doeſt
ſo, thou canſt not ſubmit to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13. But diddeſt
thou know what a righteouſneſſe Chriſt
is, thou couldſt not but have preferred it
before thine own righteouſneſſe, yea it
would be eſteemed by thee but <hi>droſſe and
dung</hi> to his, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. And unleſſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103276:36"/>
the Lord Jeſus open thine eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
his righteouſneſſe unto thee, thy
righteouſneſſe (which thou joyneſt with
Chriſts for ſalvation) will of a certaine
worke thy deſtruction unto all eternity.
Publicans and harlots are neerer ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then thee, when you who worke for
life are Phariſees, and if you dye in this
eſtate, you muſt periſh, <hi>Mat. 21. 31, 32.
Luk.</hi> 7. 29, 30.</p>
               <p>I know many will cavill, and ſay, if
Chriſt muſt doe all, and man nothing,
then men need not care what they doe,
but live as they liſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As it is our dutie, ſo it is our

to doe any thing to procure the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our ſinnes, but in reference to
ſervice and dutie, I count my ſelfe to be
never the neerer Heaven for my beſt
workes, then if I had done nothing elſe
but blaſpheme God. But what ſaith the
Scriptures, <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the
reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt,
but to him that worketh not, but beleeveth
on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103276:36"/>
is counted for righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 4. 2, 3,
4, 5. <hi>Wee are ſaved, not according to our
workes, but according to his own purpoſe and
grace,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 9. <hi>When wee were enemies,
wee were reconciled to God by the death of his
Sonne,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>I will doe away thy

<hi>When thou wert polluted in thy own bloud,

All unto whom the myſtery of Gods
love and free grace is revealed, they cry
grace, grace, Chriſt, Chriſt; Chriſt is all
in all, nothing but Chriſt, their prayers,
teares, duties, devotions, and all of theirs,
is nothing to them in reſpect of accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or juſtification, or ſalvation, they
are now dead to working, they doe no
workes in the world to attaine any of
theſe, all theirs is vaniſhed, and is quite
drowned in the infinite Ocean of Gods
free grace. It is ſo that God might have

                  <hi>all the glory,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. Jer. 9. 24. and <hi>that

               <p>To be convinced of ſin implies;</p>
               <p>Such a diſcovery of ſinne which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

               <p>The ſoule is convinced,<note place="margin">2.</note> ſo as to have
<hi>no hope,</hi> Jer. 2. in any thing it can doe to
helpe it ſelfe out of that miſerable ſtate
of ſin, he is undone in nature, he cannot
doe any thing from whence he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſalvation, or have any hope of it;
for a man cannot expect life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Chriſt alone, untill the ſoule be
taken off of all other things in reſpect of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103276:37"/>
life. This viſion of God cauſeth the ſoule
to ſee themſelves, and ſay, <hi>There remaineth
no ſtrength in me, my comelineſſe is turned
in me into corruption,</hi> Dan. 10. 8. That is,
my beſt workes, my righteouſneſſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
and is ſinne; now ſinfull ſelfe, and
righteous ſelfe are alike (if there be any
difference, the laſt is the worſt, now the
creature hath nothing to procure Chriſt,
nor no ſtrength to beleeve in him) the
holy Spirit diſcovers to the ſoule, that
there is nothing but darkneſſe and death
in our beſt duties.</p>
               <p>He is ſo convinced of ſinne,<note place="margin">3.</note> that he
juſtifieth the juſtice of God, if he periſh
in his ſin, as <hi>Pſal. 51. 4. Gen.</hi> 44. 16. See
<hi>Leviticus 26. 41, 42. Micah 7. 9. 2. Sam.</hi> 15.
26. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 28, 29. It is from grace to be
taken ſo off of nature, and he that is ſo
taken off of nature, hath grace, is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and borne of God. For when the
ſoule is taken off his own bottom, it muſt
have another to reſt upon, or elſe it
ſinkes, therefore when God takes away
the ſoules falſe ſoundation, which was
her falſe hope, God gives the ſoule a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:103276:38"/>
The teaching and drawing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. is this, that all men have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and are in an eſtate of death, and
that in Chriſt there is a ranſome, in
which is life and all happineſſe, and that
this Jeſus and all that he hath done is
for him. When the ſoule hath heard and
learned this, there is a power goeth with
this teaching, which carrieth the ſoule
by faith to Chriſt beleeving in him; for
the teaching of the Father and faith go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
together; every one that hath heard
and learnt of the Father commeth unto
me, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. So that to convince the ſoule
of righteouſneſſe, is to be convinced of
Chriſt, to reveale Jeſus Chriſt to the
ſoule, that in him onely is helpe, and in
his righteouſneſſe is deliverance; <hi>I have
laid help upon one that is mightie,</hi> Pſal. 89.
19. Iſa. 63. 1. So fix and ſettle the eye
of the ſoule upon Chriſts righteouſneſſe
onely, at leaſt putting the ſoule under
the hope of it; for as ſoone as God hath
ſtripped the ſoule of all hope in and from
it ſelfe, he turnes the ſoule to Chriſt,
and puts it under hope, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 5, 6.
when the ſoule ſeeth nothing but death,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103276:38"/>
God ſaith, <hi>Live,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6. and when
the ſoule is a going downe into the pit,
God ſaith, <hi>ſtay, hearken, I have found a
ranſome for thee,</hi> Job 34. 23, 24. Chriſt
calls, <hi>Come to me, and be ſaved,</hi> and the
power of God goeth along with this
call, workes faith, carrieth the ſoule to
Chriſt as his own, having poſſeſſion of
him. When this is manifeſted to the ſoul,
faith acts in the love of God in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſinne, greatly wondering at the
greatneſſe of his goodneſſe, or aſtoniſhed
with the glory of his preſent condition,
the heart being taken up, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 41.
43. though for the meaſure of it, it is not
in all alike. For the firſt, to be convinced
of ſinne then is more then a bare notion
that it hath ſinned, for this may be in
one that reſts in themſelves, and in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe beſides Chriſt, and periſh in
this condition; for by the letter of the
Law, and the light of reaſon, men may
ſee and ſay they have ſinned; as <hi>Saul</hi> and
<hi>Judas</hi> did: but thoſe the Spirit convinces
of ſinne, they are convinced to purpoſe,
becauſe it is thorowly; <hi>The Spirit ſhall
convince the world of ſin,</hi> Joh. 16. 8. The
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103276:39"/>
Spirit diſcovers to the ſoule that ſhe hath
choſen ſomething elſe beſides Chriſt,
upon which the ſoule reſteth, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
her ſelfe withall, and expects mercy
and comfort from by reaſon of them,
and that they are her beſt ſervices, and
other lying vanities, as groundles hopes,
peace, joy, comfort &amp;c. telling the ſoule
that there is nothing but death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in them, and that if the ſoule reſt in
any of them, there is nothing but death
and deſtruction for them; and there is a
ſecret power of God which goeth along
with this teaching, which turneth the
ſoule from darkneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſelfe, Satan,
and all lying vanities, to light, to Chriſt,
where life is, the Spirit reveales to the
ſoule a ſufficiency of life in Chriſt, and
it needs ſeek life in nothing elſe; alſo the
Spirit of God perſwades a ſoule that this
life is for him, therefore he is to look to
Chriſt for it, and wait upon him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and life, and that the ſoule ſhall not
loſe her waiting, and ſo be deceived, but
ſhall certainly have it at laſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 13.
Theſe things muſt be wrought in truth,
and in a meaſure in every ſoule that hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103276:39"/>
grace, though for the meaſure of this, it
is not in all alike; for in ſome it is in a
ſmall meaſure, as it was in thoſe who are
named to be <hi>carnall,</hi> and <hi>not ſpirituall,</hi> yet
then they were <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> therefore
their ſtate was happy, &amp; ſafe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. 3.
But when this is wrought in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
in the ſame time faith is wrought,
and as the meaſure of this worke is
wrought in the ſoule, more or leſſe, in the
ſame meaſure faith is wrought in the
ſoule, and as it appeares to the ſoule, ſo
accordingly faith appeares to the ſoule:
and when the ſoule ſeeth it ſelfe to be
loſt by reaſon of ſin, and ſeeth all to be
in Chriſt for life, and is taken off from
reſting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing elſe beſides Chriſt,
and to expect all from Chriſt, reſting
upon Chriſt, though this be but in the
ſmalleſt meaſure wrought in the ſoule,
now this inſtant time faith is wrought,
Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is formed</hi> in the ſoule, and
the ſoule is converted; for this teaching
of the Father and faith are inſeparable,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. 47.</p>
               <p>I cannot beleeve.<note place="margin">11 Ob.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is not in the power of the creature<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:103276:40"/>
to beleeve in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. therefore
look not upon faith as a worke of thine
own, nor is faith any condition of the
Covenant required on thy part; for as
the Covenant of grace is not made with
man, but with Chriſt, as appeares, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
89. 27, 28, 29, 30. nor is there any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the Covenant of grace required
on mans part, neither is there any thing
to be done by man to cauſe him to have
an intereſt in the Covenant of grace, or
to partake of it, for the Covenant of
grace and life by Chriſt is every way free
and unconditionall on mans part, elſe
how doth it differ from a Covenant of
works, if there were any thing to be done
by us to have intereſt in it? and if faith
were a condition required on our part to
partake of the Covenant, or elſe not, I ſee
not but we are now in as bad a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as to be under the Covenant of works,
it being as hard and impoſſible for man
of himſelfe to beleeve in Chriſt, as it is
to keep the whole Law, as the Scripture
declares. How hard it is to beleeve, the
experience of many can teſtifie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
is a fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. We
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103276:40"/>
muſt be in Chriſt, before wee can beare
fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4. therefore we muſt be in
Chriſt, before wee can beleeve; he that
hath the Spirit of Chriſt hath Chriſt,
wee have the Spirit of Chriſt before wee
beleeve, therefore we have Chriſt before
we beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11. Men are
ordained unto eternall life before they
beleeve, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. Faith is a grace of
the Covenant on Gods part to be given
to thoſe who are given to Chriſt; faith
is given to ſome, that by it they may
know their intereſt in Chriſt, and by it
live upon him: faith is no condition of
the Covenant, therefore they miſtake
who conceive faith to be a condition of
the Covenant, either required on mans
part to partake of the Covenant of grace,
or given to men, and then required of
them as a condition; although the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
expreſſeth, that <hi>he that beleeves ſhall
be ſaved,</hi> yet is not faith any condition of
ſalvation; but ſuch expreſſions are to be
conſidered as a declaration to us what
perſons ſhall be ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:
it is an information to ſuch as
know not who ſhall be ſaved, and if any
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103276:41"/>
deſire to know who ſhall be ſaved; the
anſwer is, <hi>he that beleeves ſhall be ſaved,</hi>
Joh. 3. 16. If faith did give us intereſt in
Chriſt, when faith did not appeare to
act, it would appeare to us, that we had
no intereſt in Chriſt, and that wee were
not juſtified by him.</p>
               <p>I know not whether I am bidden to
beleeve or no,<note place="margin">12. Ob.</note> for ſome ſhall not be ſaved,
and if I be one of them, if I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

               </p>
               <p>The Goſpel declares that <hi>whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Joh. 3. 16.
therefore thoſe who beleeve, cannot be
any of them that ſhall periſh; and the
Word ſaith, <hi>be that beleeveth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already,</hi> Joh. 3. 18. <hi>and ſhall not ſee
life.</hi> What God ſaith is truth, and truth
ought to be beleeved, and whatſoever is
contrary to truth, no man is bound to
beleeve, therefore no unregenerate man is
commanded to beleeve the forgiveneſſe
of his ſinnes in any other way then Gods
word holds forth forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,
which is, he that beleeves ſhall be ſaved,
and have everlaſting life. Men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103276:41"/>
to beleeve they ſhall have benefit
by Chriſt, life and ſalvation by Chriſt,
if they beleeve, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. And no man is
commanded to beleeve he ſhall be ſaved
by Chriſt, whether he beleeves or no;
for this is contrary to the Word which
ſaith, <hi>He that beleeves not, is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi>
Joh. 3. 18. No man is to beleeve
that which is not true, yet this hinders
not, but all that ſee an abſolute neceſſitie
of Chriſt, ſhall enjoy him, &amp; they ought
not to diſtruſt in him, but to caſt away
all their doubts and feares, and beleeve
in him, and reſt upon him for ever, as
<hi>Simon Peter</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter to
whom ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of

               <p>But I have no love to Chriſt,<note place="margin">13. Ob.</note> I am

               <p>The reaſon thou doeſt not love Chriſt,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note>
is becauſe thou ſeeſt not thy ſinnes to be
pardoned by Chriſt, didſt thou know he

Doeſt thou apprehend thy ſelfe to be

               <p>From whence is thy feare,<note place="margin">2.</note> ſure it is
occaſioned or much increaſed by them
who bid perſons beleeve, &amp; forbid them
againe by their ſaying, Take heed what
you doe, you may be deceived? it is not
ſo eaſie a matter to beleeve, you muſt firſt
be ſo ſenſible of ſin, and ſo humbled for
it, &amp;c. before you may beleeve. Now they
conceit, they are not ſo and ſo qualified,
therefore they dare not beleeve: alſo they
are ſcared with the many things hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
may doe, how farre they may goe,
and ſo ſet them ſhort of hypocrites;
which muſt needs diſcourage them, yet
the word of God requires no ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for men to learne before they may
beleeve; for when the ſoule ſeeth it ſelfe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103276:43"/>
loſt by reaſon of ſinne, and is at a ſtand,
not knowing what to doe, the firſt thing
they are to doe, is to beleeve in Jeſus
Chriſt, as appeares, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. The word
requires nothing of them before they
may beleeve, therefore wee may not, for
none may preſume above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>If thou deſireſt to beleeve,<note place="margin">3.</note> thy will is in
part regenerated, and thou doeſt in ſome
meaſure beleeve, though weakly, as he did
that ſaid, <hi>Lord, I beleeve, help my unbeliefe,</hi>
Mark. 9. 24. Gods ſervants are deſcribed
by a <hi>deſire to feare his Name,</hi> Nehe. 1. 11.
Pſal. 145. 19. Pſal. 147. 11. There can be
no deſires without faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, 3. a
man cannot deſire that which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
not to be; ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Many give
God their hearts, and doe not know it,
and ſo are troubled, becauſe they do not
know what is meant by the heart, nor
where it is ſeated. I ſpeak not of the heart
of fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7. there is a carnall
minde and a ſpirituall minde in men, I
ſpeake of the heart myſtically and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
which is principally ſeated in the
will, ſo that what it wills or deſires, there
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103276:44"/>
is the heart, and to that which the will
moſt wills or deſires, to that is the bent
of the heart unto. Now if the ſoule were
to have its choice of every thing, that one
thing that the ſoule ſhould chuſe, would
any queſtion whether they loved it, and
that their hearts were not unto it? for as
no ſoule can be ſenſible of the want of
Chriſt, untill the ſoule be poſſeſſed of
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10, 11. ſo no ſoule can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
Chriſt above all things in the world,
if they might have their choice, unleſſe
Chriſt have their hearts, and they dearly
love him, and beleeve in him; for <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is <hi>precious to them that beleeve,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7.
and to none elſe. So the ſeat of faith is in
the heart, which is in the underſtanding,
and will, but more principally in the
will, ſo that if our wills be renewed, our
hearts are renewed, <hi>Rom. 8. 5, 6. Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>To will is preſent with me; good I
would doe; ſo then with my minde I ſerve the
Law of God,</hi> Rom. 7. 18, 19. with 21. 25.
it appeares that the will is one with the
minde, and the heart is one with them,
theſe three are one, and alwayes goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and are alike ſpirituall. Chriſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103276:44"/>
ſaith, <hi>Where your treaſure is, there will your
heart be alſo,</hi> Mat. 6. 21. that is, the mind
and affections: and by affections in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.
2. is meant the heart, for the heart and
affections are one thing. There be them
that beleeve, and yet they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they beleeve or no: ſo that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them to call their faith unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
as the blind man did, <hi>Mark. 9. 24.
Lord help my unbeliefe;</hi> which muſt not be
underſtood of unbeliefe, for it is not a
lawfull requeſt to pray that ſin may be
increaſed, for unbeliefe is a ſin, and the
ground or cauſe of the ſoules departing
from God, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. Many miſtake
faith, ſome have thought, comfort, joy,
or raviſhments of ſoule with God, to be
faith, and ſo have concluded, becauſe
they had not them, they had no faith.
It is not mens beleeving, but the object
of faith, that gives faith its denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or name, for there be divers kinds of
faith; there is a naturall faith, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.
13. and a divine faith, or the faith of Gods
Elect, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 1. Faith and its object is
not to be ſeparated, becauſe faith and its
object is one and the ſame, it is too ſtrict
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103276:45"/>
therefore to give a diſtinction or definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith without its object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that beleeveth that Jeſus Chriſt is
the Sonne of God ſhall be ſaved.</hi> All is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in this, he that beleeves this, muſt</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Know Chriſt to be</hi> the anointed,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 23. the Saviour of his people from their

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>To</hi> beleeve in Chriſt, to reſt upon him,
to live or ſtay upon the Lord, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 5. To
beleeve in him, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. 11. Pſal. 17. 6.
To</hi> cleave <hi>to God,</hi> Deut. 30. 20. Joh. 23. 6.
Acts 11. 23. Pſal. 119. 30, 31. <hi>to</hi> hope in
him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>To own and</hi> confeſſe <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Simon
<hi>ſaid,</hi> Thou art the Chriſt, the Sonne of the
living God, <hi>Mat. 16. 16. Rom.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
               <p>Any man may ſay,<note place="margin">Obje.</note> that Jeſus Chriſt is
the Sonne of God, yea the Devils confeſſe
this; <hi>I know thee who thou art, Jeſus Chriſt
the Sonne of God,</hi> therefore this cannot be
the faith of Gods Elect, and ſo not the
faith of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>1. There are three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the nature of faith; firſt, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
ſecondly, for the ſoule to truſt
in Chriſt for pardon and life; and the
third is the application of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:103276:45"/>
The firſt, is when a man conſents to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Word, that it is true, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
faith, and this the Devill doth; <hi>Thou
beleeveſt there is one God, thou doeſt well,
the Devill doth ſo,</hi> James 2. Mark. 5. 8.
Acts 16. 17.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is to beleeve that Jeſus is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the Chriſt; which implies a ſeeing and
knowing all to be in Chriſt for life and
ſalvation, and ſo to reſt upon him for it;
he that thus beleeves in Chriſt, is brought
by Chriſt over to Chriſt, and ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
upon him, that he will never goe
from him, <hi>Joh. 6. 58. My ſoule wait thou
on God, for my expectation is from him,</hi> Pſal.
62. 5. and this no Devill never did.</p>
               <p>The third, is to beleeve with an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of Chriſt as their own in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
therefore to beleeve in Chriſt, is more
then an illumination, or a ſaying ſo, or
reformation; for where faith comes, old
things are done away, and they are new
creatures, there is a light ſet up in that
ſoule, now they know all is by Chriſt,
and that there is no way or meanes of
life, but by Chriſt, and cloſe with Chriſt,
and reſt upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:103276:46"/>
Secondly, the Scriptures cleerly prove
that to beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the
Sonne of God, is the faith of the Goſpel,
for the Word of God is the ground of
faith, and the ſoules ſalvation depends
upon the truth of what God ſaith, and
faith looks onely to what God ſaith, and
reſts upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſets to its ſeale that
God is true. And that ſo to beleeve that
Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God, is the
faith of the Goſpel, I prove by theſe
Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe this is the faith which the
Apoſtles preached and witneſſed unto,
and the faith which is recorded unto us
in the Scriptures, <hi>Acts 18. 28. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Becauſe</hi> none can ſay (<hi>knowingly</hi>)
that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Spirit,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe upon the profeſſion of this
faith, Chriſt builds his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.
16. 18.</p>
               <p>4. Upon the profeſſion of this faith
the Baptiſme of Chriſt is diſpenſed, as
<hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37.</p>
               <p>5. They who have this faith <hi>dwell in
God, and God in them,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:103276:46"/>
6. This faith <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale,</hi>
but God reveales it to the ſoule,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Such are borne of God;</hi> whoſoever
beleeves that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is borne of
God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>This is</hi> the faith that overcommeth the
world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>9. Becauſe ſuch as have this faith are
pronounced <hi>bleſſed,</hi> Mat. 16. 17. <hi>and ſhall
never dye,</hi> Joh. 11. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>10. Becauſe he that hath this faith
ſhall be ſaved; <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſſe with
thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleeve
in thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from
the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10. 9.
<hi>Jeſus ſaid, I am the reſurrection, and the life,
&amp; whoſoever beleeveth in me, ſhall never dye;
beleeveſt thou this? ſhee ſaid unto him, yea
Lord, I beleeve that thou art the Chriſt the
Sonne of God, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 11. 25, 26, 27.
To beleeve this Record, implies an aſſent
that it is truth, with a reſting or hoping
to have intereſt in it, to be made one
with it, is faith, though it be a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
(then a full and certain aſſurance
of life by him for himſelfe in particular)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103276:47"/>
ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 21, 22. Thoſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5.
who <hi>mourne,</hi> and <hi>hunger,</hi> and <hi>thirſt after
Chriſt are bleſſed,</hi> and ſhall be ſatisfied,
though they want the application of
Chriſt; therefore beſides the illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which wicked men and Devils may
have as well as a beleever, there is a two-fold
act of faith, the firſt is a direct act to
beleeve Chriſt is, in whom is life, &amp;c.
this is to beleeve the Record God hath
given concerning his Sonne, and that he
<hi>came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim.
1. 15. 2. Chron. 20. 12. <hi>Look unto me and
be ſaved,</hi> Iſai. 45. 22. and ſo truſt in Chriſt
for life from a hope of mercy, but this
hope is without a certainty; theſe are
bleſſed, as appeares <hi>Mat. 16. 17. Turne ye
to the ſtrong hold ye priſoners of hope,</hi> Zach.
9. 12. Secondly, the reflect act of faith,
which is (to beleeve <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to ſave
them from their ſinnes, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 23.) to
know I beleeve; he that hath this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or degree of faith, truſts in Chriſt
from a knowledge of an intereſt in him,
<hi>we beleeve and are ſure,</hi> Joh. 6. 69. He that
hath this act of faith, hath the former,
but there be ſome which have the firſt act
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103276:47"/>
of faith, but have not attained the ſecond,
yet their hearts are turned unto Chriſt,
and fixed upon him, and they long for
him, hope in him, and reſt upon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
for life and ſalvation, theſe have
faith, which cauſeth them to depend on
Chriſt, which none can doe but ſuch as
are poſſeſſed with Chriſt, though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they may not know it, yet are they
bleſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. and in his Name they
doe truſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 21. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that
beleeve on the Name of the Sonne of God,
that yee may know that yee have eternall life,
and that yee may beleeve on the Name of the
Sonne of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 13. So that theſe
words declare they did but weakly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
and that they did not know that
they were poſſeſſed with eternall life, (yet
they were) therefore they had not that
particular knowledge, or aſſurance of
the love of God, yet did beleeve in
Chriſt.</p>

               <p>I feare my faith is not the faith of

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103276:49"/>
in the ſoule; ſo the ſoule is ready to
judge that where ſo great unbeliefe is,
there is no faith: yet the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that in thoſe who had true faith,
the faith of Gods Elect, yet at the ſame
time have had much unbeliefe alſo in
them, ſo as they have been filled with
doubts and feares, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. And from
hence it was that he in <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 24. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

ſenſible of his great unbeliefe: and was
not unbeliefe ſtrong in <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he

And ſeeing that a child of God may have

               <p>I feare the ground of this is thy not

and what preſumption is. What faith is,
ſee objection 15. and concerning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
this word may be underſtood
in a twofold conſideration; firſt, for ſuch
a confidence as is without a ground; or
ſecondly, againſt a ground.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, he that preſumes he hath
a confidence of pardon, but it is without
any ground, he hath no word of God
for his confidence, and it may be he can
give no reaſon at all for his confidence,
much leſſe a good reaſon: that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
may be anſwered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
conſider wherein faith and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
differs. He that preſumes, he
hath no ground, no word of God for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103276:50"/>
his confidence, here confidence is fetched
from their own conceits, they ſeek no life
in Chriſt, his word, and promiſe.</p>
               <p>1. But he that truly beleeves in Chriſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
his confidence is from the Word; <hi>Wee
through the Scriptures have hope,</hi> Rom. 15.
4. <hi>In his word doe I hope,</hi> Pſal. 130. 5.
<hi>But I hope in thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 81.</p>
               <p>2. He that truly beleeves in Chriſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
doth not receive any promiſe of life,
but in and through Chriſt in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his grace. But he that preſumes
if he receives a promiſe he receives it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his qualifications, without reſpect to
Chriſt, and he gathers concluſions of life
from what they are and can doe, their
own righteouſneſſe was never to them as
<hi>droſſe and dung,</hi> as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. So they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon their faith, and not upon
Chriſt by faith: the ground of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
is, becauſe they are ſo good, or
not ſo bad as others, as the proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
but he was never fatherleſſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3.
nor did they ever <hi>receive the ſentence of
death in themſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9. So they
were ever confident, and it was ever very
eaſie for them to beleeve.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:103276:51"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. He that beleeves, his hope and truſt
is onely in God, and they hope in his
mercy; <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon them
that hope in his mercy,</hi> Pſal. 33. 18. 21. 22.
And this is the work of God to perſwade
the heart to reſt upon the free mercy of
God in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 13. 5. Pſal. 33. 18.
I truſt in the mercy of God for ever and ever,</hi>
Pſal. 52. 8. <hi>With the Lord there is mercy,</hi>
Pſal. 130. 7. <hi>God is rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2. 4.
Preſumption cannot doe ſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 37.
1 <hi>Pet. 19. 20. Joh.</hi> 6. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, ſo the confidence of the
preſumer is contrary to the word of God,
the word approves of no ſuch confidence,
but proteſts againſt them and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
as appeares, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 9. 15. So their
preſumption hardens them, and makes
them bold to venture upon ſinful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as lying, ſtealing, drunkenneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
cheating, and the like, as theirs

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103276:51"/>

us to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts,
and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in
this preſent world,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. <hi>Chriſt is
precious to them that beleeve,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7.
They <hi>count all things but loſſe for Chriſt,</hi>
and for him they will <hi>ſuffer the loſſe of all
things,</hi> as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. Yet many there be
who ſay they are confident, &amp;c. and yet
they dare not ſpeak for Jeſus Chriſt, his
truth, his ſervants, &amp;c. theſe are far from
ſuffering the loſſe of all things for him:
So others can hold Arminianiſme, and
free-will, ſetting themſelves and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
above God, and his grace, in
affirming that notwithſtanding all the
grace God affords to any man, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
man ſhall pleaſe to will and improve
it well, (for as they ſay he may chooſe
whether he will or no) it ſhall never be
effectuall to him; if it be ſo, they may
thank God for his grace, without which
they can doe nothing, but much more
themſelves, for ſaving themſelves; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had as much grace as they (as they
ſay <hi>Judas</hi> had) ſhall be damned, and they
had been damned alſo, if they had not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103276:52"/>
willed well, &amp;c. and it was in their power
and choice, whether they would will
well or no: which is ſo contrary to the
Scriptures; ſo then it is <hi>not of him that
willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9. 16. <hi>Not that
we are ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke any
thing of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of
God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. Surely all thoſe who
have taſted of Gods free grace, cannot
but admire it, and be thankfull for it,
and loath with the greateſt indignation
whatſoever ſhall intrench upon it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

               <p>I have no grace,<note place="margin">4. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coura.</note> becauſe I grow not in

that be expected from thee, as there is
from a man in Chriſt; as there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

ſo there is here; learne to diſtinguiſh
between the grace it ſelfe, and the exerciſe
of it; it's not the having of grace, but the
exerciſe of it, which attaines to a holy
converſation, by the operation of the
Spirit; and when a ſoule is delivered from
its enemies, as Satan, terrors, wrath, curſe,
it's borne, <hi>being delivered we ſerve,</hi> Luk. 1.

<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. is another thing in ſome of the

1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2. 12. It is one thing to be juſtified,

we ſee no fire, we know there is fire by the

that hath no grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 19. Deſire
after grace is an act of ſpirituall life; an
act is from a faculty, a faculty is from
life and being, a dead man cannot deſire,
none can deſire that which they beleeve
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103276:55"/>
not to be, nor that they doe not love;
deſires if ſpirituall they flow from faith
&amp; love, and are a part of what it deſires.
A will to obey, may be all that a beleever
can find in himſelfe at ſome time; <hi>To will
is preſent with me, but how to performe that
which is good I find not; for the good I would
I doe not, but the evill I would not, that I
doe,</hi> Rom. 7. 18, 19, 20, 21. Preſſe after

Even the ſtrongeſt of the Lords, are but

although it be thus with thee, it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe

little liſt to obey; alſo eying infirmities,
and not Chriſt alſo with them, and not

love to Chriſt, loving temporall things,
deads the heart, and makes it carnall,
weakneſſe of grace, or from Gods not

that ſlayeth the ſoule, undiſcreet doing
duties out of their ſeaſon, ignorance of

then otherwiſe, and it's certain, it is not

to have thy ſinnes forgiven, or not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2. and another thing to
be clenſed from it; live in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

ſin, and all diſcouragements, ſo live in
diſcouragements, and ſinne prevailes, as
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. Wee ought not

ours, and <hi>we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
When we are at the beſt, we may not live
in our ſelves, nor by ſight, but by faith,
and when we are at the worſt, we are to

more and ſometimes leſſe, but alwayes as
God ſeeth beſt, that wee might reſt and

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:103276:57"/>
We ought to beleeve that we neither
ſee nor feele; <hi>faith is the evidence of things
not ſeene,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. To live by faith, is
to walke after the Spirit, and to live by
ſight and feeling, is to live <hi>after the fleſh,
Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
               <p>I am diſcouraged,<note place="margin">10. Diſco.</note> becauſe nothing is
made good to me, I doe not poſſeſſe it.</p>
               <p>If thou beeſt included,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1</note> and art under
the promiſe of it, and under the hope of
it, thou ſhalt poſſeſſe it.</p>
               <p>It may be made good unto thee,<note place="margin">2.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy poſſeſſion of it, for wee muſt not
ground faith in the poſſeſſion of what it
beleeves, poſſeſſion is ſutable to ſenſe, and
there is neither faith nor hope in what
we poſſeſſe. To have right in it, and to
poſſeſſe it, are two things, they died in
faith, and yet they did not poſſeſſe what
they beleeved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17, 18. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of things gives no being unto faith,
nor is eſſentiall unto it, no otherwiſe then
as faith gives being unto it. <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
he ſhould have a ſonne; here was
his faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. 17. 18. yet he did not
poſſeſſe his ſonne, his ſonne had no being
but in the promiſe of God, therefore to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103276:58"/>
place enjoyment to be eſſentiall to faith,
is a very great miſtake.</p>
               <p>As a man muſt firſt beleeve God is,<note place="margin">3.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can goe to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. ſo a
man muſt firſt <hi>beleeve</hi> in Chriſt, to have
remiſſion of ſinnes by him, and after <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> as appeares, <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 43.</p>
               <p>It thou haſt power to cloſe with God
in the truth of his Word,<note place="margin">4.</note> as <hi>Sarah</hi> did,
that ſhee ſhould have a ſonne, not onely
before ſhee had him, but againſt reaſon
ſhee beleeved ſhee ſhould have him, thou
haſt faith.</p>
               <p>But I am not aſſured that I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">11. Diſco.</note>
therefore I have no faith.</p>
               <p>Faith and aſſurance,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1</note> is not one thing,
but are differing and diſtinct; aſſurance
cannot be without faith, but faith may
be without aſſurance; for aſſurance is not
the proper act of faith; aſſurance is an
effect of faith, and a higher meaſure then
that is, and the greater our feeling of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
is, the leſſer our faith is.</p>
               <p>Faith in the act is an aſſenting or clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the truth and faithfulneſſe of God
in his promiſe,<note place="margin">2.</note> not from any thing ſhee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103276:58"/>
feeles in her ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but from ſomething it
apprehends in God, in his word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.
20, 21, 22. The act of faith is ſometimes
attended with much ſtrife and ſtrugling,
for Satan ſaith to the ſoule, it's in vaine
for thee to looke to Chriſt, to beleeve in
Chriſt, Chriſt ſaith, Come unto me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
I will eaſe thee. Now for the ſoule
to reſt upon the fidelitie and abilitie of
Chriſt in his promiſe, is no ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of faith: aſſurance is not from the
habit of grace, nor from the direct act of
faith, but from the reflect act of faith,
which is for a man to ſee and know that
he beleeves; which aſſurance is from the
immediate teſtimony of the Spirit of God
in the conſcience of one who is already a
beleever, cauſing the ſoule to know it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves.
<hi>The Spirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe
with our Spirits, that we are the children of
God,</hi> Rom. 8. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now abideth faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> 1 Cor. 13. 13. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith doth at all times one way or
other, ſufficiently evidence the truth of
our eſtates, if we did at all times truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the teſtimony or true act of faith;
and the reaſon why we diſcerne it not, is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103276:59"/>
for want of a full meaſure of faith, to
withſtand all that is oppoſit to faith;
for ſome there be, who have faith, yet by
reaſon of their ignorance, and <hi>unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
as <hi>Heb. 5. 14, 15. &amp;</hi> 10. 15. forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe:
babes are unskilfull, and have
not experience of Gods dealings with
his, both for order and manner; ſo that
when faith doth not ſo lively act, and
when Chriſt doth not clearly appeare in
the ſoule, he begins to doubt whether he
be not deceived; and when the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
againe, the doubt is diſſolved, and
the ſoule is ſatisfied, and he is armed with
experience againſt ſuch a time appeares
againe, if he be able to judge, and neglect
not to marke well, but where uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
is wanting, there is not ſo cleare a
diſcerning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>I feare the oppoſition that is in me,<note place="margin">12. Diſco.</note> is
not between Chriſt and Satan, or the
Spirit againſt the fleſh, but from my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
will, &amp; my inlightened conſcience.</p>
               <p>I grant all the combates in men are not
right,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and many are deceived herein; yet
the difference may eaſily be diſcerned;

               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:103276:59"/>
1. The naturall conſcience (although
it be inlightened) acts onely in a naturall
way, at the moſt it is but morall, as not
to lye, ſweare, ſteale, and ſuch groſſe acts.</p>
               <p>2. It ſtirres not, unleſſe it be forced,
and onely unto that it is forced unto.</p>
               <p>3. It ſets one faculty againſt another,
as the will and affections againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
but the Spirit of Chriſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
an oppoſition in the ſame faculty,
as in the will, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. Conſcience inlightened without
grace, it ſtrikes onely at the branches of
ſin, but not in the roote.</p>
               <p>1. Whereas the Spirit of God makes a
free, full, conſtant, impartiall reſiſtance
againſt all ſin.</p>
               <p>2. And diſcovers unto the ſoule her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
corruptions in their colours, and the
Spirit over-powers the ſoule, ſo as it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the ſoule to hate ſin, and leave it.</p>
               <p>3. The Spirit cauſeth the ſoule to be
more glad when ſin is more diſcovered.</p>
               <p>4. The Spirit of God teacheth the
ſoule effectually to oppoſe all ſinne (even
the appearance of evill) equally, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
and orderly.</p>

to be juſtified by a worke of our owne;
<hi>for with the heart (man) beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10.
9, 10. That which juſtifieth us, muſt be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103276:90"/>
perfect, and ſo it is no act of ours; <hi>for all
our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Iſai. 64. 6. Not of workes, leaſt any man
ſhould boaſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 9. Before wee had
faith, it ſeemes, wee were not in Chriſt,
or in him and not juſtified; for <hi>wee were
in him before the world was,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4.
And that at one time God ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with us (as he is with all unjuſtified
perſons who are out of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
29. <hi>He hateth all the workers of iniquitie,
Pſal.</hi> 5.) and that our beleeving ſhould
make him to be at peace with us: this is
to make God changeable like man, which
is contrary to the Word; for <hi>with him is
no variableneſſe,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. I am the Lord,
<hi>I change not,</hi> Mal. 3. 6. Nothing can be
charged upon Gods elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are juſtified, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. Thoſe
who have no ſin upon them are juſtified,
but Chriſt hath taken away all the ſinnes
of the Elect, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 29. with <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35. 8.
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. Rom.</hi> 6. 6. And to ſay, wee
are not juſtified before God untill we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
is to ſay Jeſus Chriſt hath not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
us, which is contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which ſaith, <hi>Wee are accepted in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103276:90"/>
beloved, in whom we have redemption by his
bloud,</hi> Ep. 1. 6, 7. <hi>We are juſtified by his bloud,</hi>
Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath loved us, and
waſhed us from our ſinnes in his own bloud,
Rev. 1. 5. Wee were reconciled by the death
of his Sonne,</hi> Rom. 5. 9, 10. A full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And in
this God is well pleaſed before wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<hi>Mat. 3. 17. Iſai.</hi> 53. 11.</p>
               <p>Alſo to ſay, we are not juſtified before
God, or in his ſight, untill we beleeve, is
to ſay, we muſt adde our work to Chriſt,
to make up our juſtification before God,
and if it be ſo, then wee in part ſave our
ſelves; and if we doe joyne with Chriſt
in this worke, why may wee not joyne
with him in the glory of it? for that may
be eſteemed one of the greateſt parts of
our juſtification, without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be juſtified. But this derogates from
Chriſt, and all ſuch tenets we are to hate
with execration. For, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have
troden the wine-preſſe alone, and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there was none with me,</hi> Iſai. 63. 3. Wee
rather ſay, if <hi>wee beleeve not, yet he abideth
faithfull, he cannot deny himſelfe,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.
13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:103276:91"/>
What the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath done
for us, is perfect, and is by God imputed
to us, ſo as it is really ours, though it be
inherent in another, and by beleeving it,
wee know it to be ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Not any ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt,
but thoſe who were <hi>predeſtinated in him,
according to his eternall purpoſe,</hi> Eph. 1. 4, 5.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 11. And that there was not any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene
faith or works in any kinde why he
choſe theſe rather then others, the will
of God was the cauſe one was choſen
and not another; all was <hi>according to the
good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe and
glory of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 5, 6. Are we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then they? no, in no wiſe, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
9. It was from his <hi>great love, wherewith he
loved us,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 4. This love of God
was the cauſe of Gods ſending Chriſt,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and the chiefe cauſe of mans
election and ſalvation, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 10. Eph.</hi> 1.
4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23. And that it is impoſſible
for this great love to decreaſe or increaſe,
becauſe it is infinite, as appeares by <hi>Pſal.</hi>
139. 17, 18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. God is perfect
and infinite, he knows and underſtands
all things that ever were, are, or ſhall be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103276:91"/>
at once: So he is one pure act, therefore
when we were <hi>choſen in Chriſt,</hi> wee were
juſtified and <hi>compleat in him,</hi> God looked
upon the Elect to be in Chriſt before the
world was, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. and ſo he ever
lookes upon the Elect: So that they ever
appeare to him perfect and righteous as
Chriſt; for they are one, and <hi>are in him,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>Yee are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and
ever ſhall be in him, being <hi>juſtified freely
by his grace in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. 24.
God properly was never wroth with
Chriſt, nor the Elect, and therefore
Chriſt could not ſuffer Gods wrath; ſee
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. So that in reſpect of their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
God ſeeth no ſinne in any of the
Elect, even before their calling and after.
And as it is Gods will, ſo it ſhould be
ours, to ſet his glory above our ſalvation,
<hi>that in the ages to come, he might ſhew the
exceeding riches of his grace in his kindneſſe
towards us, to the praiſe of the glory of his
grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 5, 6. Epheſ. 2. 7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In time the Elect did breake
a holy and juſt Law, and ſo lay under
the curſe and wrath of it, which was
death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. 23. Chriſt in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103276:92"/>
for our perſons ſuffered death, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 9. (the penalty) to free all the Elect, ſo
that they are now actually juſtified by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
<hi>That he might be juſt</hi> (Rom. 6. 15.)
<hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 25, 26. If God ſhould have juſtified
us, without this propitiation, after he
had made this Law, and we breaking it,
he could not have been juſt, but having
received this propitiation, he could not
be juſt, if he did not juſtifie the Elect,
<hi>That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſoule by faith doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and apply Chriſt, and what he
hath done, to be for him, by which it
knoweth it ſelfe to be juſtified in the ſight
of God, and in the Word, and in his own
conſcience. Whence flowes joy and peace
in beleeving, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. becauſe all that
beleeve are juſtified; <hi>And as many as were
ordained to eternall life beleeved,</hi> Act. 13.
39. 48. So that by beleeving, I know I am
ordained to eternall life, becauſe Gods
word ſaith ſo, and that <hi>wee are juſtified
in his ſight without the deeds of the Law,
Rom. 3. 20. 28. viz.</hi> by faith wee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
our ſelves to be freely and fully ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103276:92"/>
by Chriſt, without any workes of
our own, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. without any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of inherent goodneſſe in us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by our workes in our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſubjection to Chriſt, to his word,
we declare to men (as farre as they can
judge) that we have the faith of Gods
Elect, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 1. Thou, O Lord, knoweſt
the hearts of all men; but faith without
workes is dead</hi> to men, and buried alſo,
<hi>James</hi> 2. 18. 20. If there be no workes,
they can ſee nothing of it; <hi>ſhew mee thy
faith by thy workes; Yee ſee then how by
workes a man is juſtified,</hi> 21. 24.</p>
               <p>In the 1. we are juſtified in reſpect of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
knowledge and purpoſe of God <hi>in his
ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20.</p>
               <p>In the 2. we are actually and vertually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
juſtified in Juſtice by the bloud of Chriſt,
which payd the debt: now the full price,
the full debt being paid, is it juſtice in
law by God or man, to require it againe?
ſurely no.</p>
               <p>In the 3. wee are juſtified in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
by the holy Spirits manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and application of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In the 4. and laſt, we are juſtified before
men, or unto men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſo, that men are loved
of God, &amp;c. before they repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
then men may live as they liſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are to own and confeſſe the
truth, and not what men of corrupt
minds, and baſe ſpirits, will ſay, and
will doe: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin,
we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus
Christ the righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. But what
if one ſay, it ſeemes the Apoſtle incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
men to ſin, to tell them there is an
Advocate, who is alwayes heard. And the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Where ſinne hath abounded,
grace did abound much more,</hi> Rom. 5. 20.
By the Apoſtles anſwer (it appeares ſome
did ſay, they might continue in ſin that
grace might abound) what ſhall wee ſay
then, ſhall <hi>we continue in ſinne, that grace
may abound? God forbid: how ſhall we that
are dead in ſin live any longer therein, &amp;c.
Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2. But this is an old cavill and
ſlander caſt upon thoſe that teach the
truth, as the Apoſtle ſaith it was then in
his dayes; <hi>We be ſlanderouſly reported, and
as ſome affirme, that we ſay, let us doe evill
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103276:93"/>
that good may come, whoſe damnation is juſt,
Rom.</hi> 3. 8. Their exception is againſt the
truth of God, and therfore we leave them
to God to anſwer and ſatisfie them. And
though all the Elect are freed from the
curſe of the Law, yet <hi>we eſtabliſh the Law,
Rom.</hi> 3. 31. We receive the Law from the
hand of Jeſus Chriſt to be a rule for us
to walke by; and <hi>herein is my Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
that yee bring forth much fruit,</hi> Joh.
15. 8. And the Saints injoy ſweet privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
by walking cloſe with God; ſee
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 14. To him that orders his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God,
Pſal.</hi> 50. 23. God <hi>ſheddeth his love</hi> into the
hearts of his (in his time and meaſure)
which love ſo <hi>conſtraines them,</hi> that they
cannot chooſe but love God againe <hi>for
his great love,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. Epheſ. 4. 6.
2 Cor. 5. 14. Which love as it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by them, ſo it conſtraines them
to obey him; and there is no <hi>faith</hi> true,
but <hi>that which workes by love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.
and to all that love God, <hi>his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not grievous,</hi> Joh. 14. 15. 1 Joh.
5. 1. 3. And God hath <hi>choſen us that wee
ſhould be holy and without blame before him
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103276:94"/>
in love,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>&amp; 2. 10. &amp;</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>But this doctrine hath ever been ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <head>Of infirmities.</head>
               <p>An infirmitie is ſuch a weakneſſe, as
when the heart is upright, yet by reaſon
of ſome impediment it cannot doe the
good it would, and doth the evill it
would not. Infirmities are the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

which ariſeth from ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which a man would faine remove
but cannot. There is an infirmitie that
ariſeth for want of growth in grace. A
ſin of infirmitie is alwayes with griefe and
ſorrow, and where there is no griefe for
it, it is no infirmitie. It is a ſin of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

abound, God forbid,</hi> Rom. 6. 1, 2, 3, 8. but
in obedience to God, and love to him,
uſe all meanes againſt it, all thy dayes
ſtrive againſt it in the ſtrength of Chriſt,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Be not over-preſſed and ſunk
under it, but live by faith in all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
ſay as <hi>Paul, I glory in my infirmities,</hi>
not as they are ſins, but becauſe by them
Gods power and goodneſſe is the more
ſeene, both in pardoning, and healing,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103276:97"/>
ſee <hi>Rom. 5. 20. &amp; 6. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 12. 9.
Rom.</hi> 3. 7, 8. &amp;c. What if I ſhould ſay,
all the Lords are the more happy they
were ſinners, elſe how could they have
been capable of mercy, and heaven, and
union with God, &amp;c. If there were not
evill, it would not be knowne what is
good; juſtice and mercy had not been
known, therefore how could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God be
knowne? his wiſdome in drawing good
out of evill, nor his infinite love in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt to dye, could not have been
known, and man could not come to that
full happineſſe in Chriſt, if there had not
been ſin. Sin ſhould not hinder our faith,
it is hard to beleeve the pardon of <hi>ſeventy
ſeven ſinnes in a day,</hi> yet faith is able to
beleeve it, and alſo to keep a ſinner from
being perplexed in his ſpirits with any
ſinne or trouble, ſo as to hinder the ſoule
from rejoycing in God <hi>all the day long:</hi>
faith looks to Jeſus Chriſt, his bloud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
and obedience, <hi>who hath payd
all our debts,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. and now <hi>wee are
not under the Law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.
15. So that the weakeſt beleever may ſay
in the middeſt of all, my imperfections
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103276:98"/>
have as much of the love or God, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him, acceptation, reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
full and perfect righteouſneſſe in
Chriſt, to cover all my defects, as the beſt
Saint ever had, and my ſtate ſhall be as
happie as any of theirs, and were it not
for Chriſt, all their holineſſe could not
helpe them, and they might cry they are
unprofitable in all, and had alſo periſhed
in their ſinnes. <hi>Can a man be profitable to
God,</hi> Job 35. 7? Surely no; and what ſhall
hinder me of having as much happineſſe
and glory in heaven, as the beſt Saint?
Oh who can expreſſe the ſweetneſſe that
is in this doctrine of free grace to an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoule! and it is wonderfull ſweet, and
it is a ſtrong tie to God in all holineſſe.
I know men of baſe ſpirits, unbeleevers
will catch at what I ſay, but if they doe,
who can helpe it? the children muſt have
bread, and if ſuch dogs will ſnatch it, to
their perill be it; as for you who love ſin,
ſo as you are not willing to part with
your ſinnes, that you deſire to make
<hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Covenants with ſinners, hell,</hi>
and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>the devill,</hi> you take incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to ſin, becauſe God is rich in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103276:98"/>
grace, &amp;c. Oh conſider, if yee have hearts,
yee are thoſe who turne the grace of God
into wantonneſſe, yee are ſtill in your
ſinnes, yee are the dogs, touch it not, it is
not for you; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is not meet

6. A childe of God is deſcribed by a <hi>deſire
to feare the Name of God,</hi> Nehe. 1. 11.</p>
               <p>1. Thoſe that live the life of faith in
infirmitie, they eye Chriſts ſanctification,
and injoy comfort in it.</p>
               <p>2. There is a harmony between that
ſoule, and Gods command, <hi>Speake Lord,
for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>3. He is not offended at Chriſt, at any
thing he requires; <hi>Bleſſed is he that is not
offended in me,</hi> Mat. 11. 6. <hi>For this is the
love of God, that we keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and his commandements are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi>
1 Joh. 5. 3.</p>
               <p>4. He lookes at the word of God for
his rule, and his deſire is wholly to be
ruled by it, he will truſt God, and relie

               <p>5. He eyeth Chriſts ſtrength in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

               <p>6. He will with courage incounter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>7. He is ſenſible of good and evill, and
layeth to heart his own and others ſins,

               <p>8. No ſinne he commits doth ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

joy and rejoyce in Chriſt, his joy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is not legall, but evangelicall, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
and therefore may be in one Saint

               <p>The ſecond branch of this life of faith

It is good to ſeaſon, ſtrengthen, and
perfume our ſpirits (if time will permit)
with ſome ſweet thoughts of God, as that
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and to day,
and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. He is not changed.
Here is ſtrong conſolation in this ſweet
meditation, <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be
ſweet,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. <hi>It is good for me to draw
neere to God,</hi> Pſal. 73. 28. To make him
the object and end of all my actions. O
that my underſtanding had a more full,
cleare, and glorious ſight of him, and a
more perfect, inward, eternall, and full
communion with him, then ſhould my
will and affections be more ſatisfied and
more inflamed with unwearied deſires,
high and reſtleſſe aſpirations after freſh
additions of intercourſes and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him. The ſight of God to a Saint
is glorious, and the knowledge and often
meditation of him will raiſe and inlarge
the ſoule: Every childe of God hath in
him an earneſt deſire to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, to injoy his bleſſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and to ſee his glory. <hi>As the Hart
panteth after the water-brookes, ſo panteth

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103276:117"/>
for God, when ſhall I come and appeare before

and full: it is a contempt of God
to be willing to live without him, and
ſo much he injoys God as he ſeriouſly
minds him, and ſo much as wee deſire
God, we follow after God, for deſire is
the ſoules following of God; and as God

Lord fix and faſten the heart upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
it will be fixed on things below,
and wander after vanities, and fill both
head and heart with them: he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what it is to injoy God, is ſenſible of
the want of him, and thinkes he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have enough of him, his ſoule will
faint for him, becauſe nothing leſſe then
God can content him, <hi>Pſal. 119. 81, 82.
Jer. 14. 8. Pſal. 13. 1. Exod.</hi> 33. 13, 14, 15.
18. So the ſoule lives where it loves, and
where it loves it lives, and there is nothing
more active and ſtronger then love; <hi>for
love is as ſtrong as death, the coales thereof
are coales of fire, which hath a moſt vehement
flame,</hi> Song 8. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:103276:118"/>
2. Live by faith. Every day to live by
faith, (in all eſtates and conditions) the
communion the ſoule hath with God is
by faith, in juſtification, in ſanctification,
in infirmities, in graces, in meanes uſing,
in duties, and for a ſupply of all wants,
every day to live the life of faith in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</p>
            <p>3. Watch heart. That every day I
watch my heart, to keepe it continually
ſtill, cleane, ſpirituall, content, and that
I obſerve warily the firſt and ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of my heart, leaſt I be unawares
catched and inſnared in ſinne, and that I
doe not receive any thing without it be
warranted in the word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keepe thy heart with all diligence, for out
of it are the iſſues of life,</hi> Pro. 23. 17. <hi>Thy
heart is deceitfull, take heed of it,</hi> conſider
<hi>Jer. 17. 9. Heb. 3. 12. Luk.</hi> 6. 45. If wee
ceaſe to watch our hearts, they quickly
become vaine. Conſider how it was with
<hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 9. and <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26. 72.
our experience might teach us, that our
hearts are worſe then wee tooke them to
be, when wee are croſſed or tempted, wee
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103276:118"/>
ſhew what metall wee are made of: the
beſt have cauſe enough to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
if one ſinfull thought be admitted
concerning the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure
of ſinne, the will is ready enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the motion, conſent, forecaſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment,
the affections adde heat
and ſtrength, the heart travels with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
and in time by opportunitie ſin is
brought forth: and delight and cuſtome
wraps a man up in ſinne, that he cannot
get out; ſuch careleſneſſe may coſt deare,
though the Elect ſhall miſſe hell; <hi>Lord,
bold up my goings in thy paths, that my foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
ſlip not,</hi> Pſal. 17. 5. <hi>Hold thou me up,
and I ſhall be ſafe; and I will have reſpect
unto thy Statutes continually,</hi> Pſal. 119.
117.</p>
            <p>4. Watch thoughts. Every day to
watch that my thoughts be holy or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and ſeaſonable, to ranke, order, and
confine them within an holy compaſſe,
that I may gaze and meditate on God,
his unmeaſurable goodneſſe, greatneſſe,
beautie, glory, and to bring under and
deſtroy every wicked and vaine thought
and deſire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:103276:119"/>
It is no burden to fix our minds and
thoughts on things above, where our
life, and joy, and treaſure is; <hi>Where your
treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo.</hi>
The more wiſdome leads us on high, the
more is our joy, and the more we avoyd
the ſnares below, and the more wee injoy
God in the inviſible workings, intentions,
deſires, elevations of heart, with thoughts
of ſweeteſt raptures, in which is peace,
joy, triumph, ſearching into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of grace, in which is light, is truth in
its clearneſſe, pureneſſe, fulneſſe, in gazing
upon the moſt glorious object, admiring
God in his infinite attributes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
on Gods boundleſſe mercy in
Chriſt; Such as are exerciſed herein, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
great ſweetneſſe and delight, they ſee
and ſay, as <hi>David, How precious are thy
thoughts to me, O God,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 139. 17.
Such thoughts raiſe the heart, and make
it ſpirituall, joyfull, and thankfull, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ſerious in all duties, and holy
ſervices.</p>
            <p>5. Hearken unto conſcience. Every day
to watch and hearken to the noyſe of
conſcience, that I may priſe the peace of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103276:119"/>
it, indeavour to informe it, and to doe
nothing that ſhall offend it: <hi>And herein
doe I exerciſe my ſelfe, to have alwayes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
voyde of offence towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
man,</hi> Acts 24. 16. <hi>Holding the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of faith in a pure conſcience, 1 Tim.</hi> 3.
9.</p>
            <p>6. Watch affections. Every day to
watch that my affections be ſet right,
and that they move not without or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my judgement, and that they be
ſet upon right objects, and that they ſoare
not too high, nor deſcend too low, but
according as the object deſerves; meanly
affecting meane things, and not affecting
corrupt reaſon, as paſſion, &amp;c. That my
delight be not ſet immoderately upon
any earthly things, though never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
deſirable, or amiable, and ſo to
injoy them, as expecting every day or
houre to loſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Set your affections on things above,</hi> Col.
3. 1. 5. Affections are the pulſes of the
ſoule, and ſhew the ſtate of it; the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are the motions of the will, and
the will is the principall ſeate of grace;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103276:120"/>
grace hath its birth in the underſtanding,
but her ſeate is more principally in the
will actually and formally, therefore the
will is much to be obſerved in its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
inclinations, motions, which are the
affections of the ſoule: all affections may
be comprehended in love and hatred; the
firſt comprehends deſire, delight, joy,
hope, theſe are the acts of love, and theſe
are chiefly to be given to God, wee muſt
make him our truſt, love, joy, delight,
and our all in all, eſteeme and affect all
things elſe under him and for him; he is
all-ſufficient, therefore we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our ſelves with him, and to love him
dearly, then are the affections ſet right,
<hi>when with God wee are ſicke of love,</hi> Song 2.
5. Forſake not God, who <hi>is a living foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
for <hi>broken Ciſternes,</hi> Jer. 2. Love is
the ſweeteſt affection, it's pity it ſhould be
ſpent and loſt upon vanities. And when
we ſet our affections ſtrongly on things
below, it's a mercy for God to take them
from us, to teach us and cauſe us to take
more delight in God himſelfe, and thoſe
true, unſpeakeable, and everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
prepared for the Saints with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103276:120"/>
Surely wee have cauſe to lament,
that we are ſo ready to ſet our affections
on things below, that they are ſo ſtrong
and unruly, and ſo hardly ſubdued, that
it is not an eaſie thing to maſter our wils
and appetites, they ſo rage and dote ſo
vehemently after vanities: <hi>vanitie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all is vanitie,</hi> Eccl. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>7. Watch time. That every day I
watch and endeavour to redeeme time,
becauſe it is precious, to improve it, to
know truth, to injoy and obey God, and
to ſerve others in love, <hi>redeeming the time
becauſe the dayes are evill,</hi> Eph. 5. 16.</p>
            <p>Alſo our time is ſhort, it's but as a
thought, a ſhadow, a dreame, a ſpan long,
it is our duty and wiſdome to preſerve
and redeeme time for every purpoſe and
action. <hi>Paul</hi> improves his time, by <hi>the
ſpace of three yeares I ceaſed not to warne eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one night and day with teares,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.
31. Yet we loſe many houres needleſly, in
ſleeping, in trifling, in idle viſits, &amp;c. In
which time good might have been done
to many.</p>
            <p>8. Watch ſenſes. Every day to watch
the windows of my ſoule, my ſenſes, as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103276:121"/>
eares, eyes, from unlawfull objects, and
lawfull, when I perceive they would ſuck
evill from them, and ſhutting my eyes
and eares, if need be.</p>
            <p>He ſhall dwell on high, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſtoppeth
his eares from hearing of bloud, that ſhutteth
his eyes from ſeeing of evill, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Thus we are commanded, to <hi>take heed,
watch, and pray,</hi> Mark. 13. 35. ſo <hi>take heed
what yee heare.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> deſire to
God, <hi>Turne away mine eyes from beholding
vanitie,</hi> Pſal. 119. 37. <hi>Job</hi> ſaw a neceſſitie
to <hi>make a Covenant with his eyes,</hi> Job 31. 1.
For Satan is ready to convey much evill
inſenſibly through theſe floud-gates of
ſin; bad diſcourſe inflames luſt; <hi>Davids</hi>
roving eye cauſed him to fall foully, and
procured him much vexation and griefe;
who could have thought an idle glance
could occaſion ſo much miſchiefe? Expect
no better fruit in ſuffering your hearts to
run after your eyes; fancy will take fire
before we be aware; but a <hi>foole</hi> will take
no warning, he <hi>will have his eyes in every
corner of the earth,</hi> Prov. 17. 24. he muſt
and will hearken unto a tale-bearer,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103276:121"/>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 23. And ſo he hath his heart fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with anger and revenge, but when he
is wiſer, he will cry out with ſhame and
griefe, <hi>that all is vanitie and vexation of
ſpirit,</hi> as Eccleſ. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>9. In outward things. Every day to
watch to make ſome good uſe, and draw
inſtruction from the creatures and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Gods providence, ſo to mind hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things by naturall.</p>
            <p>So did Chriſt upon mentioning of
bread, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Theſe things below make themſelves
wings, and fly away; but fly thee, by them,
from them, before them.</p>
            <p>10. Watch in lawfull things. Every
day to watch narrowly with care and
heedfulneſſe in the uſe and injoyment of
things lawfull, <hi>viz.</hi> meat, drinke, ſleepe,
apparell, marriage, viſitations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our nature is prone to exceſſe herein,
and we oft ſinne more, and are in greater
danger, by lawfull things, then by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
becauſe wee feare groſſer evils
more then we do the ſecret inſnarements
that attend lawfull things, ſo that many
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103276:122"/>
are deceived, and inſnared, and inſenſibly
drawne into many exceſſes, before we be
aware, to the diſhonour of God, &amp; griefe
of our ſelves, and others; <hi>the fooles minde</hi>
was all for his <hi>eaſe and his belly, meate and
drinke,</hi> Luk. 12. 19.</p>
            <p>11. Watch in things indifferent. Every
day to watch that I uſe not indifferent
things ſecurely and careleſly, but to have
regard to others weakneſſes, indevouring
that my actions be ſuch as I may defend
with a good conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things are pure, but it is not lawfull
to doe things with offence, it is good neither
to eate fleſh, nor drinke wine, nor do any thing
whereby thy brother ſtumbleth,</hi> or is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or made weake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21, 22.
Theſe words doe prove that wee ought
to forbeare the doing of that which is in
it ſelfe lawfull (if it can be omitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin) in caſe another is not perſwaded
of the lawfulneſſe of it, and ſo is offended
at it: I grant he takes offence when none
is given, for if I doe that which is lawfull,
I give no offence; therefore in being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it is his fault and weakneſſe, yet if
I know he is offended with it, and yet
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103276:122"/>
ſhall do it, &amp; he therewith is grieved, &amp;c.
I in ſo doing ſin againſt God and him;
though otherwiſe I might doe it, yet in
this caſe it is condemned in the Word,
and it cannot defend it with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>12. Watch againſt ſinne. Every day
to take heed and watch againſt every ſin,
and that I defend no ſinne in my ſelfe,
nor leſſen it under no pretence of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
temptation, or for the ſweetneſſe or
ſmalneſſe of it; nor inwardly favour it,
but to reſolve againſt all ſinne, with the
occaſions of it, and the appearance of it,
to be jealous againſt it, and fearful of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by it, and ever to ſhew ſome diſlike
of it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17.</p>
            <p>Looke we to ſin at the firſt motion of
it, conſider we the roote of it, and the end
of it, and preſently looke up to God for
ſtrength againſt it, beleeve and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, and avoyd all the occaſions of
it: <hi>Come not neere the doore of her houſe,</hi> Pro.
5. 8. Firſt, we ſhould be afraid to ſinne,
becauſe we are commanded to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
by God; ſecondly, leſt by it we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God, his truth, and ſervants;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103276:123"/>
thirdly, leſt by it we incourage others to
ſin; fourthly, and fill our ſoules with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
becauſe wee have ſinned againſt ſo
great, and gracious, and loving Father.
A ſenſibleneſſe of ſinne, and a heart eaſily
touched with remorſe for it, may ſtand
with the aſſurance of pardon of it, and
when any hath by reaſon of frailtie ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
though it ſeeme to be in the leaſt
meaſure, abhorre it with the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
and cover it not with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
or pretenſes whatſoever; ſee <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.
2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>13. Every day watch the tongue. To
watch that my ſpeech be not vaine, and
idle, and frothy, but powdered with ſalt,
to take heed of ſpeaking againſt others,
eſpecially ſuch as are the Lords, that I
diſgrace none, nor inſult over any, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
my own weakneſſes, and that
I wreſt not mens actions and words, but
take them in the beſt ſenſe, ſo farre as I
can, with a good conſcience, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice of the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Idle words are forbidden;</hi> Let your ſpeech

Every day to obſerve the paſſages of my

            <p>18. To ſympathize with others. Every

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103276:126"/>
croſſe our ſelves, if we could deny our
ſelves, every thing would be eaſie for us
to doe; for all things are ſo ſure under us,
as we are above our ſelves: in the ſame
meaſure we are ſpirituall, or live by faith,
ſo much we deny our ſelves, ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

the troubles and indignities of this

            <p>21. To be humble. That in all my

Rom. 12. 11. Jam. 5. 16. Fervent prayer.</hi>
Chearfulneſſe; <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.
16. A chearful and a willing ſpirit is moſt
ſutable and acceptable, wee oft looke not
ſo much what is done, as from what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
it is done, an unchearfull ſpirit is
ſoone weary, if we be overwhelmed with
ſorrow, feare, &amp;c. and if we be filled with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103276:127"/>
lightneſſe, vanitie, wee are unfit for any
ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>22. Watch in uſe of meanes. That I
uſe the meanes to injoy and increaſe in
holy reſolutions, deſires, purpoſes, &amp;c.
to injoy God, and the things of God for
God.</p>

O let me not wander from thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.

a poore Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Oh the ſtrong and reſtleſſe deſires, and
the unweariedneſſe thereof after God, of
a heart touched with his love, and taſted
of his ſweetneſſe!</p>
            <p>23. Watch to joy in God. That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day I rejoyce in God, my union with
him, and intereſt in him, and priviledges,
and happineſſe by him, &amp;c. and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
of his graces, and his word, and
Saints, as the temptations, chiefeſt joy,
and greateſt advantage.</p>
            <p>I was in his love before the world was,
love was the cauſe he ſhed his bloud for
me, it is his love that preſerves me, and
crowned with it I ſhall be to all eternitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:103276:127"/>
24. That I ſcorne none. That I ſleight
none, nor checke any with their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of body, dulneſſe, or weakneſſe of
wit, or memory, meanneſſe of outward
eſtate, birth, or ſmalneſſe of gifts, parts,

            <p>Conſider, <hi>who made the difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and thee, ſee 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Job</hi> 10.

God onely maketh the difference, and if
God ſhould convert him, he may ſoone
become better then thee or me.</p>
            <p>25. To know the vanitie of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Every day to conſider the vanitie of
theſe outward things, and the hurt wee
receive by them, how wee exceed in our
affections unto them, notwithſtanding
they are not ours, and may in a leſſe time
then an houre be taken all from us, or us
from them, and that we are often diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and unſetled by them, to the end I
may with more content want them, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103276:128"/>
be weaned from them in my injoyment
of them, and ſo to uſe the liberties of this
life ſoberly, ſo as to be bettered by them.</p>
            <p>All things below are full of tranſitori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
mortalitie, and change, <hi>vanitie of
vanities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all is vanitie,</hi> Eccl. 1. 2. Theſe
<hi>things are under the Sunne,</hi> Eccle. 2. 7. (but
above is conſtancy, and eternitie of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
perfections, and pleaſures) we
have no certainty of any thing below,
<hi>Eccl. 1. 2. 1 Cor. 5. 25. Pro. 23. 4. Luk.</hi> 12.
15. Experience makes it appeare, the more
men poſſeſſe of outward things, the leſſe
many uſe and injoy, the more wee love
them, the more we are croſſed with them,
and the more they have, the more they
are in want, becauſe of their inſufficiency,
uncertainty, and periſhing nature. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
oft payeth for mens getting riches,
and oft ſuffers moſt by them.</p>
            <p>26. Watch in ſolitarineſſe. That every
day I be well imployed, eſpecially in my
retiredneſſe, and ſolitary ſeaſons, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
needleſſe feares, thoughts of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſinne, paſt, preſent, or to come,
leſt ſuch thoughts cauſe ſinne upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:103276:128"/>
Experience may teach ſome, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
temptations have come more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter
and ſtronger, when alone, and
that they have then ſinned more freely in
their imaginations; oh curſed contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
that pollutes ſoule &amp; body with
ſenſuall filth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 9, 10. and renewed
guilt; nor is it good for a weake beleever
to affect ſolitarineſſe, Satan is more bold
when thou art moſt ſolitary, and his
temptations then take a deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>27. Watch to ſpeake for truth, &amp;c.
Every day, as occaſion is offered, that I
earneſtly contend for the truth, <hi>Jude</hi> ver.
3. own it, maintaine it, and thoſe that are
unjuſtly accuſed, and count it a glory to
be reproached and diſgraced for Chriſt
and his truth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>28. Watch to doe duties. Every day
to catch at all opportunities of receiving
and doing good, ſhunning evill, and with
conſtancy nouriſh all good and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and conſider what times we live in,
and what they afford, and how I may

            <p>29. Watch againſt covetouſneſſe. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>Conſider, <hi>Mat. 25. 14. Luk. 6. 2. Mat.</hi> 6.

            <p>30. To looke for trouble. Every day
to expect trouble and croſſes, and looke
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103276:129"/>
upon all that befals me, as appointed and
ordered by God for my good in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
love, and mercy, that ſo I may be
thankfull for them, and not fret, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing can befall me without the
will of God, and that it is ſent in love,
and is beſt for me, and that God will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his all-ſufficiency whatſoever I
ſhall need, and that I deſire not freedome
from trouble, but a free ſpirit, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
heart to God in it, and to expreſſe
in every trouble, wiſdome, patience, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
comfort, willingneſſe, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
thankfulneſſe, and faith in God,
and that I indeavour to comfort others
in their trouble.</p>
            <p>We ſhould not looke to be exempted
from troubles, the whole courſe of a Saint
in this life is a life of <hi>trouble,</hi> and ſuffering,
yea, <hi>more then other men,</hi> Pſal. 73. 5. All
our croſſes, &amp;c. are Chriſts ſervants, they
are under Chriſt, they come and goe at

they have done what they come for;
therefore be not impatient at them, <hi>fret
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103276:130"/>

and unſutable for a Saint, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11.
13. Our ſpirit ſhould be above, and rule
and over-rule things below, and not be
ruled by them; a Saint ſhould be under
nothing beneath it ſelfe: if we ſhould <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi>
in trials, &amp;c. inward, outward temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
deſertions, conflicts, outward
troubles, and death it ſelfe, (is to make us

much more ſhould we be content and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient?
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 18. Lord, I will beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, becauſe my ſinnes are forgiven
me: a conſcience ſo ſet at libertie, can
with eaſe undergoe a great burden. Bees
gather honey of bitter flowers as well as
ſweet, and cannot we doe ſo from bitter
conditions? outward bondage is not much
to an inlarged and free ſpirit; what can
doe much hurt, when all is well within?
all is light and eaſie to him that can deny
himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:103276:130"/>
What God takes away one way, he can
give it in another, which will be better;
<hi>How ever it be, yet God is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and good to
<hi>me,</hi> who will ever remaine ſo to be, and
be the ſame to me. We have his promiſe,
that <hi>wee ſhall not want any thing that is
good for us,</hi> Pſal. 349, 10. Therefore when
I thinke I want, I will not beleeve I want,
and that I have what I want, when I doe
not ſee it, when I ſee not outward things,
I ſee God can give, and I may have the
comfort of them without them, eſteeme
God above all, and ſet him againſt all;
what God conveyd before by meanes, he
inſtilles immediately from himſelfe; the
immediate comforts are the ſtrongeſt;
ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 32. and when all <hi>forſooke Paul,
yet God ſtood by him;</hi> and ſo it was with
Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 20. Saints that are poore,
and under abaſement, may be <hi>richer in
faith,</hi> Jam. 2. 5. and have more experience
of Gods faithfulneſſe, care, and love, and
ſee more of their own hearts, be more
humble, more ſpirituall, and live more
upon God, and more weaned from the
world, then thoſe Saints who are richer;
the meaneſt are as happy, and as free from
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103276:131"/>
cares as the richeſt, and their ſleepe is as
ſweet; therefore take we heed of ſin, and
then let come what can; Sin not, to avoyd
trouble, for that is the way to bring grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trouble upon thee, for ſin defiles, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts,
inſnares, and ſtraitens a ſoule;
where the ſpirit is inlarged, it is not much
troubled at outward bondage, if it be
lightſome, outward darkneſſe will not be
burdenſome, if the Spirit be ſound, it can
beare troubles, ſickneſſe; nothing can be
very ill, when all is well within, what can
be grievous to him, whoſe eye is fixed in
heaven, and knowes it to be his owne?
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
            <p>We ſhould not looke ſo much at trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or freedome from it, as to God for
profit by it, comfort in it, ſtrength to
beare it; oh let no trouble trouble thee,
for when God ſeemes to leave thee, he is
neere to helpe thee, when he hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he ſeeth and will provide helpe for
thee; as <hi>Gen. 22. 14. He is all ſufficient,</hi> Gen.
17. 1. and he is <hi>faithfull</hi> that hath ſaid,
all is ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 23. And <hi>that wee ſhall
not want</hi> that which is for our good, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
34. 9, 10. The ſame faithfulneſſe will

make it good; <hi>therefore I ſhall not want
what ever can come,</hi> ſhould each Saint
ſay.</p>
            <p>31. Watch to ſhew mercy. Every day
as occaſion is offered, to ſhew mercy and
pity to others in their miſery, to ſupply
their neceſſities, freely and willingly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my ability, and that I be more
induſtrious, and more moderate in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
to ſupply others wants, eſpecially
the Saints, if it be above my abilitie, with
an open heart, hand, houſe, joyfully and
compaſſionately to ſupply the Saints ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities:

            <head>SOME
CONSIDERATIONS
againſt ſinne, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to prevent ſinne.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſider, it's Gods command
that wee avoyd ſinne, and
ſubdue it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God ought to be
wonderfull powerfull in us, and over us,
and did wee know the majeſty and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the command of an infinite
and eternall God, we neither could nor
would doe that he forbids to be done.</p>
            <p>2. Know, it's the worke of God to
ſubdue the leaſt ſinne, we cannot do it of
our ſelves, therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me yee can doe nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 5. Yet
we are to uſe the meanes he appoints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſinne, and to ſtrive againſt it in his
ſtrength, and alwayes reſiſt ſinne and
Satan.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider ſinne in the nature of it,
and in the root and fruit of it; the want
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103276:134"/>
of a true ſight of ſinne, is a cauſe why men
love ſinne, and ſleepe ſo ſecurely in it.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider, ſinne is the price of <hi>bloud,
Mat.</hi> 27. 6.</p>
            <p>5. Conſider, there is nothing in ſinne
why we ſhould deſire it, there is no true
ſweetneſſe in ſinne, no true contentment
and ſatisfaction there: the fruit ſinne
beares is miſerable deſtruction at the beſt,
is wounds, ſorrow, bitterneſſe, ſhame, &amp;c.
I appeale to your experience, what fruit
have yee ever found come of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it not fill you with horror, or rob you of
peace, or diſable you for the ſervice of
God, &amp;c. <hi>What fruit had you of thoſe things
whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21.
Pro. 23. 8. <hi>Sinne fights againſt your ſoules,</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. it diſgraces the truth, grieves
the Saints, by it we doe what we can to
deſtroy others, harden their hearts, and
hinder them of receiving the truth, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
men in ſinne, and open their mouths
againſt God, and his truth and ſervants.</p>
            <p>6. Be ſure you avoyd the occaſions of

ſhut your eyes, ſtop your eares, take heed
to thy tongue, take heed of exceſſe in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking, and pampering the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Some have ſo pampered their bodies,
that they could not rule them, their want
herein hath cauſed them to want no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and ſuch as avoyd not the occaſions
of ſinne, let them not looke to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

the prayers of ſuch as are the Lords, that
thou maiſt withſtand ſinne, and Satan,
and get others to watch over you, that
<hi>you order your ſteps by his Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.
133. Receive reproofe willingly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably,
and thankfully.</p>
            <p>8. Indeavour to know Satans ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,
be not ignorant of his enterpriſes,
he uſeth to double his aſſaults when he is
reſiſted, that ſo he might perſwade men,
the more he is reſiſted, the more they ſhall

of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>of the houſhold of

<hi>We were ſometimes darkneſſe, but now we are

Kings and Prieſts to God,</hi> Rev. 5. 10. It is

Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4. 17. <hi>This I ſay and reſtifie in

Chriſt <hi>gave himſelfe for his, that they ſhould

upon you, <hi>Heb. 4. 14. Pro. 15. 3. &amp;</hi> 16. 6.</p>
            <p>11. Let the <hi>love of Chriſt conſtraine</hi> you
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103276:135"/>
to hate and oppoſe every evill way.</p>
            <p>12. Nouriſh the motions of the Spirit,

23. Reforme the inſide, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 4. and
Satan ſhall not prevaile.</p>

the pleaſures of ſinne are but for a ſeaſon,</hi>
Heb. 11. 25.</p>
            <p>15. Know your intereſt in Chriſt,

ſinne.</p>
            <p>16. Hearken unto the noyſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
if conſcience ſaith, doe it not,
hearken unto it, doe it not, leſt conſcience
be ſilent, and yee hardened.</p>
            <p>17. When the pleaſure of ſinne is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto thee, preſent to thy thoughts
the ſting ſinne will leave behinde it, with

What preparation is in generall?</p>
               <p>Preparation, it is an holy conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

rightly diſpoſed, craving his ſtrength to
inable us to a right performing of this

               <p>In particular.</p>
               <p>1. For the perſon, he muſt be accepted,
muſt be a <hi>Sonne,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. Alſo all that

               <p>4. Before thou prayeſt, ſpend a little
time, ſome thoughts concerning what
God is, and what may raiſe thy heart, and
incourage thee to draw neere to God.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103276:140"/>
Conſider what be thy chiefe wants, lets,

the ſutable promiſes of a ſupply fits the

we have received above others, and
what cauſe wee have to be thankfull to
God.</p>
               <p>5. Prayer requires our ends to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and right placed, as to injoy God,
and for grace to obey him: and laſt and
leaſt of all, for ſuch things as chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
our ſelves, as peace, &amp;c. If the end
be nought, or good, and not right pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
we aske amiſſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>6. Deny thy ſelfe and come empty
headed, hearted, handed, of all that is thy
own, that God and his grace may be all
in all: emptineſſe raiſeth our hearts in
prayer.</p>
               <p>7. Mind thy own inabilitie to doe any
thing that is ſpirituall, and looke up to
Chriſt by faith for ſtrength, eying his
promiſe; we are no more able to pray or
doe any ſpirituall worke of our ſelves,
then to remove a mountaine at once.</p>
               <p>8. Conſider God in his attributes,
that he is great, gracious, mercifull, ſlow
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103276:141"/>
to anger, &amp;c. and that he is ſo to thee,
and that he is neere thee, yea preſent with

his ocean of grace cannot be exhauſted,
ſpent, his fountaine doth nothing decay,
though multitudes draw from it.</p>
               <p>9. When thou comeſt to God, thinke
thou canſt not have too high thoughts
of God, nor too low ones of thy ſelfe:
<hi>Duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18. 27. a <hi>worme, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>

if we could ſee our own filth, we ſhould
ſtinke worſe then the filthieſt carrion in
our own noſtrils.</p>
               <p>10. Come to God with a heart that
is large &amp; chearfull, by faith in aſſurance
of perſon and prayer accepted, hate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitions
and jealouſies of God, ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 65.

Come, O ſoule, rejoyce, be chearfull, for

               <p>11. Be abaſed under thy pride, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
coldneſſe, dulneſſe, deadneſſe, and
breake through all impediments to goe

12. Empty thy ſelfe of all diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
cares, and clogs of ſpirit, that thou
maiſt be free when thou comeſt to God,
hold thy heart cloſe to God, in love,
zeale, meekneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>13. Obſerve fit times and ſeaſons to
goe to God in, yet prefer that ſeaſon
wherein God and thy own heart ſends
thee to prayer before a ſet time, imbrace
it gladly and quickly, ſo ſweet a motion
of the Spirit, put it not by till another

               <p>14. Be ſenſible of others wants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for ſuch as are the Lords, that you
may pray with a feeling of their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>15. Pray for grace to ſtirre thee up to
pray, and fit thee with ſutable matter,
ſutable to the occaſion, either for the
Church, thy ſelfe, or others, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven
us in all, abhorre forme and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pray not in print, they are deadly
enemies to ſpiritualneſſe; pray from an
inward feeling and ſenſibleneſſe of thy

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103276:142"/>
as it makes them that uſe it quite lame;
we are not ſo much to looke to a ſet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

weak expreſſions in uprightneſſe of heart,
the Lord likes well, but if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but well framed ſentences, God
abhorres them.</p>
               <p>16. Above all come to God in faith,
<hi>Rom. 10. 14. How ſhall they call on him on
whom they have not beleeved?</hi> ſee <hi>Heb. 11. 6.
Jam. 1. 6. Mark.</hi> 11. 24. This is the moſt

               <p>17. Read and meditate before prayer,
if time will permit, for the better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our hearts thereunto. The graces of

            <p>6. Whatſoever is truly and ſoundly
collected from Scripture, is to be beleeved
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103276:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and reſted upon, as well as that which is
expreſly written, yet no Ordinance of
Chriſt, nor the adminiſtration of it, but
it is plainly expreſſed in Scripture, and
depends not upon conſequences, much
leſſe meanes.</p>
            <p>7. It is uſuall in Scripture to attribute
that to the inſtrument, that efficacy and
force which belongs to the Author, as
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 16. Rom. 3. 28. &amp; 5. 4. Deut.</hi> 5.
22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. That good meanes may be
reſpected, and bad ſleighted.</p>
            <p>8. In a parable, the minde, ſcope, and
intention of the Spirit of God is to be
marked above all, it muſt be expounded
and no further ſtrained then things agree
with the principall drift, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 1, 2.
The ſcope is, God is not a debtor to no
man: ſtraine no parable.</p>
            <p>9. We may not interpret Scripture by
allegories, unleſſe we be able to prove the
allegoricall ſenſe by ſome other place of
Scripture.</p>
            <p>10. In interpreting Scripture, we muſt
take the ſenſe from the word, and not
bring one to it.</p>
            <p>11. Compariſon of places together,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103276:156"/>
darker with plainer, is the way to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
            <p>12. There can be but one onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
true ſenſe of one place of Scripture,
which we are chiefly to ſearch after, and
reſt in; wee may not make every Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeake every thing.</p>
            <p>13. The literall ſenſe of Scripture
which ariſeth from the words duly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
is the onely true and proper
ſenſe.</p>
            <p>14. Scriptures muſt be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the largeſt extent of the words,
except there be ſome reſtraint of them by
the matter, phraſe, and ſcope of them,
(as the word <hi>grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 13.) or by
ſome other place of Scripture it appeares
they muſt be reſtrained.</p>
            <p>15. They muſt be expounded ſimply,
according to the letter, except neceſſitie
compell to depart from a literall ſenſe
to a figurative.</p>
            <p>16. Wee muſt not take a figurative
ſpeech properly, nor a proper ſpeech fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively,
<hi>Mat. 26. 26, 27. This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
is a figurative ſpeech; it is a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
to take ſignes for things, of which
words be but ſignes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:103276:157"/>
17. Where there is a ſentence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which hath a tropicall or borrowed
word, we may not think the whole place
figurative, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28.</p>
            <p>18. That which is ſaid to one, muſt be
underſtood to be ſaid to all in the like
caſe and condition, as appeares by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. 5. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. For of
the like things there is the like reaſon and
judgement to be given, let the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
be conſidered wiſely.</p>
            <p>19. A particular example will afford a
generall inſtruction, when the equitie of
the thing done is univerſall, and the cauſe
common, otherwiſe not.</p>
            <p>20. The Scripture puts upon dead
things the perſon of ſuch as ſpeake, by a
fiction of a perſon, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. The firmament
ſpeakes, &amp;c. So <hi>Rom. 19. 20, 21. Pſal.</hi> 98.
7, 8. By this manner of ſpeech wee are
moved to affect the things ſpoken, and
more eaſily brought to underſtand them.</p>
            <p>21. By bodily things the Scripture
leads and lifts us up to divine: thus a hand
applied to God, ſignifieth his working
power, ſo an eye, his knowledge, a heart
his will, his foot his preſence or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103276:157"/>
wings, his care or protection, a
mouth, his word or commandement, a
finger, his might, and a ſoule put for the
eſſence of God.</p>
            <p>22. The Scripture aſcribes the names
of things unto the ſimilitudes and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>23. That expoſition that cauſeth an
abſurditie to follow, is a falſe expoſition,
<hi>Rom. 4. 14. &amp;</hi> 10. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>24. The word <hi>heart,</hi> is commonly put
for the ſoule of man.</p>
            <p>25. There is ſuch a neceſſary and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
relation between faith, and Chriſt
the object, that where one of theſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
alone, the other is included; Chriſt
onely is the matter of our righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>26. The Scripture divers times expreſſes
the antecedent by the conſequent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.
33. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. For not making haſte
in <hi>Iſaiah, Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shall not be aſhamed,</hi>
ſhame &amp; confuſion being an effect which
followeth haſte.</p>
            <p>27. The Scripture uſeth one word
twice in one ſentence, with a different ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 35. Harveſt is taken firſt
for earthly, and in the latter place for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103276:158"/>
harveſt. So the word <hi>water</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi>
4. 13, 14. Firſt, elementary; ſecondly,
ſpiritually, <hi>viz.</hi> the graces of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>28. The word of commanding is often
put for wiſhing, as, <hi>Let thy kingdome come,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hy Name be hallowed,</hi> that is, Oh that thy
Name were hallowed; <hi>Let him kiſſe me,
Song</hi> 1. 1. for oh that he would kiſſe me.</p>
            <p>29. Crying in Scripture doth often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token
a ſtrong noyſe outwardly, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
compunction and fervency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and affection, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Heb.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>30. Things proper to the body are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
unto the ſoule, as hunger &amp; thirſt,
to declare the earneſt deſire of the ſoule;
becauſe the ſoule is unknowne unto us,
the Scripture very oft ſpeaketh of inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things by viſible, and ſhadoweth ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
by corporall.</p>
            <p>31. A hyperbole is ſometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
this kind of ſpeech expreſſeth more
then can be ſignified, by the proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of that ſpeech it increaſeth the
truth, as <hi>Gen. 13. 16. &amp;</hi> 15. 5. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is no more then that his poſteritie
ſhall be very great, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 4. ſo <hi>Joh.</hi>
21. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:103276:158"/>
32. It is uſuall in Scripture to put (<hi>all</hi>)
for <hi>many, 1 Tim. 2. 3. Mat. 3. All Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
and <hi>Mat. 4. 23. All diſeaſes;</hi> So on
the other ſide, <hi>many</hi> is put for <hi>all,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 9. And whether <hi>all</hi> or <hi>many</hi> is meant,
may be knowne by obſerving the matter
handled.</p>
            <p>33. Nothing <hi>is for</hi> little, <hi>Joh. 18. 20.
Alſo</hi> ſmall and none <hi>for</hi> few, <hi>Act. 27. 33.
and</hi> alwayes <hi>for</hi> often.</p>
            <p>34. The negative particle (<hi>not</hi>) is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
put comparatively and reſpectively,
not abſolutely and ſimply, as <hi>Hoſea 6. Not
ſacrifice,</hi> viz. <hi>rather then,</hi> or <hi>not ſacrifice</hi> in
reſpect of mercy, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 33. So <hi>not</hi> is
put for <hi>ſeldome,</hi> Luk. 2. 37.</p>
            <p>35. The word <hi>ever</hi> or <hi>everlaſting,</hi> doe
not properly ſignifie <hi>eternitie,</hi> in every
place where it is uſed, but <hi>great continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 14.</p>
            <p>36. In Scripture the word (<hi>untill</hi>) doth
not alwayes exclude the time following,
but ſignifies an infinite time, or <hi>untill,</hi> viz.
<hi>eternitie, 1 Cor. 15. Mat. 28. 28. Mat.</hi> 5.
26. That is to ſay, never, and alſo a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
limit of time.</p>
            <p>37. The copulative particle (<hi>and</hi>) is
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103276:159"/>
often when it is not joyned to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as <hi>Pſal. 4. Ezek. 2. 1. &amp;</hi> 5. 1. And ſo
often elſe-where: Alſo this particle <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
or <hi>then,</hi> is not alwayes illative or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it coupleth
words outwardly to that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
heard inwardly.</p>
            <p>38. The particle (<hi>if</hi>) is not alwayes a
note of doubting, but of reaſoning, as
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31: <hi>Joel 1. 14. Acts</hi> 8. 22. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it notes the difficultie of the dutie,
and ſometimes the neceſſitie of the thing,
and ſometimes it is put for doubtingly,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>39. When a Subſtantive is repeated or
twice mentioned in one caſe, it ſignifieth
<hi>emphaſis</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> as <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> ſecondly,
a <hi>multitude,</hi> as <hi>droves, droves,</hi> Gen. 32.
16. <hi>many droves:</hi> thirdly, <hi>diſtribution,</hi> as
1 <hi>Chron. 16. a gate, a gate,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 5.
<hi>Levit. 17. 3. a Citie, and a Citie,</hi> that is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Citie: fourthly, diverſitie or varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as <hi>Pro. 20. 20. A weight and a weight,</hi>
that is, divers weights; <hi>An heart and a
heart,</hi> divers or a double heart.</p>
            <p>40. A Subſtantive, repeated in divers
caſes, if it be in the ſingular number, it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103276:159"/>
argueth certainty, as <hi>Sabbath of Sabbath,
Lamentation of Lamentation,</hi> Micah 3. 4.
If it be in the plurall number, it ſignifieth
<hi>excellency,</hi> as <hi>Eccl. 1. 1. Vanitie of vanities,
Song of Songs,</hi> Cant. 1. <hi>God of Gods,</hi> Pſal.
136. 2. <hi>King of Kings, Lord of Lords,</hi> for
moſt high and excellent.</p>
            <p>41. Repeating of an Adjective, and of
a Subſtantive, ſometimes ſignifies increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
as <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah, Jehovah,
Temple, Temple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>42. A Verbe repeated or twice gone
over in a ſentence, makes a ſpeech more
ſignificant, or elſe it ſhewes <hi>vehemency, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
ſpeedineſſe,</hi> as <hi>to dye, by dying,</hi> Gen. 2.
<hi>And is my hand ſhortened in ſhortening,</hi>
Iſai. 30. 2.</p>
            <p>43. A Conjunction doubled, doth
double the deniall, and increaſe it the
more; <hi>Shall not perceive,</hi> Mat. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>44. A figurative ſpeech affords matter
to nouriſh our faith, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 35.
1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. Acts</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>45. An Ironie, which is when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that which is ſpoken is meant,
carrieth with it a juſt reprehenſion of
ſome ſinnes, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. laſt. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 14.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103276:160"/>
               <hi>Mark. 7. 9. 1 Kings 22. 15. Goe up and
proſper,</hi> 1 King. 18. 27.</p>
            <p>46. Queſtions doe ſometimes affirme
an earneſt affirmation, as <hi>Gen. 4. 7. Joſh.</hi>
10. 13. <hi>Joh. 4. 35. Gen. 37. 13. 1 Kings</hi> 20.
2. Sometimes they ſignifie a forbidding,
as, <hi>Why ſhould the Gentiles ſay, where is their
God?</hi> Pſal. 79. 10. alſo 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. And
ſometimes they argue affection of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
compaſſion, fault-finding, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
as <hi>Pſal. 8. 10. Iſa. 1. 21. Pſal.</hi>
22. 1.</p>
            <p>47. Confeſſion and yeelding, hath
ſometime in it a deniall and reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>48. The word, <hi>behold,</hi> is not uſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
or onely to ſtirre up attention, as
the report of ſome weighty or admirable
thing, but moſt commonly it ſignifieth a
thing manifeſt and plaine, where men
may take knowledge, as <hi>Pſal. 51. 6. Mat.</hi>
1. 23. and often elſe-where.</p>
            <p>49. <hi>Doing</hi> doth ſometimes import be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
as <hi>Mat. 7. 2. Joh.</hi> 6. 40.</p>
            <p>50. Negative ſpeeches in Scripture be
more vehement and forcible then affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:103276:160"/>
51. Grammer muſt give place to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie,
becauſe things are not ſubject to
words, but contrariwiſe.</p>
            <p>52. The placing of things before which
ſhould come after, and ſome things after
which ſhould be before, is frequent in
Scripture.</p>
            <p>53. We are commanded to be perfect,
<hi>viz.</hi> in uprightneſſe, ſhining to all duties,
for perfection in meaſure and degree, wee
are not capable of in this world.</p>
            <p>54. All places of Scripture have this
proper to them, that they be interpreted
by the matter handled, and phraſe, ſcope,
end, which is aimed at, or by circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of time, perſons, places, alſo by prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and ſubſequence, by conferring
Scripture and analogie of faith.</p>
            <p>55. Scripture hath allegories, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.
22, 23, 24. An allegory is ever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
according to the meaning and
drift of the place where it is found, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall
ſenſes are not of private motion,
but to be followed where wee have the
Spirit for our precedent and ſubſequent,
by conferring Scripture and analogie of
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:103276:161"/>
56. Numerall words, as, 5, 7, 10, &amp;c.
notes not alwayes a certaine time, as <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie
weeks of captivitie,</hi> &amp;c. yet a certain
finite time is put for an uncertaine often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as, <hi>to fall ſeven times, to forgive ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
times ſeven,</hi> and the like. Alſo divers
numbers be Propheticall, as the number
of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes, or myſticall, as the
number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
            <p>57. The Scripture often in one word
ſaying, uttereth one thing plurally, and
many things ſingularly, as, <hi>Bleſſed is the
man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heare, O Iſrael, and thou ſhalt not
have any ſtrange God,</hi> becauſe God would
have every one to take to himſelfe that
which is meant of that ſocietie and kind
whereof he is one.</p>
            <p>58. In ſetting downe numbers, the
Scripture is not exact to reckon preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as <hi>Luk. 3. 23. Act.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p>59. It is uſuall in Scripture, by a part
to ſignifie the whole, as <hi>Rom. 13. Let every
ſoule be ſubject,</hi> for every perſon, man and
woman; and the whole ſometimes notes
onely a part, <hi>Mat. 3. 5. All Judea,</hi> that is,
a great part.</p>
            <p>60. Some wiſhing ſpeeches be not ſo
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103276:161"/>
much prayers as Propheſies, foretelling
what ſhall be, rather then deſiring they
ſhould be as imprecations againſt <hi>Judas,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>61. The Scripture repeats the ſame
things in the beginning and end of the
ſentence, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 10. It is done by way
of explication, ſometimes for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſometimes for expreſſing or exciting
zeale, as, <hi>Iſa. 3. 9. Joh. 1. 3. Pſal.</hi> 6. 9, 10.
2 <hi>King. 9. 10. Rom.</hi> 11. 8.</p>
            <p>62. In ſundry places of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cited by Chriſt and the Apoſtles,
the ſenſe is kept, but not alwayes the ſame
words, as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15, 18, 19, 20, 21.
and elſe-where. To teach us, that the
Scripture is conſidered by the meaning,
and not by the letters and ſyllables.</p>
            <p>63. Some places in the old Teſtament,
which ſeeme meere hiſtorical, containing
bare Narrations of ſome things done, yet
are myſticall withall, and have a hid and
ſpirituall ſenſe; as <hi>Jonah's</hi> being in the
Whales belly, holds forth Chriſts death,
buriall, reſurrection, for it pleaſeth God
to make ſome hiſtories already done, to
be types and Propheſies of things after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103276:162"/>
to be done; as that of <hi>Hugar</hi> and
<hi>Sarah,</hi> Gal. 4.</p>
            <p>64. The Scripture hath ſundry words
which according to the place where they
be uſed, doe ſignifie divers, yea even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
things, as Leven, to ſignifie the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. and alſo he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
and ſuperſtition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 6. 12.
And ſometime for ſinfull corruption, as,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. So a Lyon ſignifieth Chriſt and
the Devill, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. Likewiſe Serpent is
put in good part, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16. and in ill
part, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. Becauſe theſe things have
ſeverall properties and contrary.</p>
            <p>65. Where the text of Scripture is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,
as it cannot be found out by us
after diligent ſearch, to which ſenſe of
two or three to leane unto, that text may
be interpreted in both ſenſes, if analogie
of faith will ſuffer, &amp; they be not againſt
the circumſtances of the text, for we muſt
not ſwerve from the generall ſcope of the
whole word, faith in Chriſt, and love to
God, and our neighbour.</p>
            <p>66. Many things be firſt generally ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and preſently declared by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2. There be many ſuch
examples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:103276:162"/>
67. Some things in Scripture are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
by our reaſon, yet true.</p>
            <p>68. Such Scriptures as have ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,
are eaſily reconciled by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
reader, as, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. with <hi>Rom.</hi>
9. <hi>Not all.</hi> By <hi>all</hi> is not meant every one,
but of all ſorts and kinds of men, rich and
poore, &amp;c. See <hi>Joh. 5. 17. Gen.</hi> 2. 2. That is,
from making more workes anew of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
So <hi>Mathew</hi> ſpeaks of a ſtaffe which
might cumber and burden, but <hi>Marke</hi> of
one that might eaſe and relieve a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<hi>Mat. 10. 10. Mark.</hi> 6. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>69. Some things are ſaid in Scripture
not according to the truth of the things,
but after their profeſſion, appearance, or
viſibilitie and opinion of the times, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thought. Thus the Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
are termed righteous, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. And
thus hypocrites are ſaid to have faith,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>70. The Scriptures doe not allow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the things &amp; actions from whence
ſimilitudes be fetched, as the manners of
theeves, and unjuſt Stewards, and Judges.</p>
            <p>71. Some of Chriſts workes were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,
and proper to him as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103276:163"/>
but Chriſts morall duties were given
us for example and patterne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29,
30. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 21. 1 Joh. 2. 6. That we ſhould
walke as he hath walked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>72. By the words <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>needy</hi> in the
Scriptures is often to be underſtood all
Gods people, poore or rich.</p>
            <p>73. When ſinfull actions are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God, as to provoke others to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to envie, or to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart,
and the like, we muſt know God tempts
none to ſinne, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. But he doth it
by delivering them over to Satan, &amp; their
luſts, to be hardened, God oft puniſheth
ſin with ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>74. Sundry interrogations in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. have the force
of a negative, that is to ſay, they cannot.
Some againe do ſo aske a queſtion, as they
require &amp; have an expreſſe anſwer, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
15. 1. <hi>Rom. 11. 1. &amp;</hi> 3. 12. It is to quicken
attention, or to urge more vehemently
the affection, or to prepare way for ſome
weightie diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>75. The title (<hi>God</hi>) is ſometimes put
abſolutely, and in the ſingular number,
then it notes the Creator, or the eſſence.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103276:163"/>
Sometimes it is uſed with an addition, as
in <hi>Exodus, I have made thee God of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
or in the plurall number, <hi>Pſal. 84. I
have ſaid yee are Gods;</hi> and <hi>verſ. 1. In the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of Gods,</hi> then it belongs to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. Sometimes eſſentially,
as <hi>Joh. 4. 24. God is a Spirit.</hi> So the word
<hi>Father</hi> is ſometimes put eſſentially for the
deity, <hi>Mat. 6. Our Father.</hi> Sometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
<hi>The Father is greater then I.</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in theſe Rules cauſeth errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God.</p>
            <p>76. Words of knowledge and ſenſe
doe ſignifie (beſides) action and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as. <hi>God knoweth the wayes of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
Pſal. 1. 6. And <hi>that he knoweth who
are his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. Apoc. 2. 3. is meant
he knowes them with love, favour, and
approbation, to reward and crown them.
Alſo it is ſaid, <hi>whom he foreknew,</hi> Rom. 11.
2. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. is meant his eternall
love imbraceth theſe as his owne; for he
knew barely before all reprobates and
devils, and their works too, but not with
favour and allowance. Alſo the word,
<hi>Remember,</hi> is a word of ſenſe, yet it often
importeth care, love, delight, 1 <hi>Cor. 11.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103276:164"/>

            <p>77. Legall and Evangelicall promiſes
muſt not be diſtinguiſhed by bookes, but
by the nature and condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
for Legall promiſes may be found
in bookes of the New Teſtament, as, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5 Gal. 3.
10. 12. And Evangelicall promiſes of
grace are in the old Teſtament, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
132. 1, 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 31, 32. &amp;c. Obſerve
them according to theſe two rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>78. If promiſes of temporall or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
things are propounded upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of workes, they are Legall, Chriſt
onely hath kept the Law, and they which
beleeve are to claime them by this tide
conveyed to them by faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>79. All promiſes for this life or a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which are made as one condition, of
beleeving, repenting, working, (for theſe
are workes though imperfect) are onely
effects and fruits of faith, and not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
nor cauſes, but are onely to declare
what perſons God will ſave; <hi>Godlineſſe
hath the promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim. 6. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. And to underſtand them

            <p>80. Touching ſuch places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
duties are commended and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they muſt be underſtood according
to theſe Rules following; as, 1. though
no word be ſpoken o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt, yet it muſt
be underſtood that he alone is the whole
cauſe of every part of our ſalvation, <hi>Act.</hi>
4. 12.</p>
            <p>81. All morall duties are then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in any partie, when the partie
which doth them, is firſt in Chriſt, and
his ſinnes pardoned through his death,
as 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Our beſt duties
are imperfect, if in Chriſt accepted, if out
of Chriſt, mens beſt duties cannot cauſe
them to be accepted.</p>
            <p>82. All good workes muſt have a pure
heart, Gods glory for the beginning and
the end, having a conſcience to God in
obedience to his Word: unleſſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
be accepted, the bare deed or action
cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>83. Where bleſſedneſſe is promiſed to
morall duties doing, thoſe places are not
to be conſidered as cauſes thereof, (for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:103276:165"/>
Chriſt is the cauſe of all) out onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what perſons they are which God
doth ſave; and what the Saints dutie is
to doe.</p>
            <p>84. Theſe duties muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in the ſtrictneſſe and rigour of the
morall Law, but of a continuall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
deſire, purpoſe, and indeavour to
doe them. This rule prevents ſcruples and
feares, which weake ones have through
the ſenſe of their wants and failings.</p>
            <p>85. The Scriptures uſe to call them
ſonnes, which by nature are no ſonnes to
them whoſe ſonnes they are called, but
they are ſonnes legally, and by ſucceſſion:
thus <hi>Salathiel,</hi> being ſonne of <hi>Neri</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 27. is legally and by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made the ſon of <hi>Jechoniah,</hi> whom he
ſucceeded in the kingdome, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>86. After this manner <hi>Zedekiah</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim,</hi>
1 Chron. 36. 10. and his ſonne,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 16. His brother by generation,
his ſonne by right of ſucceſſion. By this
Rule the two Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> and
<hi>Luke</hi> are reconciled in their Genealogie;
for <hi>Luke</hi> followeth the naturall order,
and <hi>Matthew</hi> the legall order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:103276:165"/>
87. Many things are ſaid in Scripture
by anticipation and recapitulation.</p>
            <p>88. In Scripture ſome things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
well, when righteous things are taught
rightly, as, <hi>Repent and beleeve,</hi> &amp;c. Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
when evill things are taught e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
when wicked things are perſwaded,
as, <hi>To curſe God and dye.</hi> Or thirdly, when
good things are uttered evilly, when ſome
right thing is ſaid with a perverſe mind,
as <hi>Joh. 9. Be thou his Diſciple.</hi> Or fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
evill things well ſpoken, and diſhoneſt
things uttered in honeſt termes; as, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
went in to Bathſheba,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
            <p>89. The Scripture ſpeaks many things
in the perſon of the ungodly men, whoſe
crooked words it doth report unto us as
well as their deeds.</p>
            <p>90. That word which ſeemeth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
goodneſſe, or to command wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
is a figurative ſpeech, as, <hi>Vnleſſe a
man eate my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. This is wickedneſſe,
becauſe the word is pure, it cannot allow
any thing againſt honeſty of manners, or
veritie of faith.</p>
            <p>91. Tropes and figures in Scriptures
are not to be accounted lies; as for Chriſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103276:166"/>
calling <hi>Herod</hi> a <hi>Fox,</hi> and himſelfe a <hi>Vine,</hi>
a <hi>Dore,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe there is no purpoſe to
deceive in them, but by meet reſemblance
to expreſſe the truth.</p>
            <p>92. Similitudes are rather to make
darke things plaine, then to prove any
doubtfull thing; ſimilitudes are not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative,
as Stewards in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>93. To make allegories and figures,
where none are in expoſition, is licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
dangerous, and hurtfull.</p>
            <p>94. In things that be ſubordinate, the
affirming the one doth not ſollow the
denying of the other.</p>
            <p>95. All interpretations muſt be fit as
well as true.</p>
            <p>96. It is a ready way to all error, to
interpret Scripture by prejudice, in favour
of ſome opinion of our owne.</p>
            <p>97. In Scripture a betrothed woman
is called a wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20. and ſo of the
man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 23. Becauſe betrothing is
an eſſentiall part of marriage, yet the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization
is neceſſary unto comelineſſe
and avoyding of offence.</p>
            <p>98. That interpretation is corrupt that
builds not up in faith and love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:103276:166"/>
99. A figurative ſpeech in Scripture
does more affect us with delight, then if
the ſame thing were ſpoken plainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
figures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1. Gods care is ſet
out by a Metaphor of a Shepheard, and
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. Alſo ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2. For
new things ingender delight.</p>
            <p>100. When the Scripture ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
darkly, it uſeth for the moſt part to
joyne thereto ſome plaine thing in the
ſame place to give light to it, as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 1.
The latter part of the 1. verſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard, is opened in the beginning of
the ſecond verſe. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 1. the third
verſe expounds the ſecond; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part of the firſt verſe of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the latter, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. the 5. and
6. verſes, expounds the 3. &amp; 9. 13. 8. <hi>Saith
the word is neere,</hi> that is, the Goſpel. See
the like, <hi>Rom. 8. 20. 31. 2 Tom. 4. 6. Rom.</hi> 11.
7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. yet this Rule holds not
alwayes.</p>

wiſdome, power, love, there is in them

they call men to God, to be for God.</p>
            <p>7. They are not from men, becauſe

            <p>8. They are from God, becauſe God

            <head>Reaſons why wee diſſent
from ſuch as hold free will.</head>
            <p>1. BEcauſe it exempts the creature from
being under the power of God,
for that which giveth a creature power
to doe as he will, when God hath done
all he may unto him, that doth make
him no inſtrument ſubject to Gods
power; for they affirme, that God doth
not worke in his omnipotency, but leaves
it to the free will of the creature. It is one
thing to be able to doe a thing by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:103276:173"/>
and another to doe it by power
which I cannot refuſe, this latter they
deny.</p>
            <p>2. It denies Gods decree to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for either God determines in ſuch
and ſuch caſes, with the circumſtances
thereof, or not, if not, then he cometh
ſhort of the creature herein, for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth
ſuch things in his matters.</p>
            <p>3. If God doth not determine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the creature to will and worke that
which he worketh in the creature, then
the creature is the cauſe why God willeth
this or that, and by conſequence is the
cauſe why he willeth this or that, but
the creature is not the cauſe, &amp;c. Gods
working this or that, muſt either goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the will, and ſo cauſe it to will, or
elſe it muſt follow, accompliſhing that
which mans will willeth, the latter makes
God to follow and tend on mans will.
Alſo it makes the will of man to have a
caſuall force in God himſelfe, as if God
ſhould ſay, I will work converſion, faith,
&amp;c. in ſuch a perſon if he will.</p>
            <p>4. If libertie of will ſtands in ſuch a
power, free for exerciſing good or evill,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103276:174"/>
then Chriſt had not libertie of will, ſon
he had libertie onely to work that which
was good; nor hath man of himſelfe any
libertie or power to come to Chriſt; <hi>For,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>none can come to me, except the
Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6. 44. 37. So that
they are deceived who make God by his
grace to convert us. So that he leaveth it
in our power, whether we will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
or no: but who can reſiſt that
which God worketh by his almightie
power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 20: when he putteth forth
this his power which raiſed Chriſt from
the dead? and if this could be reſiſted, it
were not almightie. The Apoſtle ſaith,
that <hi>the power did worke in him mightily,
Col.</hi> 1. laſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe God in his good pleaſure
of his will, doth freely and effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of all things whatſoever he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
he doth all things according to the
<hi>counſell of his own will,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 11. All
things are in the minde of God before
they are in themſelves, and what he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
he effecteth in his time, and nothing
is done, if he willeth it not to be done,
<hi>Pſal. 115. 3. &amp;</hi> 135. 6. Jehovah doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103276:174"/>
he pleaſeth. The will of God is the
firſt cauſe of things; <hi>By thy will they are,
Rev.</hi> 4. 11. He by willing makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>Jer. 1. 18. He hath mercy on whom he
will,</hi> Rom. 9. 18. and there is no cauſe to
be given of his will; <hi>It's God that worketh
in you to will and to doe,</hi> Phil. 2. 17. And
ſuch as make the will of God to depend
upon the creature, as if he beleeves, God
wills his ſalvation, if he beleeves not, he
wills his damnation, makes Gods will
mutable, and to depend upon the act of
the creature; and then it will follow, ſo
often as the will of the creature changeth,
ſo often God changeth, and then God
will doe this or that if man will: But
whatſoever God willeth in all things he
willeth effectually, ſo that he cannot in
no wiſe be hindered or diſappointed;
for if God ſhould will any thing he could
not obtaine, there ſhould be imperfection
in God, and if he can obtaine it and will
not, how then doth he will it? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.

Jer.</hi> 14. 22. That the bones of Chriſt
ſhould not be broken. By all which it
appeares, the will of God determined
the certainty of the event. And if God
ſhould not determine of all things, the
will of God ſhould not be ſimply and
univerſally the firſt cauſe; and to deny
him to be the firſt cauſe, implies that
there are two firſt beginnings, or more
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:103276:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then two, which cannot be truth. And
for any to ſay, that man hath power to
reſiſt all God can worke for his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
is to put grace in mans power, (and
not mans will under the power of grace)
is to ſay, that man is able to fruſtrate
Gods counſell concerning his converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and power to reſiſt all that God can
worke herein, is to affirme, that man hath
power to fruſtrate Gods counſell; and if
it be ſo, will it not follow that man hath
power to make God a lyer? If God by
his omnipotent power inclines the wills
of men whither he willeth, then he hath
them more in his power then man hath;
then his will decreeing is the cauſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
followeth, and the will of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not the cauſe of the neceſſitie of
things. The Scriptures declare that God
workes all things <hi>after the counſell of his
will</hi> (not mans will) <hi>and made all things
for himſelfe,</hi> Pro. 16. 4. Iſa. 43. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Then you take away the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the will, if man have no power to
doe otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That which doth (not having
power to doe otherwiſe) from ſecond
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:103276:176"/>
cauſes, compelling it ſo to doe in that it
is not free: Gods will in himſelfe is the
firſt cauſe of all things, and this omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
will of God doth determine the
creature.</p>
            <p>2. Men ground the freedome of will
falſly, for the freedome of will as it is a
faculty voluntary or elective, doth not
require this indifferency of the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in exerciſe, for it is bound by Gods
decree, ſo as not any thing can be done
but what he hath determined, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſatisfie ſome, unleſſe it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that they have power of will to croſſe
Gods decree.</p>
            <p>3. If the cauſe why God chooſeth me
(and not another) is becauſe I will, &amp;c.
then it is not meerly from his will, and
then you deny the freedome of Gods will.
Alſo if a man hath libertie of will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
Gods will and worke, ſo as God ſhall
not convert him, it will follow that when
we are converted, we convert our ſelves,
which is contrary to the Scriptures, as,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. And doe not they give the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the lye, that ſay the will of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
man may be free to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:103276:176"/>
will it, and imbrace it when it is
propoſed: But if a ſeeing eye were in
darkneſſe, it could not diſcern any thing,
how much leſſe ſhall the blind ſee? By
nature we are blind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Wee
are darkneſſe, till we be made light in the
Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. Darkneſſe cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the light, <hi>Joh. 1. 5. The naturall
man cannot receive the things of the Spirit,
for they are fooliſhneſſe to him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14.
Therefore the Saints pray to God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
to them the knowledge of Chriſt,
and to inlighten their eyes by the Spirit
of wiſdome and revelation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17, 18:
Mans will being wholly inthralled into
ſinne, as appeares <hi>Rom. 6. 20. &amp; 8. 6. The
carnall mind is enmitie to God,</hi> it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Law of God, nor can be; how
then can it will, deſire, and receive grace
by nature? As God commanded <hi>Pharaob</hi>
to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe, yet he could not, for God
hardened his heart that he could not be
willing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 39. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32.
they confeſſe, that unleſſe God give faith,
it's impoſſible for men to beleeve; ſo then
the reaſon men doe not beleeve, is becauſe
God doth not give them faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103276:177"/>
But to what purpoſe is it for God to give
Chriſt to dye for mens ſinnes, ſeeing as
they confeſſe, they ſhall have no benefit
by him unleſſe they beleeve, and that they
cannot doe without God, and God doth
not give them faith (if he did, they could
not but beleeve) what great love is this
which is ſhewed to them? The ſubſtance
of thoſe famous, or rather infamous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of ours, of ſuch as hold free will,
and that Chriſt dyed for the ſinnes of all
<hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie, is that God wills the
ſalvation of all men, but he is diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his will. Thoſe whom God will
ſave by his antecedent will, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
by his conſequent will: that God
doth ſeriouſly intend the ſalvation of all
perſons, yet nevertheleſſe, he calls men
by a meanes, and time, that is, not apt,
nor fit, by reaſon whereof thoſe who are
ſo called, doe not follow Gods calling.
That faith is partly from grace, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from free will; that God is bound to
give all men power to beleeve. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between the obtaining of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the application of ſalvation;
The firſt, they ſay, is for all; The ſecond
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:103276:177"/>
is onely for them that beleeve, but the
application of ſalvation is neither willed,
nor nilled to men. That man may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and open his own heart, and receive
the word of God; That the reprobate
may be ſaved; That the number of the
Elect is not certain; That the decree of
Reprobation is not peremptory; And
that a Reprobate may convert himſelfe;
And that faith is not of-meere grace.
They bring in God ſpeaking thus; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
to ſend my Sonne to ſave all who
ſhall beleeve; but who and how many
they ſhall be, I have not determined,
onely I will give to all men ſufficient
power to beleeve, but he ſhall beleeve
who will himſelfe: I will ſend Chriſt to
dye for the ſinnes of many, whom I know
it ſhall not be effectuall at all unto, to
whom I will never give faith, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

largely in ſeverall Treatiſes, ſuch as

to them.</p>
            <p>Some affirme, that the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
in Church-fellowſhip, are to be
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:103276:180"/>
baptized, which is now practiſed in <hi>New-England,</hi>
and elſe-where. There are three
doubts to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>1. What if neither of my parents, nor
their parents can be proved beleevers?</p>
            <p>2. Nor any members of a true viſiable
Church?</p>
            <p>3. If I were baptized with god-fathers
&amp; god-mothers, Common-prayer-book,
Croſſe, and Surplice, and by a Miniſter
made by the Biſhops, all which are now
found out to be Antichriſtian, and the
manner of Baptiſme was alſo by ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
water upon my face; concerning
which the Scripture is ſilent: how may
I be aſſured God will own ſuch a bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
for his Ordinance, ſeeing alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
confeſſe, that no man may lawfully
baptize but a true Miniſter that hath a
lawfull calling? And although wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
men able to preach the Goſpel may
baptize, yet we doe not beleeve God ſends
ſuch to baptize, whom he hath not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the manner how to doe it, which
is not by ſprinkling water on the face,
but by dipping in the River, as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.
16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="treatise">

            <head>That the gift of miracles is not
eſſentiall in him that diſpenſeth Baptiſme.</head>
            <p>THat ſome of thoſe that did baptize,
did miracles we grant, and that all
that baptized did ſo, cannot be proved;
<hi>John</hi> baptized, yet he did no miracle,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 41. nor <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. And ſeeing
that the Scriptures doe not declare that
the gifts of tongues, or miracles, or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands, is to be in thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
Baptiſme, we have no word to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
ſuch a reſtriction; men are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
baptiſme by vertue of gifts.</p>
            <p>1. Then that gift and miniſtery which
God in his word owns, is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
ſufficient for his Ordinance; but
ſome one or more of thoſe gifts in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 8, 9, 10, 11. 28, 29. &amp;c. ſtill continue,
as they confeſſe; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. All the gifts of the Spirit are of the
ſame nature, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpirituall, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in operation, and are of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
and ſo to be eſteemed by us,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:103276:181"/>
3. As in the naturall body, wee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and put comelineſſe upon thoſe
parts which we think leaſt honoured, for
our comely parts have no need; ſo ought
we to doe the ſame in ſpirituall gifts, as,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23, 24. Doe they ſo who tie
the adminiſtration to one of the gifts of
the Spirit, and not to another; and doe
not they who ſeeke to honour one gift,
to the diſhonour of another, diſhonour
all the gifts of the Spirit? For as it is in
the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26. ſo it is in this caſe;
and this was the <hi>Corinths</hi> ſin, as appeares
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Wee are all baptized by one Spirit,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. He ſaith not by the gift of
miracles, &amp;c. and he that is baptized by
any gift of the Spirit, is baptized by the
ſame Spirit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>5. If the adminiſtration of Baptiſme
be not annexed to the operation of one
gift of the Spirit, more then to another
of the ſame Spirit, then wee may not ſo
annex them: but to the operation of any
one gift of the Spirit, Baptiſme is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed:
<hi>Ergo:</hi> for proofe, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.
to 14.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:103276:181"/>
6. If God workes in all the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Spirit, then to be baptized by
any of the operations of the ſame Spirit,
it muſt be acknowledged to be the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
of the ſame God: but the firſt is true,
1 <hi>Cor. 12. 6. Ergo,</hi> the latter is true alſo.</p>
            <p>7. If the Apoſtles might baptize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were Apoſtles, then might they
baptize in caſe they had not the gift of
miracles and tongues, &amp;c. For it is one
thing to be an Apoſtle, and another to
have the gift of tongues or miracles, as
appeares 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29, 30. They were
ſeverall gifts, &amp; though they might have
the gift of miracles, it's not becauſe they
were Apoſtles; for they were given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the good pleaſure of his will;
he divides to every man ſeverally as he
will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
            <p>8. If any affirme Baptiſme was to be
adminiſtred by thoſe who had ſuch gifts
of miracles, &amp;c. becauſe thoſe gifts were
greater in operation, and ſo the greater
gifts: I anſwer, the gift of faith is greater
then the gift of miracles, for a man may
periſh with the latter. They confeſſe, ſome
of theſe gifts ſtill continue, if the reſt are
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103276:182"/>
not, then theſe are the greateſt now, and
ſo Baptiſme may be diſpenſed by him
that hath any of them, and if they be cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
might it not be, becauſe they were
Idolized above the reſt of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
            <p>9. It is ſaid, that <hi>Apollo</hi> conferred the
gifts of the holy Spirit by laying on of
hands, becauſe he baptized not untill he
had learned the principles of Religion,
and ſo underſtood the miniſtery of the
Spirit. I anſwer, it follows not, becauſe
it is one thing to underſtand the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Spirit, and another to worke
miracles, and conferre the gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, and ſpeake with tongues, &amp;c.
As it is one thing to learne the doctrine
of Baptiſme, and laying on of hands, and
the reſurrection of the dead, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.
and another thing to have the gifts, and
to conferre them by laying on of hands;
it is one thing to learne and beleeve the
reſurrection of the dead, and another to
raiſe the dead.</p>
            <p>10. They affirme, that thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in truth, are of the body of which
Chriſt is the head, and that they are of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103276:182"/>
the Church, and that many now beleeve.
Whence I alſo inferre, thoſe who are of
the Church of Chriſt, they have the
power of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is theirs,
and Chriſt and his power are never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<hi>Mat. 28. 20. Ergo,</hi> they have the
power of Chriſt, as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22.
Therefore they have authoritie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>They grant, many have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
by the free gift of God, and the
bloud of Chriſt. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Be it ſo. I cannot
beleeve that God gives his a right to any
thing that would doe them no good; and
if the injoying the Ordinance be good,
how can we thinke that God ſo orders it,
that they cannot come by it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.
Chriſt purchaſed no priviledge for his,
which they may be as well without; is
not Gods power as great as his love?
and as the Communion of Saints, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and the Supper, are the priviledges
of the Saints, given them in love, ſo God
hath appointed a way for them to injoy
them, and ſo to affirme, holds forth as
much wiſdome and love in God to them;
as to ſay, God hath given them a right
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103276:183"/>
to ſuch priviledges, but hath not afforded
them any way, or meanes for them to
come by them, that they might injoy
them. But this ſubject is handled at large
in <hi>John Spilsberies</hi> Booke, intituled, <hi>Gods
Ordinance.</hi> It is foretold that Antichriſt
ſhall come <hi>with ſignes and wonders,</hi> as,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 23, 24. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9, 10.
We are not to looke for Chriſt to come
in this way, yet it may be ſaid of ſome,
<hi>Except yee ſee ſignes and wonders</hi> (to ſenſe)
<hi>yee will not beleeve,</hi> Joh. 4. 48.</p>

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:103276:204"/>
honour &amp; comfort of mariage, and ſay,
What is equall to mariage for the being
and well-being of life, it's the prop of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
content, the ayd of nature, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of health, wealth, beauty, honour,
experience, no condition is ſweet where
mariage ſupplies it not, it's the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of chaſtitie, the pillar of the world,
and of the Church, the glory of peace,
and the life of the dead; nothing is ſo
precious in worldly reſpects as that for
which the husband loveth and deſireth
the wife, and ſhee him; no union ſo ſtrong
as this, no joy in any outward union ſo
contentfull as this, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. Nouriſh love, and abhorre all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to the contrary, ſtrive who ſhall
love each other with the moſt cordiall
affection; love is given to both, to make
the miſeries of mariage tolerable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
live and love, and ceaſe not to love,
till yee ceaſe to live: have a care yee loſe
not your firſt love: and ſo demeane your
ſelves, as may beſt draw forth each others
heart in all love and amitie, and ever be
ready to expreſſe love and ſympathy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
a peeviſh carriage, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:103276:205"/>
to wearineſſe, impatience, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
            <p>3. Beare with each others infirmities,
fret not, cavill not at them, cover them
with tenderneſſe: If you have a bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
make the beſt of it you can, now it
is too late to complaine; impart not your
diſcontents to ſtrangers, aske no counſell
of them but with a free conſent of both,
when neceſſitie requires it. Obſerve it,
ſuch as complaine to others, they ſhew
their clamorous and turbulent ſpirits,
and want of wiſdome and love; if thy
husbands or wives vertues be but ſmall,
make them great by contemplation, and
put upon them the great value of their
worth: an eying each others infirmities,
deads and kils the affection of love.</p>
            <p>4. Obſerve each others tempers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
diſcontents, and preſerve your firſt
love.</p>
            <p>5. If there fall out a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you, be both freely willing the
word of God may decide it, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto it, feare breaches, and know a
ſmall ſparke of difference may increaſe a
great flame, if not timely prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:103276:205"/>
6. Be both chaſte, and love each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
company, and be faithfull each to
other; let one purſe, one bed, one houſe,
ſerve them that are but one.</p>
            <p>7. Be induſtrious and provident, that
neither of you may want.</p>
            <p>8. Hinder not each other in ſerving
of God.</p>
            <p>9. Tender each others good name.</p>
            <p>10. Find as little fault one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as poſſibly you can, and then expreſſe
them not in anger, but in love, and when
yee be both alone.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Counſell to the wife.</head>
               <p>1. LOve your own husbands, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
your love in a reverend, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and modeſt manner, in thy husband
thou maiſt behold authoritie, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:103276:206"/>
2. Honour your husband inwardly in
your heart, and outwardly in your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
eſteeme him as he is your ſuperior
and head, and yeeld to him, let your will
be ſubject to his, you muſt have no will
but his, if he ſpeake the word, you muſt
not conteſt, but in humilitie yeeld, if he

what the carriage of the Church ought
to be to Chriſt, to be a patterne for you,
and know where love is, duties are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and acted with eaſe and delight.</p>
               <p>3. Obey thy husband; obedience is a
hard word, many a proud ſtout ſtomack
neither will nor can yeeld their neckes
to the collar of ſubjection in every thing;
the Lord knew how it would come to
paſſe, that both husband and wife would
both have their wills, though each were
quite contrary to the other, therefore
God thought fit to order it as he would
have it, that the wife ſhould yeeld to her
husband, and be obedient to him in every
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing; <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your
own husbands, as unto the Lord; for the
husband is the head of the wife, even as Chriſt
is the head of his Church, &amp;c. Therefore as
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:103276:206"/>
the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt, ſo let the
wives be unto their own husbands in every
thing,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 22, 23, 24. Therefore
know, O woman, whoſoever thou art,
rich or poore, that God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you to be ſubject to your husband,
and if you doe it not, God will call you
to an account for it one day, though it
may be, your husband be contented to
let it paſſe, in the feare of God conſider it,
and tremble at the thought of living in
the breach of ſo plaine and cleare a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
conſider Chriſt is <hi>the author of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. and
no more; therefore goe to God for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and ſelfe-deniall, to ſtoop to thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
command (if it be lawfull) 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God hath commanded it, &amp; though
mariage be an equall ſtate, yet the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of both is not to be the ſame, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let thy love to thy husband be with
a loyall ſweet ſubjection, without ſlavery,
and thy obedience ſhall be a bleſſing to
thee, and an increaſe of thy inward peace
and joy; alſo thou ſhalt avoid many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
envie, and diſcontents, which others
indure, alſo by thy obedience thou ſhalt
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:103276:207"/>
honour God, and be a good patterne to
others to doe ſo alſo.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Counſell to the Husband.</head>
               <p>1. COnſider the command of God is
upon you, that yee <hi>love your own
wives, and be not bitter unto them,</hi> let love
deſcend, firſt from thee, ſhee is a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
object of love, ſhee hath forſaken all
for thee, and perhaps is ſhiftleſſe without
thee, great are her burdens and paines
in conception, and bearing children, &amp;c.
Let thy love to her be full and free, love
her in ſome ſenſe better then thy ſelfe,
and let thy love be conveyed to her with
royaltie without tyranny: <hi>Husbands love
your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved his
Church, and gave himſelfe for it, ſo ought
men to love their wives as their own bodies;
he that loveth his wife, loveth himſelfe,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
5. 25. 28. <hi>For no man ever yet hated
his own fleſh: they two are one fleſh,</hi> 29. 31.</p>
               <p>2. Let her ſhare with thee in the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of thy (graces, gifts,) eſtate, if thou
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:103276:207"/>
haſt plenty, let her have plenty alſo, ſhee
ſhall be ſure to ſhare with thee in the ill,
in povertie, ſickneſſe, diſgrace, and other
miſeries, oh therefore let her ſhare in thy
plenty alſo; let her have for delight as
well as thy ſelfe, make her cauſe thy own,
and doe ſo as thou wouldſt be done unto,
and give it her freely without asking.
Some men have much, and ſpend much
upon their pleaſures, but allow their
wives juſt nothing; ſuch give their wives
ground enough to queſtion their loves
to them, becauſe love is bountifull where
there is plenty; why ſhould not part of
that which is yours be hers, for her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
and comfort?</p>
               <p>3. Eaſe thy wife as much as thou canſt,
though ſhee be bound to obey thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
yet it's like you need not command
ſo many things, or not ſo frequently, and
ſo the burden of ſubjection may be much
lighter to her; if ſhee be willing to obey,
ſpare her; if unwilling, forbeare her, that
ſhee may ſinne leſſe. Say not, that thou
wilt make her, be not too confident of
thy ſtrength to mould thy wife into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
as wiſe and ſtrong as thou art,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:103276:208"/>
could not doe it, (onely God can make
a ſtout ſtomack to yeeld to a weake and
wilfull Governour) <hi>Victory is not alwayes
to the ſtrong,</hi> Eccl. 9. 11. It's ill grapling
with a head-ſtrong woman, ſhee may be
weake in body, but ſtrong in miſchiefe;
<hi>the tongue is an unruly member, no man can
tame;</hi> be not ſo mad as to ſtrike thy
crowne, nor caſt it in the dirt; if ſhee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
not thy deſires, informe her of her
dutie from the Scriptures, and pray to
God to ſet it home upon her conſcience;
if God be not regarded, who ſhall?</p>
               <p>4. Honour thy wife, right her wrongs,
ſuffer none to ſleight nor abuſe her in no
kinde, &amp;c. Follow Chriſts carriage to his
Church, which is moſt loving, meeke,
and ſweet.</p>
               <p>5. Provide all things needfull for her,
that ſhee may live comfortably with thee;
and whether ſhee be good or bad, you
ought to doe what you can to provide
meanes, that ſhee may live comfortably
after you in this world.</p>
               <p>6. Dwell with her, deprive her not of

               <p>Thus I have thought fit to mention

10. Feare not, for I am with thee, be not
diſmayd, for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen
thee, yea I will helpe thee, yea I will uphold
thee, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Some things are terrible to a
Saint, which he is ſubject to feare.</p>
            <p>2. It is the will of God, that his people
be not troubled, but to live a ſweet and
quiet life, in, and upon God.</p>
            <p>3. God is alwayes preſent with his,
to keepe them from evill, and doe them

4. Feares ariſe in not beholding the
preſence of God.</p>
            <p>5. The conſideration of the preſence
of God, a remedy againſt feares.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>I am thy God;</hi> when a childe of God
is at the worſt, ſtill God is his God.</p>
            <p>7. The knowledge of an intereſt in
God, is enough to raiſe a ſoule out of all
its feares.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee;</hi> God is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by promiſe to helpe and ſtrengthen
his.</p>
            <p>9. The Saints ſhould minde Gods
promiſe, and live upon it.</p>
            <p>10. The promiſe of God is enough to
quiet and ſettle a ſoule from feares.</p>
            <p>11. The weakeſt Saint with God ſhall
prevaile.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Strengthen thee;</hi> there is ſtrength
enough in God.</p>
            <p>13. The Saints ſtrength is God.</p>
            <p>14. It's in vaine for men to oppoſe the
Saints, for God is with them to helpe
them.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>I will help thee;</hi> the Saints in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:103276:209"/>
16. There is no helpe but in God;
creatures cannot helpe, they are vanitie.</p>
            <p>17. So much as the ſoule reſts upon
the promiſe of God for helpe, ſo much
its freed from feares in the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of dangers.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>Vphold thee;</hi> The trialls of the

            <p>2. They have the preſence of God to

<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.</p>

hurt; they diſhonour God, his truth, and

            <p>8. Feare is unſutable for a Saint, <hi>Rev.</hi>
21.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, feares are unreaſonable for a

unto them many great, ſweet, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
