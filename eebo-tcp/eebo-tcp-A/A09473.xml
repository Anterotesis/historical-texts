            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD hath bestowedon vs great prosperitie and peace with plenty of all temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings that heart can wish for many yeres in this land.</p>
            <p>Prosperity abused hath bin the occasion of many grievous sinnes against the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condtable: specially of Atheisme, neglect of Gods worship, contempt of the word, prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, abuse of the Sacraments, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These and such like sinnes have long called downe for iudgements from heaven upon us: &amp; the rather, because the preaching of the worde hath litle prevailed to bring vs to any amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2226:3"/>Whereupon God hath now begun to cause his iudgements to seaze upon vs, specially by plague and pestilence: &amp; that even in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principall part of this land: whereby he him selfe doth (as Iob saith) <hi>round us in the eare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 36. 15.</note> and preach repentance to vs.</p>
            <p>Wherfore it stands vs now in hand if ever, to looke about vs: and if we have not repented to begin to repent: if we have in former time repented, to doe it more earnestly.</p>
            <p>If so be that we shall harden our hearts both against his word and iudgements, &amp; put farre from vs the evill day: undoubtedly we must needs looke for iudgements far more terrible then ever we felt as yet; if not eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Let vs be advised by the old world, who made light of Noahs warning, and were drowned in the flood: by Lots sonnes in law, who<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 14.</note> tooke their fathers counsell for mockage and were burnt with fire and brimstone from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: by the foolish virgins, who were sleeping when they should have bene furnishing their lampes, and were shut from the mariage of the lambe.</p>
            <p>And to direct thee somwhat in the practise
<pb facs="tcp:2226:3"/>
of repentance, I haue penned this small trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: vse it for thy benefite, and see thou be a doer of it: vnlesse thou wilt be a wilfull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer &amp; shed the blood of thine owne soule.</p>
            <p>And whereas there have bin published here to fore in English two sermons of Repentance, one by M. Bradford Martyr, the other by M. Arthur Dent: sermons indeed which haue done much good: my meaning is not to adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or to teach any other doctrine, but only to renew &amp; revive the memory of that which they have taught.</p>
            <p>Neither let it trouble thee that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall divines of this age, whom in this treatise I follow, may seeme to be at difference in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of repentance. For some make it a fruite of faith containing two parts, mortification, &amp; vivification: some make faith a part of it, by deviding it into contrition, faith, new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The difference is not in the substance of doctrine, but in the logicall maner of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling it. And the difference of handling ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of the divers acception of repentance. It is taken two wayes generally &amp; particularly. Generally for the whole conversion of a sinner,
<pb facs="tcp:2226:4"/>
and so it may containe contrition, faith, and nevv obedience under it. It is taken particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the renovation of the life and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicur: and so it is a fruite of faith. And this only sense do I follovv in this treatise.</p>
            <p>I have added hereto a fevv lines of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat betvvene the flesh and the spirit: because repentance and this combat are ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; the one is not practised vvithout the other, as appeares by resolving Psalme 51.</p>

            <p>Yea, the best man that is, in the practise of godlinesse often appeares to be unlike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: the cause is this spirituall combat. The flesh other whiles makes him waile and mourne and goe drooping: presently after the spirit puts into him (as we say) the heart of grasse, and makes him triumph against the flesh, the devill the world. Moses was couragious at the<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 13. Num. 20. 11, 12. Iob. 1. 21. &amp; 3. 1.

David is often fainting in miserie, yet by and by revived. Wherefore there is good cause why the consideration of repentance and the combat should go togither: that no man, after he hath begun to repent, might dreame of ease to his flesh; as though we should goe to heaven in beds of downe: but rather that we might be resolved, that when we begin to doe any thing pleasing unto God, then wee must looke for nothing but continuall molestations from our vile and wicked natures.</p>

               <p>I call repentance a work: because it seemes not to be a qualitie, or vertue, or habit: but an action of a repentant sinner. which appeares by the ser mons of the Prophets and Apostles, which runne in this tenor, <hi>Repent, turne to God, amend your lives, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby they intimate, that repentance is a worke to be done.</p>
               <p>Againe, Repentance is not every kinde of

worke, but a worke of grace. because it can not be practised of any, but of such as be in the estate of grace. Reasons are these. I. No man can repent, unlesse he first hate sinne, and loue righteousnes; and none can hate sinne, unlesse he be sanctified; and he that is sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is iustified: and hee that is iustified must needes haue that faith which unites him to Christ, and makes him bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh. Wherefore he that repentes is iustified and sanctified, and made a member of Christ by faith. II. Hee that turnes to God must first of all be turned of God: and after that we are turned, then we repent. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

                  <hi>after I was converted I repented: and after that I was instructed I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did beare the reproch of my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some may obiect, that repentance goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all grace, because it is first preached. The first sermon that ever was made was of repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance preached by God himselfe in paradise to our first parents. And ever since the sermons of al the prophets and Apostles and of all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ministers haue had repentance for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2226:6"/>
and scope. The answere hereto may be this. If we respect the order of nature, there be other graces of God which goe before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because a mans conscience must in some part be setled touching his reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God jn Christ, before he can begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. wherfore iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; sanctification in order of nature go before repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But if we respect time, grace &amp; repentance are both togi ther. So soone as there is fire so soone it is hot: &amp; so soone as a man is regenerate, so soone he repents. If we respect the outward manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these twaine, repentance goes before all other graces: because it first of all appeares outwardly. Regeneration is like the sap of the tree that lies hid within the barke: repentance is like the bud that speedily shews itself, before either blossom, leaf, or fruit appeare: yea, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces of the heart which are needfull to salvation, are made manifest by repentance. And for this cause Repentance (as I take it) is first preached.</p>
               <p>I adde further, that repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce riseth of a godly sorow in the heart, as Paul teacheth. <hi>Godly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>causeth repentance unto salvation never to be repented of.</hi> It is called a godly sorow, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2226:7"/>
a sorrow according to God, that it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from worldly sorrow: which is a griefe arising of the apprehension of the wrath of God and other miseries; as feare of men, losse of good name, calamities in goods and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which in this life follow as punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sinne: whereas the godly sorrowe causeth griefe for sinne, because it is sinne. And it makes any man, in whome it is, to be of this disposition and minde, that if there were no conscience to accuse, no devill to terrifie, no iudge to arraigne and condemne, no hell to torment, yet he would be humbled &amp; brought on his knees for his sinnes, because he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a loving, mercifull, and long suffering God.</p>
               <p>Further I say, that repentance standes in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe to God. Man at the first was made a goodly creature in the image of God having fellowshippe with him, whereby hee dwelt in God and God in him. By sinne there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made betweene God and man: who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 2. eph. 4. 18.</note> and estraunged from God, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the child of wrath, a firebrand of hell, the prodigall child going from his father into a far
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2226:7"/>
countrey, the straying nay the lost sheepe. Now when men haue grace to repent, then they begin to renew this fellowship, and turne againe to God. And the very essence or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of repentance consistes in this turning. Which Paul doth seeme to intimate, when he saith, <hi>That he shewed both to Iewe and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Actes. 26. 20</note> 
                  <hi>that they should repent and turne to God, and doe workes worthy amendment of life.</hi> In which wordes he sets downe unto us a full description of repentance.</p>
               <p>Againe I say, that repentance is a turning from sinne, because it doeth not abolish or change the substance of body or soule, or any of the faculties thereof either in whole or parte: but onely rectifie and amend them by remooving the corruption. It turnes the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of melancholy to godly sorow, choller to good zeale, softnesse of nature to meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit, madnesse and lightnesse to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mirth: it reformes every man according to his naturall constitution, not abolishing it but redressing the faultes of it.</p>
               <p>Further I put downe, that repentance is a turning from all sinne to God, that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2226:8"/>
many false turnings. The first, when a man turnes from God to sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when one of a protestant becomes a papist, an Arrian, a Familist. The second, when a man turnes from one sinne to another. As when the riotous person leaves his prodigalitie, and gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the practise of covetousnesse: this can be no repentance: because it is a going from one extreame to another, whereas repentance is to leave the extreames and keepe the mean. The thirde is, not when a man turnes from sinne, but sinne turnes from him and leaves him. As when the drunkard leaves drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse because his stomacke is decayed: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatour his uncleannesse, because the strength of nature failes him: the quareller his fighting, because he is maimed on legge or arme. The last is, when men turne from many sinnes, but will not turne from all. As Herod did many things at the advertisement of Iohn baptist, but coulde not be brought to leave incest, in having his brother Philips wife. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is nothing. For as he which is truly regenerate, is wholly in body, soule, &amp; spirit regenerate: so he which truly repents, turnes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2226:8"/>
from all sinne, and turnes wholly to God.</p>
               <p>Neither is this to trouble any, that they can not know all their sinnes: for sound repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for one speciall sinne brings with it repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all sinne. And as God requires particular repentance for knowen sinnes, so he accepts a generall repentance for such as be unknown.</p>
               <p>To proceed further, the conversion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in repentance, hath three partes. The first, a purpose and resolution in the mind: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, an inclination in the will and affections: the third, an indeavour in life and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to abandon and leave all his former sinnes, and to imploy himselfe in obedience to Gods commandements.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this repentance must bring foorth fruites worthy amendement of life: because it can not be knowen to be sincere, vnlesse it bring forth fruit. Repentant sinners are <hi>trees</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the Spirite of God, as Paul saith, <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The instrument of the holy ghost in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king repentance, is the ministerie of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell onely, and not the Law. Reasons hereof are these. I. Faith is ingendred by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching not of the Law, but of the Gospell, as Paul saith, <hi>The gospell is the power of God to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>salvation to all that beleeve from faith to faith:</hi> therefore repentance which followes faith as a fruite thereof, must needes come by the preaching of the gospell only. II. The Lawe is the <hi>ministerie of death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 7.</note> because it shewes a man his wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2226:9"/>
but shewes him no remedie: therfore it can not be an instrumentall cause of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which is effectuall to salvation. III. The doctrine of repentance is a part of the gospell: which appeares in this, that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching<note place="margin">Luc. 9. 6. cum Marc. 6. 12.</note> of repentance, and the preaching of the gospell are put one for another. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ divides the gospell into two partes: the preaching of repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 47.</note> of sinnes in his name. IIII. That part of the worde which workes repentance, must reveale the nature of it, and set out the promise of life which belongs unto it. But the law neither reveales faith nor repentance: this is a proper worke of the gospell. If it bee said, that the law is a schoolemaster to bring us to Christ, the answere is, it brings men to Christ <hi rend="sup">a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do non al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do.</note> not by teaching the way, or by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them: but by forcing and urging them.</p>
               <p>Neither do we abolish the law, in ascribing the worke of repentance to the gospell only: for though it be no cause, yet is it an occasion of true repentance. Because it represents unto the eye of the soule our damnable estate, and smites the conscience with dolefull terrours
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2226:10"/>
and feares, which though they be no tokens of grace (for they are in their owne nature the very gates and the downe-fall to the pit of hell) yet they are certen occasions of receiving grace. The Phisition is otherwhiles constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to recover the health of his patient by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting him into some fits of an ague. So man, because hee is deadly sicke of the disease of sinne, he must be cast into some fittes of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall terrours by the ministerie of the law, that he may recover his former estate, and come to life everlasting.</p>
               <p>Repentance also is furthered by calamities. Iosephs brethren, when they were in distresse in Egypt said one to another, <hi>We have veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

                  <hi>CAP. III.</hi> Of the partes of Repentance.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Epentance hath two parts: Mortification, and Rising to newnesse of life.</p>
               <p>Mortification is the first part of repentance which concernes turning from sinne.</p>
               <p>Men turn from sinne, when they do not only abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> actuall sinne, but also use all means whereby they may both weaken &amp; suppresse the corruption of nature. Surgeons, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they must cut of any part of the body, use to lay plai sters to it, to mortifie it, that beeing without sense and feeling, it may be cut off with lesse paine. In the same maner, wee are to use all helpes &amp; remedies prescribed in the worde, which serue to weaken or kill sinne, that in death it may be abolished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:2226:11"/>And it must not seeme strange that I say we must use meanes to mortifie our owne sinnes. For, howsoever by nature we can not doe ane thing acceptable to God, yet' be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Actia gimus.</note> quickened and moved by the holy ghost, we stirre and moove our selves to doe that which is truly good. And therefore repentant sinners haue grace in them, whereby they mortifie their owne sinnes. Paul saith, <hi>I be at down my body and bring it in subiection.</hi> And,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 27. Gal. 5. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>They which are Christes haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes thereof.</hi> And, <hi>Mortifie therefore your earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, fornication, uncleannesse, the inordinate</hi>

                  <hi>affection, evill concupiscence and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And, <hi>If any man purge himselfe from</hi>

                  <hi>these, he shall be a vessell unto honour.</hi> And S. Iohn saith, <hi>Everyone which hath this hope in</hi>

                  <hi>him, purgeth him-selfe, even as hee is pure.</hi> And, <hi>He which is begotten of God preserveth</hi>

                  <hi>himselfe, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mortification hath three partes. A purpose in minde, an inclination in will, and an indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in life and conversation to leave all sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:2226:11"/>Rising to newnesse of life, is the second part of repentance concerning sincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God.</p>
               <p>And it hath also three partes. The two first are a resolution in the minde, and an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or lust in the will to obey God in all things. Barnabas exhorts them of Antiochia, <hi>That with purpose of heart they would cleave</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Actes 11. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>vnto the Lord.</hi> Examples of both these are many in scriptures. Of Ioshua. <hi>If it seeme</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 24. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>evill vnto you to serve the Lord, chuse you this day whome yee will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served, or the gods of the Amorites, &amp;c. but I and my housholde will serve the Lorde.</hi> Of David, <hi>O Lorde</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 119. 57.</note> 
                  <hi>thou art my portion, I have determined to keepe thy commandements.</hi> And, <hi>I have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 106.</note> 
                  <hi>sworne, and will perfourme it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements.</hi> And, <hi>When thou saidst, Seeke ye my face, mine heart answered</hi>

                  <hi>unto thee, O Lord I will seeke thy face.</hi> And, <hi>I have applyedmine heart to fulfill thy statutes alwayes even to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third parte, is an indeavour in life and conversation to obey God. Example of Paul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:2226:12"/>

               </p>
               <p>No man must here thinke, that a repentant sinner fulfilles the lawe in his obedience: for their best workes are faultie before God. And whereas the faithfull in scriptures are said to be perfect: we must know that there be two degrees of perfection: perfection in substance, and perfection in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Perfection in substance is, when a man doth sincerely indeavour to perfourme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to God not in some but in all his commandements. And this is the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that any man can have in this life. A Christian mans perfection is to bewaile his imperfection: his obediencee more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistes in the goodwill then in the worke, and is more to be measured by the affection, then by the effect.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Epentance hath two degrees. It is either ordinarie or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
               <p>Ordinary repentance is that which every christian is to per forme every day: for as men fall daily either more or lesse: so the graces of God are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally weakened day by day. wherefore the continuall reparation therof must be made by a daily renuing of repentance. A christian man is the temple &amp; house of Gods spirit: hee must therfore once a day sweepe it, that it may be sit to entertaine so worthy a ghest.</p>
               <p>Extraordinary repentance is the same in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the former: it differs onely from it in degree and measure of grace.</p>
               <p>And this is to be put in practise, when men fall into any enormous, capitall, or grievous offences, whereby they doe very grievously wound thir owne consciences, &amp; giue great offence to the Church. Of this sort was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Peter when he went forth &amp; wept bitterly: &amp; Davids repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, after that he had committed adultery &amp; murdered Vriah.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2226:14"/>Touching Originall sinne, this must be well remembred, that one man hath not one part onely of originall sinne, and another man an other: one man this corruption, another that: but every man as he received from Adam the whole nature of man: so also he received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sinne wholly. And therefore every man, (not one excepted, saving Christ who was extraordinarily sanctified by the holy ghost in the womb of the virgin) hath in him from his parents the corruption and seede of all sinne, which is a naturall disposition &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to commit any sinne whatsoeuer. Take a view and consider all the horrible sinnes that be practised in any part of the world, either against the first or second table: whatsoeuer they are, the spawne and seede of them all is euen in that man that is thought to be best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by nature. Some may say, that experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shewes the contrary; because among men that want all maner of religion some are more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill &amp; orderly: some againe more lewdly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. I answere, that this comes to passe, not because some men are by nature lesse wicked then others: but because God, by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2226:14"/>
doth limit and restraine mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more or lesse, which he doth for the good of mankind. For if men might be wholly left to themselves, corruption woulde so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly breake out into all maner of sinnes, that there should be no living in the world.</p>
               <p>Touching actuall sinnes, they shalbe found by examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be innumerable as the haires of a mans head, &amp; as the sands by the sea shore: if any will but search themselves a litle by the ten commandements of the Decalogue, for all their sinful thoughts, words, and deeds against God and man.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus much of examination: now followes the second duty, which is confession of sinne unto God, which is very necessary. For the right way to haue our sinnes covered before God is, to uncover and acknowledge them unto him. For hee will iustifie vs if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our selues, he will pardon us, if we, as being our owne enemies, accuse our selues: he forgets our sinnes if wee remember them: when we are vile in our owne eyes, wee are pretious in his: and when we are lost to our selues, we are found of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:2226:23"/>That confession may be rightly performed, a notable duety is to be put in practise in it: namely, the arraignment of a repentant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby he <hi>iudges himselfe that he may</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>not be iudged of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This arraignment hath three speciall pointes in it. For first of all, hee must bring himselfe forth to the barre of Gods iudgement. which thing hee doeth when he sets himselfe in the presence of God, as though even now the day of iudgement were. As Saint Hierome did, who alwayes thought with himselfe that hee heard this voice sounding in his eares, <hi>Rise yee dead and come to iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he must put up an inditement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe: by accusing him-selfe before God, by acknowledging his knowne sinnes particularly and his unknowen generally, without any excuse, or extenuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or defence, or hiding of the least of them. Example of David. <hi>I know mine iniquitie and my sinne is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>ever before me: against thee, against thee only have I sinned, and done this evill in thy sight, &amp;c. behold, I was borne in iniquitie, and</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:2226:23"/>
                  <hi>in sinne hath my mother conceived me.</hi> And,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 21. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, remoove the iniquitie of thy servant: for I have done very foolishly.</hi> Of Ezra, <hi>O my God, I am ashamed &amp;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezra. 9. 6.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he must with heavinesse of heart give sentence against himselfe, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that hee is worthy of everlasting hell, death, and damnation. As the prodigall child, <hi>Father, I have sinned against heaven, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, &amp; am not worthy to be called thy child,</hi> And Daniel, <hi>Wee haue sinned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>

                  <hi>much as his eyes to heaven, but smote his brest saying, Lord be mercifull to me a sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for confession of sinne to men, it is not to be used but in two cases. First, when some<note place="margin">

               <p>The third dutie in the practise of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is Deprecation, whereby we pray to God for the pardon of the sinnes which haue bene confessed with contrition of heart, with earnestnesse and constancie, as for the weightiest matter in the world. And here we must remember to behaue our selues to God as the poore prisoner doth at the barre, who when the iudge is about to giue sentence, cries unto him for favour as for life and death. And we must doe as the cripple or lazar man in the way: sit downe, vnlappe our legges and armes and shew the sores of our sinnes; crying to God continually as they doe, <hi>(Looke with your eye, and pity with your heart:)</hi> that wee may finde mercy at Gods handes, as they get almes at the hands of passengers. Thus Oseah<note place="margin">Ose. 14. 2.</note> instructeth the people, <hi>O Israel, returne unto</hi>

                  <hi>Wee doe not present our supplications before thee for our own righteousnes, but for thy great tender mercies. O Lord heare, O Lord forgive, O Lord consider and doe it: defer not for thine owne names sake, O my God.</hi> Of David, <hi>Have</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The last duty is to pray to God for grace &amp; strength, whereby wee may be inabled to walke in newnesse of life. Of David, <hi>Behold, I</hi>

                  <hi>CAP. VII.</hi> Of legall motives to repentance.</head>
               <p>MOtives to repentance are either Legall or Evangelicall. Legall are such as are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the law: &amp; they are 3. especially.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:2226:25"/>The first is, the misery and cursed estate of euery impenitent sinner in this life by reason of his sinnes.</p>
               <p>His miserie (that I may expresse it to the conceit of the simplest) is seven-fold.<list>
                     <item>1. within him.</item>
                     <item>2. before him.</item>
                     <item>3. behind him.</item>
                     <item>4. on his right hand.</item>
                     <item>5. on his left hand.</item>
                     <item>6. over his head.</item>
                     <item>7. vnder his feete.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>His miserie within him is twofold. The first is a guiltie conscience: which is a very hell vnto the ungodly man. For hee is like a silly priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the conscience like a Iayler which followes him at the heeles, and dogges him whither soever he goes, to the end he may see and observe all his sayings and doings. It is like a register, that sits alwaies with the pen in his hand, to record and inrole all his wickednesse for everlasting memory. It is a litle iudge, that sittes in the middle of a man even in his very heart, to arraigne him in this life for his sinnes as he shall be arraigned at the last iudgement.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2226:25"/>
Therfore the pangs, terrors, and feares of all impenitent persons, are as it were, certaine flashings of the flames of hell fire. The guiltie conscience makes a man like him, which lies on a bedde that is too strait and the<note place="margin">Isa. 28. 20.</note> covering too short: who would with all his heart sleepe, but can not. Belshazzar when he<note place="margin">Dan. 5 6.</note> was in the middest of his mirth, seeing the hand-writing on the wall, was smitten with great feare, so as his countenance changed, &amp; his knees smote togither.</p>
               <p>The second evill within man, is, the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full slaverie and bondage vnder the power of Satan the Prince of darkenesse: in that his mind, will, and affections are so knit and glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the will of the devill, that he can doe nothing but obey him, &amp; rebell against God. And hence Satan is called the prince of this<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> world: which keepes the hold of the heart as an armed Captaine keepes a sconse or a castle with watch and ward.</p>
               <p>The misery before man, is a daungerous snare which the devill layes for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soule. I say it is dangerous: because he<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 25.</note> is in setting of it twentie or fortie yeres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2226:26"/>
he strikes; when as (God knowes) men do little thinke of it. It is made of three cords: with the first, he brings men into his snare: and that he doeth by covering the miserie and the poyson of sinne; and by painting out to the eie of the minde, the deceitfull profits &amp; pleasures thereof. With the second, he hopples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snares them: for after that a man is drawen into this or that sinne, the devill hath so suge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it over with fine delightes, that he can not but needes must live and lye in it. By the third, he drawes the snare and indevours with all his might to breake the necke of the soule. For when he seeth a fitte opportunitie, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in grievous calamities; and in the houre of death, he takes away the vizar of sinne, and she weth the face of it in the true fourme, as ouglie as him selfe: then withall he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (as we say) to shewe his hornes: then he rageth in terrifying &amp; accusing, that the soule of man may be swallowed up of the gulfe of finall despaire.</p>
               <p>The miserie behinde him, is the sinnes past. The Lord saith to Cain, <hi>If thou doest not well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>sinne lyeth at the doore.</hi> Where sinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2226:26"/>
to a wilde beast, which followes a man whither soever he goeth, and lyeth lurking at his heels. And though for a time it may seeme to be hurtlesse, because it lyeth asleepe: yet at length, unlesse men repent, it will rise up, sease on them, and rent out the very throtes of their soules. Iob in his afffliction saith, <hi>Thou writest</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>bitter things against me, and makest me pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the sinnes of my youth.</hi> And David pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Ps. 25. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Forgive me the sinnes of my youth.</hi> If the memorie of sinnes past be a trouble to the godly man, oh what a racke? what a gibbet wil it be to the heart of him that wants grace?</p>
               <p>The miserie on the right hand is prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and ease: which by reason of mans sinne is an occasion of many iudgements. In it men<note place="margin">Ezec. 16. 49.</note> practised the horrible sinnes of Sodome: it puffes up the heart with divelish pride, so as men shall thinke themselves to be as God him selfe, as Senacherib, Nebuchad-nezzar, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Alexander, Herode, Domitian did. It steales away mans heart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; quenches the sparkes of grace. As the Lord complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the Israelites. <hi>I spake unto thee when</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 22. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>thou wast in prosperitie: but thou saydest, I will not heare: this hath bene thy manner from</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:2226:27"/>
                  <hi>thy youth.</hi> It is like the Ivie that embraces the tree and windes rounde about it, but yet drawes out the iuice and life of it. Hence is it that many turne it to an occasion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Salomon saith, <hi>Prosperitie of fooles destroyeth them.</hi> When the milt swelles, the<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 32.</note> rest of the body pines away: and when the heart is puft with pride, the whole man is in danger of destruction. The sheepe that goes in the best pasture, soonest comes to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-house; and the ungodly man fattes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with continuall prosperity, that he may<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> the sooner come to his owne damnation.</p>
               <p>The misery on the left hand is Adversitie, which stands in all manner of losses and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in goods, friends, good name, and such like. Of this read at large. Deut. 28.</p>
               <p>The miserie over his head is, the wrath of God, which he testifies in all maner of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from heaven, in danger of which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impenitent sinner is every houre. And the danger is very great. The scripture saith. <hi>It is</hi>

sinners that they can not scape. Gods wrath is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s a fire making havocke and bringing to nought whatsoeuer it lights on: yea, because he is slow to anger, therefore more terrible: as a man therefore stayes his hand for a time, that he may lift it higher and fetch a deeper blowe. When the dumb creatures melt as wax and vanish away at his presence, when he<note place="margin">Nah. 1. 4, 5, 6. Psalm. 97.</note> is angry, as the huge mountaines and rockes doe, fraile man must never looke to stand. If the roaring of a lyon make men afraid, and the voice of thunder be terrible: oh, how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly should all be astonished at the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God.</p>
               <p>The misery under his feete is, <hi>Hell fire:</hi> for every man till he repent, is in as great danger of damnation as the traitour apprehended, of hanging, drawing, and quartering. A man walking in his way falles into a deepe dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is full of vggely serpents and noisome beastes: in his fall he catches hold of a twigge of a tree that growes at the mouth of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and hangs by it: afterward there comes a beast both leane and hungerbitten, which having cropt the whole tree, is ever and anon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2226:28"/>
knapping at the twigge on which he hanges. Nowe, what is the daunger of this man? surely he is like to fall into the pit, over which he hangeth. well, this man is every impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner: the pit is hell, prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and his angels: the twig is the brickle and fraile life of man: the hungerbitten beast is death, that is ready every houre to knap our life asunder: the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger is fearful: for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were over the mouth of hel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life is ended, unlesse he use good meanes before he die, he then falleth to the very bottome of it.</p>
               <p>If this be the miserie wherewith the careles man is sieged &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed about every way, &amp; that for his sinnes, why do men lie in the dead sleepe of security? ô! it stands them in hand to take up the voice of bitter lamentation, &amp; for their offences to howle after the manner of dragons. If men could weepe nothing but teares of blood for their sins, if they could dye a 1000 times in one day for very griefe, they could never be grieved ynough for their sins.</p>
               <p>The second motive to draw men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is the consideration of the wretched estate of an impenitent sinner in his death,<note place="margin">

that he receives for his sinne: and it is the very<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> suburbs, or rather the gates of hel. S. Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares death to a scorpion, who carieth <hi>a sting</hi> in his taile, which is sinne. Now then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 55, 56.</note> &amp; prophane persons die, then comes this scorpion &amp; gripes them with her legs, &amp; stabs them at the hart with her sting. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best thing is before death come, to use meanes to pull out the sting of death. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wil do it, but the blood of Christ: let me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore breake off their sinnes by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to the throne of grace, &amp; crie: yea let them fil heaven &amp; earth with cries for mercy. oh! pray, pray, pray for the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy sinnes. If thou obtaine but one drop of Gods speciall mercie in Christ, all danger is past. For death hath lost his sting: and then a man without danger may put an ougly serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his bosom.</p>
               <p>The third motive, is the consideration of his estate after death. When the day of the last judgement shalbe, he must be brought and set before the tribunal seat of christ: he shal not be able to escape or hide himself: then the bookes shalbe brought out, &amp; all his sins shalbe disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before Gods saints &amp; angels: the devil &amp; his own conscience shal accuse him: none shall be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2226:29"/>
aduocate to plead his cause: hee himselfe shall be speechlesse; hee shall at length heare the dreadfull sentence of damnation, <hi>Goe ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into hell prepared for the divell &amp; his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> This thing might moove the vilest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest in the world to leaue his wicked wayes and come to amendement of life. Wee see the strongest theefe that is, when he is ledde in the way from the prison to the barre, leaves his theeving and behaues himselfe orderly. And indeed if hee woulde then cut a purse, it were high time that he were hanged. All men by nature are traitours and malefactours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God: whiles we live in this worlde, wee are in the way going to the barre of Gods iudgement. The wheele of the heavens turnes one bout every day, and winds up som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the threed of our life: whether wee sleepe or wake we are alwayes comming nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer our end: wherfore let all men daily hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues for their sinnes, and pray vnto God that he would be reconciled unto them in Christ: and let them indeavour themselves in obedience to all Gods commandements, both in their lives and callings.</p>

A separation from all ioy and comfort of the presence of God. II. Eternall fellowship with the divell and all his angels. III. The feeling of the horrible wrath of God, which shall seaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bodie, soule, and conscience, &amp; shall feed on them as fire doth on pitch and brimstone: and torment them as a worme crawling in the bodie and gnawing on the heart: they shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be dying, and never deade: alwayes in woe, and neuer in ease.

ever he was. This consideration may serve as an yron scourge to drive men from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lives. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> would have men in their meetings in tavernes and feastes, to talke of hel, that by often thinking on it, they might avoyde it. A grave and chaste matrone, being mooved to commit folly with a lewd ruffian; after long discourse, she called for a panne of burning coales, requesting him for her sake to holde his finger in them but one houre; he answered, that it was an unkinde request: to whome she replyed, that seeing he would not holde so much as one finger in a fewe coales for one small houre, she could not yeeld to do the thing, for which she should be tormented body &amp; soule in hell fire for ever. And so shold all men reason against themselves. None will be brought to doe a thing, that may make so much as their finger or tooth to ake: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to have great care to leave our sinnes, whereby we bring endlesse torment to bodie and soule in hell.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. VIII.</hi> Of motives Evangelicall.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Vangelicall Motives are two especially. The first is taken from the consideration of mans redemption. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed mankind is God him selfe. As Paul saith, that <hi>God was in Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>the world to him selfe.</hi> Mans sinne is so vile and hainous in the eyes of God, that no Angell nor creature was able to appease the wrath of God for the least offence. But the Sonne of God himselfe must come downe from heaven, and take mans nature on him: and not onely that, but he must also suffer the most accursed death of the crosse, and shed his most pretious heart blood to satisfie the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of his Father in our behalfe. If a Father should be sicke of such a disease, that nothing would heale but the heart blood of his owne childe, he would presently judge his owne case to be dangerous; and would also vowe if ever he recovered, to use all meanes whereby he might avoid that disease. So likewise,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2226:31"/>
seeing nothing could cure the deadly wound of our sinne but a plaister made of the heart blood of Christ: it must make us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our pitifull case, and the hainousnesse of the least of our sinnes, and stirre us up to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life.</p>
               <p>Againe, considering the end of the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption wrought by Christ, was to deliuer us from our euill conuersation in sinne and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, we are not to continue and as it were lie bathing our selues in sinne; for that were, as if a prisoner, after that he had bin ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed and had his boltes taken of, and were put out of the prison to go whither he would, should returne againe, and desire to lie in the dungeon still.</p>
               <p>The second motive is, that God hath made a promise to such as truly repent. I. Of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes. <hi>Wash you, make you cleane, take away the evill of your workes from before</hi>

                  <hi>for the sonne of man wil come at an houre when ye thinke not.</hi> This one thing should make a man to hasten his repentance; and the rather, because many are dead, who purposed with them selves to repent in time to come; but were prevented by death, and shall never repent. II. The longer a man lives in any sin, the greater danger: because by practise sin gets heart &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. Custome is of such force, that that which men use to do in their life time, the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2226:33"/>
same they doe and speake when they are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. One had three pounds owing to him to be paid three seuerall yeres: when he was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nothing could be got of him, but three yeres, three pounds. Againe, by deferring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, men treasure up wrath against the day of wrath. As if a malefactour for his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, should be appointed to cary every day a sticke of wood to an heape, to burne him twentie yeeres after. III. The more the time is prolonged, the harder it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: the longer a man goes in his sicknesse without phisicke, the harder is the recoverie. And where the devill dwells long, hee will hardly be remooved. The best way to kill a serpent, is, to cruse it in the heade when it is young. IIII. It is as meat and drinke to the devill to see men liue in their sinnes defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring repentance: as on the contrary, there is great ioy among the angels of god in heaven, when a sinner doth repent. V. Late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is seldome or never true repentance. For if a man repent when he cannot sinne as in former time, as namely in death: then hee leaves not sinne but sinne leaves him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2226:33"/>
the repentance which men frame to them selues when they are dying, it is to be feared least it die with them. And it is very iust, that hee should be contemned of God in his death, who contemned God in his life. Chrysostome sayeth, that the wicked man hath this punishment on him, that in dying hee shoulde forget himselfe, who when hee was living did forget God. VI. We are with Abel to giue unto God in sacrifice even the fatte of our flocke: now they which deferre repentance to the end do the contrary. Late repenters offer the flower of their youth to the deuill: and they bring the lame and broken sacrifice of their old age to God.</p>

                  <p>WHether doeth repentance alwayes go with teares or not. <hi>Answer.</hi> No: For very pride and hypocrisie will draw foorth teares, for some there are, that can weepe for their sinnes in the presence of others: whereas being alone, they neither will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2226:36"/>
nor can. Some againe are of that constitution of body, that they haue teares at commaund. And a godly man with drie cheekes may mourne to God for his sinnes, and intreat for pardon, and receive it. Yet in all occasions of deeper griefe for sinne, teares will follow: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men haue stony and flinty hearts. And yet againe, though the greatest cause of sorow be offered, the softest heart that is, sheds not teares at the first: but afterward it will. When the body receiues a deepe wound, at the first yee shall see nothing but a white line or dint made in the flesh, without any blood: stay but a while, then comes blood from the wound in great aboundance. So at the first the mind is astonished and gives no teares: but after some respit and consideration, teares follow.</p>

can not alwayes testifie it.

                  <hi>CAP. XI.</hi> Of the contraries to Repentance.</head>
               <p>COntrarie to Repentance is Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: whereby men continue in one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, neither sorowing for sinne, nor
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2226:37"/>
turning from it.</p>
               <p>It is one of the most grievous iudgements that is if it be finall. For as a sick man, then is most sicke, when he feeles the lest sicknesse, &amp; saith he is well: so miserable man is in most misery when he feeles no misery, and thinks himselfe in good estate.</p>
               <p>This sin befalls them that iudge themselves righteous, needing no repentance. As the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises</hi> in the daies of Christ, the <hi>Catharists</hi> in the Primative Church, &amp; the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> in our age. Adde unto these, such as haue harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts: so as they can not discerne between good and euill; nor tremble at Gods iudgements, but rather fret and rage against them: till God in his wrath either destroy them or cast them to finall despaire. As it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, who died blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and casting his own blood into the aire.</p>
               <p>Between the two extremes Repentance &amp; Impenitencie, is placed counterfeit repentance. For the wicked nature of man can dissemble &amp; counterfeit Gods grace. As the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the Iewes. <hi>Her rebellious sister Iudah, hath not returned vnto me with her whole</hi>

               <p>Desperate repentance is, when a man hauing only gods iudgements before his eyes, is smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with horrour of conscience: &amp; wanting assurance of Gods mercy despaires finally.

                  <hi>CAP. XII.</hi> Of corruptions in the doctrine of Repentance.</head>
               <p>THe Church of Rome at this day hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the ancient doctrine of repentance
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2226:39"/>
being one of the speciall points of religion. The corruptions are specially sixe.</p>
               <p>The first, that they make repentance or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be a sacrament, which can not be: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it wants an outward signe. And though some say, that the words, which the priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearseth in absolution, are the signe: yet that can not be: because the signe must be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly audible, but also visible.</p>
               <p>The second, that a sinner hath in him a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disposition, which being stirred-up by Gods preventing grace, he may and can work togither with Gods spirit in his owne repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But indeed all our repentance is to be ascribed to Gods grace wholly. The soule of man is not weak but starke dead in sinne: &amp;<note place="margin">Eph. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> therefore it can no more prepare it selfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, then the body being dead in the grave can dispose it self to the last resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The third corruption, that contrition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance must be sufficient. A thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For sinne doth so greatly offend Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, that no man can ever mourne enough for it.</p>
               <p>The fourth, that contrition doth merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2226:39"/>
of sinne. An opinion that doth dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate much from the all-sufficient merites of Christ.</p>
               <p>The fift that he that repents must confesse all the sinnes, that he can remember with all their circumstances to his owne priest, or one in his stead, if he will receive pardon. This kind of confession is a mere forgery of mans brain. <hi>I.</hi> There is neither precept nor example of it in the Scriptures. II. David and others haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented<note place="margin">Psalm. 32. 3. 2. Sam. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and haue receiued remission of their sinnes without confessing of their sinnes in particular to any man.</p>
               <p>The last, that the sinner by his workes and sufferings must make satisfaction to God for the temporall punishment of his sinnes. A flat blasphemie. The scriptures mention no other<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 7. &amp; 2. 1.</note> satisfaction but Christs; and if his be sufficient, ours is needlesse: if ours needful, his imperfect. Papists write that both may stand togither. Christs satisfaction (they say) is as a plaister in a boxe unapplyed: mans satisfaction as a meanes to apply it: because it prepares us to receiue it. Ah, good divinity: for euen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense the satisfaction of Christ must first
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2226:40"/>
be applyed to the person of man that it may please God: before the workes (which they terme satisfactions) can any way be acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Romish doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is the right way to hell. For when a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shall be taught that he must haue sufficient sorow for his sinne: and withall that he must not beleeue the remission of his owne sinnes particularly: when sorow comes upon him and he wants sound comfort in Gods mercy, he must needs fall into desperation without recovery. Therfore the papists in the houre of death, (as we haue experience) are glad to leaue the trumpery of humane satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to rest only, for their iustification, on the obedience of Christ.</p>

            <head>THE COMBAT <hi>OF THE FLESH AND</hi> SPIRIT.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Gal. 5. 17.</bibl>
               <q>For the flesh lusteth against the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the spirit against the flesh; &amp; these are contrary one to another, so that ye can not doe the things which ye would.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apostle Paul from the beginning of this chapter to the 13. verse exhorts the <hi>Galatians</hi> to maintaine their christian liberty: &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the end of the chapter he perswades the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to other speciall duties of godlines. In the 13. verse he stirs them up to be serviceable one to another by loue: in the 15. verse he disswades them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contentions &amp; doing of iniuries. In the 16. verse he shewes the remedy of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sinnes, which is to walk according to the spirit. In this seventeenth verse he renders a reason of the remedie, the force whereof is this. The flesh and the spirit are contrary:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2226:41"/>
wherfore if ye walke according to the spirit, it will hinder the flesh, that it shall not carry you forward to do iniuries &amp; liue in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as otherwise it would.</p>
            <p>In this verse we haue to obserue 5. points. The first that there is a combat betwene the flesh &amp; the spirit in these words, <hi>The flesh lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.</hi> The second is the maner of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which stands in the contrary lusting of the flesh and the spirit. The third is the cause of the combat in these words, <hi>and these are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The fourth is the subiect or person in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this: combat is, noted in these words, <hi>So that yee,</hi> the <hi>Galatians.</hi> The last is the effect of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, in the last words, <hi>that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not do, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the combat it selfe, diuers points are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered. The first, what these two, which make combat, namely, the flesh and the spirit, are. They haue diuers significations. First of all, the spirit is taken for the soule, and the flesh for the body. But so they are not taken in this place. For there is no such combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the body &amp; the soule: both which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree togither to make the person of one man.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2226:41"/>
Secondly, the spirit signifies naturall reason, &amp; the flesh the natural appetite or concupiscence. But they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be so understood in this place. For the spirit here mentioned doth fight euen against naturall reason: which though it serue to make a man without excuse, yet is it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the spirit. Thirdly, the spirit signifies the godhead of Christ, and the flesh the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: but it must not be so taken here. For then euery man regenerate should be deified. Lastly, the spirit signifies a created quality of holines, which by the holy ghost is wrought in the mind, will, &amp; affections of man: &amp; the flesh, the naturall corruption or inclination of the mind, will, and affections to that which is against the law. In this first these twain are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this place.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is to be considered how these twain, the flesh &amp; the spirit can fight togither, being but mere qualities. And we must know, that they are not severed asunder, as though the flesh were placed in one part of the soule, &amp; the spirit in another: but they are ioyned &amp; mingled togither in al the faculties of the soul. The mind or understanding part, is not one
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2226:42"/>
part flesh, and an other spirit, but the whole mind is flesh and the whol mind is spirit; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one and partly the other. The whole will is partly flesh and partly spirit: the flesh and the spirit that is grace and corruption, not seuered in place but distinguished. As the aire in the dawning of the day is not wholly light or wholly darke as at midnight and at nooneday: neither is it in one part light, in another part darke: but the whole aire is partly light, and partly dark throughout. In a vessell of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme water, the water it selfe is not onely hot or only cold; or in one part hot &amp; in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part cold: but heat and cold are mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in every part of the water. So is the flesh and the spirit mingled togither in the soule of man: and this is the cause why these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities fight togither.</p>
            <p>Thirdly in this combate we are to consider what equality there is betweene these two combaters, the flesh and the spirit. And we must know, that the flesh usually, is more in measure then the spirit. The flesh is like the mighty gyant Goliah: and the spirit is litle and small like young David. Hence it is, that Paul
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2226:42"/>
calls the Corinthians which were men iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sanctified, <hi>carnall. I could not</hi> (saith he)<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>breethren spkake unto you as unto spirituall, but as unto carnall, as unto babes in Christ.</hi> And none can come to be tall men in Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> to the age of the fulnesse of Christ, till after this life. And the speech which is used of some divines, that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regenerate <hi>hath but the reliques of sin in him,</hi> must be understood warily, els it may admit an untruth. As for the measure of grace, it can be but smal in respect, whereas we do receiue but <hi>the first fruites of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> 
               <hi>the spirit</hi> in this life; &amp; must wait for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> till the life to come. For all this, the power &amp; efficacy of the spirit is such, that it is able to prevaile ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the flesh. For the flesh receiues his deadly wound at the first instant of a mans conuersion, and continually dyeth after by litle &amp; litle: &amp; therfore it fights but as a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med soldier. And the spirit is continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed &amp; increased hy the holy ghost: also it is liuely &amp; stirring &amp; the vertue of it is like musk; one graine wherof wil giue a stronger smell, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many unces of other perfumes. Some may
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2226:43"/>
say, that the godly man doth more feele the flesh then the spirit: &amp; therfore that the flesh is euery way more then the spirit. I answer, that we must not measure our estate by feeling which may easily deceiue us. A man shall feele a paine which is but in the top of his finger more sensibly then the health of his whol bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: yet the health of the body is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pain of a fingar. Secondly we feele corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not by corruption but by grace: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, the more they feele their inward corruptions, the more grace they haue.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the combat it selfe: now let us come to the maner of this fight.</p>
            <p>It is fought by <hi>Lusting.</hi> To lust in this place signifies to bring forth &amp; to stir up motions &amp; inclinations in the hart, either to good or euil.</p>
            <p>Lusting is twofold: the lusting of the flesh, &amp; the lusting of the spirit.</p>
            <p>The lusting of the flesh hath two actions: the first is, to ingender euill motions &amp; passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of selfe-loue, envy, pride, unbeliefe, anger, &amp;c. S. Iames saith, that men <hi>are enticed and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>drawen away by their own concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> Now this inticing is only by the suggestion of bad
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2226:43"/>
cogitations &amp; desires. This action of the flesh made Paul say that he was <hi>carnall solde under</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> 
               <hi>sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second action of the flesh is to hinder, &amp; quench, &amp; overwhelm all the good motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the spirit. Paul found this in himselfe, when he said, <hi>I see another law in my members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against the law of the mind, &amp; leading</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>me captive to the law of sinne.</hi> By reason of this action of the flesh, the man regenerate is like to one in a slumber troubled with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease called <hi>Ephialtes</hi> or the mare: who thinks that he feeles something lying on his breast as heavy as a mountaine: &amp; would faine haue it away, wherupon he striues &amp; labours by ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and voice to remoue it, but for his life can not doe it.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the lusting of the spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines two other actions. The first is to beget good motions, inclinations, &amp; desires in the mind, will, &amp; affections. Of this David spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">Psalm. 16. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Myreines teach me in the night season.</hi> That is, my mind, affection, and will, and my whole soule being sanctified and guided by the spirit of God, do minister unto me consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2226:44"/>
of the way in which I ought towalk. Isaias prophecying of the Church of the new testament, saith, <hi>When a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goeth to the right</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 30. 22.</note> 
               <hi>hand or to the left, he shal he are a voice, saying, here is the way walke ye in it.</hi> Which voice is not only the outward preaching of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but also the inward voice of the spirit.</p>
            <p>The second action of the spirit is to hinder aud suppresse the bad motions and suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the flesh. S. Iohn saith, he that is <hi>borne of God sinneth not, because his seed remaineth</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>in him,</hi> that is, grace wrought in the heart by the holy ghost, which resisteth the rebellious desires of the flesh.</p>
            <p>That the manner of this fight may more clearely appeare, we must examine it more particularly. In the soule of man there be two speciall parts, the mind and the will.</p>
            <p>In the mind there is a double combat. The first is betweene knowledge of the word of God, and naturall ignorance or blindnes. For seeing we doe in this life knowe but in part: therefore knowledge of the truth must needs be ioyned with ignorance in all that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned: &amp; one of these being contrary to an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2226:44"/>
other, they striue to ouershadow and ouercast ech other.</p>
            <p>Hence we may learn the cause why excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t divines do vary in divers points of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and it is, because in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, naturall blindnes yet remaining, prevailes more or lesse. Men that are dim sighted &amp; cannot discerne without spectacles, if they should be set to discry a thing a far off, the most of them would be of divers opinions of it. And men inlightened &amp; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in this life do but see <hi>as in a glasse dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> Again, this must teach all stude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of divinity often to suspect themselues in their opinions and defences: seeing in them that are of soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the light of their understanding is mixed with darknes of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And they can in many points see but as the man in the Gospell, who when our Saviour Christ had in part opened his eyes, saw men walking, not as men, <hi>but in the forme of trees.</hi> Also this must teach all that read the scriptures to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate &amp; cal upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of God, that he wold inlighten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his spirit, &amp; abolish the mist of natural blindnes. The prophet David was wor thily inlightned with the knowledge of Gods
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2226:45"/>
word, so as he excelled the ancient and his owne teachers in wisdom: yet being privy to himselfe touching his owne blindnes, often prayeth in the Psalms, <hi>Inlighten my eyes that I may vnderstand the wonders of thy law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By reason of this fight, when naturall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes prevailes, the child of God truly inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with knowledge to life everlasting, may erre not only in lighter points, but euen in the very foundation of religion, as the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans &amp; the Galathians did. And as one man may erre, so an hundred men may also: yea a whole particular Church: and as one Church may erre, so an 100. more may. For in respect of this combat, the estate and condition of all men is alike. Whence it appeares that the Church militant upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth is subiect to error. But yet as the diseases of the body be of two sorts: some curable, and some incurable which are to death; so likewise errours are. And the Church though it be subiect to sundry fals, yet it can not erre in foundation to death: the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Gods children be curable. Some may here say, If all men &amp; Churches be subiect to errour, then it shall not be good to ioyne
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2226:45"/>
with any of them, but to separate from them all. I answer, though they may and do erre, yet we must not separate from them, so long as they do not separate from Christ.</p>
            <p>The second combat in the mind is, between faith &amp; unbeliefe. For faith is imperfect, and mixt with the contrary unbeliefe, presuming, doubting, &amp;c. As the man in the Gospell saith, <hi>Lord I beleeve, help mine unbeliefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By reason of this fight, when unbeliefe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, the very child of God may fal into fits &amp; pangs of dispaire: as Iob &amp; David in their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations did. For David once considering the prosperity of the wicked, brake out into this speech, <hi>Certenly I have clensed mine heart in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 73. 13.</note> 
               <hi>vaine, &amp; washed mine hands in innocencie.</hi> yea, this dispaire may be so extreme, that it shal weake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body &amp; consume it, more then any sicknes. No man is to think this strange in the child of God. For though he dispaire of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection &amp; saluation in Christ, yet his desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neither total nor final. It is not <hi>totall,</hi> because he doth not dispaire with his whol heart, faith euen at that instant lusting against dispaire. It is not <hi>finall,</hi> because he shall recouer before the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2226:46"/>
last end of his life.</p>
            <p>To proceed, the combat in the will is this. The will partly willeth and partly nilleth that which is good at the same instant: &amp; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it willeth &amp; nilleth that which is evill: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is partly regenerate &amp; partly unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. The affections likewise, which are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the wil, partly imbrace &amp; partly eschew their obiects: as loue partly loueth and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth not loue God and things to be loued: feare is mixed &amp; not pure (as schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue dremed) but partly <hi>fili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> partly <hi>servil,</hi> causing the child of God to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in awe of god not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his mercies, but also for his iudgements &amp; punishments. The will of a man regenerate is like him that hath one leg sound, the other lame: who in every step which he makes, doth not wholly halt or wholly go upright, but partly go upright &amp; partly halt. Or like a man in a boate on the water: who goeth upward because he is caried upward by the vessell: &amp; at the same time goes downward, because hee walkes downward in the same vessell at the same instant. If any shall say that contraries ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be in the same subiect. The answer is, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2226:46"/>
they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, if one of them be in his full stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in the highest degree: but if the force of them<note place="margin">In gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis non in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</note> both be delaied &amp; weakned, they may be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togither.</p>
            <p>By reason of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corruption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails against grace in the wil &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there ariseth in the godly a certain <hi>deadnes or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of heart, which is nothing els but a wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of sense or feeling. Some may say, that this is a fearfull iudgement: but the answer is, that there be 2. kinds of hardnes of heart: one which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the heart, &amp; is never felt: this is in them, who haue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences seared with an hot<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 19.</note> iron, who by reason of custome in sin are past all feeling, who likewise despise the meanes of softning their harts. And indeed this is a fearful iudgement. There is another hardnes of heart<note place="margin">Zach. 7. 11.</note> which is felt: &amp; this is not so dangerous as the former: for as we feele our sicknes by contrary life &amp; health: so hardnes of hart when it is felt argues quicknes of grace &amp; softnes of hart. Of this Dauid often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained in the Psalmes: of this the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel speak when they say,<note place="margin">Isai. 65. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Why hast thou hardned our harts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the maner of the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mbate in

particular: before we proceed any further, let us mark the issue of it, which is this.</p>
            <p>The spirit prevailes against the flesh at two times: in the course of a mans life, and at his end; but yet with some foiles receiued.</p>
            <p>I say the spirit prevails not in one instant, but in the whol course of a mans life. So S. Iohn saith, <hi>He which is begotten of God sinneth not:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>for he preserveth himselfe:</hi> the grace of God in his heart ordinarily prevailing in him. And Paul makes it the property of the regenerate man <hi>to walk according to the spirit,</hi> which is<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> not now &amp; then to make a step forward, but to keep his ordinary course in the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. As in going from Barwick to London, it may be a man now and then will go amisse: but he speedily returnes to the way againe, &amp; his course generally shall be right.</p>
            <p>Again, the spirit prevails in the end of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life. For then the flesh is utterly abolished &amp; sanctification acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished: because no uncleane thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>This further must be conceived, that when the spirit prevailes, it is not without resistance &amp; striving. As Paul testisieth, <hi>I do not the good</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:2226:47"/>
               <hi>which I would, but the evill which I would not that do I.</hi> which place is not to be understood only of thoughts &amp; inward motions (as some would haue it) nor of particular offences: but of the generall practise of his duty or calling, through the whol course of his life. And it is like the practise of a sickman, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of some grieuous disease, walkes a turn or twain about his chamber, saying, ah, I would fain walk up and down but I cannot: meaning not that he can not walke at all, but signifying that he cannot walke as he would, being soone wearied through faintnesse.</p>
            <p>I added further, that this prevailing is with foyles. A foile is, when the flesh for the time vanquisheth &amp; subdueth the spirit. In this case, the man regenerate is like a soldier, that with a blow hath his brain-pan cracked, so as he lyes groueling astonished not able to fight: or like him that hath a fit of the falling sicknes, who for a time lies like a dead man. Hence the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion may be mooued, whether the flesh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing doth not extinguish the spirit, &amp; so cut off a man from Christ, till such time as he be ingrafted again. The answer is this. There be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2226:48"/>
two sorts of christians: one who doth only in shew &amp; name professe Christ: &amp; such an one is no otherwise a member of Christs mystical body, then a wooden leg set to the body is a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the body. The second is he that in name &amp; deed is a liuely part &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christ. If the first fall, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be said to be cut off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was never ingrafted. If the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fall, he may be &amp; is cut off from Christ. But marke how: he is not wholly cut of but in some part, namely in respect of the inward fellowship &amp; communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Christ, but not in respect of coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him. A mans arme take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the dead palsie, hangs by &amp; receives no heate, life, or sense fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of the members, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head, yet for all this, it remains still united &amp; coupled to the body, &amp; may again be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by plaisters &amp; phisicke: so after agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fall the childe of God feeles no inward peace and comfort but is smitten in conscience with tbe trembling of a spirituall palsie for his offence: and yet indeed remaines before God a member of Christ which shall be restored to his former estate after serious repentance.</p>
            <p>And God permits these foiles for weighty causes: first that men might be abashed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2226:48"/>
in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves with the consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their vile natures &amp; learne not to swell with pride, because of Gods grace. Paul saith that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had bin rapt into the third heaven, the <hi>angell Satan was sent to buffet him,</hi> and (as we said) to beat him black &amp; blew, that he might not be exalted out of measure. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that we may learn to deny our selues &amp; cleaue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottom of our hearts. Paul saith that he was sick to death, <hi>that he might</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>not trust in him selfe, but in God who raiseth the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the maner of the combate: now followes the cause of it.</p>
            <p>The cause is the contrariety that is between the flesh and the spirit. As Paul saith, <hi>The wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note> 
               <hi>of the flesh is enmitie to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we are taught, that since the fall, there is no free wil in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in spiritual matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning either the worship of God or life everlasting. For flesh is nothing els but our naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing els but flesh by nature: for the spirit comes afterward by grace: &amp; yet flesh is flat contrary to the spirit which makes us do that which is pleasing unto God. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wil naturally is a flat bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dslaue unto sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:2226:49"/>Again, hence we may learne: that it is not an easie matter to practise religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is to liue according to the spirit, to which our naturall disposition is as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary as fire to water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will obey God, we must learne to force our natures to the duties of godlines: yea, even sweat and take paines therein.</p>
            <p>Lastly here we may learne the nature of sin. The spirit is not a substance but a quality: and therfore the flesh which is nothing els but ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne, and is contrary to the spirit, must also be a quality: for such as the nature of one contrary is, such is the other. There is in euery man the substance of body and soule, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sin, for then the spirit also should be the substance of man. There is also in the substance the faculties of body &amp; soule: &amp; they can not be sinne, for then euery man should haue lost the faculties of his soule by Adams fall. Lastly in the faculties there is a contagion or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which carieth them against the law: and that is properly sinne and the flesh, which is contrary to the spirit.</p>
            <p>The fourth point is touching the persons in whom this combat is. Paul shewes who they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2226:49"/>
are, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith, <hi>So that ye can not, &amp;c.</hi> where it appeares that such as haue this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat in them must be as the Galatians, men iustified &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: And yet not all such, but only they that be of yeres: for the infants of the faithfull, how soeuer we must repute them to belong to the kingdom of heauen, &amp; therfore to be iustified &amp; sanctified: yet because they do not commit actuall sin, they want this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat of the flesh and spirit, which sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for those which be unregenerate, they neuer felt this fight. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny say that the worst man in the world, when he is about to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any sinne, hath a strife &amp; fight in him. It is true indeed: but that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, which is between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienceand the heart. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science on the one part terrifying the man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinne: the will and the affections haling &amp; pulling him therunto: the will &amp; the affections wishing &amp; desiring that sin were no sin, &amp; Gods commandement abolished: wheras contrariwise the conscience with a shril voice proclaimes sin to be sin. This fight was in Pilat, who by the force of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science feared to condemne Christ: &amp; yet was willing, and yeelded to condemne him that he might please the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:2226:50"/>Furthermore, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat is in the regenerate but during the time of this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they which are perfitly sanctified feele no strifte. If any shal say, that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat was in Christ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he said, <hi>Father, if it be thy will let this cup passe from me, yet not my will but thine be done.</hi> Indeed here is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, but of another sort: namely the fight of two divers desires: the one was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to do his fathers will in suffering the death of the crosse: the other a natural desire (which was no sinne but a meere infirmity of humane nature) whereby he in his manhood desires (as the maner of nature is to seek the preseruation of it selfe) to haue the cursed death of the crosse remooued from him.</p>
            <p>The fift point is the effect of this combat, which is to make the man regenerate, <hi>that he can not doe the things which he would:</hi> and this must be understood in things both good &amp; ill.</p>
            <p>And first he can not do the evill which he would for two causes. First because he cannot commit sin at what time soeuer he would. S. Iohn saith, <hi>He that is borne of God sinneth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>neither can he sin, because he is borne of God,</hi> that is, he can not sin at his pleasure or when he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2226:50"/>
will. Ioseph when he was assaulted by Puti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phars wife to adultery; because the grace of God abounded in him, wherby he answered her, saying, <hi>Shall I doe this, &amp; sin against God,</hi> he could not then sin. Lot, because his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart was grieved in seeing and hearing the abominations of Sodom, could not then sin as they of Sodom did. Hence it appeares, that such persons as liue in the daily practise of sin against their own consciences, (though they be professours of the true religion of Christ) haue no soundnes of grace in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the man regenerate can not sin in what manner he would: And there be two reasons therof. First, he can not sinne with <hi>full consent,</hi> of will or with all his heart: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the will so far forth as it is regenerate, resisteth and draweth back: yea, even then when a man is caried headlong by the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the flesh, he feeles some contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a regenerate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. It is a true rule that sin doth not reigne in the regenerate. For so much grace as is wrought in the mind, will, affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: so much is abated proportionally of the strength of the flesh, wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2226:51"/>
any sin, he doth it partly willingly, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against his wil. As the mariners in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest, cast Ionas into the sea willingly: for otherwise they had not done it: &amp; yet against their willes too: which appeares because they prayed, and cast their goods out of the ship, &amp; laboured in rowing against the tempest, &amp; that very long before they cast him out. And herein lies the difference betweene tvvo men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting one &amp; the same sinne, the one of them being rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, the other unregenerate. For the latter sins with all his heart &amp; with full consent, &amp; so doth not the first. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, though he fall into any sin, yet he doth not lie lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in it, but speedily recouers himself, by reason of grace in his hart.</p>
            <p>Hence it is manifest, that <hi>sinnes of infirmitie</hi> are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted only of such as are regenerate. As for the man unregenerate he cannot sin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity whatsoeuer some falsly think. For he is not weak but stark dead in sinne. And sinnes of infirmity are such only as rise of constraint, feare, hastines, &amp; such like sudden passions in the regenerate. Aed though they sin of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes often by reason of this spirituall combat, yet they do not alwaies: for they may sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst knowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:2226:51"/>To come to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point: the regenerate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot <hi>do the good which he would:</hi> because he cannot do it perfitly &amp; soundly according to Gods will as he would. Paul saith, <hi>To will is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> 
               <hi>present with me, but I find no means</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>perfitly to do that which I would.</hi> In this point the godly man is like a prisoner that is gotten forth of the gayle, &amp; that he might es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the hand of the keeper, desires &amp; striues with all his heart to run an 100 miles in a day: but because he hath strait and weighty boults on his legs, cannot for his life creep past a mile or twain, &amp; that with chafing his flesh &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting himselfe. So the servants of God do hartily desire, &amp; indeavour to obey God in all his comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements: as it is said of king Iosias, <hi>That he turned to God with all his heart, with</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. king. 23. 25.</note> 
               <hi>all his soule, with all his might, according to all the lawes of Moses, &amp;c.</hi> yet because they are clogged with the boltes of the flesh, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme obedience both slowly and weakely, with divers slips &amp; falles.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the combat: now let vs see what use may be made of it.</p>
            <p>First of all by it we learn what is the estate of a christian man in this life. A christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2226:52"/>
that is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al evil cogitations, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebellious inclinations &amp; motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of will &amp; affections, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all maner of slips in his life &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versation: for such an one is a mere deuise of mans brain &amp; not to be found upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. But indeed he is the sound christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feeling himselfe laden with the corruptions of his vile &amp; rebellious nature, bewailes them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hart, &amp; with might and main fights against them by the grace of gods spirit. Againe here is ouerthrown the popish opinion of merit &amp; iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by workes of grace, on this manner. Such as the cause of works is, such are works the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves. The cause of works in man, is the mind, will, &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sanctified: in which, the flesh &amp; the spirit are mixt togither, as hath bin shewed before. Therfore works of grace, euen the best of them are mixt works, partly holy &amp; partly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. wherby it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to a man that hath but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sense, that they are not answerable to the righteousnes of the law: &amp; that therfore, they can neither merit life, or any way iustify a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God. If any reply, that good works are the works of Gods spirit, &amp; for that cause perfitly righteous: I answer, it is true indeed, they come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy ghost that can not sin, but not only or immediatly. For they come
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2226:52"/>
also from the corrupt mind and will of man, and in that respect become sinfull, as sweete water issuing out of a pure fountaine, is by a filthy channell made corrupt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we do he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce learn that concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or originall sin is properly &amp; indeed sin after baptism, though it please the councel of Trent to decree otherwise. For after baptism it is flat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the spirit, &amp; rebels against it. Papists obiect that it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by baptism. <hi>Ans.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal sin or the flesh is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate thus. In it there be 3. things, the guilt, the punishment, the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the first 2. are quite abolished by the merit of Christs death in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: the third that is the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remaines still: but mark in what manner: it remains wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, it remaines not imputed to the person of the beleeuer.</p>
            <p>Lastly hereby we are taught to be watchfull in prayer. <hi>Watch &amp; pray</hi> (saith Christ, <hi>&amp;c. for the spirit is ready but the flesh is weak.</hi> Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, when 2. twins stroue in her wombe was troubled &amp; said, why am I so? wherefore she we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ask the Lord, namely by some prophet. So when we feele this inward fight, the best thing is to haue recourse to God by prayer,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2226:53"/>
and to his word, that the spirit may be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened against the flesh. As the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael by compassing the city of Ierico 7. daies, and by sounding rammes hornes overturned the walles thereof: so by serious invocation of Gods name the spirite is confirmed, and the turrets and towres of the rebellious flesh bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
