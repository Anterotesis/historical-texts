            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Second Humble Petition of <hi>Abel Carew</hi> an Excluded Door-keeper from this Honourable Houſe, with a True Account of the Cauſe of the preſent Serjeants Acting againſt your Petitioner. Alſo a Deſcription of the Serjeant's Power in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any Place belonging to this Houſe:</head>
            <p>Humbly Sheweth,<lb/>
THAT whereas your Petitioner lately Petitioned your Honours, ſetting forth the Cauſe of his being Secluded the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Serjeant <hi>Shoreditch</hi> of his wearing the Ribbon at <hi>Oxford</hi> with this Motto, <hi>No Slavery, No Popery.</hi> Your ſaid Petitioner further ſets forth, That as he was the laſt Parliament taken into Cuſtody for ſpeaking ſome Words of an Alteration againſt Popery in Seven Years time, he has ſufficient cauſe to believe, that the whole Houſe was at that time acquainted of him; for it happened within a day or two after he was diſcharged: When the Houſe was up, he went in to ſee what it was of the Clock by the Dial; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome of the Members behind, who took notice of him; and one of them asked your Petitioner, What he did there? and bid him be gone, Saying, That he was one that wiſh'd for the time to wear the Ribbon again. Thus your Petitioner, through much difficulty, by the Interceſſion of a Friend, obtained his Liberty from a Priſon, with paying of Fees. And Serjeant <hi>Topham</hi> being now reſtored to his Place, your ſaid Petitioner agreeing to the Authority of this Houſe againſt Popery, and expecting for the ſaid Serjeant to do likewiſe, he was willing to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſaid Serjeant in any manner that your Honours ſhould require of him: But the ſaid Serjeant having thwarted the Authority of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in not admitting your Petitioner to his ſaid Place; therefore your ſaid Petitioner further ſets forth, That the Cauſe of the ſaid Serjeants acting againſt your Petitioner, and of his being offended at him, in keeping him out of his ſaid Door-keepers Place, doth ariſe upon ſome old Grudge: Ever ſince he did belong to this Houſe, he has endeavoured to undermine, and to ſell your Petitioner out of his ſaid Door-keepers Place for 20 or 30 <hi>l.</hi> And accordingly in the late King <hi>Charles</hi>'s time, he was pleaſed to tell your Petitioner, he was offered ſo much for it; and within a a ſhort time after he turn'd your Petitioner out, and was then Reſtor'd by ſome of the worthy Members of the Houſe; but was firſt told by one of the Worthy Members, that the Serjeant ſaid, That he ſhould ask pardon; whereas your Petitioner is Conſcious of no Crime that he had committed againſt him; and the ſaid Serjeant having no objections againſt him, he was then reſtored without asking Pardon, and without paying any Mony for it. But it may be objected, That the Serjeant is a Patent Officer, and ſo he has a Power to Depute Servants under him. For Anſwer, He has no Patent to act unjuſtly, and to twhart the Authority of any of the Members of this Houſe againſt Popery; and your Petitioner being thankful to thoſe Worthy Members, who have ſpoken to the Serjeant in his behalf; and the ſaid Serjeant pretends to ſome of them, that he ſhall have ſhare of the Profits, which is nothing at all; and that he pretends that he offered your Petitioner a Meſſengers Place, which your Petitioner is not capable of; and this is only with a deſign to exclude your Petitioner for ever from his ſaid Door-keepers Place; and ſo to make him his Bondſlave, and to turn your Petitioner out at his pleaſure: And he makes an Objection concerning Letters, which was occaſioned about Six or Seven years ago, upon the ſaid Serjeants receiving ſome Money out of the Exchequer for the Under-Servants belonging to this Houſe, which was never paid to any other Serjeant before this; for the Under-Servants did formerly uſe to receive it themſelves, (as the Door-keepers to the Houſe of Lords, the Uſher of the Black Rod did never concern himſelf with their Mony that they received out of the Exchequer) but this Serjeant has endeavour'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs that Mony to himſelf; and accordingly he kept back part of your Petitioners Mony, and threatned to turn him out of his Place; thereupon he ſent a Letter to the ſaid Serjeant at <hi>Windſor</hi> for his Mony, who ſent him an anſwer by his Son, wherein he doth ſeem to queſtion your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners due, and yet acknowledges the Debt: But your Petitioner having confuted him in that Letter, and ſo fully convinc'd him of his due, that he ſent another Letter by his Son of what time he would be at <hi>London,</hi> within ſome time after he paid him half a Guinea in part, though it was in a great rage and ſtorm: But when the ſaid Serjeant came to Town again, your Petitioner went to demand the reſt of his Mony; thereupon he ſtorm'd at your Petitioner, and ſaid, that it was not his due, and that he would not pay it him; and after the ſaid Serjeant received many Letters from your Petitioner, and would ſhew him no Reaſon and Juſtice; ſo that at the laſt, as he was in Town, he ſtorm'd at your Petitioner and threatned to ſerve a Warrant upon him: Thereupon your ſaid Petitioner reply'd, That he would ſave him that trouble, and go with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Magiſtrate without a Warrant; and if it was not his due, he would not have a Farthing of him; and ſo your ſaid Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner went voluntarily with him without a Warrant, before Juſtice <hi>Dewcy,</hi> who forthwith ordered the ſaid Serjeant to pay him the reſt of his Mony. And thus your Petitioner recovered his due: And by the payment thereof, (as your Petitioner is able to make manifeſt by Letters) the ſaid Serjeant doth acknowledge the ſaid Inward Door-keepers Place to be your Petitioners Right, and his due, by the Authority and Command of any Member of this Houſe, who is pleaſed to give it him, as being above the power of the Serjeant; though the ſaid Serjeant, by his Arbitrary Power, has denied divers of the Members, and doth ſtill keep your Petitioner out of his ſaid Place; and though the Serjeant is truſted with a Power to depute in caſe of a Vacancy, yet as he is a Servant himſelf, it is all in reference to the Service of this Houſe; and ſo they are all Servants under the command of all your Honours, according to the Example of other old Servants, and of Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> who was Outward Door-keeper to this Houſe about 40 years, till he died; and ſo was continued in by the Authority of the Members againſt any Serjeant at Arms that oppoſed him; and according to the Example of a Serjeant at Arms, (within the memory of your Petitioner) who diſobeyed the Order of the Houſe; thereupon the Houſe turn'd him out, and ſent for another Serjeant; yet notwithſtanding the Door-keepers continued in their Places; and if they were his Servants, then they were diſmiſs'd too; but they were Servants to the Houſe; and ſo they were mentioned in the Reſolves of the Houſe for Collections to pay the Under-Servants attending the Service of this Houſe; and by a former Reſolve of the Houſe, as in the year 1671. for them to be recommended to his Majeſty to give order for a Recompence and Satisfaction of the ſaid Servants attending the Service of this Houſe. And your Petitioner doth remember, that in the late King <hi>Charles</hi>'s time, when the ſaid Serjeant threatned to turn him out; your ſaid Petitioner told the ſaid Serjeant, That he was a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervant to the Houſe of Commons; thereupon the ſaid Serjeant threatned to break your Petitioners Head, if he told him ſo again, ſaying, That he was the Kings Serjeant at Arms; but, by the Serjeants Favor, as he is the Kings Serjeant at Arms, ſo he is the Kings Servant; and as he is the Kings Servant, ſo he is conſtituted by the King to attend the Service of this Houſe. But your Petitioner has ſufficient cauſe to believe, that the ſaid Serjeant at Arms would Aſſume a Regal Power to himſelf. And now your Petitioner may ſay, that it is an undeniable Argument by the Serjeants denying divers of the Worthy Members for your Petitioner to be admitted to his ſaid Place, who has been a Sufferer for ſpeaking againſt Popery, that the ſaid Serjeant doth look upon his Old Grudge; that it ought to take place before Loyalty, or it ought to extirpate Loyalty, or any part of Loyalty to his Preſent Majeſty; yea, if it was in his power for lucre of gain, he would take any man into cuſtody, that acts againſt Popery; for he has commanded your Petitioner to depart the Lobby, and laid hold on him to turn him out by Violence, when he has given him no provocation; and has told him that the Door-keepers Place is no Place for him, who doth agree to the Authority of all your Honours againſt Popery. And thus the ſaid Serjeant ſtands brazening and confronting the Authority of your Honours in your Loyalty to the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, who is Defender of the Faith againſt Popery and Arbitrary Government. And the ſaid Serjeant may conſider, that though he frowns upon your Petitioner, yet the Times do ſmile upon him: But the ſaid Door being ſtill kept by the ſame Man that was put in the laſt Parliament by Serjeant <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> who turn'd your Petitioner out for being againſt Popery. And thus all the Places belonging to this Houſe being under the Authority and Juriſdiction of all your Honours;</p>
            <p>Therefore your Petitioner doth further humbly pray for the Conſideration of this Honourable Houſe, That as it was his Fathers Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſo he hopes that as conſiſtent to the Benevolence of this Houſe in point of Charity, and his ſuffering upon the account of Popery, as concurrent to the Authority of this Houſe againſt Popery or Arbitrary Government, will be Arguments to prevail with all your Honours to reconcile the ſaid Serjeant to him, ſo that he may be reſtored to his ſaid Door-keepers Place.</p>
