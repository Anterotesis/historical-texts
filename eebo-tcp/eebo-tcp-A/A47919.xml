            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>UPon the Blessed Return of his Sacred Majesty, I found my self under a Censure of Betraying him: This put me upon the publishing of divers scatterd Papers to acquit my self, which (alltogether) were entitled my <hi>Apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make the folly the more pardonable, I shaped it like a little <hi>Story,</hi> tracing the whole course of Affairs then in motion by the best <hi>Method</hi> I could give it, but for the <hi>Truth</hi> of what is there contein'd, I dare account.</p>
            <p>The Book lay dead a good while upon the Stationers hand; the businesse of that time being not so much to enquire who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd <hi>Reward,</hi> or who <hi>Punishment;</hi> but some were busie to <hi>Get,</hi> others to <hi>Scape,</hi> and not a few most fortunately did <hi>Both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The World it seems is now at better Leisure to look about them, and among other Trifles, this Book is call'd upon: The reason why I <hi>Printed</hi> it, is gone, and so is that too why it was not <hi>minded.</hi> My <hi>Credit</hi> being at present <hi>Fairer</hi> then it was, although my <hi>Fortune</hi> some what <hi>Worse:</hi> But till all Offices were disposed of, it might have possibly been Inconvenient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any man <hi>honest,</hi> that was <hi>poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55786:3"/>Finding this composition now afresh enquired for, to do the Stationer a kindnesse, I have a little altered the <hi>Title;</hi> and to oblige the <hi>Reader,</hi> I have Exchanged a <hi>Longer Preface</hi> for a <hi>shorter:</hi> The rest continues to a Syllable the very thing it was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One Apology for another,</hi> methinks is <hi>False Heraldry,</hi> yet I must beg the Reader to believe that I had no vanity to shew my self to the Publique in that Dresse: nor was I such a Sot, as to expect that what I fram'd to the Humour of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> should much affect the <hi>Serious.</hi> But willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rather to want <hi>Wit,</hi> then <hi>Honesty;</hi> and (to deal frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) not without some hopes, that my good meaning would not be ill taken, I caused to be Printed this Discourse ensuing.</p>

            <p>I Am here to Advertise, that as at first I entred upon This Pamphlet with great Unwillingnesse; so I have now at Last, rather chosen to break the Accompt, and Order of it, by Leaving out 34. Pages of what I intended, than overcharge the Reader by Filling up of this ensuing Vacancy. It is too much allready, of what is <hi>Necessary;</hi> and That which I had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for this Place, not being of so Absolute Necessity to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Purpose, I shall refer to a more proper Opportunity and Leisure.</p>

            <head>L'ESTRANGE HIS APOLOGY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO begin with the Beginning of the <hi>War,</hi> and of my <hi>Story.</hi> My Judgement led me to the Kings Party, and That I Serv'd, without any other Aym, or Benefit, than the Discharge of my Duty. In 1644. I was Betray'd by a Brace of Villains: by name, <hi>Leman,</hi> and <hi>Haggar</hi>) upon a Treaty to surprize <hi>Linn Regis.</hi> The former of these had been at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there Solicited, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Promise of a Command at Sea; and Both of them were bound up under an Oath of Secrecy, and Fidelity, as Rank as words could make it. Being seized; and his Majestie's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55786:4"/>
found about me: I was Hurry'd away, first to <hi>Linn;</hi> Thence to <hi>London;</hi> and There transmitted to the City. Court-Martial for my Tryal. (where Two Prime men were a <hi>Saleman,</hi> and an <hi>Ostler</hi>) In this Extremity, nothing was left unsaid, that might Infame me: and with so strong a Confidence too, that the best Friends I had, were stagger'd at it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Commission</hi> was Decry'd for <hi>Counterfeit;</hi> The <hi>Design, Rash,</hi> and <hi>Foolish:</hi>—The <hi>Instrument,</hi> as <hi>much;</hi>—The <hi>Menage, worse;</hi> There were two that Affirmed, that I <hi>Betray'd</hi> all, with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, <hi>How,</hi> and upon <hi>What Conditions.</hi> I was at last brought to the Bar; and Charg'd, First as a <hi>Spy;</hi> then as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> with all the Circumstances of Rudenesse, and Severity Imaginable. Upon that Hearing, the Court Inclining to acquit me, It was proposed, and Carry'd, under pretence of Favour to me, that Judgement might be deferred, and two dayes longer Respit given me for the advantage of my Defence. In this <hi>Interim,</hi> they had pack'd a Committee, and then Condemn'd me as <hi>Traytor;</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons Contributing to this Vote, that never heard one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of my Tryal. My Sentence being pass'd, I threw a Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of my Case among them, with these very Words; That <hi>Since they would not Hear my Defence, they might Read it; That was it.</hi> A young Red Headed Fellow, burnt it. I was then cast into <hi>Newgate;</hi> whence I dispatch'd forthwith a Petitionary Appeal to the Lords; and Narratives of the Proceedings to the Principal of Both Houses. At This Time I received a Friendly Visit, from Mr. <hi>Therowgood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arrowsmith,</hi> (then of the <hi>Synod</hi>) with an Assurance, that they would do their utmost to preserve me, if I would but Petition to be Banish'd, and Take the Covenant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, there was no Possibility to Save me. My Answer was, (with a Respect to their Civility) to this effect: That if I could be so great a <hi>Knave,</hi> as soberly to Contradict my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in order to the Saving of my Life; I was not yet so great a <hi>Fool,</hi> as to be Hang'd, with my Confession about my Neck. The time appointed for my Execution, being the <hi>Thursday</hi> following,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55786:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Lords Ordered my Reprieve, commanding MILLS, (the <hi>Iudge-Advocate</hi>) to bring in my <hi>Charge,</hi> upon <hi>Wednesday.</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared accordingly, but with an Excuse, that he wanted Time to Prepare it; however upon <hi>Friday</hi> it should be Ready. It was then Providentially Demanded; whether they meant to Hang me First, and then Charge me; and if they Intended to execute me in the Interim? He told them, Yes; For <hi>the Commons had pass'd an Order that no Reprieve should stand good, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Both Houses.</hi> Hereupon, they desired a Conference; but the <hi>Commons</hi> had Voted also, <hi>That no Private Businesse should be Mov'd in Ten dayes.</hi> This notwithstanding; with great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it was Debated, and my Reprieve confirm'd, for 14. daies: and after That, Prolong'd, in Order to a further Hearing. In this Condition of Expectancy, I lay almost 4. years, a Prisoner; and only an Order betwixt me, and the Gallows. I am the more Particular in This, because I have so many Honorable Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to prove the Truth of every Syllable I say: and yet in this Extremity, I had as much to do to Preserve my Credit among my Pretending, Friends, as to Defend my Life against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of my Professed Enemies.</p>
            <p>MY first Step out of <hi>Prison,</hi> was into <hi>Kent,</hi> and There, (God knows it) had my Soul depended upon a strict Account for every Thought, and Moment; I could not have employ'd more Care, and Zeal, in the Performance of my Duty, than I did: Yet in the very height of our Successe, being grown to a Considerable Body, even out of Nothing, It was Suggested that <hi>L'estrange</hi> was <hi>False:</hi> But That Opinion was soon Quieted, by a Discriminating Oath to the Commissioners at <hi>Rochester,</hi> which made those very Persons that had privately aspers'd Me, to withdraw; and diverse of them afterward appear'd openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. Upon the Dissolution of the Party, I Cross'd the Sea; and There I found the main Miscariage of the Businesse Cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Me; but still by Those that Ruin'd it Themselves. After a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55786:5"/>
Six Month's tryal, by Word of mouth, and Letter, to Rectifie Mistakes, I found my self at length obliged to a more Publique way of doing it, and then, I Printed a Formal <hi>Series,</hi> and Relation of the Story; under the Title of my <hi>Vindication.</hi> This Discourse prov'd as Effectual as I wish'd it; For, insisting only upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, with every Circumstance of <hi>Persons, Time,</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> Material to my Purpose, there remain'd no Pretense for Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and yet I made it my great Care, as well to Disperse Copies, as to provoke a Reply, if any Syllable of what I said would bear it. The Sum of all amounts to This. I gave a due Accompt of all Employments which the Country put upon me, nor could I reasonably be charged as Causal to any Miscariages, when there hapened none, while I had any Interest in the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. At last, upon the Conjunction of the County-Forces, finding some Dangerous, and Unseasonable disagreements, even among themselves; besides some Scruples started against Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I thought it the best Service I could do them, to render that Command I had, to the Commissioners, and leave Them to Respond, both for the Conduct, and the Issue of the Rest. Nor having done This, did I quitt my Duty; but after the losse of <hi>Maidstone,</hi> I mov'd the Committee at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (although in <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) to give another Push for't. From Thence, I went to <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> where finding the Town in a Tumult, and Abandon'd; The Sea Before me, and the Enemy Behind me, I took a Bote, and with much Difficulty, Escaped.</p>
            <p>So much for KENT.</p>
            <p>I Continu'd beyond Sea, from 1648. till the Army dissolv'd the <hi>Rump</hi> in 1653. and then Returning, after 2 or 3. Months dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attendance, I was Examin'd by a Committee of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and in the End discharg'd from that Attendance, upon 2000l. Bayl, to Appear at any time within 12. Months, upon Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>After that Bond given, I challenge the World to say, where
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55786:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ever I exchang'd Syllable either with the <hi>Protector,</hi> or his <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary:</hi> or that ever I Communicated, Directly, or Indirectly, with any man of the Party, upon Publique Business. Nay more: Let any man prove that I did ever disown my First Judgement:—That ever I took any <hi>Engagement:</hi>—That I ever held any Particular Converse with any person of Differing Principles:———or, in Fine:—Let it appear that ever I either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined any Rationall means of serving my Prince, my <hi>self,</hi> or Diverted <hi>others</hi> from it; Nay if I am not able to Evidence the contrary; and that I have steadily, and Positively employed all the Faculties, and Interests I had in the World, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, I am content to suffer, as if I had been the Murtherer of his Father.</p>
            <p>During the Rule of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> there was small Encouragement, to Form any Design, unlesse upon his Person. For Betwixt diverse Renegado-<hi>Royallists,</hi> and Mercenary Male-contents of his own Party, it was scarce possible to Act without Discovery: beside, that he was <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Cruell.</hi> (Two great Advantages over a slavish People) His <hi>Death</hi> in 1658. opened the way most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a <hi>Change,</hi> but That which entred upon it, in 1659. was of all others (I think) the Least expected.</p>
            <p>Severall of the Old Members finding the Councell of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at a Stand, (having Cast off their new Protector) Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Army</hi> to Invite <hi>their Return to a Discharge of their Trust as before Apr.</hi> 20. 1653.

            <p>THis Dispute Lasted not Long; and <hi>Lambert</hi>'s return put an End to any further thoughts of stirring in the City, for that Bout.</p>
            <p>The next Opportunity of Moving, was upon the Dispatch of the Army into the <hi>North</hi> to oppose <hi>General Monck:</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being then Lodg'd in a Committee of 23 Officers of the Army: which gross Usurpation, together with the <hi>New Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> which they had Imposed upon the City, (<hi>Nov.</hi> 11.) put the Citizens upon an Absolute Necessity of Endeavour to Free themselves: To which end, they resolv'd to Petition the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counsell,</hi> for their Assistance towards the obteining of a <hi>Free-Parliament,</hi> according to the Antient Constitution of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Petition was accordingly <hi>Drawn, Subscribed,</hi> and <hi>Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> but by reason of some pretended Informality in the Address, it was laid aside. This Repulse made the Petitioners more Eager than they would have been; especially finding themselves Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd

by diverse of those Persons to whom they had committed the Care of their Protection.</p>
            <p>Upon Monday, <hi>Dec.</hi> 5. Horse and Foot were dispatch'd into the City, by Violence to hinder the Re-enforcement of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they behaved themselves with an Insolence, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism, not to be express'd. In this Action, had the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy been but half so carefull to Vindicate the <hi>Honour</hi> of the City, as they were to save the <hi>Enemies</hi> of it, not a soul of them had sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>

Nor have these Principles of Publique tenderness been lesse Eminent, upon our <hi>Iudgements,</hi> than upon our <hi>Passions;</hi> For, we have as well <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Witness that Execrable Monday</hi> (sacred to the Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of this City) even <hi>Then,</hi> when we had that Enemy at our <hi>Mercy,</hi> toward whom, by the Rights of Nature, and of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, wee were not bound to exercise <hi>any;</hi> even Then, I say, in the very <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Course</hi> of an Honest, and Powerfull <hi>Indignation,</hi> we returned <hi>Quietly,</hi> to our Houses, upon the first Notice, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55786:10"/>
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> would have it so. But it is likewise true, that this Assurance was added to the Message, <hi>viz. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counsel was sensible of our Grievances, and would duly consider them.</hi> Since this, we find nothing done in persuance of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; but on the Contrary, Injuries are Multiplyed upon us; and those of that Day, serve but as Arguments of Encouragement to Greater. <hi>Some</hi> of us <hi>Killed, Others Wounded,</hi> and <hi>lead in Triumph Naked</hi> through the Streets: Two or three Hundred Thousand Persons <hi>Looking on, to celebrate the Conquest, and the Shame.</hi> A Citizens Skull is but a thing to try the Temper of a Souldiers Sword upon; Give us every Man a <hi>Red-coat</hi> for a <hi>Cash-Keeper,</hi> and the work's done. They're come within a Trifle on't already; and all this while, an <hi>Order</hi> to be <hi>Quiet,</hi> is all our Patient Masters will afford us. Give us an Order that may make us <hi>Safe,</hi> (although we need not <hi>Ask,</hi> what we can <hi>Give</hi> our selves) <hi>Perswade</hi> these people to be <hi>Gone,</hi> or <hi>Bidus</hi> Drive them out; What <hi>Law</hi> made <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Gresham Colledge, Garrisons?</hi> If nothing else will do, we'll do't our selves: We have <hi>Engaged,</hi> and <hi>sworn</hi> the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the City,</hi> and nothing can <hi>Absolve</hi> us from the <hi>Oath</hi> we have taken. This must be done betimes too, 'twill come too late else, to prevent, either the Necessity of a Tumult, or the greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, of a Supine and Credulous Security. <hi>A Parliament</hi> in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> will do us no more good, than a Cordial will do him that was <hi>Hanged</hi> last Sessions. Our Sense at Large, we delivered to the world, in a Paper, Entituled, <hi>The Final Protest, and Sense of the</hi> CITY: VVhich is Publique enough, notwithstanding the great Design used to suppress it, and the Insolences of divers persons, disaffected to the good of the City, toward those that sold them. <hi>To That we adhere.</hi> That <hi>Protest</hi> of <hi>Ours,</hi> produced <hi>Another</hi> from the <hi>Common counsel,</hi> of the 20th. Current, to which something ought to bee said. The sum of that Order is, but in effect, the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Lord Mayor, in the matter of Prudence and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: we do not Deny, but finding our selves abandoned to all sorts of Outrages, by the Cold Proceeding of the Court in our behalf,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55786:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we were transported to some bitter Reflections: Involving the <hi>present Mayor,</hi> with his more Criminal <hi>Predecessor Ireton,</hi> in the Imputation. We shall not more <hi>Gladly find</hi> it a Mistake, than <hi>Readily Confess</hi> it one, when we reap the Effects of that Care for the Good of the City; but so long as <hi>Wee</hi> are <hi>tyed</hi> up from all <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Defence,</hi> and the <hi>Publique Enemy</hi> at <hi>liberty</hi> to practise all <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Violences</hi> upon us, we desire to be Pardoned, if we suspend in the Case.</p>
                           <p>The Cloze indeed is very Noble, and worthy of the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they Declare, <hi>For the Fundamental Lawes, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, &amp;c.—and in fine, to endeavour the convening of a Free Parliament,</hi> in order thereunto. But in Contradiction to this Resolve, the Committee of Officers have yesterday published a Paper, Entituled, <hi>The Agreement, &amp;c.</hi>—fairly telling us, That we are to be Governed by People of their Chusing, and by a Model of their framing, without any regard had to the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Antient Laws,</hi> or to the <hi>Interest,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of every <hi>Freeborn English-man.</hi> This Usurpation is to bee considered in its due place; at present it concerns us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hinder them from making the Slavery of the City, their first Step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Subjection of the Nation. The seasonable Care of This, we do Humbly, and Earnestly recommend to the <hi>Court of Common-counsel;</hi> Our Hopes are, that we are now fallen into Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hands, and if our Magistrates will but Command us, they have an Hundred Thousand Lives in readiness to Engage for them. If we should be so unhappy, as to be still delayed; wee do however wash our hands of the Consequences: And so <hi>God Direct and Deliver Us.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>In order to this effect: <hi>The City of</hi> London <hi>hath constituted</hi> 4 <hi>Commissioners, to Treat Respectively with the rest of the People of</hi> England, <hi>in the behalf of their invaded Rights, and in such manner to Proceed, as to the said Commissioners shall appear most convenient.</hi>

                           <p>In persuance of this Appointment; <hi>We Four,</hi> (whose Names, and Authority you shall find in a Schedule, to this annexed) do, in the <hi>Name,</hi> and by the <hi>Commission</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and unanimously desire a General Assistance, toward a work of a Publique and Universal Benefit.</hi> The transaction of this Affair, we have committed to Persons, eminent both for Honesty and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: and to gain Dispatch, as well as Privacy, wee have at the same Instant, and by safe hands, dispersed True and Exact Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of These to you, throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> Our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication should have been more Regular, but for three or four false Brethren in our Counsels, whom wee dare not confide in. <hi>We find few the Honester for the Quarrel, that are the Richer for it;</hi> and <hi>no other Enemies to the Peace of the Nation, but the Gainers by the Ruine of it.</hi> Upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a due scanning of the whole matter, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>nothing can restore us but a Free Parliament:</hi> Nor can any thing compose that, but a <hi>Free Vote,</hi> without either <hi>Force,</hi> or <hi>Faction.</hi> The most likely means to procure this, will be a <hi>general
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55786:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Engagement,</hi> to endeavour it. We ask no more, than that <hi>you</hi> will follow our Example. That Paper, which we commend to you, is already subscribed by many Thousands of this City. If you Approve it, doe as much; and if you think Fit; <hi>chuse out of every County Two Persons of a Known Integrity, that may be still Among us, and at hand, to preserve a fair Intelligence betwixt us.</hi> No lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger since, than Yesterday, the <hi>Conservators of our Liberties;</hi> Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>and his Mirmidons,</hi> put an affront upon us, and with some mischief too, upon this very Point: The very mention of a <hi>Free-Parliament</hi> enrages them, and there is Reason for it. <hi>Their Heads are forfeited, and if the Law Lives, They must Perish.</hi> But all this while, we're in a good condition, when the <hi>Trangressors</hi> of the Laws must be the <hi>Iudges</hi> of it. The very <hi>Boyes,</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> had destroyed the Party to a man, but that with much adoe, we hindred them. The Truth is, in such a Confusion, more honest blood might have been spilt, than that Rabble was worth. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, the City is grown so impatient of the Souldiers, that 'tis to be feared they will sodainly break out into an open violence upon them. They have already entred into a solemn Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that purpose: But we shall doe our best to quiet them, till we receive your Answer. In Fine; the <hi>End</hi> is <hi>honorable,</hi> and we desire the <hi>means</hi> that lead to it may be so too. Let nothing be omitted that may save blood; The Army is necessitous, and without pay, they must or Steal, or Perish. Let <hi>us consider, they are our Countrey-men,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> of them, (the <hi>necessity apart) our Friends. Let such a course be taken, that so many of them as shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Advantage of a Free Election, may without either Fraud, or Delay receive their Arriers.</hi> We shall do our part in the Contribution and in all Offices of Relation to a <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Lawfull Settlement,</hi> as freely engage our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> with you, as we do our <hi>Pens</hi> in this Profession to you, that we are</p>

                           <p>HAving already satisfied you by what <hi>Authority</hi> we Act, it concerns us next, to acquaint you, to what <hi>purpose</hi> we are <hi>Sent,</hi> and what it is, which we have in Charge to deliver unto you.</p>
                           <p>Your <hi>Proposals for the Settlement of the Nation,</hi> (and That, by the means of a Free-Parliament) have been as Faithfully, and Generally communicated, as you intended they should; as Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received as you could wish; and the whole matter brought to as speedy an issue as was possible for an Affair of that Weight, and Quality to admit. In Testimony hereof, <hi>We are to give you the Thanks of the People of England;</hi> and to assure you, that they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55786:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not less <hi>pleased</hi> with your <hi>Method</hi> of promoting the Publick Good, than they are <hi>Obliged</hi> by those <hi>Affections</hi> which have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed you to endeavour it. Particularly, they are exceeding glad to find, that the City hath entrusted such Persons in the Businesse, as, beside all other due Qualifications for the Employment, have This also; that they were never Parties in the Quarrell. It hath been our Care likewise, to proceed by the same rule; and for this Reason, <hi>If Both Parties should be taken in, there might (possibly) be some Animosities started, sufficient to obstruct the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding:</hi> And again, <hi>should Either of them be left out, the matter would (probably) be carried by Faction.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This we are commanded to represent, rather as a <hi>Fair Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> than an <hi>Absolute Necessity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the next place, we are to inform you, that the Engagement you sent us, found so prone a Reception, that we reckon it, with us, a greater difficulty to Find an Enemy to the Intent of it, than to Subdue any whatever, that shall presume to appear against the Promoters of it. We do however hold our Selves bound to assure you, that we are perfectly resolved to Joyn in the Charge, and Hazard of the Dispute, with you: and that we are as Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in This Cause, as if the Treasure of the Nation had but one Master, and the Strength of it, were but directed by the Same Mind. The List of the Subscribers, we have here in Town: If you desire to see it you may: but if Otherwise, we offer to your Prudence to consider, if it may not be of more Advantage, and Security to the Businesse in hand, rather totally to conceal the Subscribers, if not also the Commissioners themselves. For the Thing it self, we are not only Willing, but Desirous to make That Publique. It is of so Honest, and Reasonable a Nature, that no Man <hi>Dares</hi> oppose it, who dares not be Damn'd; no man <hi>Will,</hi> that deserves to Live upon English ground: and to conclude, no Man <hi>Shall,</hi> and escape Unpunish'd. <hi>Parliaments are the Constitution Fundamentall of the Nation,</hi> the <hi>Safeguard,</hi> and the <hi>Honor of it:</hi> nor are we more concern'd to <hi>Support</hi> them, than to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55786:13"/>
be wary lest we <hi>Mistake</hi> them. We are to Distinguish betwixt <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> that we be not govern'd by Delusions; Where have we a greater <hi>Cheat,</hi> than that which stiles it self the <hi>Publique Faith? Greater Subverters</hi> of our <hi>Liberties,</hi> than some that write themselves, the <hi>Conservators</hi> of them? 'Tis not for 40 people to call themselves our <hi>Representative.</hi> Is't not enough that they have Robb'd us, unless they Govern us too? They'll say we <hi>Chose them,</hi> so did we chuse above 300 <hi>more;</hi> and we'll be <hi>Rul'd</hi> by <hi>All,</hi> or <hi>None of them.</hi> Without more adoe, having Formally assured you of an absolute <hi>Concurrence</hi> from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as to what they have received in Proposition from you: It remains now, only that we recommend some <hi>Additionals</hi> to you, which we conceive may be of some Benefit to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest of the whole.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>In the First Place</hi> we Propose, <hi>That no Petition</hi> be presented to this <hi>Pretended Parliament, from the City of</hi> London, <hi>and we Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take as much for our Selves.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly, That no Levies of Men, or Monies, be suffered, in persu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their</hi> Pretended Acts; <hi>and in case of any</hi> Force <hi>attempted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> Refusers, <hi>that we immediately</hi> Arm <hi>our Selves, and by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence Repell it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly, we judge it very fit, in regard of Dangers Imminent, both Forein, and Domestique, That a</hi> Free Parliament, <hi>be</hi> speedily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened; <hi>the</hi> Time <hi>and</hi> Manner of Summons <hi>instantly agreed upon, with a</hi> Salvo Jure <hi>to all Interests.——(By a Free Parliament, we understand, an Assembly of such Persons as by the Law are Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to chuse, without any other Restreint than what the Law imposes.) Not that we claim to our selves the Right of Calling Parliaments; but the Impossibility of procuring one Regularly; and the Absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of having something like one Suddenly:—This</hi> is enough to acquit <hi>us before God and Men.</hi> By these means, all Differences may be composed, all Parties reconciled; and to These pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses we are ready to Sacrifice our Lives, and Fortunes.</p>

                           <p>IT were no hard Matter to Trace the <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> thorough all it's several <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>Mixtures,</hi> from the very <hi>Fountain</hi> of it; and to <hi>Deduce</hi> the <hi>Story,</hi> from it's <hi>Original</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> down to this wretched <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Instant.</hi> The <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Assignment</hi> of it being proved, (That the <hi>Almighty Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> placed ONE RULER over the World) Enquiry might be made into the <hi>Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of those ensuing <hi>Changes,</hi> which, either <hi>Force, Craft,</hi> or <hi>Agreement</hi> afterward produced. To come a little neerer <hi>Home:</hi> much might be added, concerning <hi>our Religion, Parliaments, Magna Charta, &amp;c.</hi>—but the <hi>Presse</hi> groans under the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Nation</hi> under the Dispute. <hi>Conviction</hi> puts an end to <hi>Argument.</hi> The <hi>Question</hi> is no longer, <hi>Right,</hi> but <hi>Power;</hi> and our <hi>Reasonings</hi> are only An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with <hi>Blowes.</hi> It's true,—in the Infancy of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, when <hi>Rebellion, like a Painted Whore, under the Masque of Loyalty, and Conscience, Cheated the People into an Engagement: when onely some Mis-governments, in Church and State were to be Reformed; and that Pretence back't with a Thousand Oaths, to strengthen the Delusion: Dominion and Obedience, Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> were then a <hi>Proper,</hi> and a <hi>necessary Theame, to undeceive

the Nation,</hi> but now 'tis out of Season. The <hi>Sword's</hi> the onely <hi>Iudge</hi> of Controversies. Our businesse is, <hi>to Talk more Sensibly, and lesse Learnedly.</hi> Alas! to tell the <hi>Simple,</hi> that which they can <hi>never understand,</hi> and the <hi>Wise,</hi> that which they <hi>know already;</hi> Who's the <hi>Better</hi> fort? The <hi>Injuries</hi> we suffer, are <hi>Notorious;</hi> and <hi>Understood,</hi> as universally, as <hi>Felt.</hi> The skill would be, to find out a <hi>Fair Remedy,</hi> for a <hi>Foul Disease.</hi> In order to that, I shall be <hi>Plain,</hi> and short: <hi>Prove</hi> what I say, and keep my self within the Compasse of my Page. This <hi>Nation</hi> is at this instant, upon the Brink of a <hi>Reprochfull,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous</hi> Condition of <hi>want,</hi> and <hi>slavery:</hi> Nor is the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Calamity more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than the <hi>Reason</hi> of it. <hi>Half</hi> the Revenue of the Land is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shared among the <hi>Saints,</hi> and in Reward, for <hi>robbing</hi> us of <hi>That,</hi> we are to <hi>Give</hi> the <hi>Rest,</hi> and purchase our <hi>Bondage,</hi> dearer, than our Fore-Fathers did their <hi>Liberties.</hi> Indeed, a <hi>Hundred Thousand Pound a Moneth,</hi> when we have scarce Money left for Bread, is a modest Proportion: and to endear the Proposition to us, 'tis to maintain a warre against the established Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate our Thraldome: After this Tax is paid, they'll Ask no more, but Take the rest without the Ceremony: and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to Lose All, If we Levy This. By <hi>Violence,</hi> they keep themselves <hi>In,</hi> and their <hi>Fellowes Out;</hi> By <hi>Violence,</hi> they <hi>Sit,</hi> and <hi>Vote,</hi> and <hi>Execute.</hi> They're not the Twentieth part of those we Chose; and then the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Faction, is as Inconsiderable, as the <hi>Number.</hi> The Nation looks upon them, as a Herd of <hi>Wolves; they live by Blood and Rapine, and 'tis the Publique Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to Hunt them.</hi> They are too <hi>Few</hi> for us to <hi>Fear,</hi> too <hi>False</hi> to <hi>Trust,</hi> too <hi>Wicked,</hi> and <hi>Imperious,</hi> to <hi>Obey.</hi> 'Tis not their <hi>Ianiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> that will doe their Businesse, when the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> is united against them. The very <hi>Souldier</hi> that hath <hi>Raised</hi> them; Hates 'em; as being, at once, <hi>Instrumental</hi> to their <hi>Guilt,</hi> and to their <hi>Punishment.</hi> They are neither to be Obliged by Oathes, nor by Benefits. How meanly have they treated the very Officers that preserved, and Restored them; and Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55786:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all that ever Trusted them! Those Summes which were designed for the Satisfaction of Publike Accompts, they divide among themselves; and Turn those Troops to Free-quarter, whose Pay is already in their own Pockets. After all this, the <hi>Laws</hi> must be as well <hi>subdued,</hi> as the <hi>People:</hi> no other Title left us to our Lives, and Estates, but what depends upon the Vote of a Legislative Committee. It is already construed <hi>Sedition,</hi> to <hi>Demand,</hi> what the <hi>Law</hi> tells us, is <hi>Treason</hi> to <hi>Oppose:</hi> and the bare <hi>mention</hi> of a <hi>Free-Parliament</hi> puts our <hi>blessed remnant</hi> into a Sweat. There's <hi>Violence</hi> designed upon us, and <hi>Violence</hi> must meet it. <hi>The Axe is laid to the root: the Commune Freedome of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nation lies at stake; and 'tis our Commune Interest to defend it. The Iust, and peaceable assertion of our Undoubted rights, is Voted Breach of priviledge: and he that draws his Sword to save his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, forfeits his head for't.</hi> This will not doe. These worthy <hi>Squires</hi> of the <hi>Fagg end</hi> must take their Turns too. Suppose the <hi>City</hi> should refuse the Tax: (the <hi>Countries</hi> are resolved upon't) How <hi>Certain,</hi> and <hi>Inevitable,</hi> is their <hi>Ruine?</hi> The very first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Force,</hi> sets the whole Nation in a Flame. <hi>They Rise to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Work is done.</hi> 'Tis not the stifling of the <hi>Presse,</hi> can break their <hi>Correspondence:</hi> nor the <hi>Old Cheat of Creating New Plots,</hi> that will divert them. <hi>These Iugglers have shewed all their Tricks,</hi> and the whole World's Convinced of their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Design walks bare-fac'd. It is now evident, that they purpose to make us <hi>perpetual Slaves;</hi> and to enure us to no other <hi>Law,</hi> than the <hi>Imperious Will</hi> of our hard Masters. Their very best <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Assistants,</hi> are now <hi>discarded</hi> by these <hi>Thanklesse Wretches:</hi> the <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> and <hi>Congregationall Party</hi> being cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ballance with the <hi>Commune Enemy:</hi> and <hi>both</hi> alike <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> from the <hi>Government</hi> they promise us: (to shew, that their <hi>Ambition</hi> is as well <hi>Insociable</hi> as <hi>Boundlesse.</hi>)</p>
                           <p>To Finish All; what Security or Quiet, <hi>can that Faction expect, which never Requited a Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Spared an Enemy?

                           <p>THere is a Letter which hath passed the Press under your Name, dated at <hi>Leicester</hi> 23. <hi>Ian.</hi> and directed <hi>unto Mr.</hi> Rolle, <hi>to be communicated to the rest of the Gentry of</hi> Devon: &amp;c.—Whether this be your Excellencies Actor not, is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. If so it be, we receive it as a noble Respect from <hi>General Monk</hi> to his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Country men;</hi> if Otherwise, we look upon it as the <hi>Artifice</hi> of an <hi>Anti-Parliamentary Faction,</hi> under the <hi>pretence</hi> of your <hi>Concurrence</hi> and <hi>Aid,</hi> to <hi>Delude</hi> and <hi>Enslave</hi> the Nation.</p>
                           <p>It is <hi>one</hi> thing for a Person of Honour freely to communicate his Thoughts and Reasonings, (although in favour of a possible

                           </p>
                           <p>To hasten the dispatch of that little we have to say, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this, are of that number to whom your Letter directs. We shall proceed according to our Duties, and Instructions, and briefly acquaint your Excellency with the sense of those that have entrusted us.</p>
                           <p>We shall begin (my Lord) with the <hi>Concession</hi> of what wee much <hi>Suspect;</hi> and take for <hi>Granted,</hi> that the Letter so inscribed, is really <hi>Yours.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We are next to return you the <hi>Thanks</hi> of your <hi>Country men,</hi> for the expressions of your <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> therein contained; and <hi>particularly,—that in the head of your Army, you have rather chosen Arguments of Reason, than of Force.—That you propose the word of God, for your Rule; and the Settlement of the Nation, for your End.—That you take notice of many Factions, and Interests introduced, and yet professe a service to None of them.—That you so earnestly desire to Compose Old Differences at Home, and to Prevent New Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs from Abroad.—And finally; That you submit the Result of all, to a Fair, and Rational Examination.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To <hi>profess,</hi> and to <hi>persue</hi> all this, is but <hi>like your self;</hi> and <hi>to these purposes,</hi> we shall not stick to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> at your <hi>Feet.</hi> If upon Discussion of the Reasons you alledge, we assume the Liberty which your Candour allows us, of declaring wherein we differ, we beg to be understood with all tenderness toward your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; to whom, as a stranger to our late Oppressions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, the state of our Affairs, and Affections, may probably be misrepresented.</p>
                           <p>To observe your own Method; our Letter to the <hi>Speaker, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the recalling of the Secluded Members</hi> was the <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>Yours</hi> to <hi>Us;</hi> which sayes, that; <q>Before these Wars our Government, was Monarchical, both in Church, and State; but <hi>(as the case now stands)</hi> Monarchy cannot possibly be admitted for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

(as to Civils) by which means, the support it self is taken away; so that the Constitution, qualified to fix all Interests, must be that of a Republique: To which, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Members of 1648. will never agree, many of them being Assertours of Monarchy, and Disclaimers to all Lawes made since their Seclusion: Over and above, that the Army al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so will never endure it. The Conclusion, This; that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to desist from that Paper, and rely upon the Promises of this Parliament, for a due Representative:—a Provision for succeeding Parliaments, and a Peaceable Settlement; than by an unseasonable Impatience to embroil the Nation in a fresh Engagement.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>From hence is appears, that we might be allowed a Free Parliament, but for Four Reasons.</p>

A <hi>Single Person</hi> will down well enough, with the fiercest of them, <hi>when it lies fair for any of Themselves.</hi> Witness the <hi>late Protectour,</hi> and the <hi>Later Lambert.</hi> Briefly, since the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>late King,</hi> we have been <hi>Govern'd</hi> by <hi>Tumult; Bandy'd</hi> from <hi>One Faction</hi> to the <hi>Other: This</hi> Party up <hi>to day, That to Morrow;</hi> but still the <hi>Nation Under,</hi> and a <hi>Prey</hi> to the <hi>Strongest.</hi> It is a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument <hi>against Monarchy,</hi> that we never have been happy since we <hi>lost</hi> it: and yet nothing hath appeared to obstruct our Quiet, but the <hi>Division</hi> of the <hi>Booty.</hi> What <hi>Hath</hi> been, <hi>Shall</hi> be, so long as this <hi>Violence</hi> continues over us: nor can any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>Settle</hi> the Nation, than that which <hi>pleases</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of it. And in that, we pretend not to <hi>direct</hi> our Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives: but which way soever they encline, we shall with our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> Justifie, and <hi>Obey</hi> their <hi>Appointments.</hi>

                           <p>Whether we <hi>have</hi> Reason, or <hi>not, in this Particular,</hi> let your Excellency Judge.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Objection against a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> is drawn from the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a <hi>Republique, to reconcile all Interests.</hi> To This, we offer, <hi>First,</hi> that it is not <hi>Necessary;</hi> next, that it is not so much as <hi>Effectual,</hi> to that purpose; and <hi>Lastly,</hi> that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> ought to <hi>Introduce</hi> it, if it were both the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Other.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>First</hi> we prove thus, <hi>It is not the Form of Government, but the Consent of the People, that must Settle the Nation: The Publike Debt, must be secured out of the Publique Stock: and That disposed of by an Engagement of the Publique Faith, to such Ends, and purposes, as the Representative of the Nation shall deem expedient for the Good of it.</hi> In like manner may all other Interests be secured; whether of <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> under what Form of Government soever a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> shall think fit to unite us. That it is not <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> enough is said. We are now to deduce from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Text, that a <hi>Free-State</hi> would be as little <hi>effectuall</hi> also, as to our concerns. You are pleased to intimate the <hi>Dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the People to Monarchy:</hi> and to Ballance the <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>Universall Vote</hi> of <hi>the Nation,</hi> with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi>

of some <hi>Few</hi> persons, <hi>that would Rule us</hi> Themselves, (for that's the English of the Settlement they propose.) By this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, a <hi>Republique, excludes the Negative,</hi> and more <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Interest,</hi> in <hi>favour</hi> of a <hi>Small,</hi> and a <hi>Partial</hi> one: and if it be granted, that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> will never agree upon a <hi>Free State,</hi> it follows necessarily, that <hi>That Form will never doe</hi> our Businesse. <hi>Lastly,</hi> what Government soever is <hi>forced</hi> upon us, must certainly <hi>expire</hi> with the <hi>Force</hi> that imposes it; and the <hi>Voice of the People</hi> (in this case) <hi>is the Declaratory Voice of Providence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Third Difficulty is. <hi>The Army will never endure it.</hi> This is to say, <hi>You are to be Govern'd by the Sword.</hi>

            <p>A man would have thought, these people should have had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already of the <hi>Oath</hi> of ABJURATION; for nothing did more expose them, than the eagernesse they had formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the promoting of it: which served, only to <hi>Enrage</hi> the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and to set up for a <hi>Marque,</hi> the Infamous Abetters of it. But all this was not sufficient to divert the <hi>Gratious Members</hi> from a most Particular <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Thanks</hi> to the <hi>Petitioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> (the memorable 11th. of Feb.) the <hi>General,</hi> finding himself a little more at <hi>Liberty,</hi> Removed his Quarters into the <hi>City,</hi> and there <hi>Declared</hi> himself, to the Universal Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

            <p>In the transaction of this Affair, there were so many unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumstances, that to Prevent Mistakes, I dispersed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Copies of this ensuing <hi>Narrative.</hi>

with his Orders, he seized divers eminent Citizens, and sent them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and took up his Quarters that Night in the City; By this time, the People, beyond all doubt, pronounced him the most execrable Creature that ever came within their Walls, not understanding that the <hi>Mischief</hi> he <hi>did</hi> them, was but <hi>Iest,</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> he <hi>Intended</hi> them, was <hi>Earnest.</hi> That in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of a <hi>weeks Imprisonment, he would reward them, and their Posterity, with Perpetuall Liberty.</hi> This however carried an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of severity, which was in effect, but a point of Military Honor; For his <hi>Inclination,</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> in this Action, Led him <hi>several waies:</hi> as a <hi>Souldier he obeyed a Barbarous Order;</hi> as an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman</hi> he made it his care, to take off the <hi>edge</hi> on't; and he was bound to doe <hi>That, this day</hi> by <hi>Commission,</hi> Which he resolved to undoe two dayes <hi>after</hi> upon a Nobler Principle; upon <hi>Friday,</hi> (the 10th. of the <hi>Moneth,</hi> and the last of his <hi>Commission,</hi>) the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral demanded the Cities last Resolve, from the Aldermen; who still adhered to their former Judgement. His Excellency, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gave command <hi>to demolish the City Gates,</hi> and so Returned to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> (Observe, that his <hi>Displeasure,</hi> and <hi>Commission</hi> died together,) For the next Morning, (<hi>Saturday,</hi>) he made the Town a large Amends: <hi>Declaring Solemnly to joyn with them, and their Associates for a Free Parliament;</hi> (but having fairly first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himself to those at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by a Letter in commune with his Officers; <hi>who have behaved themselves as men of Honor in the Businesse.</hi> The Truth is, had not the Generall been nimble with them, they had undermined him; for, contrary to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> to their expresse Agreement, they had not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a <hi>secret</hi> combination with the Sectaries, but <hi>publickly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their Assemblings and Petitions;</hi> and more particularly, contrived the direct Ruine of that Person, who had so lately preserved them.

            <p>UPon the neck of this, came out Two sharper Pamphlets; written, (as I am of late Enformed) by a Renegado Parson; but as then, I took them to be either <hi>Nedham's,</hi> or <hi>Miltons,</hi> (a Couple of <hi>Currs</hi> of the same <hi>Pack</hi>) They were <hi>Printed</hi> by <hi>Livewell Chapman,</hi> and a <hi>Proclamation</hi> from the <hi>Counsell</hi> was issued out against him for it, to which he never appeared. I was by many Reasons moved to Answer these; as well to lay them Open, and Confute them, as to prevent the Possible exception that might arise from a Reply by some less wary, though more skilfull pen.</p>
            <p>The malice of these Pamphlets was Double-edged; and the Blow made at the Kings Party over the Presbyterians Shoulder: Directed to perswade the World that 'twas the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> did the <hi>Mischief;</hi> and to engage the <hi>Presbyter</hi> himself under an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Revenge.

                           <p>IT is written, The prudent shall keep silence in an evil time; and 'tis like, we also might hold our peace, but that we fear a knife is at the very throat, not only of our and your Liberties, but of our persons too. In this condition, we hope it will be no offence, if we cry out to you for help, you that (through Gods goodness) have helped us so often, and strenuously maintained the same Cause with us, against the return of that Family which pretends to the Government of these Nations. It is the pulick interest and yours, that we hitherto fought for, and for which we now plead; therefore we insist upon it with the greater confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

you, because we are all equally concerned in the good or ill of your transactions: We cannot yet be perswaded, though our fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies are strong, and the grounds of them many, that you can so lull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep your Consciences, or forget the publick Interest, and your own, as to be returning back with the multitude to Egypt, or that you should with them be hankering after the Lecks and Onions of our old bondage. Though it were possible you should forget, yet certainly God will not, all the injuries and oppressions done by that family to his Church and people in these and other Nations: Though the Inscription <hi>[Exit Tyrannus]</hi> which was fixed over the place where the Statue of the late King formerly stood at the Exchange, hath been blotted out by the Rabble, yet it is written with the Pen of a Diamond in the hearts of many thousands, and will be so hereafter in the adamantine Rolls of Fame and History. No matter then, though the prophane Vulgar take a liberty to proclaim him both Saint and Martyr in the midst of their Bon-fires, and their Tipple. All the good fellows were ever at his Devotion, because he was for theirs, and commanded it to be observed upon the Sundaies. But to the end it may be better known how good a King, and how great a Saint he was, we have taken the boldness at this instant to offer you an accompt of some part of the transactions during his Reign: and because there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the City who wait the good time to re-erect his Statue, we desire in the first place to present you his Picture, as it was drawn by a good hand, the Parliament, in the year 1647. at which time it was resolved upon the Question joyntly by the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. That they would make no further Addresses or Applications to the King, or receive any Message from him.</p>

                           <p>SOme two dayes since, came to my view, a Bold, Sharp Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, call'd PLAIN ENGLISH—directed to the GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL, and his OFFICERS, &amp;c.—</p>
                           <p>It is a Piece drawn by no fool, and it deserves a serious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.—By the Design;—the Subject;—Malice, and the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55786:44"/>
Stile; I should suspect it for a Blot of the same Pen that wrote ICONOCLASTES. It runs foul;—tends to Tumult;—and, not content Barely to Applaud the Murther of the King, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Author of it vomits upon his Ashes; with a Pedantique, and Envenom'd scorn, persuing still his sacred Memory. Betwixt Him, and his Brother <hi>Rabshakeh, I</hi> think a man may venture to divide the glory of it; it relishes the mixture of their united fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and wickedness. As yet, 'tis true; the Hand is somewhat doubtfull to us; but the Drift,—Certain, and 'tis as Clear from whence it first mov'd, as to what end it tends, it speaks the Rancour, and the interest of the Rump; be the contrivance whose it will; and, beyond doubt, it was written by some Mercenary to the Faction; and That, by their direction, and appointment. 'Tis too Malicious, for a private Passion; and too Dangerous, for one that writes not, either for Bread, or Life. Take it in gross; 'tis an Alarm to all the Phanatiques in England; couched under the specious notion of an Appeal to the General, and his Army, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting to all purposes, the interests; and Justifying the horrid Practises of the Regicide-Party.—</p>
                           <p>It Remonstrates;—Expostulates;—Tempts;—Threatens;—Flatters;—Begs;—Prevaricates: and by all Artifices, toward all Humours, it moulds it self into an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation suitable:—only upon the Blood, and Family of the late King; it lashes out into an Impious, and Inhumane fury, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Disgrace, the Sober (in comparison) promoters of his Death; and to Startle their very Consciences, that spilt his Blood with Pleasure.</p>
                           <p>Nor does the Brutish Rebel only quit the Man, in point of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness; his rage against the Royall Line, disturbs his Reason too. (otherwise smooth enough to delude such as are not very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him) Whether it be the Agony, and Horrour of a Wounded Soul, which thus transports him; or that, in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, he only Personates the last Convulsions of a Heart-broken Faction;—It matters not: Thus much we may collect from his

distempers; That Rabble is, at this instant, upon a Combination, to Tumultuate the Army, and the People, and such as will not share the Guilt of their Conspiracy, they labour to engage within the Reach and Danger of it. That we may better understand what they Design, wee'll see a little what they Say.</p>
                           <p>This Phamphlet speaks the sence of the whole Gang; and throughly Examined, will discover the frame, and the extent of of their lewd Purposes.</p>

                              <hi>I</hi> look upon't as an Affront to Christianity, and to Reasonable Nature; so scandalous; <hi>I</hi> vow to God, in Favour meerly of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, <hi>I</hi> would suppresse it, were no more Copies extant of it: but 'tis too late for that. The Countreys are already furnished; and the Town yet full of them; (the singular, and carely care of the Publick Magistrate to hinder it notwithstanding) so that it rests now, only to lay open the vile interests of this bloody Faction, and Antidote the People against the danger of their Pestilent Infusions. Let Time produce the Author; (if it be lawfull to Prophane the Light with such a Monster) The Matter only of this Licentious Paper must be my Subject.</p>
                           <p>IF we must never be quiet, til these People think themselves Safe, we must stay till divine Justice is dissolved;—till they believe the word, and Power of God, a Fable;—till they can Lay that Devil, Conscience;—and Blot out of the Table of their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all their Presumptuous outrages, both against Heaven and Earth;—till they can Quench those raging Horrours that Exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Souls;—Remove those hideous Fantomes, (that whereso|'ere they fly) pursue them, with the images of those that they have murther'd, Bleeding afresh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when they think to Turn away their Looks from the Dire object, to the other side, they meet with a Remembrancer, that mindes them of their Sacrilege, and Treason, and then they start again, another way; and there they meet with a Sword drawn, to revenge their Perjuries. In fine, their Injuries are of a large extent, and such, by consequence, must be

               <hi>The Scotich Ministers</hi> (as he tells us) <hi>proclaimed, and published in</hi> 1644. <hi>That the late King had spilt more blood than was shed in the Ten Persecutions of the Christians,—and the Ministers of London declared him a Man of blood, &amp;c.</hi>—(That is, the <hi>High Priests,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> cryed out, saying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him.) [That's the <hi>Original.</hi>] But to come closer to the Business, the <hi>Scotich,</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ministers, are a clear different thing. <hi>Scotich,</hi> denotes the Antient Faction of the Nation, [No Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of Kings,] and <hi>Scotch,</hi> relates to their Nativity alone, abstracted from the Party.</p>
            <p>First, they were <hi>Arglyes</hi> Creatures, selected to promote <hi>Arglyes</hi> designs: So, not the <hi>Ministry of Scotland,</hi> but a Pack of <hi>Scotish Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, of no more Authority to the Rump, against the King, than to the Nation, against the Rump, [in which they are as much unsatisfied.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55786:48"/>The Ministers of <hi>London,</hi> did as much, he sayes. That's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truly; till we consider what those Ministers were, and by whom, placed, and moulded, for that purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mrashall</hi> was the prime person in the Agency betwixt the two Nations;—He, that cursed <hi>MEROZ;</hi> He, that was sent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner into <hi>Scotland;</hi> taught them their Lesson there, and then returning, taught some of our reputative Divines to fing the same Tune, Here.—This is the Man, that clos'd with <hi>Nye,</hi> when Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry went down; and carried the 4. Bills to the King, at <hi>Carisbrock-Castle,</hi> for which, they had <hi>500l.</hi> apiece. I could tell you of some more of the Gang, that, under question for confederacy with <hi>Love,</hi> after a due formality of seeking God, delivered, as upon accompt of Inspiration, that Oliver Protectour was the person; and his the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of all that ever were, or should be, the most agreeable to God.</p>
            <p>This is not, to lessen the esteem of Holy Orders; neither to fix a rash, irreverend Censure upon the Ministry: No Man reveres the Character of a Church-man more than my self. But 'tis to shew the World, how much our <hi>Pamphlet-Merchand</hi> is steer'd, by Interest, and Passion, and how little, by Reason, and Truth.</p>
            <p>The grinning Whelp, now, betwixt snarling, and fawning, would fain perswade the General, and his Officers, and all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side] that the Resolve of Non-Addresses, by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was introductive to the <hi>MURTHER</hi> of the King. <hi>Murther,</hi> I say, that's the Plain English of what he stiles—<hi>A MOST NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE ACT OF IUSTICE;</hi> His Method lyes through direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to the Universal Rules, of Logique, Truthand Honesty.</p>
            <p>By this Insinuation, he charges that Exorbitance upon the two Houses, and drawes an inference, from the Impardonable Quality of that Action, to the Necessity and Reason of pursuing it. This, he pretends to make appear, in <hi>spight of Ignorance, and Envy, from the Commons Declaration, in persuance of the resolve of Both Houses, conteyning the Reasons, why no further Address;</hi> and thence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to a Determination upon the Fathers Life, and the Son's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55786:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
—as positively fixing upon the Kings Accompt, those Plagues this Nation has endured; as if the Graceless Villain were of Counsell with the Eternal Wisedom.</p>
            <p>I shall observe in order, and First, I'll prove that the vote of Non-Address, was not properly an Act of the two Houses; or if it were so, that it did not rationally direct to the Kings Life.</p>
            <p>Secondly. That Declaration of the Commons, (SINGLY) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Reasons of the resolve of Both Houses (Joyntly) does not amount eitheir to a justification, or intention of taking the Kings life,—No not though I should grant the Members Free,—which <hi>I</hi> cannot; and the Authority Full: which I do not.—To the First.—</p>
            <p>They were under a Force.—Upon a Debate in the Commons House, concerning the Answer to the 4. Bills, presented to him <hi>Dec.</hi> 24. 1647. and debated, <hi>Ian.</hi> 3. Commissary <hi>Ireton</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King hath denied safety, and protection to his People by denying the</hi> 4. <hi>Bills, that subjection to him, was but in lieu of his protection to his People; this being denyed, they might well deny any more subjection to him, and settle the Kingdom without him: That it was now expected, after so long patience, they should shew their Resolution, and not desert those valiant men who had engaged for them, beyond all possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and would never forsake the Parliament, unless the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forfook them first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence naturally results the menace of the Army, in case the Parliament should forsake them; and <hi>Ireton</hi> understood the Souldjery too well to mistake them.—</p>
            <p>As yet; here's nothing Capital pretended against the King.</p>
            <p>After some more debate <hi>CROMWELL</hi> urged,—<hi>that it was now expected, the Parliament should govern and defend the Kingdom, by their Own Power and Resolutions; and not teach the People any longer, to expect safety and Government from an Obstinate man, whose heart God had hardened: That those men, who had defended the Parliament, from so many dangers, with the expence of their Blood; would defend
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55786:49"/>
them herein with Fidelity, and Courage, against all Opposition. Teach them not by neglecting your Own, and the Kingdomes safety, in which their own is involved, to think themselves betrayed, and left hereafter to the Rage, and malice of an irreconcilable enemy, whom they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued for your sake; and therefore are likely to finde his future Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them insupportable; and fuller of Revenge then Iustice: Nota—lest Despayr Teach them to seek their safety by some other means than adhearing to you,</hi>—who will not stick to your selves; <hi>how destructive such a Resolution in them will be to you all, I tremble to think and leave you to Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Speech, concluded the debate; and the better to Impress his meaning, he laid his hand upon his sword, at the end of it. If this be not a Force, what is? The Power and Inclination of the Army, being the only moving Arguments to obtain the Vote. The Question was then put, and Carried for no more Addresses.—But no pretence still that extends to Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> shall appeal now to the Declaration it self; to which our Regicidall Babler refers the world for satisfaction.</p>
            <p>First, the Sectarians had stoln a Vote, <hi>Ian.</hi> 4. to Engarrison Whitehall, and the Mews: (the Lords not mentioned in the case) their manner of obtaining it, was this. 'Twas Noon, and the Independent party called to Rise. The Presbyterians went their wayes to Dinner: the Independents staid and did their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
            <p>The Lords opposed the vote for Non-Addresse; (10. to 10.) but the Engagement of the Army, cast it, who sent a Declarara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Commons of thanks for their 4. Votes against the King, engaging to defend them with their Lives, &amp;c.—Is this a Force yet?</p>
            <p>Soon after this; comes forth a Declaration, and Reasons, &amp;c. Drawn by a Committee apppointed, by the Independents, &amp;c. So that even That too, was a piece, Contrived by the Designers of our Mischief, and by a Force, Extorted from the Sober rest, that would have saved us. This appears, from the interpose of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55786:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Presbyterians, to moderate the Eagerness of it, upon the debate. The last 4. lines of the said Declaration will be sufficient to stop the mouth of any Reasonable person, as to the point of life; (even without the Violence; which undenyably produced the rest.) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Enumeration of diverse particulars objected against the King, The Declaration concludes thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These are some few, of the many Reasons why we cannot repose any more Trust in him, and have made those former Resolutions;</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 4. Votes concerning Non-Addresses) <hi>yet we shall use our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Endeavours, to settle the present Government, as may best stand with the Peace, and Happiness of this Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very Declaration touches not his life; it is not said, settle A present Govenment, but THE—; (relating properly to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, not an Abolition)</p>
            <p>Considering the Grammar of it; I do not wonder much, at a Complyance; in some Measure, to an indecency, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a greater Ill, that threatned Them, and Us: and That, was their design; for when it came at Last to the Result of Life, and Death, (as then 'twas evident, it amounted to no lesse) those Gentlemen, whom the Author of Plain English would willingly engage, as Complicates,—those Gentlemen, I say, did then oppose themselves, against the Murtherous Faction, and voted for a Treaty, <hi>Dec.</hi> 4. Upon the 6. they were Imprisoned, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by the Army for their pains.—When the more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Party, was removed, the Rest were left at Liberty to consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Kingdoms Ruine, and their own Damnation.</p>
            <p>Come I'll go further with the angry man;—put case, these Gentlemen had gone yet forward; and dipp'd as deep as he could wish they had. Frailty is an inseparable from our nature. 'Tis Humane to Transgresse;—'Tis Christian to forgive, and 'tis our Interest to Repent. He that <hi>Delivers</hi> me by Design, though but from that mis-fortune which he himself engaged me in upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake;—he is so far from any Reason to apprehend my Revenge, he has a Title to my Kindness: but our incorrigible <hi>MONITOR,</hi> sets up his Rest upon a Finall, Reprobated, Impenitence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55786:50"/>I have been Tedious, out of a desire to be Clear: but I shall hasten and contract as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Having already proved the Declaration (of the Reasons why no more Addresses) to have been an evident contrivance of the Independent Faction, in the very frame of it; and publish'd, while the Army stood to dare, and Over-awe the Sober Party, that was likely to oppose it; I do not hold my self concerned, in any further notice of the Particulars therein Conteined; and which our Challenger produces, as an unanswerable eviction, <hi>that the Late King and his Family, deserved Death, and extirpation</hi> (as by and by, he tells you)—Yet something shall be said, even to his Queries, thence extracted, (in due place;) but I must first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail him to the people; and that, by laying open the Dilemna he proceeds upon.—He reasons Thus,</p>
            <p>My businesse (sayes he to himself) must be to hinder an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the King. The Presbyterian party (I'm afraid) enclines to't. If he returne, we're Lost: My own Soul tells me, we have sin'd without Remission, and yet I see no way to hinder it neither. The nation is United against us; the Presbyterian ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrs us, as much as the Royal party does; and the Army it self, begins to declare it self our Enemy. Whats to be done, must be both Quick, and Home. These Six wayes lye before us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the Army must be wrought into a Tumult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Presbyterian must be Right or Wrong, involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with us in Guilt, and consequently in danger. They must be made to share in the Blood of the Father, and in the Detestation of the Son, and be possessed, that there can be no safety to Them, but in a common interest with our selves. To this end, we may forge Letters from <hi>Brussels,</hi> Suborn Witnesses to swear the King a Papist, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Cavalier must be perswaded, that the Presbyter only designes, to set up for himself; and Arguments drawn from by-past, and mistaken Failings upon promise, to beget a Jealousie. The inconsistency of Episcopall, with Presbyterian Principles must be objected, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:55786:50"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All Persons interessed in Estates, got by the War, must be engaged, for fear of losing them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The General himself, must be solicited to take the Government upon him; Promises urged; no matter whether real or false: If this won't do, advise him, as a Friend, to have a care of the City; and bid the City look to him. Perplex them both; We'll confound all the World, rather then perish.</p>
            <p>Lastly, We may publish the Declaration, of the Reasons, for no further Addresses: and try, if that way, we can either make a Party among themselves, or with the People. We may so bring it in, it shall be dangerous to reply upon, for fear of disobliging, and as unsafe to let alone, for fear of seducing. Here's the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma; It will be answered, or it will not; if it be 'twill startle the Presbyterian; if otherwise, 'twill puzzle the People. [I wish our Common Enemy would go this open way to work.]</p>
            <p>Here's the true State and Method of our Adversaries Thoughts, and Actions. Now to his Quaeres, wherein I shall be tender, how I revive Disputes, either unkind, or unseasonable; and yet not wanting to my undertaking, that is, my undertaking to make Evident, that his Foundation is Sandy, and the Entire Structure composed of Rotten Materials.

me, 'tis a Peevish point. Why—the Irish <hi>Rebellion,</hi> began, by the Irish <hi>Rebels:</hi> as the <hi>English</hi> Rebellion, did by the <hi>English</hi> Rebels.

I speak my Soul, I do believe, the Irish Catholiques in that Rebellion which you point at, took flame at the Severity they apprehended, from some extraordinary Declarations against them here, previous to their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>This I must add further, the King, (for'tis at Him, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's malice strikes) at his return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> did earnestly, and particularly recommend the care of <hi>Ireland</hi> to both Houses, in his speech, Dec, 2d. 1641. upon the 14th. he pressed them once again, to the same purpose; Adding, the great Necessity of Dispatch;—the daily Cries, and Importunites of the Irish Protestants, and offering all his Power and Interest toward their Relief, in these very Terms, See the exact Collections, the 1. and 2.

That there was one Mr.</hi> Smalling, <hi>a Committeeman of</hi> Leicester-<hi>shire, who had been a Deputy-examiner in the star-Chamber, and affirmed, that above twenty years since, there being a sute in star-Chamber, between the Earl of</hi> Bristol, <hi>Complainant, and the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; Concerning Physick, presumptuously administred by the said Duke, to King</hi> James; <hi>the said</hi> Smalling <hi>took many Depositions therein, and was further proceeding in the Examinations, untill a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, signed by the King, was brought him, Commanding him to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease, and to send him the Depositions already taken; which</hi> Smalling <hi>did; yet kept notes by him of the principal passages, doubting what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings might be hereafter in a business of such importance.</hi>

                              <hi>AS for our parts, we very well recount the Series of past transactions, and do remember that in</hi> February 1647. <hi>when the two Houses of Parliament passed their Resolves of making no further Address, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to lay him wholly aside, they never were in a greater state of security and freedom, never passed any thing with greater deliberation; and never the least disturbance or alteration arose in either of the Houses against those Resolves, untill some Persons in the Commons House other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise affected, and who by procuring Elections of Persons fit for their turn to serve in Parliament in vacant places, brought in new men of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier stamp (as is known) like themselves; and thereby out-balancing the old Patriots, gained the Major Vote of the House; and so with heat, and by design; obtained a revoking of those resolves which had been passed by both Houses in a time of temper, upon most serious Consideration so that though we shall not take upon us</hi> ex absoluto <hi>to justifie the interposure of the Souldiery afterwards, and their Exclusion of the Adverse Members, (it being a transcendent Act, not to be measured by ordinary Rule, and which nothing can justifie but Supreme necessity) yet This we can truly say in their defence: In Judgment and Conscience there was so indispensable a necessity, that had they not interposed, those Principles and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the Common-wealth, upon which the aforesaid Resolves of both Houses were founded, had been utterly shipwrackt, and the whole Cause and its Defenders most inevitably have sunk together, seeing the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55786:54"/>
same heady confidence in treaty was then given to the Father, which too many now encline to allow unto the Son, who were first engaged against them in the War, and held out to the time of the last treaty: whom (of all other Men) his party do hate upon that accompt; and, if they had an opportunity, would be sure to make them fall the severest Sacrifices to the Revenge and Memory of his Father.</hi>

            <p>THis is already Sifted, and a little Picking will serve the Turn here. A Cavalier, I find, is onely an Honest man that crosses a Fantan; but the <hi>Old Patriots</hi> it seems, were the <hi>Minor part</hi> of the <hi>House;</hi> and That's enough to entitle the Nation to the Benefit of the Treaty resolved upon. For Sir (if you'l give us leave) we'l be governed by the <hi>Major</hi> part. It's true, your <hi>Supreme neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> is a pretty popular Sophism. But,</p>
            <p>As necessity ha's no Law, so is it none; nor in any case pleada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against Law, but by the Judges of the Law, which at all hands, is confessed to be the Parliament, and the Major part of the Two Houses in conjunction with the King have ever denominated That.</p>
            <p>I must needs take a little pains to correct the Gentleman, in his next Fleere upon the Presbyterians. He hangs like a Cock-sparrow upon <hi>the aforesaid Resolves of both Houses</hi> (which is but an old Trick of laying a Knaves Bastard at an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest mans door) and then he preaches most <hi>Infallible Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the <hi>first engagers, whom</hi> the <hi>King will be sure to sacrifice to the Revenge and memory of his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This opinion or rather suggestion of his, opposes all Principles of Honesty, Generosity, and prudence, which fall within the latitude of the case. Nay, Taking for granted, the very entrance upon the War Justifiable.</p>
            <p>There might be then a Question, Now there's none, They intended only a Reformation, here's a Dissolution. A Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was there Designed, here's an Intollerable Slavery Imposed, Those quitted, when they saw their error; These, for that very Reason, proceed.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55786:59"/>
These goodly pieces are Christen'd, PLAIN ENGLISH,—and AN ALARUM. I suppose they are Twins, the Issue of the same Brain, as they are related to the same main End. I had nigh finish'd a Reply upon the former, when the latter came to my hand: comparing which with the other, I finde they correspond so aptly, and so universally, to the same seditious Purpose, that there's not any Interest 'scapes their Malice and Attempt. They advance their Dispute, and March, together; that what they cannot gain by force of Argument, they may be ready to Essay by dint of Sword. PLAIN EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLISH is a reasoning of the case: first with the General, claiming, from his Engaging for the Publick Liberty, a title to his aid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in favor of a private and enslaving Faction. It labours then, to puzzle the Presbyterian into a jealousie of the Kings faith and honour, and consequently into a doubt of his own safety, should His Majesty be restored: Nay, not content to blaspheme the Kings Integrity by a bold censure of his secret thoughts; the shameless Beast (the Author of it) proceeds to charge the secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with the guilt of the Kings bloud, upon a senceless inference drawn from <hi>the Declaration of both Houses</hi> in 1647, touching the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Votes for non-Address.</hi> His aim is here, to perswade them to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                           <p>How those Votes were obtained, I have shewed at large, (in answer to PLAIN ENGLISH) and it suffices: the whole Nation knows, that though the Plague was in both Houses then, yet All were not infected; the Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers only had the Tokens, (nor all these neither:) so that at last, the seclusion of so many as opposed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital prosecution of the King, amounts to a clear Act of discrimination; a <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>clean</hi> from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55786:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>Having there set the Presbyterians at work, upon the Question of Interest, and safety; and (after many a lame complement to his Excellency) he cuts out worse employment for the Phanatick Souldiery: and at the same time, breathing Hot and Cold—Reason and Mutiny, he solicites the General into a Complyance, and the Army into a Tumult.</p>
                           <p>To disabuse the multitude, (if any should be mad enough to be deluded by so gross a cheat) I'll lay the juggle open, in as few and familiar words as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible.</p>
                           <p>The Title speaks the <hi>business</hi> of the Pamphlet: ('Tis AN ALARUM;) and the Application—(<hi>To the</hi> OFFICERS <hi>and</hi> SOLDIERY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the <hi>malice;</hi> there's Treason in the very Face on't. If the first two words cost not the Nation a hundred thousand lives, 'tis not the Authors fault.</p>
                           <p>His second page places the Legislative power in the Army, challenging their promise; <hi>That before they would SUFFER themselves to be disbanded, or divided, they would see the Government of these Nations establisht upon the just and secure fundamentals, and constitutions of Freedome and Safety to the People, in relation as Men, and Christians, and that in the way of a Common-wealth, or Free-state-Government, without a King, single Person, or House of Lords.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>These Gentlemen, I see, resolve to be their own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>not SUFFER themselves to be disbanded?</hi> This RUMP would be a <hi>perpetuall ARMY,</hi> as well as a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual PARLIAMENT.</hi> Let the Nation observe now the Quality of this suggestion.</p>

                           <p>Thirdly, 'Tis <hi>MURTHER,</hi> Murther intentional, in the bare conception of it; and actual, sure enough, so soon as that intention is but known.

                           <p>Nor <hi>SAFETY,</hi> where in that Disproportion the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is engaged against a Faction: and every Sword that's rais'd against it, carries damnation upon the point on't.</p>
                           <p>Neither do they act as Men. Man is a Reasonable and Sociable Creature. Here's a Design that breaks the Bond of Order: and betrayes a manifest Folly, by a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance so impracticable and mischievous at once; Idly to labour the saving of a few guilty persons, at the price of an universal Desolation.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>Christianity;</hi> either my <hi>Bible</hi>'s false, or their <hi>Opinion,</hi> that shall pretend to raise a <hi>Christian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon a <hi>Basis</hi> of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Bloudshed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From hence the terible Trifle proceeds to the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Design into three Heads.</p>
                           <p>First, what the <hi>CAVALIER saies.</hi> Secondly, what the <hi>PRESBYTERIAN thinkes.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>what the Armies best Friends (scornfully called COMMON-WEALTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN and PHANATICKS) do foresee, concerning the present transactions in the three Nations.</hi> And lastly, <hi>his own Observations, and seasonable Advice.</hi>

                           <p>
                              <hi>First, That upon the 11th. of February last, he sent an imposing Letter to the Parliament, (in scorn called the</hi> RUMP) <hi>and thereupon, without any Order from them, marched with</hi> their <hi>Army into</hi> LONDON, <hi>then esteemed and made by</hi> Him (<hi>in destroying their Gates, &amp;c.) their implacable enemies; and at night suffered so many Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, and ringing of Bels, and publickly drinking healths to the</hi> KING, <hi>and a</hi> FREE-PARLIAMENT; <hi>Roasting and burning of Rumps; hearing and seeing his</hi> MASTERS <hi>in open Street declared</hi> MURTHERERS <hi>and</hi> TRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORS, <hi>&amp;c.—Feasted and associated with the Kings Friends, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is a grievous charge, assuredly; and by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense of our <hi>Observator,</hi> This I Reply.</p>
                           <p>The General's Commission expired upon the Tenth of <hi>February,</hi> so he was free the Eleventh. Again, it was the design of the <hi>Rump</hi> to make the General odious, and therefore they imposed on him such barbarous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as probably might leave him to retreat. While he professed to Act by any Derivation from Them: malice it self cannot but say His Excellency stood firm to every point of Military obedience: at last, when they proceeded so severely against the City, he interposed; but his Mediation was rejected, and more imperious commands sent to him: this is enough to prove, 'twas not the General that made <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Rumps</hi> implacable Enemies; but 'twas the sordid Insolences of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that made the Conventicle hateful to the whole Kingdome; and this appeared by the Universal Joy that followed upon their disappointment. If the <hi>Rump</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> did by a Sympathy fellow-feel the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55786:61"/>
Rumps in the City, the Case indeed was hard; but for the rest, the Murtherers and Rebels they were call'd,—methinks it should not trouble folks to be call'd by their Names; (that's only Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and I dare say, the people spake as they thought) Are these Gentlemens <hi>Ears</hi> so <hi>tender,</hi> and their <hi>Hearts</hi> so <hi>hard?</hi> Is the Sound of Treason and Murther so dreadful, and the Exercise of it so Trivial?—I must confesse, to stay away Ten dayes together, (from the 11th. of <hi>Feb.</hi> til the 21th. as that his <hi>Masters</hi> charge him with) was something a long <hi>Errand.</hi> But seriously Gentlemen, considering 'twas his first fault, forgive him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The second motive to the Cavaliers Discourse (that his Excellency will restore the King;) is, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his engagement by Letter, and Verbal promise to His MASTERS (that had ventured their All, to secure him from being ruin'd by</hi> Lamberts <hi>Army, he yet admits the Secluded Members to sit, (most of whom he absolutely knew to be for the Restauration of</hi> CHARLES STU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ART,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this; it is notorious, that Designes were laid to murther the General; That the <hi>Rump</hi> Received, and Kept in Members impeached: That they promoted, and gave Thanks for <hi>BAREBONES Petition,</hi> containing matters of direct contradiction to their Professions. In the next place; instead of the Rumpers saving the General from being ruin'd by <hi>Lambert,</hi> the General saved them; and touching their Opinions concerning (<hi>CHARLES STUART,</hi> as this Villain prates) the King. The Noble General regarded their Trust, not their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, nor did he enquire what they were.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (say they) <hi>the General will bring the King in; for he hath</hi> suffered <hi>the secluded Members to release

Sir</hi> GEORGE BOOTH, <hi>and his Party, &amp;c.—Again, they have</hi> (de novo) <hi>voted the</hi> COVENANT <hi>to be Printed, Read, and set up, &amp;c.—acknowledging the late King's Posterity:—as likewise suffering to be maintained in the House, that none but Iesuites and Priests are for Free-Sate Government.—Observe yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (sayes the</hi> CAVALIER) <hi>that he imprisons Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth-men, and releases Royalists, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>These Rumpers have gotten such a trick of breaking Parliaments, that 'tis their publick Profession now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to enforce them to the bent of the ARMY.

The General SUFFERED the secluded Members to Release Sir <hi>GEORGE BOOTH.</hi>—The next point is yet more remarkable: These very COVENANTERS ABJURE the COVENANT.—As for the SUFFERING (there 'tis again) <hi>to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that only Iesuites, &amp;c.</hi>—the General is not properly to take cognisance of what passes in the House; (the King was chidden for't, see <hi>Exact Collections,</hi> the Petition of both Houses <hi>Decemb.</hi> 14. 1641.)—now for imprisoning and releasing. If it so happen that some Commonwealth-men deserve to be laid up, and some Royalists to be enlarged (not as such) it is but justice to do the one, and the other; for at the rate of this subtile Argument, Free-state-men shall be Protected against the Law, and Royalists so Persecuted like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>

                              <hi>Lastly, the Cavaliers conclude as much from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals countenancing the Militia; being raised and formed to murther, and destroy the Army—and that the same thing was done long since in</hi> Scotland:—<hi>besides, the Irish Army have proceeded answerable to himself.—And divers Officers that served the late King have had fair promises from him,—and several of the Kings friends

are peaceably returned from exile, &amp;c.—and again, there's a</hi> Proviso <hi>in the</hi> ACT <hi>of</hi> DISSOLUTION, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the</hi> LORDS <hi>being a part of the</hi> PARLIAMENT, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To be short,—<hi>the General encourages the Militia</hi> to <hi>Save the Countreys,</hi> not to <hi>Ruine the Army,</hi>—next, if <hi>long since done in Scotland,</hi> the <hi>better</hi> done, the <hi>sooner;</hi> for <hi>England</hi> hath been only Rump-ridden, for want of it. To this, the <hi>conform motion</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> proceeds from their Commune Concerne with <hi>England</hi> in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering themselves from the Tyranny of the <hi>Rump;</hi> for the <hi>Generals promises;</hi> I am glad to hear it, but truly I know nothing of it. In truth, 'tis a sad business, <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bunce his return:</hi> and the <hi>Proviso in the Act of dissolution, (for certainly, by the known Law, the Lords are no part of the Parliament.</hi>) To speak my thoughts freely; I am very glad to hear that the Cavaliers are of Opinion that the King will come in, but I believe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more for your saying it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Now to the</hi> SOBER PRESBYTERIANS: <hi>they</hi> (sayes our Phanatick) <hi>begin to suspect the General: for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers are at this instant arming themselves in all the three Nations, and if</hi> CHARLES STUART <hi>comes, he'll bring with him Arch-Bishops, Bishops, &amp;c.—and then in comes his Mother—with her Iesuites, Priests, &amp;c.—and this will make little difference betwixt us and the Sectaries.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now do I dote upon the sincerity of this Bubble; had he pretended to Religion himself, h'ad been ridiculous; but putting that scruple upon the Sober Presbyterian, 'tis well enough. The story of the <hi>Cavaliers Arming themselves,</hi> is a Phanatick, not a Presbyterian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt. As to the Queens bringing in Jesuites, &amp;c. It needs not, the Independents have enow for her Majesty and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55786:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themselves too. (How the changeable Butterfly flutters from Party to Party, and whereever he seizes, he stains.) As to his concluding Opinion, that the King will put no difference, he may live yet to change that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                           <p>He comes next to the <hi>Armies</hi> BEST FRIENDS, (as he terms them) and they preach nothing but Fire and Sword, if ever the King come. Oh this pestilent <hi>MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIA!</hi> Alas poor Wretch! Away with your Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Lies: The Secluded Members threaten the Army, Yes, 'tis a likely matter. Come Gentlemen, you are safe, if you continue honest, and lost without it. Do not you know, that these very persons that now Flatter you, are the people that have taken your meat out of your mouths; that have received sufficient for six Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from the Nation, and yet have left you monilesse, and ready to perish for want of Bread? Nay, suppose their Arguments were more rational than they are, and that the King were a Person as famous for Cruelty, as he is for Clemency, you were still safe. You are below the stroke of Revenge. They are fearfull for their own Heads, and pretend to concern themselves for you. They talk of Treachery, in case you should recede from their Designs: They tell you of Engagements, Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and so do I. Remember but your Oathes and Covenants; and if you do, you will not mix with them; they promise you the glory of after-Ages: yes, you shall be Renown<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

LEYDEN, KNIPPERDOLLING, CADE, TYLER, RAVILLAC, BALTAZAR GERARD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Desire your brainsick Illuminates to tel you <hi>Muncer's</hi> Story, go to, beware of separating. Remember them that cried, <hi>You take too much upon you ye Sons of Levi, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is holy every one of them, and the Lord is among them.</hi> To come a little nearer home. Reflect upon the deceas'd Patrons of their Frantick Zeal; their very flesh is not more putrid than their memories. Come nearer yet, and look impartially among your living Partizans, (I speak of such as our Pamphleter stiles <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots</hi>) do not you finde them cloth'd with the Spoils of Widdows, and of Orphans? Nay, look into their Morals, even toward those, that with the loss of Bloud and Peace, have rais'd them: how Thanklesse and how Avaricious are they? Examine now their Principles of Courage, and their Military Vertues: do they not sneak into Committees, and there dispose of all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of your Unchristian Hazzards? <hi>YOU kill the</hi> HEIR, but <hi>THEY divide the</hi> INHERITANCE.</p>
                           <p>Having abundantly perplex'd the mindes of his weak Brethren, he's as intent, now, how to entangle the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi> of the Nation. The man is willing to do any thing that may help on the work of undoing All; and here he's ballancing Accompts:—casting up how many millions will pay the Court-debts, and repair the Losses of His Majesties Friends. For that I think the next Parliament may as well compose the Difference, as either he or I: this only I may say, 'tis not the care of the Publick which imploys him so much. <hi>His sins are greater than he can bear.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>All this is nothing, compar'd with what he has yet to tel you. Observe him well, and ask him, how he looks when he lies? <hi>Upon his knowledge, the Militiaes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

                           <p>The Story of your <hi>Governor</hi> is every bodies tale. I'll only take the Applicable part; <hi>We love the</hi> TREASON, <hi>but we hate the</hi> TRAYTOR.

Gentlemen, here's the difference of the Case; the Nation then was with the revolted Party against the Great ones: Now, they're Unanimously against you, in any such Design. Your General is a Gentleman and a Soldier; and every Man that is either, (in the Kingdom) will die at's Feet: His Officers are Persons that understand Honour, and the Discipline of War. There's not a man among them, but when he comes to passe a Sober Thought upon so base an action as a Mutiny, would rather Perish than promote it.</p>

THe <hi>Militia</hi> of the Nation, being at present in good forwardnesse toward a settlement, was yet quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Lambert's</hi> escape out of the Tower, which was understood to signifie more than his particular Freedom and Safety, by reason that he had already refused Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon engagement to be quiet.
