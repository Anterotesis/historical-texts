            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving seen some Depositions of Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> taken in <hi>Chancery,</hi> in a Cause there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, between Sir <hi>Francis Holles</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> concerning a Portion due (but denied to be paid) by the said Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to the said Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Sister; in which the said Justice is pleased to say things very much reflecting, both upon Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and upon me his Father; where there are great mistakes, and much said by him as upon hear-say; which though insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant as to be matter of Proof and Evidence, yet serving much to make a noise, and possess standers-by, who shall hear his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions read, with a prejudice and ill opinion of us, as if we were really guilty of those foul Things which are there said of us; I shall therefore do that right to my Self, my Son, and to Truth, as to make some Observations upon those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, to discover the very great improbability (to say no more) of what is there delivered: My method shall be, first to set down the Interrogatory, and his Deposition <hi>verbatim;</hi> then to shew briefly, where in it he hath varied from Truth by his own mistake, and where upon hear-say from another Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40669:3"/>
The Interrogatory is thus: <hi>Do you believe, or have you heard that the said Sir</hi> Francis Holles <hi>had preconveyed those Lands so to be setled for an additional Iointure as aforesaid to other Persons, to other uses, so to frustrate the said Settlement? Or what discourse have you at any time had with Sir</hi> Francis Holles <hi>about the Premises? and whether did not the said Sir</hi> Francis Holles <hi>confess to you, that he had so preconveyed the said Lands, that were so to be setled for an Additional Iointure as aforesaid? Declare,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Deposition follows: <hi>To the 5th Interrogatory this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent saith, That after the said Deed was so executed by the said Complainant, the said Lady</hi> Carr <hi>came to him this Deponent, and acquainted him that the said Complainant had made some Settlement and Conveyances of his Estate, he had so made to his Wife for an Additional Iointure, after his said Marriage, and before the Sealing of the said Deed for an Additional Iointure, on purpose to avoid the said Iointure, and that the said Iointure was worth nothing; at which he this Deponent was much surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and did take himself concerned in it, for that he this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent had drawn, or caused his Man to draw the said Iointure; and perswaded the said Lady</hi> Carr, <hi>that she should have no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that the Complainant would do any such thing; and that he this Deponent did conceive, that he the said Complainant had a good Estate in himself, when he this Deponent saw the said Deeds: but the said Lady</hi> Carr <hi>did insist upon it, that it was true, that he the Complainant had done such an Act; and that not many days before he sealed the said Iointure, he had conveyed away his Estate to others: Whereupon he this Deponent took an occasion to acquaint the Complainant with what he had heard, who to the best of this Deponents remembrance did acknowledge the same. But this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent well remembreth, that upon that discourse with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant, he this Deponent was well satisfied, that some short time before the said Complainant sealed the said Conveyance of an Additional Iointure, he had conveyed over his Estate therein to some other Person or Persons, whereat this Deponent was much troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40669:3"/>
This concerns only my Son, who hath in his Answer upon Oath to Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi>'s Bill in Chancery, said positively he made no such Preconveyances; The words of his Answer are these:</p>
            <p>This Defendant denies that before his Sealing and Executing the Deeds of Lease and Release in his former Answer mentioned, he had made or granted any Estate or Conveyance of or in the Lands or Hereditaments therein mentioned, or any part thereof, to any Person or Persons whatsoever: Nor doth this Defendant remember or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ever declared or confessed, he made or granted any Estate or Conveyance thereof precedent to the said Deeds of Lease and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease; nor had he any reason so to do, for that this Defendant at the time of his Sealing the said Deeds of Lease and Release, was seized of such Estate in the said Premises, as that he had (as he conceived and was advised by Counsel) good right and power to convey the same, as by the Deeds of Lease and Release was menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and intended.</p>
            <p>Now, if there never was any such thing done by him, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he could not acknowledge that he had done such a thing as is set forth in the Deposition: It is true, Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> something qualifies his Assertion by putting in these words, <hi>That to the best of his remembrance he did acknowledge it.</hi> But he must give me leave to remember him, that a Man of his gravity, who hath the honour to be one of the twelve Judges of <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> (whose words even doubtfully spoken are of great weight, and do sway much to lead other Mens Opinions and Judgments to a concurrence with his, even with what he enclines to believe) should not utter any thing tending so much to the disparagement of another, give such a wound to the Honour and Reputation of a Gentleman, as this Accusation (if true) would do to my Son, but upon a very great certitude: For, I say, if this were true, that my Son had done such an Act, so unworthy of himself, so unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an honest Man, much less a Gentleman, I would never own him more for my Son, but should think him fitter for a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40669:4"/>
Goal or a Bridewell, and there to end his days, than to come into any honest Company; and truly I look upon it as such an injury done him, as that it passeth almost all Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> goes something further, and saith, <hi>He well remembers that,</hi> which is, <hi>That upon that Discourse he was well satisfied there were such Preconveyances, and that he was much troubled at it.</hi> And saying what he said before, I do not much wonder that he saith this; For I see he is resolved to lead others into a belief that there were such Preconveyances, whether there were any or no; and I am most confident, so as I durst almost swear it, as much as I would swear, for any thing that I do not of my own knowledge certainly know, that there never were any such Preconveyances, nor never any such discourse, or ground for such a discourse. For, first, my Son hath denyed it upon his Oath, and I never observed but that he was one who made a Conscience of his Ways, and Conscience of an Oath. But admit him to be a Knave, and that it had been true, that he had done such an unworthy frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Act, in all reason he would not have been so weak, as to have acknowledged it in his Discourse to one, who he knew came to pump it out of him, or have given him any ground to be satisfied that it was so, and that he had so played the Knave: Such Works of Darkness use not to be owned and avowed, since it is the secrecy of them that they owe their Being unto, and which renders them advantageous to their Contrivers. Therefore it is not probable my Son would make such a Confession to him: And if Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> did but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it from Circumstances, and by Inferences upon what was said, he should have done well to have declared those Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and have expressed in his Deposition the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that Discourse, upon which he grounded his being so satisfied; which certainly he could not but have remembred, (if there had been any) as well as that he was so satisfied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And me-thinks he should have asked the Lady <hi>Carr,</hi> what ground she had to say so, before he had gone any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, especially so far as to speak with my Son about it, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40669:4"/>
he could not but think would be to him a very disobliging discourse taxing him with, and questioning him about such a piece of knavery; of which yet nothing appeared, and of which there was no sign, no <hi>Vestigium,</hi> but in the Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s Fancy; and (it seems) a desire in Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> to have it so believed by others, whether true or not true.</p>
            <p>But I may ask, Did Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> do the part of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend to the Lady <hi>Carr,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> for whom he saith he was entrusted, as their Learned Counsel, to draw their Writings, and take care that good Assurances should be made, and all things well settled? That he should know, or but believe, or fear, there was such double-dealing used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Clients and Friends, such a Fraud and Cheat put upon them, instead of an Additional Jointure to a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Family, and he be silent so long, and say nothing of it, whereby it might be put into some way, to discover all that foul play, and prevent the mischief and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which must of necessity have come of it; For that Wife of my Son's, whose Portion they would now not pay, lived with him several Years, and a Daughter he had by her lived about a twelve month after the Mother; and all that time Mr. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Ellis</hi> said not one word of this, nor I know not of how long after, not until his examination in this Cause in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery:</hi> And to say the Truth, I have reason to believe, that both his Satisfaction and his Trouble (which he speaks of) began but when Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> took up the Resolution to keep back his Sisters Portion; and that he had no thought before, that ever there had been such discourse between my Son and him, or any thing like it, to cause either his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or his Trouble. And so I come to his next Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>The Interrogatories were the 5th, 6th, and 7th: The 5th; <hi>Did you at the instance of Dame</hi> Mary Carr <hi>prepare a Draught in pursitance of the said Settlement, to tender to the Lord</hi> Holles, <hi>and the Plantiff Sir</hi> Francis, <hi>and what was done therein, and whether was the same accepted or no? Declare,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40669:5"/>
6th, <hi>Do you know that the Lord</hi> Holles <hi>did refuse to appoint his own Counsel, to draw a Book in pursuance of the said Articles of Agreement; and was there ever any Settlement made according to the said Articles? Declare,</hi> &amp;c. 7th; <hi>Do you know, or have you heard that the said Lord</hi> Holles <hi>did ever deliver a Copy or Draught of such Settlement to the said Dame</hi> Mary Carr, <hi>or to her Counsel for that purpose appointed? Declare,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His Deposition to those Interrogatorics more immediately concerns me, it runs thus:</p>
            <p>To the 5th, 6th, and 7th Interrogatories, This Deponent saith that he doth well remember, That the said Lady <hi>Carr</hi> was often with him this Deponent, to prepare a Conveyance for to make a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, according to the said Articles of Agreement upon the said Marriage; and did very much complain she could not get the said Lord <hi>Holles</hi> to do it; and did often importune him this Deponent to draw a Book to that purpose: Whereupon this Deponent told her, That he could not well draw a Book without sight of the said Lord <hi>Holles</hi> his Writings, which she could not procure. But this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent remembreth, at the said Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s importunity, he this Deponent did draw, or cause to be drawn, a rough draught of a Paper Book with Blanks, to the Effect of the said Articles, the said Lady <hi>Carr</hi> often telling him this Deponent, that she had the Money for the Portion ready if she could but have the Assurances performed. And this Deponent had often discourse with Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Constantine,</hi> the said Lord <hi>Holles</hi> his Counsel, who did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against something in the said Articles, and said they were not reasonable; whereupon this Deponent told him, that they were drawn by the said Lord <hi>Holles</hi> himself with his own hand, and that they were not to make Articles, but to draw Assurances, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles already made, and desired him the said Sir <hi>William,</hi> That if he did not like the said Draught, which he this Deponent had drawn, that he the said Sir <hi>William</hi> would draw a Book himself; and if there were any thing in the said Articles unreasonable, (so as the Substance and Effect of them might be performed) he this Deponent would perswade the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> to agree to them. But this Deponent did not perceive that the said
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40669:5"/>
               <hi>Sir</hi> William Constantine <hi>was willing to do it. And this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent saith that afterwards the said Lord</hi> Holles <hi>was with him this Deponent, and did complain of the said Articles, and said it was never his intention such Settlement should be made; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this Deponent told his Lordship, That he this Deponent could not, nor had any power to make any new Articles; but if any thing were unreasonable or hard upon him in them, he this Deponent would do his endeavour to perswade the Lady</hi> Carr <hi>to have them rectified; but this Deponent doth not know that ever any Conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were made and executed according to the said Articles, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, or any tendred by the Lord</hi> Holles <hi>or his Counsel, although the said Lady</hi> Carr <hi>did often desire, and was very importunate to have had the same done and perfected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Matter of this is far from Truth; yet it may be true, that the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> told him so; But that good Lady would sometimes mistake, and I am sure she did so now, if she said any such thing to Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis,</hi> as he saith she did: For upon the Faith of a Christian it is not true, that she did press me to perfect those Assurances, and as little true that I ever refused it, or was backward to do my part in it. So far from it, that it was still desired and pressed on by me; and it stuck at her, and those of her side, who would never perform what was in the first place their part to do, which was to secure the Portion. For which purpose, she was tied by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to get a Fine levied of her Husband and Son, of certain Lands there specified, in the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Marriage of her Daughter, which was about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>August</hi> 1661. This was not done. And my Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for setling the Jointure, was to do it some three months after that Fine levied: for this I was to do but in six months after the Marriage, which time did not expire till about the end of <hi>February.</hi> So then the Portion not seemed, as I was not at all bound, so it had been a very imprudent thing in me to have setled Land for a Jointure <hi>gratis,</hi> without any hopes of ever seeing a Portion, which by their dealing I had cause to apprehend might be their intention, or at least to put us to trouble to recover it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40669:6"/>
For though Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> is pleased to say, <hi>That the Lady</hi> Carr <hi>told him the Portion was ready;</hi> She nor he never told us so: It is what we never heard of, neither my Son nor I, and I am confident no Man nor Woman did ever hear so, but the Justice himself; And sure we were most concerned to have had the notice given to us: Nay, the Justice, who by his own saying was intrusted with the care of procuring those Settlements to be made, and seeing all things performed, that were requisite thereunto, was bound in Duty and Conscience to have signified so much to us, as that which would have removed the sole Obstacle, and brought the Business to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conclusion; or at least it would have justified to all the World the sincerity of their Proceedings, and laid open past all denial the tergiversation and insincerity which they met with from us.</p>
            <p>I am sure that with much ado, after long waiting, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sollicitations of mine, being then upon my Journey into <hi>France,</hi> I got a meeting at my House in <hi>Westminster</hi> with the Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s Agents, a Counseller at Law one Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and some others whom she employed; And all the Writings on my part were there ready, and were examined and approved by them, and I began to Seal, and had sealed one or two; and I had acknowledged a Fine of the Land in pursuance of the Articles, and I delivered it to them: And as I was Sealing, I asked what Order they had for the Portion; to which Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> answered, He had none at all; whereupon I replyed, I would then settle no Jointure, till I had satisfaction in that Particular, and accordingly stopped my hand from further Sealing, and there it rested.</p>
            <p>Soon after that I went into <hi>France,</hi> where I continued near three years; whilst I was there, I received a desire from Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> that I would write to some of my Friends in the House of Peers (the Parliament then sitting) for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and assistance to him in passing a Bill to settle his Estate, and enable him to pay some Debts, and particularly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40669:6"/>
and pay his Sisters Portion: Accordingly I did write to several Lords, to the Earl of <hi>Arlington</hi> by name for one, who was then Principal Secretary, is yet alive, and can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness if this be true that I say.</p>
            <p>My last treating about this Business, or rather I may say my last endeavour to have treated, was when I went once to have visited the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> at her House in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-fields,</hi> with an intention to have moved her, that she would at last perfect things relating to it. And I stayed near an hour in a low Parlour, spake to several of the Servants to acquaint her with my being there, but could have no answer; So I came away, and I never went to see her more, nor never had any more to do with her.</p>
            <p>By these Passages it appears no Portion was ready, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lady said to Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis;</hi> And whether she said it or no, I durst almost positively affirm, he could not believe it was so; for he, who knew that Family so well, and the Necessities, Difficulties, and Distractions which it laboured under, by reason of the Distemper of Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the opposition of the Lady to her Husband, and to all that he did, their drawing several ways, sometimes the one prevailing, sometimes the other, one undoing what the other did; he, I say, who knew all this, could not but know that six thousand Pounds, was a Sum not to be there so easily got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together, and that he was not presently to believe it to be so because that Lady said it.</p>
            <p>Indeed I have heard she had a Sute in <hi>Chancery</hi> with her Counsellor Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> about some Money that she had put into his hands; which Money, she in her Answer to my Son's Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> saith was for the payment of this Portion; but how likely this is to be true, that it was for that use, let any Man judge. <hi>Cox,</hi> as I have heare, confessed only two thousand Pounds, and that it was in trust for one Mr. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> a Gentleman whom she then much respected; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this was in 1667, or 1668, several years after all treating
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40669:7"/>
about either Portion or Jointure, or any thing else relating to her Daughters Marriage, was absolutely broken off and laid aside, and her Daughter then dead, of whom, or of any thing concerning her, she then certainly had no thought at all; so as this is but a meer Fancy, that it seems she then pleased her self with, when she was Sued by my Son, of which he nor none of his Friends had ever heard before, whom (as I have already said) she should chiefly have acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>Yet this Deposition of Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> even so framed, but upon a Hear-say, may have its operation, and perhaps much to my disadvantage; for though the Justice speak it but upon the Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s Credit, who should tell him such things, <hi>That I refused to perform Covenants, and that the Portion was ready, but I would do nothing of that I ought to do;</hi> yet this coming from him, and being vented and published by him, a Person of that Weight and Authority, who bears such a Figure as he doth, will make an impression upon some Mens Minds, as if I were in truth such a Man as I am there deciphered to be. Therefore I have cause to complain of his readiness upon so slight a ground to utter things so much to my disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and which he could not but know to be no legal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the behalf of Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> who had produced him for a Witness, and shews more a good will and a desire he had to please him, than that it could be any real service to him, for the carrying on of his Cause.</p>
            <p>He goes on and tells a Story, first of a Discourse between him and Sir <hi>William Constantine,</hi> then of one between him and me; What Sir <hi>William Constantine</hi> said to him I do not know. I do not remember that ever I employed Sir <hi>William Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to treat with him about that Business; nay, if I were to die at this present, I would take it upon my death, that I cannot call to mind, that ever I knew that Serjeant <hi>Ellis</hi> (for so I think he was then) was employed, or made use of, in any part of all that Negotiation between the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> and me; so I may very well say, that I do not believe it to be true,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40669:7"/>
that I ever was with him to <hi>complain of the Articles,</hi> and that I should say <hi>it was never my intention, that such a Settlement should be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I do verily believe he goes upon a mistake, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding another Business with this: For I do acknowledge, I was with him about a Marriage propounded for the Earl of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> which was long after that of my Son's; and I am very confident it was upon that occasion, the first time that ever I was at his Chamber, or ever had to do with him; for I do very well remember, that when I went to speak with him about that Business of the Earl of <hi>Lincolns,</hi> I did not know where his Chamber was till it was shewed me; which could not have been, if ever I had been there before.</p>
            <p>But be it how it will, that he was employed or not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that business, and that I was or was not with him about it, it matters not much; I wish he had dealt more clearly in his Testiony, and not have spoken in the Clouds, laid a general Charge, which makes a sound, as if it signified some great Mattter; <hi>That I should complain of the Articles, and say, I never intended to make a Settlement according to them, though the Articles were of mine own drawing,</hi> as he saith; Which if true, I had been certainly a very unworthy Man, not fit for that common dealing which is between Man and Man, one upon whose Promises, nay Covenants and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements no Man could put trust nor confidence; And for such a Man he endeavours to make me to pass; and therefore tells not, wherein I was unsatisfied, or what the particular was which I complained of.</p>
            <p>For it is true, I did complain of one Particular, (yet I think not to him, for as I say) I do not believe I ever spake with him in all that Business) nor was it of the Articles I complained; But this I complained of, that the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> would have something to be done by me, which was not in the Articles, as I supposed: It was concerning three Leases which I held for Lives, one from the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40669:8"/>
other two from the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury:</hi> I had Articled, that after my Decease my Son should have them, and was willing to yeeld to any thing, whereby they might be secured to my Son, that it should not be in my power to dispose of them from him: But nothing would serve the Lady <hi>Carr,</hi> but that I should presently assign them over to him; which I could not give way to for two respects: One was a little Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for two of these Leases being of two Mannors, I could not afterwards keep Courts, nor grant Estates in my own Name, but must do it in my Sons: The other was a real Inconvenience, that when any of my Lives should die, it would not be in my power to renue my Estate, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him present to join with me, or rather to be himself the taker of it in his own name, who lived not with me, might be an hundred miles off, when an occasion of renewing should present it self, and I by that means might lose the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which would have been a great prejudice unto me, and even to my Son and his Wife. to whom those Leases were to come after me. This I did not conceive at all to be the sense and meaning of the Articles; which on the other side I did conceive would have been fully pursued and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by what I proposed, and what I was willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do: And therefore Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> would not tell the Particular, what it was that I complained of, which would have carried with it its own Justification, but laps it up in general terms, to make me appear a falsifier of my word, and of my Covenants. This I think was not so fair, and seems to me to argue rather a desire in him to do me a mischief, and serve a turn, than to give a full and clear Testimony to the Truth.</p>
            <p>One thing more I must observe, which I cannot let pass without some Remarque upon it, he saith, <hi>The Articles were of mine own drawing,</hi> and makes use of that Circumstance to aggravate my ill dealing, that I should go against my own Act, and have the impudence my self to proclaim it, and say I never intended the Settlement should be made according to the Articles which my self had drawn. Which had been a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40669:8"/>
folly in me even beyond the knavery, for few that play the Knaves will be so very Fools, as to say they intended it.</p>
            <p>But in truth Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> hath ill luck to mistake in all he hath deposed from the beginning to the end; For this is as true of my drawing the Articles, as all the rest which I have before spoken to: It was Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgman</hi> that drew them, or caused them to be drawn: All the hand that I had in them, was to insert the name of Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom they would have left out, saying he was mad, and that the Lady managed all, both the Person and Estate of her Husband being committed to her, and governed by her in the nature of his Guardian, so that it was not at all needful (as they said) to make him a Party; yet I desired he should be made a Party, and therefore put in his Name in several places, where I conceived it necessary.</p>
            <p>And one Passage more I find there written with my own hand; It was to have 4000 pounds of the Portion laid out in Land to be setled upon my Daughter in Law for an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to her Jointure; and further to declare how the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the whole Estate should go in case of no Issue.</p>
            <p>This is all I did as to the drawing of the Articles: but I do not say, nor did I ever think, that I was the less bound by them, because I did not make them my self, for I did agree to them, and was still ready to have performed them, if the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> would have performed her part concerning the Portion, which (as I have said before) was at least to have been secured in the first place.</p>
            <p>However I was resolved still to take care of her Daughter, and do all that I was bound to do, or indeed could do (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound to it or no) for her good, after she was once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into my Family, who I must say did deserve it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a very excellent good Woman; though before she did come into my Family, that is, before I knew her, and was acquainted with her, I was not at all desirous my Son should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40669:9"/>
marry there. It was Sir <hi>Edward Rossiter</hi> that first proposed the Match, who did manage the treaty of it and perfect it; And if my Son would have been ruled by me, and followed my advice, he had not been married before he had received his Portion, and then all the trouble that hath since followed would have been prevented; but this is not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: To return then to Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> his Deposition and so make an end.</p>
            <p>In his conclusion of it, he goes beyond all that he hath said before, he saith, <hi>He did not know that any Conveyances were made by me according to the Articles, although the Lady</hi> Carr <hi>did often desire the same, and was very importunate <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to have it done and perfected.</hi> Here he seems positively to swear, that the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> did often desire it, and was importunate with me to have it done. I would fain hope, that there was some mistake in the Examiner writing down his Deposition, and that he omitted what he had fully expressed in the former part of it, which was, <hi>That the Lady</hi> Carr <hi>had told him so;</hi> and so indeed he may swear truth, though she did not say true; For I am sure the thing is very false, if there be any truth in me: It was I still that desired her and importuned her, and not she me, I was still ready but she would do nothing. And upon the whole Matter I must say, That I am as much wronged by Mr. Justice <hi>Ellis</hi> in his Deposition throughout, as a Man can be; yet as a Christian I will say, God forgive him, and I do; though he hath done me all this wrong; which is a better conclusion of my Remarques, than his of his Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
