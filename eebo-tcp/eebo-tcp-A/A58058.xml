         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Worthily Honoured,
Sir GEORGE WHARTON,
Baronet.</head>
            <p>IT is the unavoidable Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of ſome to be highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by thoſe, to whom
their good Fortune has made
them any thing particularly
known. Not that thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are to be attributed to
ought of more than ordinary
Merit on their ſide, by whom
they were received; but purely
to that Munificence and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency
of Generoſity, which
<pb facs="tcp:62341:3"/>
is ſo predominant in certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that they cannot forbear
endeavouring to render the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of thoſe, whom they once
take notice of, more comfortable
then they found them.</p>
            <p>That theſe have been my very
Circumſtances, I have had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
heretofore to acknowledge
to others; and I am now to
make the ſame Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to your ſelf, from whom,
in my moſt preſſing Exigencies,
I have receiv'd ſuch ſeaſonable
Reliefs, as give me juſt cauſe to
celebrate the Liberalities of ſo
great a Benefactor.</p>
            <p>As to the ſmall Piece which
this humble Addreſs uſhers to
<pb facs="tcp:62341:3"/>
your hands, I find it without any
Author's Name prefix'd thereto.
Of which Concealment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as alſo of his Deſign in the
enſuing <hi>INSTRUCTIONS,</hi>
ſince he has given an Account in
a particular Preface, I thought fit
to give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of that too, that they
who ſhall henceforth concern
themſelves in the publiſhing of
any thing by way of <hi>History,</hi> may
take their Meaſures from this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Treatiſe, and before they go
any further, compute the Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Extent of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>I have onely to add the retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butory
Devotions of ſuch as are
highly ſenſible how highly they
<pb facs="tcp:62341:4"/>
are oblig'd, and to pray for the
Continuation of a Life and
Health, which has been ſo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to ſeveral Perſons, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

            <head>THE
Original Author
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am not ſo well conceited of my ſelf,
or my Work, as to ſet my Name before
it. For, beſides that it is not a
throughly-ſhap'd Project of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how Hiſtory ſhould be written, and
that the very Project it ſelf is the reſult
of ſuch a reading of Hiſtorians, as may be
thought ſuperficial enough, the natural
diſtruſt I have of my ſelf, puts me into a
fear, that either Impatience or Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has wreſted out of my hands what
could not have continued there much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>But not to create a diſguſt in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
for the preſent I here make it, by
undervaluing it ſo far, I ſhall think it no
<pb facs="tcp:62341:5"/>
trouble to acknowledge, That this Work is
a kind of Abridgment of what has been
written upon this ſubject, by the greateſt
men of the firſt and laſt Ages; That it is
an Extract of what paſſed (that was moſt
rational) in the Apprehenſions of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius
Halicarnaſſaeus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in his Anſwer to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> requiring his Sentiment upon
the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorians, and his criticizing
Judgment upon their different Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters;
That it is a Copy of <hi>Lucian's</hi> moſt
judicious Reflections, in that admirable
Treatiſe which he writ, of the manner how
Hiſtory ought to be written; and that in
ſhort, the Sentiments which I advance in
this Diſcourſe, are not ſo much my own, as
thoſe of <hi>Franceſco Patrici,</hi> in his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Girolamo Marucci, Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtino
Maſcardi, Paolo Beni, Luis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brera,</hi>
and the other modern <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and
<hi>Italian</hi> Authors, who have treated of this
matter.</p>
            <p>But as it is poſſible that I may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
their Conceptions, by intermixing
my own therewith, I am to declare, That
I do not think my Reputation concern'd to
<pb facs="tcp:62341:5"/>
perſuade my Readers that it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
They are not <hi>Laws</hi> which I impoſe,
as having not either Authority or Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to do any ſuch thing; but they are
at moſt but ſimple <hi>Advertiſements,</hi> which
every one may take as he pleaſes; ſo far
would I be thought from giving <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to any one, by a title which will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
ſomewhat of Vanity to thoſe who are
Lovers of Modeſty, that I would have the
World aſſur'd of my readineſs to receive
<hi>Directions</hi> from all others. For if I
have not wit enough to be as exact as ſo
important a Deſign requires I ſhould be, I
have judgment enough to be timorous and
diſtrustful of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I am further to avoid the Imputation of
aſſuming to my ſelf the honour of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Modeſty in ſuppreſſing my Name,
to acknowledge that my concealing my ſelf
proceeds ſomewhat from Vanity; for I am
too coy to make a diſcovery of my ſelf, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I do, that in an Age ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and critical as ours is, a man muſt
think it matter of Humiliation to declare
himſelf an Author. Nay the rigour is ſo
<pb facs="tcp:62341:6"/>
great, that there is not any Merit, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e're
ſo well it may be eſtabliſhed, that will
exempt any one from it; and it now ſeems
to be a kind of preſumption, for a man to
commit himſelf openly to the Judgement of
the Publick, which grows daily more and
more delicate and humorous, and that in
a Juncture of time when Cenſure favours
no man.</p>
            <p>It is certain alſo, that there is ſo much
wiſdom, for a man not to pretend to any
great talent of Capacity, and that there
is ſo much judicious caution in being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
that I ſhould in thoſe paſſages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I advance any thing of my own, have
mollified my Expreſſion with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
<hi>(Peradventure)</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>(It ſeems)</hi>
ſo to be the leſs poſitive, and to give my
Sentiment with more reſervedneſs; if
that had been ſuitable to the Simplicity in
which I uſe to expreſs my ſelf. For as
ſoon as a man has acquir'd a mean degree
of Wiſdom, he is very cautious of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
and deciſive, in an Age ſo obſtinate
and opiniatrous as ours is. And therefore
ill luck betide him who decides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62341:6"/>
Be it noted further, that this Diſcourſe
which I make upon Hiſtory, is not at all of
the Character of that of <hi>Lucian,</hi> who
commends thoſe that write well for no other
reaſon, than that he may blame and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thoſe who write ill; and under the
Approbation he gives good Authors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
a ſmart Satyr againſt the bad ones.
That is not my humour, as having no pique
againſt any one. I pretend onely to open
their eyes, who have their Sences atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
to make them comprehend how that
a man ought to tremble, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
himſelf in the writing of Hiſtory,
wherein it is ſo hard a matter to come off
well; and that the particular Judgment
which <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> paſſes
upon <hi>Thucydides,</hi> ſhould ſtartle all wiſe
Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>In fine, to cloſe up all with a word of the
Character of the Work, after I had ſpoken
of the Workman: I declare, that Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
with an exact obſervance of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
is more conſpicuous in theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
than any political Subtilty;
which is the thing that the more inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb facs="tcp:62341:7"/>
ſort of people do moſt look for in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in regard that Politicks is the vaineſt
of all the Sciences; and that ſenceful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
are the moſt univerſal and moſt
ſolid Groundwork of the other. I do not
pretend to offer all that might be ſaid upon
this matter; and poſſibly I may ſome time
or other ſay more of it, if the Publick give
a kind Entertainment to the preſent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

               <p>THere is not any thing more difficult,
than for a man preciſely to Affirm, which
is the beſt way of writing Hiſtory. Every one
ought to follow that which he finds moſt in

conformable to the Guſt and Inclinations of
the People to whom he writes. But is that
enough to pleaſe Poſterity? That is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,

gives its approbation onely to true Merit.
Let us therefore endeavour to find out the
ways, whereby we may deſerve its Suffrage.
When a men writes nobly, with a conſtant
Current of ſound Sence, Purity, and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

Language ſoever he writes in. Theſe are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal

               <p>A Man muſt therefore beſet himſelf to

he ſpeaks to Kings, Princes, and the
Grandees of all Countries and all Ages, and
is become in ſome manner the Maſter and
Inſtructor of all Mankind. There is not any
thing therefore more eſſential to Hiſtory,
than for a man to give his Diſcourſe a noble
and lofty ſtrain, to ſpeak as he ought to do.
So that the Hiſtorian quits the mean and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Language, that by the Excellency of
Expreſſion he may anſwer the Excellency of
the things which he has to ſay. He accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
himſelf to make noble Reflections on
whatever comes into his mind, that by the
choice of Words he may make it his deſign to
give weight to his Thoughts, and vigour to his
Diſcourſe, by a careful queſt after whatever
may heighten and ennoble it, in order to the
beſtowing a Character of Grandeur on all he
ſays. The Models in this kind of writing
are <hi>Thucydides</hi> amongſt the Greeks, and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
amongſt the Latines. They are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Authors, who have been able to keep up
that lofty Style, with the ſame ſpirit and the
ſame tone, without falling into the mean and
vulgar way of Expreſſion; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they have had but few Imitators. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi>
out of an humour to keep too cloſe
to <hi>Homer,</hi> would needs ſometimes dwindle
in thoſe paſſages which required Elevation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

times is great onely upon the ſcore of his
being conciſe, is not a very good Model to be
propos'd to any; for the Grandeur of his
Style has not any thing that's natural. And
in the general it is requiſite, that we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between the counterfeit Grandeur and
the real. It is not in the affectation of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch'd
Terms, nor in lofty Expreſſions; 'tis
not in an overflux of big words, nor yet in
the ſumptuouſneſs of diſcourſe, that we are
to make that Excellency of Style to conſiſt,
which Hiſtory requires: wherein <hi>Ammianus
Marcellinus, Lampridius,</hi> and moſt of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
of the lower Claſs, were deceived.
It conſiſts in a lofty Expreſſion,<note place="margin">Magna, non nimia; ſublimis, non abrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta; fortis, non temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, non tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, non tarda; lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in a Diſcourſe capable of keeping up the

It conſiſts, in fine, in that temperament of
Grandeur, which <hi>Quintilian</hi> gives true Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
It is not ſufficient for a man to be
ingenious, but he muſt have a particular Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,

                  </gap>ain Elevation to what he ſays, by the
Choice of the Terms, and by the Grandeur
of the Sentiments. That Talent is ſo rare,
that if we daſh out of the number of Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
thoſe who have not written thus, the Liſt
of the true ones will be very ſmall.</p>

               <p>TO write with that Contexture of ſound
Sence, is to go directly to the main end,
in what matter ſoever a man writes, without
wandering or amuſing himſelf by the way.
It conſiſts further in an Expoſal of things with
a kind of Prudence and Reſervedneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abandoning himſelf either to the heat of
his Imagination, or the vivacity of his Wit.
It conſiſts in the ſuppreſſing of what may be
ſuperfluous in the Expreſſion, ſuch as are
thoſe Adverbs and Epithetes, which extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
things in aggravating them; in not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any thing that is inſignificant, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or fruitleſs; in a generous Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what ought not to be ſaid, how plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſoever it may be; in attributing always
leſs to what is ſplendid than to what is ſolid;
in not diſcovering any thing of fire or heat,
where he needs expreſs onely what is to be
done ſeriouſly and in cold bloud; in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all his Conceptions, and meaſuring all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62341:12"/>
his Words with that <hi>aequilibrium</hi> of Sence,<note place="margin">Delectus verborum habendus, &amp; pondera ſingulorum examinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. <hi>Fab. l. 10. c.</hi> 3.</note> and
that exquiſiteneſs of Judgment, which lets
nothing ſlip but what is exact and judicious.
It conſiſts, in fine, in having the ſtrength to
reſiſt the temptation, which a man naturally
has to make oſtentation of his Wit; as that
impertinent Hiſtorian does, who in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of the <hi>Parthians</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lucian. de conſcrib. Hiſt.</note> makes <hi>Oſroes</hi> eſcape, by getting into a
Cave planted about with Laurels and Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
wherein he makes himſelf ridiculous,
while he thinks to be divertive; which is
one of the moſt ſlippery places that an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
could fall upon. And that ſenceful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that Character of Wiſdom, which Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
requires, is a kind of Attention over ones
ſelf, which does not allow it ſelf any Exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration,
and which takes continual Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt thoſe daring Imaginations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he is ſubject, whoſe Mind is too quick and
volatile, or over fertile; that he may ſet
down great things in few words, as <hi>Saluſt</hi>
does, who holds great Councils, gives Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
takes Cities, conquers Kingdoms, with
a ſhortneſs of Diſcourſe, and a ſwiftneſs of
Expreſſion, which is underſtood at half a
word. <hi>Tacitus</hi> has all the Sence that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
anſwerably to his cloſe way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
but he has not enough of it to be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.
A man is ſometimes put into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62341:12"/>
at the Precipitations of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who loſes much of his Gracefulneſs,
and falls into Obſcurity, meerly upon this
ſcore, that he will needs confine in too few
words what ought to have a greater Extent.
The humour he has to be too conciſe puts me
out of all humour, by reaſon of the little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
he gives me, in things which he
does not ſufficiently unravel. <hi>Polybius</hi> and
<hi>Appianus</hi> are ſometimes too liberal of their
Diſcourſe: and there is a kind of Judicious
Taciturnity, which raiſes a better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the Grandeut of the things which
are ſpoken of, than all the words that are
too weak to do it. 'Tis a Maſter-talent to
ſuppreſs what cannot well be ſaid; and it is
the principal part of an Hiſtorian, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between that which admits of Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Reſtriction, and ſo to give every thing
its juſt meaſure, that there may be a ſtrict
obſervance of <hi>decorum.</hi> For <hi>Livy,</hi> as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
as he is, does not tire out the Reader's
patience, becauſe he is judicious where he
ſeems to be moſt tedeous. But <hi>Thucydides,</hi>
keeping too cloſely to ſound Sence, does
ſometimes fall into a kind of harſhneſs and
drought, which a man would hardly pardon
in him, were it not for the Purity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his Style. So hard a matter is it
to write with a ſtrict obſervance of Sence,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62341:13"/>
without loſing ſomewhat of thoſe Beauties,
which might be imployed if a man were not
ſo prudent. But however let an Author be
ſtill of this perſuaſion, that the greateſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any Production is always the ſound
Sence of it: men are wearied with all elſe,
but ſound Sence never tires them. It is by
this conſtant current of ſound Sence that
<hi>Philip Comines,</hi> notwithſtanding the impure
and unrefin'd Language of his Age, has me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
the eſteem and approbation of ours.
But of all the modern Hiſtorians there is not
any one has writ with a greater obſervance
of the ſenceful Character, than <hi>Mariana</hi> in
his Hiſtory of <hi>Spain.</hi> It is a Maſter-piece
of the laſt Ages, onely upon the ſcore of
that Quality. There is obſervable through
that whole Work a wiſe Precaution, which
never allows him to expatiate too much in the
moſt plauſible paſſages, nor yet to betray
any negligence in thoſe that are not ſuch:
and that ſo judicious an Evenneſs of Hand,
which is always the ſame in the inequality of
the matters, treated of by that Author, is
but little known to the Hiſtorians of theſe
laſt times. But the Talent of a ſenceful <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi>
on things is not ſufficient, without
that of <hi>purely expreſſing</hi> them.</p>

<hi>Herodotus</hi> had this Purity of Style,
and excells therein above all the Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
as <hi>Caeſar</hi> does above all the Latines.
Mens minds grew ruſtly in the ſubſequent

<hi>Q. Curtius,</hi> out of a deſire to be too polite,
has loſt ſomewhat of that grand and majeſtick
Air, which is ſo becoming in <hi>Saluſt</hi> and <hi>Livy.</hi>
Certain it is, that he flouriſhes too much in

               <head type="sub">Of the Simplicity of Writing.</head>
               <p>THere is alſo a further Obligation incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon an Hiſtorian, to obſerve a
Simplicity of Elocution, to avoid the Air that
is pompous and affected, both which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the grand Character which Hiſtory
is to look after; in regard that whatever is
great ceaſes to be ſo, as ſoon as it is deveſted
of that Simplicity which it ought to have;
and what is joyntly ſimple and great doubles
the Grandeur of it, and becomes ſublime.
Nor is there any thing that inſtructs better,<note place="margin">Si oratio perderet gratiam ſimplicis &amp; inaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctati colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, perderet &amp; fidem. <hi>Fab. l. 9. c.</hi> 4.</note>
or more cajoles the publick Belief, than that
Simplicity of Style, which was ſo much culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by the Ancients, and is ſo little known
to the Moderns: whatever exaggerates has a
counterfeit Air; and Nature, which ought
to be imitated in all things, expreſſes her ſelf
with as much ſimplicity as may be. But to
make a full diſcovery of that Simplicity,
which is ſo neceſſary to, and conſiſtent with,
a Grandeur of Style, it is to be obſerved
that there are three ſorts of it, to wit, a Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62341:17"/>
in the words, ſuch as that of <hi>Caeſar;</hi>
a Simplicity in the Sentiments, ſuch as that
of <hi>Salust;</hi> and a Simplicity in the Deſign,
and in the Diſtribution of the Deſign, ſuch
as that of <hi>Thucydides,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In judicio de Thucyd.</note> ſo much celebrated by
<hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus.</hi> Thoſe Authors of
the Moderns, who have come neareſt that
Character, are amongſt the <hi>French, Philip de
Comines; Guicciardine</hi> amongſt the <hi>Italians,
Buchanan</hi> amongſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> moſt of the others
endeavour not to keep themſelves up by the
Purity, Politeneſs, and the other Ornaments
of Diſcourſe, but onely when their Abilities
will not reach to the obſervance of that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;
and they paraphraſe the truth, when
they have not the ſtrength to deliver it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Happy is that man who can arrive
thereto when he is concerned to write; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
perſons may underſtand him, while
the intelligent are charm'd with him. But
there is not any thing of greater difficulty to
attain, than that even and natural Air, which
contributes ſo much to the Simplicity of
Style. There is an extraordinary <hi>Genius</hi>
requiſite in him who would ſpeak things ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
without falling into the mean and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
Style. For when he ſtudies Simplicity,
there is not any thing he ought more to fear
than Meanneſs of Expreſſion. But wherein
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62341:18"/>
does this admirable Simplicity conſiſt, which
is the ſovereign Perfection of a great Work,
and what is meant by writing ſimply? In
this, that a man ſhould make uſe of the moſt
proper and moſt ordinary words, but yet ſuch
as are full of great ſence, as that Prince
does,<note place="margin">Homerus brevem quidem, cum animi jucunditate propriam, carentem ſuperfluis, eloquenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lao dedit, quae ſunt virtutes generis primi. <hi>Fab. l. 12. c.</hi> 10.</note> on whom <hi>Homer</hi> beſtows a conciſe,
pleaſant, and ſignificant Eloquence, without
any ſuperfluity. It is for a man to think and
ſpeak pertinently what he has to think and
ſay, without giving too great a Vivacity to
his Expreſſion, as <hi>Strada</hi> does; and without
giving too much Luſtre to his Conceptions, as
<hi>Grotius</hi> does. It conſiſts in a mans having
ordinary and natural Sentiments, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſo many Ratioecinations and Reflections,
as <hi>Davila</hi> does, in his Hiſtory of the Troubles
of <hi>France,</hi> for when a man is ſo much taken
up with Ratiocination, it is not Nature, but
Art and Study that ſpeak; and thoſe ſo much

and amongſt them he is to make choice
onely of the moſt Eminent for the Simplicity
of their Style.<note place="margin">Herm. de Idaeis l. 2.</note>

ſimplicity, of which their Writings are a

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62341:19"/>
charges <hi>Thucydides,</hi> as ſimply as
he writes, with inſerting too many matters
of fact in ſome of his Narrations. <hi>Xenophon</hi>
and <hi>Polybius</hi> are too full of Moralizations,
and many times break off the Thread of the
Hiſtory by their Reflections. <hi>Diodorus Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
intermixes too much Learning in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> may paſs for a great Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of that ſimplicity which we look after,
for he has obſerv'd it in all he has written.
<hi>Titus Livius</hi> does not appear to me more
admirable upon the ſcore of all his other
great Qualities, than he does upon this. The
current of his Hiſtory is like the courſe of a
great River, which glides away majeſtically;
whereas the Hiſtory of <hi>Tacitus</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a rich and plentiful River, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Inundations: he is not ſufficiently well
poiz'd in what he thinks, and he is many
times forc'd and harſh in what he ſays, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe he is not ſimple. <hi>Mariana</hi> is one
of the moſt accompliſh'd amongſt the modern
Hiſtorians, becauſe he is the moſt ſtudious to
expreſs himſelf ſimply. For there is not any
thing of this ſimplicity of Style to be found
in great Subjects, but what is always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with Grandeur and Excellency. Thoſe
are the Qualities from which proceeds that
primitive Ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(as I may ſo ſay) the firſt Elements of that

<hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> has done, in the

which <hi>Herodotus</hi> had made of his Subject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> for the Reaſons he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

what is falſe has the Air of what is true, ſo

does commit very great Abſurdities in the

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62341:21"/>
out of his ignorance of Military Affairs, and
the order which was obſerv'd in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

above all things to be very well aſſur'd of his

And if there be not any thing more

it may alſo be ſaid, that there is not any
thing more rare than that Certainty or Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

the perſons he ſpeaks of have always

a man ought to bid defiance to hope or fear,

the great ones, who have their Attractions

to keep the Reader in breath by that
variety. For a Narration grows flat, when it
has not a diverſity of Accidents, Adventures,
Figures, and Expreſſions. Nay, a man muſt
give certain Intervals to things, that ſo the
Reader may have time to breath, and not
ſmother his matter, by an over-intermixture
of Occurrences one with another. This is a

                  </note> It is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by this concealed Order that he ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
himſelf with the Reader, makes him
take the ſame proſpect of things as he had
done himſelf; that he inſtils into him his own
Sentiments, when he makes him ſee men act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
naturally as they ought to act, and that
he ſhews him their Manners, their Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62341:34"/>
their Deſigns, their Motives, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as they are in a kind of dependence one
upon another, and in that natural Order,
wherein there is an exact Correſpondence.
The Hiſtorian, who knows how to manage
this without confuſion, is a great man. This
is the way that is pleaſing, and not thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Emergencies, after which a man
runs when he has no Judgment. For there is
not any thing more taking, than to ſee men
act in that order: that alone well deliver'd
keeps the Mind attentive. As to which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Livy</hi> has been the moſt ſuccesful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has beſt followed that Order, by
purſuing the courſe of his Hiſtory with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertexture
of Diſcourſe, and an always equal
and even Concatenation of Actions.<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note>

does ſometimes diſcompoſe things that
were well concerted, merely that he might
ſurprize by his diſorder, and ſo diverſifie his
Narration: nay, he often relates things paſt
in the preſent time, in ſhewing them as if
they then actually paſſed; which raiſes a
greater Expectancy and Attention in the
Reader. <hi>Tacitus</hi> has his frequent Sallies,
and does not make a conſequential delivery
of things. That great Sence pent up in few
words has not the extent it ſhould have, to
be proportionate to the Apprehenſion of his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62341:34"/>
Readers, which is many times o'repreſſed
therewith: and as he is not natural in what
he relates, nor ever hardly humanizes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſo he does not inſtruct as he ought to
do. For inſtance; when upon occaſion of
the <hi>Papian</hi> Law he explicates the Origine of
Laws; or when he elſewhere deſcribes the
Privilege of Places of Refuge, he does not
go to the Source of the things; he does not
clear up any thing to the bottom, or he does
it amiſs; as when he would explicate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the fifth Book of his
Hiſtory. Nay, his very Style is no way fit
for it, which is a great defect in an Hiſtorian,

And indeed thoſe delicate and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Windings, thoſe happy Devolutions from

of the Diſcourſe engaging; thoſe
inſinuating Attractions, which conduct the
Reader's Mind from object to object, and
give him a ſpacious, yet divertive, Proſpect:
in fine, all that admirable oeconomy of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,
is that which is moſt delicate and moſt
ſprightly in Narration, which looks always as
it were forc'd, never eaſie and natural, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Art. It is not enough for a man to
underſtand ſpeaking well, in order to the
attaining of this; but he muſt be eloquent,
abſolute Maſter of his Subject, and perfectly
know the Connexions and Dependencies of
it; for the moſt proper Tranſitions ought to
be rather in the things themſelves, than in
the words. So that thoſe Excurſions out of
Kingdoms into Kingdoms, out of Nations

thoſe qualifications in a greater meaſure; his
Narration is an admirable Concatenation, in
regard his Tranſitions are not ſo much in the
words as the things. <hi>Saluſt</hi> is not of ſo even
a thread. <hi>Tacitus</hi> is leſs even; if he has any
Connexions, they are forc'd, and the thread
of his Diſcourſe is much interrupted; which
ſtartles the Reader, who cannot follow that
Author but with loſs of breath. The moſt
difficult Tranſitions are thoſe which are in
the moſt common things; for a man muſt keep
up himſelf with an Expreſſion that has not
any thing mean in it, notwithſtanding the
meanneſs of the Matter; nay find out an
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62341:36"/>
Expedient to connect things that have not
any mutual dependence. 'Tis alſo in thoſe
places that a man ought to uſe his greateſt
art and wit. The Reader's Mind is ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
that it is not always turn'd as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
pleaſes. And therefore thoſe Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which it is to be conducted from Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
to Adventures, ought to be prepar'd
by ſecret Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>catenations. For in ſhort, it is
many times ſubject to a ridiculous Coyneſs,
and is in ſo fantaſtick an humour as renders it
intractable. But what artifice is there not
requiſite to diverſifie thoſe Tranſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which there ſhould never be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
that ſo he may always ſupply the
Reader with new <hi>Idea's,</hi> by not placing the

the induſtry of the Hiſtorian to be much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed;
for in this conſiſts that Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Narration, which alone can make it

               <p>IF a Narration becomes pleaſant upon the
ſcore of its Tranſitions, it becomes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
upon that of its <hi>Circumſtances.</hi> For
nothing renders a man more concern'd than a
matter of Fact well circumſtanced, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-clouded and obſcure, as it is in it
ſelf, is cleared up by particulars, and by that
means becomes ſenſible, palpable, evident;
and there's no way to make one apprehend
the progreſs of great Enterprizes and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Affairs, but that of unveiling them by
the different degrees of their Circumſtances.
So that the art of expoſing the Truth in all
its dependences, by decyphering what is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
therein, making one of the greateſt
Beauties of Hiſtory, the Hiſtorian ought to
ſtudy it with all the care imaginable. Take
then what there may be to be obſerved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
The grand Secret is, to know how to
make a prudent and judicious choice of the
Circumſtances, fit to give a greater <hi>Idea</hi> of
the thing, to imprint in them that colour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62341:37"/>
which engages Credulity, and by that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
diſſection to render them capable of
faſtening on the Mind. A Collection of great
and ſmall Circumſtances methodically inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
one with another, is of that nature
when they are well choſen. For the great
Circumſtances raiſe admiration, and the ſmall
ones create diverſion, provided they be well
choſen, without being aggravated. But,
though a Matter of Fact, which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
particularized, does not make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
yet is it requiſite, that a man
ſhould avoid all thoſe mean, frivolous, and
minute Particularities, which debaſe a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
for he becomes childiſh, and indeed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
who inſiſts too much on ſmall things.
Such was that impertinent Hiſtorian menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by <hi>Lucian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r. hiſt.</note> who makes a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
deſcription of the <hi>Parthian</hi> King's Veſt,
and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour's Buckler, whileſt
he is deſcribing the Engagement. Others
(ſays he) not minding eſſential things, ſpend
their thoughts on what makes nothing to
their purpoſe; as he, who having ſaid a word
or two of the Battel, which he was to give an
account of, falls into a deſcription of the moſt
extravagant Adventures of a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Knight,
that could be imagined. Thus does <hi>Procopius</hi>
in his Secret Hiſtory, forget to circumſtance
what is important, and is very careful in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtancing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62341:37"/>
what is not ſo. A man ought
therefore, in the relation of a Matter of
Fact of conſequence, to know how to ſet off
to the beſt advantage the Circumſtances
which are moſt proper to clear it up, and to
heighten it, by diſtinguiſhing that which is
eſſential from that which is not. The moſt
complete Model we have in Hiſtory of a
great Action related in all the Circumſtances
capable of giving it weight and grandeur, is
<hi>Hannibal</hi>'s March into <hi>Italy,</hi> deſcribed in the
21. Book of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Annals. It is in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the moſt accompliſh'd paſſage of his
Hiſtory; and there are few things of that
force in Antiquity. Never did greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
enter into a Soul more extraordinary,
and never was any thing executed with more
confidence or more reſolution. His buſineſs
was to come out of <hi>Africa,</hi> to paſs through
all <hi>Spain,</hi> to climb over the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
to croſs the River <hi>Rhone,</hi> which is ſo
large and ſo rapid near its falling into the
Sea, and whereof the Shores on each ſide
were planted with ſo many Enemies; to open
a way through the <hi>Alps,</hi> where none had
ever paſſed before; to march all along upon
Precipices, to diſpute every foot of Ground
he was to go, with People poſted every where
in continual Ambuſcado's, amidſt Snow, Ice,
Rain, Torrents; to defie Tempeſts and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62341:38"/>
Thunder, to engage againſt the Heavens, the
Earth, and all the Elements; to have at his
heels an Army of an hundred thouſand men
of different Nations, but all diſſatisfied with
a Captain, whoſe Courage they could not
imitate. There is a Conſternation in the
hearts of the Souldiery; <hi>Hannibal</hi> is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſon undiſturb'd; the danger which
ſurrounds him on all ſides, raiſes a trouble in
the hearts of the whole Army, but he is not
mov'd thereat. All is ſet down in a minute
Particularization of dreadful Circumſtances;
the image of the danger is expreſſed in every
word of the Hiſtorian; and never was there
any Repreſentation more complete in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor any touch'd with ſtronger colours, or
more lively. Nor is there any thing better
circumſtanc'd in <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Annal. l. 11.</note> than the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
which the Empreſs <hi>Meſſalina</hi> made
for <hi>Silius,</hi> her Gallant and Favourite. 'Twas
a kind of Vintage in all the Ceremonies, the
ſeaſon of Autumn being favourable thereto;
Joy, Pleaſure, Effeminacy, Laſciviouſneſs,
Impudence, Debauchery, all is deſcrib'd
with an exquiſite delicacy and elegance, and
all is particulariz'd ſuccinctly, ſencefully, and
related in a ſmart and lively manner: and
there is not any thing more judiciouſly plac'd,
to render by ſo frolickſom a Pourtraiture the
Death of <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> which follows ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62341:38"/>
more tragical and more full of horrour.
In fine, there are ſome happy Circumſtances
which give a Grace to whatever they are
applied to; they muſt be known ere they can
be imploy'd. Sometimes things become great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by their Circumſtances than they are in
themſelves. Let us ſeek out thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which are joyntly capable of pleaſing
and inſtructing, and ſo prevent the Reader's
being wearied out. Let us imitate <hi>D'avila,</hi>
who ſo excites Attention by the art he has of
Circumſtancing what he ſays. And yet exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Particularizations tire the Mind: let us
therefore make a diſtinction between import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and neceſſary Circumſtances, and thoſe
that are not ſuch. Let us conſult <hi>Lucian,</hi>
and his Diſcourſe upon Hiſtory; he is a great
Maſter in it. But to make a Narration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
we are to joyn to the Circumſtances of
the things which it ſays, the Motives of the
Actions which it relates; for the Motives well
couch'd down render a Narration as curious,
as the Circumſtances render it probable.</p>

the Events of things, but alſo to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Ground-work and Principles thereof,
and to give ſome account of the Motives.
'Tis by this that an Hiſtorian diſtinguiſhes
himſelf, and becomes conſiderable; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more divertive in a Narration, than
the decyphering of what is ſecret and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
in the deſigns and intentions of
thoſe whoſe Actions it divulges: and as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
has not any thing curious comparably
to that, ſo are there not any Hiſtorians of
any fame, who have not endeavoured to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize
themſelves upon that ſcore. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
does more excite the Curioſity of men,
than when they have diſcover'd to them what
is moſt conceal'd in the Heart of man, that is
to ſay, the ſecret Springs and Reſorts, which
make him act in the Enterprizes, which are
ordinary to him. It is therefore by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcenſion
to the Cauſe that we diſcover the
<hi>genius</hi> of thoſe perſons who are ſpoken of,
that we find out the predominant humour
which puts them into action, what things
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62341:40"/>
they are capable of, and that we light on the
truth by diving into their intentions. But
with how many Falſhoods are Hiſtories
fraught upon this plauſible pretence? And
into how many errors have fallen, and do
daily fall, unjuſt, unfaithful, and intereſſed
Hiſtorians, who carried on with the Career
of their own Conjectures, communicate their
own Viſions to the publick, in explicating
the Deſigns of thoſe whom they diſcourſe of.
As for example, that <hi>Pericles</hi> occaſioned the
<hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, upon the ſcore of his
Amours to the Curtezan <hi>Aspaſia.</hi> That <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>

of which Hiſtorians give us an account, onely

loſt the Empire, onely to avoid loſing
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> That <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt of <hi>France</hi>
had no motive to bring an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi>
but the fair Eyes of a <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Lady named
<hi>Claricia.</hi> There is not any thing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than this ſort of people, who make
it their buſineſs to ſearch into mens hearts, to
gueſs at their thoughts; who ſay all they
know, and all that comes into their Minds,
out of a fear of being defective in telling the
truth. This is one of the great Miſcarriages
of <hi>D'avila,</hi> whoſe Reaſonings are pertinent
enough, but whoſe Conjectures in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the matters of fact which he alleges,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62341:40"/>
have but little truth in them, if we refer our

are in all Hiſtorians ſome Miſcarriages of this

have their heads ſteddy enough to oppoſe
their Prepoſſeſſion. But though the Motives
in great perſons ought regularly to be more
excellent, and indeed greater than the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for the Motives depend on them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Events do not; yet is there no great
miſtake (the Condition of Grandees conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
in putting into the Scales of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and Deliberations, ſome Grains of the
Vanity and Weakneſs whereof they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
For it happens many times, that moſt
men determine what they intend to do upon
impertinent and ridiculous Motives. There
are infinite Examples of it which I omit, to
avoid being my ſelf infinite upon this Subject.
It is principally requiſite, that there be a
diſcovery of the Vanity, the Malice, the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
the Extravagance of Man's Spirit,
which are as it were the Principles thereof,
in order to a full diſcovery of his intentions,

Malice; and a man muſt not be ignorant above
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62341:41"/>
all things, that the Slothfulneſs of moſt Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,
in examining what is of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
in Affairs, and the impatience they are
in to ſee the iſſue of them, is the Wheel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is carried about what is moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
in their conduct. Theſe are they who
ought principally to be known, in regard that
being (as they are) the grand Actors upon
the Theatre of the World, all things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
according to the fantaſtick humour
they are in; but it is not to be affirmed, that
a man's Reaſon always hits upon the right,
when haply he may have done it once by pure
chance. There are ſome Hiſtorians in this
Age who have loſt their Repute by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
itch they had to intermingle their own
Conjectures in all occurrences, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
themſelves to the publick, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their Hiſtories. As <hi>Herrera</hi> does,
who ſays that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> did not
what he could againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that he
might according to policy keep them the
longer upon the ſtage. There is not any
thing more oppoſite to the Spirit of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,
who ought to be faithful and ſincere,
than thoſe Conjectures which are made at
random without any ground; and all thoſe
Deductions grounded upon ſimple Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are either uncertain or frivolous.
And this I conceiv'd obſervable upon the

Expreſſions that can be imagin'd,
are excellent Examples of it. And it is in
this Hiſtorian that a man ought to ſtudy the
Air of treating the Paſſions, as they ought
to be treated in Hiſtory; for he animates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
onely in thoſe places, where there is a

neceſſity of heat and fervour. <hi>Tacitus</hi> minds

<hi>Tiberius</hi> had to retire thither, towards the

and being ſhort, elegant, polite, as it is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing ſuperfluous, it may be ſaid, that

Fiction: for upon what Memoirs could they
have been taken? Beſides that, it is not

Orator. So when <hi>Pericles</hi> in <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
commends thoſe Souldiers who had been
defeated and killed by the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
is ſuppoſititious; as is alſo that which
<hi>Saluſt</hi> makes <hi>Catiline</hi> ſpeak to the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which in all probability was ſecret, and
not much thought of before hand. And this
is ſome part of <hi>Beny</hi>'s Argument in his diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proval
of that Abuſe.<note place="margin">Ben. l. 2. de hiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who was
a judicious Author, grew ſenſible of it in his
laſt Books, wherein he Harangues much leſs
than in the precedent. But it is a Leſſon of
Nature; for there is no account made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
if they who are concerned therein are not
introduc'd to ſpeak them; for there is not any
thing elſe does ſo much animate the Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is apt to become frigid by too even
a thread of Diſcourſe. There is therefore a
mean or temperament to be obſerved: A
ſhort Diſcourſe pertinently made in an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
by an Author fit to make ſuch a one,
and ſuch as may be conveniently applicable
to the perſon and the ſubject then concerned,
may have its peculiar beauty, being ſet in its
proper place. But thoſe formal Harangues
at the head of an Army, when they are juſt
ready to engage, and thoſe tireſom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62341:48"/>
Deliberations, which are made upon the
Affairs whereof they ſpeak, are now in a
manner obſolete and out of uſe in well-digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hiſtories; and the wiſeſt Authors chuſe
rather to introduce the perſons concern'd
ſpeaking indirectly, and ſaying the things in
general, without engaging themſelves to
ſpeak the very wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Livy</hi> has done at
the beginning of his Hiſtory, by the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
whom <hi>Romulus</hi> ſends to his Neighbours.
Moſt of the Harangues in <hi>Salust</hi> are always
admirable, and never pertinent nor to the
purpoſe. For nothing can be more excellent
than the Diſcourſe of <hi>Marius;</hi> it is a moſt
ſolid piece of Morality upon the ſubject of
Gallantry: all is rational in it, and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
has but few Diſcourſes of that vigour in
order to the perſuaſion of Vertue; but that
is not in its proper place. And the Air
wherewith he makes <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> give
their Votes in the Senate, is not (as great as
it is) proportionate to the reſt of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For the ſame reaſon the great Diſcourſe
which <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> makes in the 56. Book
of his Hiſtory, upon the Commendation of
Marriage and Celebacy, is not very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
There is not any thing comparable to
the Harangue which <hi>Tacitus</hi> brings in <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
making in the Senate, upon the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Luxury and Riot, in the third

And this is the beſt that can be ſaid as to that

a great Opinion of <hi>Catiline,</hi> by the Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he makes of him at the entrance of his
Hiſtory. And when I ſee that reſolute Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
raiſing Armies in his Cloſet, going to

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62341:49"/>
to affront the Conſul, ſlighting and
ſcorning his Invectives, putting <hi>Rome</hi> into
an Alarm, making <hi>Italy</hi> tremble; in fine, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that which no private perſon ever durſt;
I am not ſurpriz'd, after the Deſcription
which the Hiſtorian has given me of him. I
ſee a man of capacity and conduct, who ſtirs
all without ſhewing himſelf, becauſe he had
laid his deſign well. <hi>Pompey</hi> is at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
with the beſt Forces of the Common-wealth,
engag'd in an important but obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
War; <hi>Rome</hi> is full of diſaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
the neighbouring Provinces are full of
Malecontents; there is an univerſal diſorder
in the Commonwealth, by reaſon of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of all vices predominant therein; and all
things ſeem favourable to <hi>Catiline</hi>'s deſign, in
the conjuncture he takes for the execution of
it. Thus may a man gueſs at what will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
upon the War between <hi>Adherbal</hi> and
<hi>Jugurth,</hi> after the deſcription which <hi>Saluſt</hi>
gives of both their <hi>Genius's:</hi> thus have I a
perfect knowledge of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Idea</hi> he has given me of them;
and take a pleaſure to ſee flowing down from
a ſource, which that Hiſtorian has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me, the reſult of the great Actions of
<hi>Jugurth,</hi> who gave ſo much trouble to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> after the Repreſentation he has
made me of that Chieftain's courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62341:50"/>
'Twas thus the Ancients intermingled
in their Hiſtories ſuch Pourtraitures of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whom they would give a particular
Character of, to diſtinguiſh them from others;
which is a thing of great Ornament in a
Work, when 'tis pertinently done. For when
the Hiſtorian has well eſtabliſh'd a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
by thoſe eſſential and diſtinctive lines, all
goes the better; every thing is more eaſily
apprehended in the Narration. But it is a
Maſter-piece for a man to attain that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
which conſiſts onely in thoſe ſingular
and imperceptible Touches, by which alone
Nature is expreſs'd, and which are hardly
found, otherwiſe than by a particular ſearch
into mens hearts, and a diſcovery of all the
Receſſes thereof, to get a perfect knowledge
of what lies conceal'd. But what vivacity of
Spirit, and what perſpicacity is there not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to do that? Take here then what is
to be obſerved therein: The Pourtraiture
or Character ought to be real; and ſo <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
is defective in the Pourtraiture he has
made of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> wherein he has given us a
<hi>Hero</hi> in <hi>Idea.</hi> It ought to reſemble the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
repreſented; in which caſe <hi>Tacitus</hi> is not
exact, who makes it his buſineſs rather to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his own <hi>genius,</hi> than to imitate Nature;
endeavouring rather to make beautiful pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
than good draughts; provided his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62341:50"/>
pleaſe, as that of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> in
the fourth of his Annals, he minds not how
little they reſemble, for he makes him more
wicked than he was, if we may believe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terculus,</hi>
who much commends him. There
ought not to be any Pourtraitures made but
of the moſt important perſons; as to which
particular <hi>Saluſt</hi> is miſtaken in the Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Sempronia,</hi> who comes but indirectly
into <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy. But though a
man ought not to amuſe himſelf too much in
deſcribing the external qualifications of the
perſon, yet may it be done upon certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
when it is conducive to a better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the <hi>genius</hi> of thoſe who are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. And indeed there are many ways
of repreſenting perſons. <hi>Livy</hi> ſpeaking of
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> who was ſo beautiful in the eye of
her Husband, giving no deſcription of her
Countenances gives an account onely of her
Vertue, and in two words ſets down the
greateſt <hi>Idea</hi> which could be given a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Woman. <hi>Taictus</hi> deſcribes <hi>Tiberius</hi>

which the Reader has not the ingenuity to

It is therefore wiſdom in an Author,
not to be ridiculouſly over-conceited of his
own ſence, that ſo he may act the part of a

Learned. <hi>Livy</hi> keeps on his way, without

It is a great talent in an Author, to know
how to find work for thoſe who read him, by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62341:52"/>
giving them matter, that they may deduce
Conſequences from it, and take thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to the things he relates, which they
ſhall think fit. For every Reader would have
the freedom of think what he pleaſes upon
what is preſented to him, and not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed;
and the uſe of that freedom is one
of the greateſt divertiſements he takes in his
reading. Let us therefore retrench thoſe
profound and abſtracted Reflections, if our
deſign be to pleaſe; let us not ſubtilize ſo
much in what we write, but let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be ſimple and natural. Let us ſpeak
the truth without commenting upon it, if
we have the ſteddineſs and ſtrength of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
to do it. Let us above all things avoid
thoſe uſual Moralizations upon Fortune and
her inconſtancy, whereof ſome Books are ſo

over-ſententious Sayings, which aim onely
at ſplendour and decoration. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

ſo much a Declamator, if he did not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

forget that he is onely an Hiſtorian.
It is alſo requiſite that a man ſhould be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
skill'd in Morality, e're he can make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and ſeaſonable Reflections; for true
Morality is the Ground-work of good Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And ſo it may be ſaid, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> his
Politicks are many times falſe, becauſe his
Morality is not true; wherein he attributes
too great a Corruption to men, or he has not
ſufficiently that talent of implicity he ought
to have: there is not ordinarily any thing
natural in his Reflections, becauſe there is
not any thing innocent; he envenoms all, and
gives all things the worſt Gloſs that may be.
By thoſe ways has he corrupted the Minds of
many perſons, who imitate him in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
not being able to do it in others.
And this is what I conceive obſervable as to
the uſe of <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the ſcore of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
A ſententious Saving may be ſeaſonably
put into the mouth of a perſon, whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
qualifies him for the ſpeaking of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
In my judgment <hi>Mariana</hi> and <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
have not been ſufficiently careful in this
particular. Nor is there any kindneſs to be
had for that over-ſerious ſort of Writers,
who will not be put out of their track; and
who to give an Air of greater importance to
what they ſay, multiply Sentences upon Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
Reflections upon Reflections, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62341:54"/>
by a ridiculous Gravity play the <hi>Cato's</hi> upon
trifles. An exceſſive humour of ſubtilizing
in theſe over-ſought Conjectures, is apt to
degenerate into a deluſive delicacy of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;

or want of connection, inaſmuch as
they give the Narration that variety which is
requiſite to render it divertive; but there
ought to be a prudent diſtribution and inter-mixture
of them. A man is apt to be miſled
when he leaves his Subject; for wanting the
requiſite recollection, he is apt to take the
wrong courſe; and for a man to quit the
matter he had propos'd to himſelf, without
any Precaution, and ſo to go and ſeek out
Adventures, onely to give his Reader a
more ſpacious proſpect, does not ſo well
ſtand with the Character of an Hiſtorian, as it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62341:54"/>
does with that of an Adventurer, who minds
every thing, purpoſely to thruſt into his
Narrative whatever comes in his way; he
takes Cities, gives Battels, and makes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
every where; as <hi>Herodotus</hi> does,
who is continually ſtarting out of his matter
by over-frequent Digreſſions, and thoſe many
times forc'd, though he had taken <hi>Homer</hi> for
his Patern, who is a great Maſter in it; for
though he often takes a high ſoaring flight,
yet he purſues his courſe directly enough to
his mark, without deviating by introducing
things that are incongruous. <hi>Thucydides</hi> is
more regular than <hi>Herodotus;</hi> he keeps cloſe
to his Subject, without ſtarting out of it.
The Conſpiracy of <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
in the ſixth Book, is one of thoſe Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
wherein he has moſt excell'd. <hi>Xenophon</hi>
endeavours to imitate him; if he ſometimes
miſcarries, as he does in the fifth Book of the
Hiſtory of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the Adventure of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
yet that Adventure has a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
with the body of his Hiſtory; <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>
having been taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat

would not be anſwerable for the other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
of that Author, which have not that

with the ſame fault; upon which ſcore a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

does very much commend the Digreſſion
which <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> makes in his
ſeventh Book, in deſcribing the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Ariſtomedus</hi> his Tyranny. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
about the <hi>Phoenix</hi> handled in the ſixth

the News which was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of a
<hi>Phoenix</hi> that appear'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> is within the rules of a
juſt Digreſſion. The Queſtion is ſearch'd
into by the different Opinions of Naturaliſts
upon the Bird; its Qualities, its Figure, all
is there deſcrib'd in few words. A Flouriſh
of that nature well plac'd is of great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a Narration, and it excites the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
of the Reader, and keeps his Mind vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
and attentive. Nor is there any thing
gives the Hiſtory of <hi>Mariana</hi> that Air of
Grandeur which it has, ſo much as the Art
which that Author has of introducing into it,
by the means of Digreſſion, whatever paſſes
in the world that's conſiderable, whatever is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62341:55"/>
admirable in fabulous times, and whatever is
remarkable in <hi>Greece, Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire. There you have a very particular

it will be hard to find better couch'd any

ſetting up of Chriſtianity, the Preaching of
the Goſpel, the Conqueſts of the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
and ſeveral other Imbelliſhments which are
of the ſublime Character. 'Tis a <hi>genius</hi> ever
minding tranſcendent matters, which yet
have a conſtant dependence by ſomething to
the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain.</hi> No Hiſtorian ever
honour'd his Countrey by any Work ſo
much as he has done, for he makes whatever
was tranſacted of any great account in the

Countrey. But as there are few Authors
who have that vigour of <hi>genius,</hi> as to follow
the thread of a Hiſtory with the ſame breath,
and to keep themſelves cloſe to the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

without any diſcernment. It ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be laid down as a certain Rule, and
ſuch as is not to be diſpenc'd withall; That
Digreſſions ought always to have a Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

is treated of;<note place="margin">Luc. de conſcrib. hiſt.</note> as it has always been obſerved
by that Judicious Hiſtorian we mentioned
before: and it muſt be ſtrictly examined,
whether there be not at the bottom ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
incompatibility between them and it;
otherwiſe they are no way proper thereto, for
nothing is more eſſential to Digreſſion, than
the Rapport which it ought to have to the
Subject, and the great myſtery is, that a man
preciſely know how far it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62341:56"/>
for it has its natural Boundaries,
which muſt not be exceeded. And what
makes this meaſure the more difficult is this,
that the extent which muſt be given it ought
not to be always the ſame; for it ought
to be great or little, proportionably to the
greater or leſſer Connection it has to the
principal part of the Hiſtory; and this very
Diſcernment is the Rock upon which moſt
Hiſtorians are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to manage that as it ought to be, he ſhould
not ſo much reflect on what he ſays, as on the
manner how he ſays it; for in this as well as

corrupted by Luxury and Avarice,
weakned by the weight of its own Grandeur,
you have the expreſſions of the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Eloquence that is to be found in Hiſtory.
It is in thoſe draughts and repreſentations
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62341:58"/>
that Art ought to ſhew it ſelf, when a man is
Maſter of it: and the Hiſtorians of the firſt
rank are full of them. 'Tis this ſort of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that ought to be interwoven with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
that it may be animated by its fire and
ſpirit; for without that every thing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes.
And thoſe different Dreſſes which
ought to be given to the Narration, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it delightful; all that artifice of <hi>Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
thoſe ſo delicate and ſo paſſionate Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which ſmite the Reader's tendereſt
part; that intertexture and compagination
of the moſt memorable Matters of Fact, that
regular diſtribution of Circumſtances, and all
thoſe conſpicuous paſſages which excite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
are onely the effects of that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
ſort of Eloquence which is proper to
Hiſtory, and ought ſometimes to take a ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flight when occaſion requires. But it
muſt be the diſcerning Perſpicacity of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,
that ſhall diſtinguiſh thoſe paſſages.
There reigned amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> a kind of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the Harangues of the perſons
whom they introduc'd ſpeaking, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

inſtruct, as to dazle and amuſe the Reader.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62341:58"/>
That Eloquence is grown obſolete amongſt
thoſe of the Moderns, who are of ſoundeſt

Affectation, and that ſuch as are able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern

It might do well in an Orator, who many
times ſpeaks in publick, and has not always
the leiſure to prepare himſelf: but it is not to
be allow'd in a Hiſtory, where a man is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

thoſe Diſcourſes how plauſible ſoever they
may be of themſelves, are no longer ſuch
when they are out of their proper place, and
as ſoon as they make any diſcovery of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.
And thus much as to the Eloquence
of Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>THere may be yet other Beauties and
Embelliſhments fit to be us'd in the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Hiſtory, in order to the making of

But of ſuch Embelliſhments, thoſe which make
the greateſt ſhew do not always produce the

that's counterfeit in what is moſt glittering.
A mind which is limited takes no pleaſure in
too much luſtre; and that conſideration
ought to oblige an accompliſh'd man ſo to
husband thoſe Embelliſhments, as not to be
prodigal of them, and to proportion himſelf
to the capacity of man, whom exceſſive Light
dazles; beſides that, when theſe Beauties
are too frequent, they rather aſtoniſh than
delight. There are ſome, which being not

ſo obvious, give a greater ſatisfaction to the
more delicate ſort of Readers, by whom they
are obſerv'd, though they are not ſo by the

them, which keep them up, and are of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
continuance than what makes a ſudden
impreſſion, by its being too much expos'd
to Apprehenſion. Theſe ſorts of Beauties
do ſometimes conſiſt in certain ſudden turns
of Eloquence or Wit, which have ſomewhat

raiſes amazement in the minds of the

That very word ſpoken by an inconſiderate

perſon, begat ſuch a penſiveneſs and perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity
in their minds, as occaſion'd a general

In ſhort, all thoſe delicate Touches, and
ſuch as are capable of making a kind of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in the mind of the Reader, and ſo to
put it into motion and exerciſe, being always
real Embelliſhments, are always appoſite
and to the purpoſe. What is of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
is, that they be plac'd after ſuch a

in the Narration, there to have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
effect; that is to ſay, that they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive

               <p>THere are ſome Sentiments which are fit
for the Theatre, and are not ſo for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory;
in regard that Poeſy ſpeaks things as
they ought to be, and Hiſtory as they are.
Accordingly thoſe Hiſtorians who give their
<hi>Hero's</hi> ſuch exquiſite Sentiments, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the moſt judicious; and whatever is not
grounded upon ſound Sence, how plauſible
ſoever it may otherwiſe be, is not always
the beſt. So that <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
in the right, when he repreſents
<hi>Alexander</hi> as a perſon ſo admirable. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
makes him take the moſt prudent courſe
that might be taken, but the moſt heroick
and the moſt hazardous. He looks upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
as what has ſomething of Charm in it;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62341:61"/>
and he does not ſo much love Conqueſts, as
the Glory of Conquering. He may ſurprize
<hi>Darius</hi> by attacquing him in the night-time,
and by that means conceal his own weakneſs,
the Enemy's Army being twice the number
of his. But that great man, whoſe thoughts
are leſs bent upon conquering, than upon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Valour admir'd, engages the King
of <hi>Perſia</hi> in the day-time, reſolv'd rather to
periſh gloriouſly, than to overcome by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes.
<hi>Darius</hi> after his Defeat proffers to
divide <hi>Aſia</hi> with him, and propoſes to him
an Intermarriage with his Daughter; but
<hi>Alexander</hi> would rather make his way to
Fame through danger, than to gain prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
with tranquillity. He hearkens not
to thoſe Propoſals, and would not have any
thing but what is extraordinary. 'Tis true,
his Hiſtorian does him much honour, but in
that great acqueſt of Glory is there not ſome
defect in point of Veriſimilitude? Does he
not make his <hi>Hero</hi> more daring than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and repreſent him rather as an hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Adventurer, than a perſon of great Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition?
No doubt he thought that the
more plauſible way, but he has thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us occaſion to doubt whether it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
or a Hiſtory he hath left us; ſo far has
he overſhot himſelf as to that point. Of ſo
great concern is it, that an Author keep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cloſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62341:62"/>
in all things to Reaſon, which ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
his Sentiments, and follow rather the
nature of the things, than the charming <hi>Idea's</hi>
of his own imagination. Let not Hiſtory
therefore by any means countenance thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
projects for the acqueſt of an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſame, which occaſion unſettled minds to
commit ſo many miſcarriages, inaſmuch as
moſt of them go but blindly in the purſuit of
true honour, becauſe they know not what it
is. Let it not inſpire a ſolid man with the
Sentiments of a <hi>Palladin</hi> or Knight Errant,
nor attribute the Vertues of a Romantick <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
to a true Courter of Honour. Great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are apt to frame to themſelves <hi>Idea's</hi> of
Reputation according to their own Fancies,
and anſwerably to the bent of their own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But the Publick Intereſt ought to be
more dear to him who governs, than his own
Fame; and the true Honour of a great Prince
is, that he be lov'd rather than fear'd. Theſe
are the Sentiments which ought to be moſt
predominant in Hiſtory, that ſo it may be a
Lecture of Clemency to Princes, and a Rule
of Reaſon and ſound Inſtruction to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Let not the Hiſtorian therefore be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
let him in the firſt place be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between true and counterfeit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in the Maxims of Life, that ſo he may
not commend any thing but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62341:62"/>
Let him undeceive people of
their Errors, without becoming himſelf a
Slave to popular Sentiments. Let him not
ſuffer them to judge of things by their events,
without reaſcending to the ſources, that he
may acquaint them with the Principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Let him be careful to do juſtice to true
and falſe merit, that ſo he may not impoſe
any thing upon Poſterity, which is apt to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
what is ſaid without examining it, and to
keep to the literal ſence of what it meets
withall. Let him never make a diſcovery of
great Emergencies, without ſome advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Cauſes, and without laying open
the ſecret Contrivances and Reſſorts by which
they were compaſs'd. That many times is
ſomething very inconſiderable; but men take

weak for Hiſtory, and not able to reach that
Perfection which it requires, he puts me into
ſome aſtoniſhment, and raiſes in me a very
great <hi>Idea</hi> of the difficulty there is for a man
to acquit himſelf well of that charge. For if
that Author, who has not written any thing
but what is admirable, and who gives Rules
for the writing of Hiſtory, ſo ſenceful and
inſtructive, ingeniouſly confeſſes, that he
is not himſelf capable of ſupporting the
weight of ſo great an undertaking, what are
we to think of thoſe perſons who become Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
on a ſudden, without ever having any
knowledge of what is eſſential to Hiſtory?
As it happen'd (ſays he) in that War of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
mention'd by him, which begat ſo
many Authors, who out of a pure it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h of
writing would needs be dabbling upon that
ſubject. That will not do the work, ſays he;
for there is nothing more difficult than for
a man to labour for Eternity, as <hi>Thucydides</hi>
has done. For what vigour of Mind is there
not requiſite to deliver the truth, without
paraphraſing upon it, as they do, who have
not their Souls great enough to obſerve the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62341:64"/>
Rules of a candid ſimplicity, and to relate
things as they are? What unbyaſs'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
is there not requiſite to unmask the
Vice, which is naturally conceal'd in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
of Diſſimulation? What Penetration
and Perſpicacity is there not neceſſary to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the receſſes of their <hi>Genius,</hi> of whom a
man is to ſpeak without amuſing himſelf about
the external conſideration of their perſons,
which does hardly ever ſignifie any thing?
But when his work is to make a diſtinction
between whole Nations and Ages, by
what is eſſential in their Character, what
ſteddineſs of Apprehenſion is there not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite?
As for inſtance, in a relation of the
Civil Wars of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to confound the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Humour of the Commonwealth, with
that of Monarchy, the Independence of the
one with the Dependence of the other; not
to attribute in a Hiſtory of <hi>France</hi> the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Age of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, which is no
way ſuperſtitious, to the Age of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI,
whoſe Character was Superſtition it ſelf; not
to make <hi>Charlemaign</hi> ſuch a one as <hi>Henry</hi> III,
and to denote the times and perſons by what
is particularly remarkable in their difference.
What Principles of Equity ſhould not a man
have for the exact Adminiſtration of Juſtice
to Vice and Vertue, for the diſtinguiſhing
of true and apparent Merit, and for a man's
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62341:64"/>
accuſtoming himſelf not to look on the Acti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
without reflecting on the Perſons?
What Judgment is there not needful for a
man to pitch upon the right ſide in all things,
to diſplay things in their beſt ſence, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
tending to what is moſt ſolid; ſo to
interpoſe his own Sentiment upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of which he diſcourſes, as not to force
the Reader by Prejudgments; not to deſcant
upon the paſſages that ſeem delicate, but
with that delicacy of Reflection, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the effect of any thing but an exquiſite
ſence; not to charge his Diſcourſe with too
much matter, ſuch as many ſmother the ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it, without allowing therein ſome
place for what Reflection he might make
himſelf, or giving his Reader a convenience
to make any; to be able to find out the real
Knot there may be in every Affair, without
any danger of miſtaking, and ſo to clear the
difficulty; not to make a recital of great
Events upon frivolous motives; not to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceal
falſe Conceptions of things under a pom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pous
Expreſſion; to avoid what ſeems to
have too ſtrong a Scent of Study, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
has a forc'd Air; and to follow in all
things that Beam of Light and Intelligence,
which gives an <hi>Idea</hi> of the diſcernment of the
Hiſtorian, by raiſing a good opinion of his
Capacity and Endowments? So that the

which may prove ſuccesful in a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of people, who are not taken with any
thing ſo much as Confidence. The Poet may
expatiate out of his ſubject, and not have his
Wits always about him: But the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
who ſpeaks in cold bloud, ought ever to
be Maſter of himſelf, have the command of
his thoughts, and not ſpeak any thing but
what is judicious. In ſhort, there is not any
thing requires ſo great a ſtock of Senceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo much Reaſon, ſo great Wit, ſo much
Judgment, and ſo many other qualities, as
Hiſtory, if written as it ought to be; and yet
when all is done, a fortunate Diſpoſition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
with all theſe Accompliſhments, muſt
have one additional Perfection, to wit, that of
a particular Converſation of the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
'Twas by the familiar acquaintance
which <hi>Polybius</hi> had with <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi>
that he became ſo excellent an Hiſtorian. We
have in <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> the accompliſh'd
Models which Hiſtory requries; Antiquity
has not any thing of greater perfection in
that kind; and there is hardly any thing to
be wiſhed for in either of them, unleſs it be
that <hi>Thucydides</hi> is yet more ſincere than <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>

is admirable in his way; <hi>Lapſuis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
him before all the reſt, but all are not of
his Sentiment. It may be ſaid in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that he is an Hiſtorian of a particular
Method by himſelf, who has great beauties,
together with great defects; but his defects
are ſomewhat ſhadowed under a Grandeur
of <hi>Genius,</hi> which is conſpicuous in whatever
he ſays; as alſo under ſomewhat of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Character, which exalts him above ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Authors, who are more exact and more
natural than he is. He has his Adherents
and his Admirers. 'Tis true, he pleaſes thoſe

               <p>Amongſt the Moderns I find <hi>Mariana,
D'avila,</hi> and <hi>Fra. Paolo,</hi> of an admirable <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
for Hiſtory. <hi>Mariana</hi> has the talent of
reflecting and expreſſing excellently well
what he thinks and has to ſay, and of giving a
Character of Grandeur to what is tranſacted
in his mind. <hi>D'avila</hi> does circumſtance
things well, reaſons appoſitely enough upon
the Subjects he treats of, and gives his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that evenneſs of thread and intertex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from which it derives that inſinuating
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62341:66"/>
Air, which is obſervable in him above the
reſt. <hi>Fra. Paolo,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> gives what colour and proſpect
he pleaſes to what he ſays; never had any
man that Art in a more eminent degree than
he has. He alſo makes a diſcovery of a vaſt
Capacity, in the talent he has of making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Reſearches into the points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
whereof he treats, in order to give his
Reader an exact account of them. Never
did Author write with more artifice, or
greater ſmartneſs of wit, nor yet with leſs
reaſon and truth. He is a paſſionate Author,
who imploys his Art in concealing his Paſſion.
He would be pleaſant and drolliſh upon all
occaſions, that he might not be thought an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and out of humour; but he falls by that
means into another default. He is too much
given to Raillery in a Subject ſo ſerious as
that which he treats of; for Paſſion ſpreads it
ſelf through all he ſays. And ſo that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
with all his great <hi>genius,</hi> is the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Character that may be ſeen in the way
of writing Hiſtory, wherein there is not any
thing leſs pardonable than Animoſity. When
an Hiſtorian has once the repute of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
with ſome Paſſion, he is no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.
And this Reflection gives us occaſion to
examine the Morality which is requiſite in
him who makes it his buſineſs to write.</p>

               <p>WHereas every one frames to himſelf a
Morality according to his <hi>Genius,</hi> there
is a diſcovery made of the Spirit and Humor
of an Hiſtorian by his Principles. This muſt in
the firſt place be laid down as granted, that
there are few of them ſo generouſly minded,
as to be free from all Hope or Fear, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly
prefer Truth before their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
which later is the moſt univerſal Source
of all the falſe Judgments which men make of
the things whereof they take upon them
to ſpeak. This therefore ought to be the
firſt thing that is taken into conſideration,
when a man makes it his profeſſion to inſtruct
the publick; and it is the firſt Maxim that an
Hiſtorian ought to propoſe to himſelf. This
being well eſtabliſhed, his thoughts muſt be
bent upon the gaining of Credibility in mens
minds, and to give an Air of Truth to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſays. And to this principally ought
all his Morality to be levell'd, and that the
Hiſtorian will never do but by a ſolid Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62341:67"/>
of his Reputation: and it is not by
Proteſtations of being ſincere that he ſhall
give proofs of his ſincerity; but it is done by
making a diſcovery in all his words of the
ſteddineſs of his Heart, and the unbyaſſable
Integrity of his Sentiments. Accordingly
nothing ought to fall from him, but what
bears the Character of Reaſon and Equity.
The love he ought to have for Truth ſhould
be the rule and ſtandard of all his Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all his <hi>Idea's.</hi> Let him always ſpeak
as a juſt and vertuous man, and never let any
thing ſlip from him which may be injurious to
Modeſty and Integrity. Let him be ſevere
and inflexible in the Sentiments which the
moſt exact conſideration of Honour can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
him withall; and let there never appear
any thing in his words which may occaſion
any diſtruſt of his Candour and Ingenuous

more a Libertine; he treats as fabulous

diſcredit them. And it is alſo by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable

than by his great Accompliſhments;
nay through all the Intrigues, Intereſts, Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

men whom he decyphers, he lets you ſee a
certain thread of Probity, which diſcovers
him to be yet a more honeſt man than a good
Hiſtorian. In the darkeſt receſſes of their
Hearts whom he deſcribes, you may behold
the clearneſs of his own; and amidſt the falſe
Lights which he diſcovers in their Conduct,
he always takes a true proſpect of things him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:

                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> is a man of a quite different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:

acquainted with any but what proceeds from
ſubtilty; and it is rather ſome political Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
than the pure truth that makes him
ſpeak. Beſides the ill thoughts he has of his
Neighbour, whenever he has any occaſion to
ſpeak of the Gods, he makes not any diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Piety or Religion, as may be ſeen in
the Diſcourſes he has upon Deſtiny againſt.

               <p>When therefore an Author takes Pen in

is the way to deſtroy, and not to eſtabliſh;
things ought to be related as they are, ſince
it is ſo much the worſe for the incredulous;
for nothing more misbecomes a man, who
makes it his profeſſion to give the publick
an account of Truth, than thus to profane it.
In ſhort, let there not any thing of Servility
or Meanneſs appear in the Sentiments or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the Hiſtorian; for nothing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
a worſe Opinion of his Fidelity. But
though I do not approve the Flatterers of
great men, ſuch as <hi>Euſebius</hi> was, who will
not have us ſee any thing but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who in the mean
time had great defects; yet is it my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they ought to be indulg'd in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things. For though a man ought to ſay
nothing but what is true, yet all truths are
not to be ſpoken. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> might
have forborn the Infamies he ſpoke of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander;</hi>
there are ſome Heads ſo privileg'd
that they require reſpect; let us therefore
treat them honourably, and not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with any inſolence towards them. We
may relate the Vices of their perſons, but let
us not ſay any thing that may ſcandalize their
Dignity, or abate ought that is due to their
Grandeur. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays ſo many dirty things
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that <hi>Boccalini</hi> cannot endure him
for it. What <hi>Lampridius</hi> relates of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62341:71"/>
Emperours <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> and <hi>Caracalla,</hi> has
made his Hiſtory deſpicable; and <hi>Platina</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
but little judgment in his way of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Popes. All will not be of my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the wiſe will; and it is my perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that how meritorious ſoever it may be for
a man to be ſincere, he would be ridiculous if
he were ſo in all things. But it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
withall, that praiſes are never well
made, becauſe they are not made with the
delicacy that is requiſite; that Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are made upon indifferent paſſages, and
not upon thoſe of which men were more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ſenſible and mov'd thereat; that the
publick is always in an ill humour againſt
Commendations, which it hardly ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds.
The ſecureſt way of Commendation
is, onely to make a ſincere recital of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Actions.<note place="margin">Lucian. de conſcrib. hiſt.</note> All know the Adventure

he ſhould be ſerv'd ſo too, for being ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

of the Morality which I ſhould wiſh in an
Hiſtorian; or at leaſt theſe ſhould be my

for it. In ſhort, I would be modeſt after ſuch

which I have gather'd by the reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians.
I am not ſo vain as to pretend, that I
lay them down for Maxims; they are onely
Conceptions, poſſibly not well digeſted, which
may become good by the good uſe which may

                  <hi>Xenophon</hi> is pure in his Language, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

a freedom and facility of Spirit, a Mind fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

is not always exactly obſerv'd in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,

tells us, that <hi>Scipio</hi> could not give over read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him, who in the greateſt perplexity of his
Affairs paſs'd away whole nights in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

much to write a Hiſtory, as an Inſtruction
for the good Government of a State, as
he declares himſelf at the end of his firſt
Book: and ſo he recedes ſomewhat from the
Character of an Hiſtorian; which obliges
him at the beginning of the ninth Book to
make a kind of Apology for his way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> is a great Character, but

                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> deſcribes things after a way differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from all others, but he confines himſelf
too much to great Affairs, that he may avoid
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62341:76"/>
condefcending to ſmall ones, which yet ought
not to be neglected. He thinks well, but he
is not always happy in expreſſing himſelf
clearly. He plays too much the Philoſopher.
His Deciſions of things are high and daring;
had he the Deſtinies of men in his hands, he
would not ſpeak otherwiſe; and he always
moralizes on the Extravagances of others,
ſparing none, and ſpeaking ill of all Mankind.
How many Minds has he ſpoil'd by the fancy
of ſtudying Politicks, which he inſpires into
ſo many people, and which is the vaineſt Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of all? 'Tis upon this rock that ſo many
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> as <hi>Antonio Perez;</hi> and ſo many

of his Style that this laſt ſo much pleaſes
the higher ſort of Wits, and ſo little thoſe
that affect what is Natural; for by the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Ratiocinations and Reflections he
tires them. He is ſo obſcure in his Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that a man muſt be well exerciſed in his
Style, ere he ſhall be able to unravel his
thoughts. His way of Criticizing is delicate
of it ſelf, but it becomes Ruſtical by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
he has to criticize upon every thing.<note place="margin">Evenit nonnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ut aliquid grande <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo many things to be ſaid upon this Author,

                  <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> is commendable for his

there be any exception to be made againſt his

               <p>This Character of Perfection, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
