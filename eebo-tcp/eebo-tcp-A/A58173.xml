            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT was no Intereſt or Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine, that induced me to dedicate this Diſcourſe to your <hi>Grace.</hi> I am not ſo well
<pb facs="tcp:65250:3"/>
conceited of my own performances, as to think it merits to be inſcribed to ſo great a Name, much leſs that I ſhould oblige your Lordſhip, or indeed a far meaner perſon by ſuch inſcription. My principal motive was, that it would give me opportunity of congratulating with the ſober part of this Nation, your advancement to the Archiepiſcopal Dignity; and of acknowledging His Majeſty's Wiſdom in making choice of ſo fit a Perſon to fill that Chair, endued with all Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons requiſite for ſo high a Calling; ſo able and skilful a Pilot to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church, and ſo prudent and faithful a Counſellor to ſerve himſelf.

Thoſe that are Good and Wiſe are
<pb facs="tcp:65250:4"/>
pleaſed and ſatisfied, when great Men are preferred to great Places; and think it pity that Perſons of large and publick Spirits ſhould be confined to narrow Spheres of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and want field to exerciſe and employ thoſe rich Talents and Abilities wherewith they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, in doing all the Good they are thereby qualified and inclined to do.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>VVERE it not cuſtomary and expected by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this Diſcourſe would need no Preface. All that I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhall be ſomething by way of Apology or Excuſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the two long Digreſſions I have made, the one concerning the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Deluge in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> the other concerning the Primitive <hi>Chaos</hi> and Creation of the World. My firſt Plea is, their Affinity and near Relation to my Subject, The future Diſſolution of the World by fire inviting me to ſay ſomething of the former Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:65250:6"/>
of it by Water. And the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being oppoſite to the formation, I had as good a Pretence to diſcourſe likewiſe concerning that. My ſecond excuſe is, their agreement with my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in being alike matters of Ancient Tradition. Five matters of Ancient Tradition I have taken notice of, and four of them, by reaſon of their now-mentioned Relation one to another I have had a fair and inviting occaſion to treat of in this Work. They are 1. That the World was formed out of a <hi>Chaos</hi> by the Divine Wiſdom and Power. 2. That there was once an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Flood of Waters, in which all Mankind periſhed, excepting ſome few that were ſaved in an Ark or Ship. 3. That the World ſhall one day be diſſolved by Fire. 4. That there is a Heaven and an Hell, a <hi>Tartarus</hi> and an <hi>Elyſium,</hi> and both eternal, the one to reward good men, and the other to puniſh wicked. 5. Of which I have
<pb facs="tcp:65250:6"/>
no occaſion to treat, That Bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are to be offered for the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin. It may be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Traditions among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then had their Original from ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in Scripture, as that of the <hi>Chaos</hi> from the ſecond Verſe of the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> And the Earth was <hi>Tohu vabohu,</hi> which we render <hi>without form and void</hi>; and that of the <hi>Deluge,</hi> from the Hiſtory of it in the ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame; and the future <hi>confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration</hi> from ſeveral paſſages in the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>; or were antecedent to the Scripture: I rather think the latter, becauſe we find them among ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which it's likely never had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ever heard of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For Writing ſo much, for which perchance ſome may cenſure me. I am not ignorant, that men as they are mutable, ſo they love change; and affect variety of Authors, as well
<pb facs="tcp:65250:7"/>
as Books. Satiety even of the beſt things is apt to creep upon us. He that writes much, let him write never ſo well, ſhall experience that his laſt Books, though nothing inferiour to his firſt, will not find equal acceptance. But for mine own part, though in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I may be thought to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten too much; yet is it but little that I have written relating to Divinity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For being too haſty in huddling up and tumbling out Books. Herein I confeſs I cannot acquit my ſelf wholly from blame. I know well, that the longer a Book lies by me, the perfecter it becomes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing occurs every day in reading or thinking, either to add, or to correct and alter for the better; but ſhould I defer the Edition till the Work were abſolutely perfect, I might wait all my life-time, and leave it to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my Executors. But I ſee that Poſthumous Pieces generally prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<pb facs="tcp:65250:7"/>
to thoſe put out by the Authors in their lives. And perchance did the Reader know my Reaſons for this ſpeed, which I think it not fit now to lay open, he would judge them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to excuſe me. However haſty and precipitate I am in writing, my Books are but ſmall, ſo that if they be worthleſs, the Purchaſe is not great, nor the Expence of Time waſted in the peruſal of them very conſiderable. Yet is not the worth of a Book always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its Bulk: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>hing ſtill remains to advertiſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of, that is, that upon ſecond thoughts, I do revoke what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as my Opinion or Suſpicion concerning the Continuance of the Rain at the Time of the Deluge for one hundred and fifty dayes, becauſe it is ſaid the Waters prevailed ſo long
<pb facs="tcp:65250:8"/>
upon the Earth, that is, as I underſtand it, increaſed. I now grant that it laſted but forty natural days; becauſe thoſe words of God to <hi>Noah,</hi> predicting the Continuance of the Rain. Gen. 7.4. <hi>For yet ſeven days and I will cauſe it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem to limit it to that term. So that we muſt ſeek ſome other reaſon for the prevailing of the Water for one hundred and fifty days; which probably might be the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Emotion of the Center of the Earth for ſo long time.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THERE is implanted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man a great deſire and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of fore knowing future Events, what ſhall befal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Relations or Dependents in time to come; the Fates of Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, eſpecially the Periodical Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and final <hi>cataſtrophe</hi> of the World.
<pb facs="tcp:65250:13"/>
Hence in ancient times, Divination was made a Science or Myſtery, and many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had their Colleges or Societies of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Magicians, Aſtrologers and Sooth-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; as for example, the <hi>Egyptians, Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> Hence the vulgar are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prone to conſult Diviners and Fortune-tellers.</p>
            <p>To gratifie in ſome meaſure this Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that his people might not in any privilege be inferiour to the Nations about them, it pleaſed God, beſides the ſtanding Oracle of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> not only upon ſpecial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to raiſe up among the <hi>Jews</hi> extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prophets, by immediate Miſſion; but alſo to ſettle a conſtant Order and Succeſſion of them, for the maintenance and upholding whereof, there were Colleges and Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries inſtituted for the educating and fitting young men for the Prophetick Function. Theſe were the Sons of the Prophets, of whom we find ſo frequent mention in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it pleaſed God ſo far to conde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcend to the weakneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that in the infancy of their State, he permitted them to conſult his Prophets concerning ordinary accidents of life, and affairs of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb facs="tcp:65250:13"/>
As we ſee <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Samuel</hi> about the loſs of his Fathers Aſſes: which it's not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would have done, had it not been uſual and cuſtomary ſo to do. In the latter times of that State, we read of no conſulting of Prophets upon ſuch occaſions. At laſt alſo by their own confeſſion, the Spirit of Prophecy was quite taken away, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left them but a Vocal Oracle, which they called <hi>Bath col, i. e.</hi> the Daughter of a Voice, or the Daughter of Thunder, a Voice out of a Voice. This Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks to have been a meer Fancy or Impoſture.</p>
            <p>In the primitive Churches of Chriſtians planted by the Apoſtles, there was alſo an Order of Prophets, 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. This Spirit of Prophecy was an extraordinary and temporary Gift, as were the Gifts of Healing and Speaking with Tongues, continuing not long after the death of the Apoſtles, and Conſignation of the Canon of Scripture. So that now we have no means left us of coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of future Events, but the Prophecies contained in the Writings of the Holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Scripture, which we muſt ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, conſider attentively, and compare together, if we deſire to underſtand any

            <p>THESE words contain in them two Parts, 1. An Antecedent or Doctrine, <hi>All theſe things ſhall be diſſolved.</hi> 2. A Conſequent, or Inference thereupon, <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe words are by the generality of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, Ancient and Modern, underſtood of the final deſtruction or diſſolution of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth: in which ſenſe I ſhall chuſe rather to accept them at preſent, than with the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and ſome few others, to ſtem the Tide of Expoſitors, and apply them to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Jewiſh Polity.

            <p>That this World and all things therein contained, ſhall one day be diſſolved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Fire.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THen, Let us conſider what we find delivered in the holy Scriptures, concerning the Diſſolution of the World. And firſt of all, This place, which I have made choice of for my Text, is in my opinion the moſt clear and full, as to this particular, in the whole Scripture; and will give light for the Solution of moſt of the propoſed Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. V. 10. <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall come as a thief,</hi> &amp;c. This anſwers the third Queſtion, Whether the Diſſolution ſhall be gradual or ſudden? <hi>Wherein the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo, and all the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> And again, V. 12. <hi>Wherein the Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat.</hi> This anſwers the ſecond Queſtion, What the Means and Inſtruments of this Diſſolution ſhall be? V. 13. <hi>Nevertheleſs

we according to his promiſe, look for a new Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> This gives ſome light toward the anſwering of the laſt Queſtion, Whether ſhall the Heavens and the Earth be wholly burnt up and deſtroyed, or only renewed and purified? Theſe Words as clearly as they ſeem to refer to the Diſſolution of the World, yet Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> doubts not to be underſtood of the remarkable deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, he thus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſing them.</p>

               <p>Looking for and haſtning unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens, being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat.</p>

that he ſhould plant in the Evangelical State.</p>
            <p>How he makes out and confirms this Paraphraſe, ſee in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this place.

            <p>But on the other ſide, 1. Some paſſages there are in this Chapter, which are hardly applicable to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Diſſolution of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; as <hi>the appearing of the Sign of the Son of man in heaven, and the Tribes ſeeing the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And his ſending his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet.</hi> 2. The coming of Chriſt is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſcribed in places which undoubtedly ſpeak of his coming to Judgment at the end of the World. As in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. mention is made of the <hi>Trumpets ſounding</hi> at the time of Chriſt's coming: and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God:</hi> and v. 17. <hi>We that are alive ſhall be caught up together with them</hi> [that are riſen] <hi>in the clouds to meet the Lord in the Air.</hi> All which places are perfectly parallel, and ſeem manifeſtly to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the fore-mentioned words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30, 31. I am apt to think, that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies may have a double reſpect; one to the City, Temple, and Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi>; another to the whole World at the great

Luke 18.17. <hi>I tell you he will avenge them ſpeedily.</hi> All theſe places the fore-mentioned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſtill applies to that famous Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the deſtruction of the City, Temple and Polity of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and in concluſion hath left us but one place in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prove the general Conflagration of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 7.7.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe ſome have been offended at theſe Interpretations of his; others have ſpoken very flightingly of them: I ſhall briefly ſum up what hath been alleged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them, by this great man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Prophets uſe to ſet down their Predictions in Tropes and Figures, and not in plain expreſſions, <hi>(their Style being Poetical).</hi> And therefore in deſcribing thoſe hideous Judgments which fell upon that people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> beyond all that ever before fell upon them, or indeed any other people, they found it neceſſary to employ thoſe High and Tragical Phraſes of the paſſing away and diſſolving Heaven, and Earth, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And that this was the manner of the Prophets, may be proved; becauſe we find the deſtruction of other places deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in as High Strains, as Lofty and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Expreſſions as this of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For example, that of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> Eſay 34.9. <hi>The ſtreams thereof ſhall be turned into pitch, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65250:22"/>
the duſt thereof into brimſtone, and the land thereof ſhall become burning pitch. It ſhall not be quenched night nor day, the ſmoke thereof ſhall go up for ever.</hi> And in the 4th Verſe he ſeems but to Preface to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in theſe words, <hi>And all the hoſt of Heaven ſhall be diſſolved, and the Heavens ſhall be rolled together as a ſcroll: and all their hoſts ſhall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the Vine, and as a falling Fig from the Fig tree; For my Sword ſhall be bathed in Heaven: Behold it ſhall come down upon</hi> Idumaea. And in the Burden of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Chap. 13.8, 9. we have theſe words, <hi>Behold the day of the Lord Cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the Land deſolate: For the Stars of Heaven and the conſtellations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall not give their light: The Sun ſhall be darkened in his going forth, and the Moon ſhall not cauſe her light to ſhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. All the Predictions in that famous place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. to which all other places in the New Teſtament relating to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are parallel, are by our Saviour himſelf reſtrained to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the full completion of them limited to the duration of that Age: Verſe 34. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, This generation ſhall not paſs till all theſe things be fulfilled.</hi> What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then can we have to extend them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65250:22"/>3. In moſt of the places where this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt is mentioned, it is ſpoken of as near, and at hand; as in the places laſt cited. Now, (ſaith the Learned Doctor) in his Note upon <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. <hi>I tell you he will avenge them ſpeedily:</hi> All which if (when it is ſaid to approach and to be at the door) it belonged to the Day of Judgment (now after ſo many hundred years not yet come) what a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were this? what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of his coming? and conſequently, what an Objection againſt the truth of the Chriſtian Religion? As <hi>Mahomet</hi> having promiſed after his death he would preſently return to life, and having not performed his Promiſe in a thouſand years is by us juſtly condemned as an Impoſtor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this place of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> out of which I have taken my Text, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the end of the World ſufficiently appears (ſaith he) by the purport of this whole Epiſtle, which is to arm them with conſtancy and perſeverance till that Day come, and particularly in this Chapter to confute them who object againſt the truth of Chriſts Predictions, and reſolve it ſhould not come at all; againſt whom he here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the certainty, the ſpeedineſs, and the teribleneſs of its Coming. And for that other famous Place, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1.8, 9. that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65250:23"/>
it belongs to the ſame Period; ſee how he makes out in his Annotations.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſuperadd ſome places out of the Old Teſtament, which ſeem to ſpeak of the Diſſolution of the World, <hi>Job</hi> 14.12. <hi>Man lieth down and riſeth not till the Heavens be no more.</hi> Pſalm 102.5, 6. quoted <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Of old haſt thou laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of thy hands. They ſhall periſh but thou remaineſt; and they all ſhall wax old as doth a garment, and as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed.</hi> Eſay 34.4. <hi>And all the hoſt of Heaven ſhall be diſſolved, and the Heavens ſhall be rolled together as a ſcroll, and all their hoſt ſhall fall down as a leaf falleth from the Vine,</hi> &amp;c. Eſay 51.6. <hi>The Heavens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke, and the Earth ſhall wax old like a garment.</hi> Joel 2.31. <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Moon into blood, before that great and terrible day of the Lord comes.</hi> Malachi 4.1. <hi>Behold the day cometh that ſhall burn like an Oven,</hi> &amp;c. Deut 32, 22. <hi>For a fire is kindled in my anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the Earth with her encreaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the Mountains.</hi> I muſt confeſs that the Prophetick Books are full of figurative Expreſſions, being written in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65250:23"/>
a Poetick Style, and according to the ſtrain of the Oriental Rhetorick, which is much different from the <hi>Euporean,</hi> affecting lofty and turned Metaphors and exceſſive <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola</hi>'s and Aggravations, which would either ſound harſh to our Ears, or import a great deal more to us than they did to them. This is obvious to any one that reads their Books; and may clearly be demonſtrated from the Titles that their Kings aſſumed to themſelves as well Anciently as lately, <hi>viz. Sons of the Sun, Brethren of the Sun and Moon, Partners of the Stars, Lions Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Throne of the World, Endued with the ſtrength of the whole Heaven, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Firmament.</hi> Now we cannot poſſibly imagine them ſo vain as to think themſelves literally to be ſuch: no ſure, all they meant by theſe Expreſſions was that they were great, and honourable, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Now the Prophetick Books of the Old Teſtament being written in a Style ſomewhat conformable to the Oratory of thoſe Countreys, are not (I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) in every tittle to be ſo exactly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and literally expounded, but ſo to be interpreted as a <hi>Jew</hi> or an <hi>Aſiatick</hi> would then have underſtood them. And this I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think, becauſe there be divers paſſages in the Prophets, which cannot be verified in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65250:24"/>
ſtrict literal ſenſe; As in the place before quoted, <hi>Eſay</hi> 34.9. It is ſaid of the <hi>ſtreams of</hi> Idumaea <hi>that ſhould be turned into Pitch, and the duſt thereof into Brimſtone; and the Land thereof ſhould become burning Pitch; and ſhould not be quenched night nor day, but the ſmoke thereof ſhould go up for ever.</hi> And of the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> it is ſaid <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.14. <hi>It ſhall be built no more.</hi> And <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>When I ſhall make thee a deſolate City like the Cities that are not inhabited, when I ſhall bring up the Deep upon thee, and great waters ſhall cover thee.</hi> And <hi>verſe</hi> 21. which is thrice repeated, <hi>I will make thee a terror, and thou ſhalt be no more: though thou be ſought for, thou ſhalt never be found again, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> And yet we ſee that the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> though it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wholly diſpeopled at that time, the Inhabitants transferring themſelves into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> when it was beſieged by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>; yet was it afterward peopled again, and continues a City inhabited to this day. And of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>there ſhould none remain in it, neither man nor beaſt, but that it ſhould be deſolate for ever.</hi> Jer. 51.62. Eſay 13.20. and of the Land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Verſe 29. that <hi>it ſhould be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation without an Inhabitant.</hi> And though indeed this Propheſy was I think as to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65250:24"/>
the City at laſt verified in the Letter; yet did <hi>Babylon</hi> long continue a great City af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Paraphraſe: And the Land of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> is now inhabited, there being at this day a great City not far from the place where <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtood. So that theſe places import no more, then that there ſhould be a very great Deſtruction and Devaſtation of thoſe Cities and Countries. As for thoſe places in the Old and New Teſtament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mention is made of the laſt Days and the laſt Times, it is clear that they are to be underſtood of the Age of the Meſſiah, all the time from the Exibition of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to the end of the World, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, that the Mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the Mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall flow to it</hi>; which very words we have repeated <hi>Michah</hi> 4.1. So that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. quoted <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days ſaith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. is to be underſtood. Hence the <hi>laſt Days</hi> have among the <hi>Jews</hi> proverbially ſignified the days of the Meſſiah, as <hi>Doctor Hammon</hi> in his Annotations upon this place tells us; who alſo Notes, that in that place of <hi>Joel, the laſt days</hi> do literally ſignifie

near an hundred foot depth, they met with a bed or floor of Sand and Cockle-ſhells; whence it is evident, one would think, that of old time the bottom of the Sea lay ſo deep, and that that hundred foot thickneſs of Earth above the Sand, aroſe from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Waters of thoſe great Rivers, the <hi>Rhine, Scheld, Maes, &amp;c.</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts emptied themſelves into the Sea, and in times of Floods brought down with them abundance of Earth from the upper grounds. The ſame Original doubtleſs had that great Level of the Fens, running through the Iſle of <hi>Ely, Holland</hi> in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Marſhland</hi> in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> That there hath been no ſmall quantity of Earth thus brought down, appears alſo in that along the Channels of moſt great Rivers, as for example, the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially near their Mouths or Out-lets, between the Mountains and higher grounds on each ſide, there are large Levels and Plains; which ſeem to have been originally part of the Sea, raiſed up, and atterrated by Earth and Silt brought down by thoſe Rivers in great Floods.</p>
               <p>Now the Rain thus continually waſhing away, and carrying down Earth from the Mountains and higher Grounds, and raiſing up the Vallies near the Sea, as long as there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65250:38"/>
is any deſcent for the Rivers, ſo long will they continue to run, carry forward the low ground, and ſtreighten the Sea, which alſo by its working, by reaſon of the declivity, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily carries down the Earth towards the lower and middle part of its Channel <hi>[alveus]</hi> and by degrees may fill it up. Moreover, the Clouds ſtill pouring down Rain upon the Earth, it will deſcend as far as there is any declivity; and where that fails, it will ſtagnate, and joyning with Sea, cover firſt the skirts of the Earth, and ſo by degrees higher and higher, till the Whole be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>To this we may add, that ſome aſſiſtance toward the levelling of the Mountains, may be contributed by the Courſes and Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts of ſubterraneous Rivers waſhing away the Earth continually, and weakning their foundations, ſo by degrees cauſing them to founder, ſubſide, and fall in. That the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains do daily diminiſh, and many of them ſink; that the Vallies are raiſed; that the Skirts of the Sea are atterrated, no man can deny. That theſe things muſt needs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time have a very conſiderable and great effect, is as evident; which what elſe can it be, then that we have mentioned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varenius</hi> in his Geography putting the Queſtion, Whether the Ocean may again
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65250:38"/>
come to cover all the Earth, and make an Univerſal Deluge; anſwers, That we may conceive a way how this may naturally come to paſs. The manner thus, Suppoſing that the Sea by its continual working doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine and waſh away the Shores and Cliffs that are not rocky, and carry the Earth thereof down towards the middle, or deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts of its Channel, and ſo by degrees fill it up. By doing this perpetually, it may, in a long ſucceſſion of Time, carry all away, and it ſelf cover the whole Earth. That it doth thus ſubvert and waſh away the Shores in many places is in experience true. About <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Dullart</hi> in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and in <hi>Zealand</hi> many Villages, ſome ſay Three Hundred, have been drown'd by the encroachments of the Sea, as ſome of their Towers and Steeples ſtill extant above the Waters do teſtifie. On the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Shore, <hi>Kircher</hi> tell us, that not far from <hi>Ligorn</hi> he himſelf had obſerved a whole City under Water, that had been in former times drown'd by the Inundation of the Sea. And over againſt <hi>Puteoli</hi> in the <hi>Sinus</hi> of <hi>Baia,</hi> he tells us, that in the bottom of the Sea, there are not only Houſes, but the traces and footſteps of the Streets of ſome City mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly diſcernable. And in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> almoſt the whole Town of <hi>Donewick,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65250:39"/>
with the adjacent Lands, hath been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and devoured by the Sea.</p>
               <p>This waſhing away of the Shores is, I conceive, in great meaſure to be attributed to the fore-mentioned ſtreightning and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhort of the Sea, by the Earth and Silt that in the times of Floods are brought down into it by the Rivers. For the Vulgar have a Proverbial Tradition, <hi>That what the Sea loſes in one place, it gains in another.</hi> And both together do very handſomly make out and explain, how the Earth in a Natural way, may be reduced to its primitive ſtate in the Creation, when the Waters covered the Land. But this according to the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely proceedings of Nature, would not come to paſs in many Ages, I might ſay, in Ages of Ages: Nay, ſome think, that thoſe vaſt Ridges and Chains of Mountains, which run through the middle of the Continents are by reaſon of their great height, weight and ſolidity, too great a Morſel ever to be devoured by the Jaws of the Sea. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be or not, I need not diſpute though I incline to the Negative, becauſe this is not the diſſolution the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, which muſt be by Fire.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not here diſſemble an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I ſee may be made, and that is, That the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth is ſo far from being
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65250:39"/>
depreſſed, that it is continually elevated. For in ancient Buildings, we ſee the Earth raiſed high above the foot of them. So the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was at firſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up to by many [eight] Steps, is now deſcended down to by as many. The Baſis and whole Pedeſtal of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar there was buryed in the Earth.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Tancred Robinſon</hi> in the year 1683. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in ſome places, the Walls of old <hi>Rome,</hi> to lye Thirty and Forty Foot under ground; ſo that he thinks the greateſt part of the Remains of that Famous Ancient City is ſtill buried, and undiſcovered; the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heaps of Ruines and Rubbiſh incloſed within the Vineyards and Gardens being not half dig'd up or ſearch't, as they might be, the tops of Pillars peeping up and down. And in our own Country we find many Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Pavements at ſome depth under ground. My Learned and Ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Edward Lloyd,</hi> not long ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of one, that himſelf had ſeen buried deep in the Church-yard at <hi>Wycheſter</hi> in <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire.</hi> Nay, the Earth in time will grow over and bury the Bodies of great Timber Trees, that have been fallen, and lye long upon it.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, As to Buildings, 1. The Ruines and Rubbiſh of the Cities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

in they ſtood, might be conceived to bury them as deep as they now lye under ground. And by this means it's likely the <hi>Roman</hi> Pavements we find, might come to be covered to that height we mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that the places where they occur, were anciently <hi>Roman</hi> Towns ſubverted and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, may eaſily be proved; as particularly in this we mention'd, from the Termination <hi>Cheſter</hi>; whatever Town or Village hath that addition to its Name having been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently a <hi>Roman</hi> Town or Camp: <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſeeming to be nothing but <hi>Caſtra.</hi>

                  <p>Howbeit I do not deny, that there was ſuch a particular Flood in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> as they call <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s, which happened Seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Seventy Years or thereabouts after the general Deluge. I acknowledge alſo a more ancient Flood in <hi>Attica</hi> in the time of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> about Two Hundred and Thirty Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s, by which the Countrey was ſo marred, that it lay waſte and uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without Inhabitants for almoſt Two Hundred Years.</p>
                  <p>Other particular Deluges, and Irruptions, or Inundations of the Seas, beſides theſe, we read of in Hiſtories; which I ſhall not ſtand to enumerate. He that deſires an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, may conſult Sr. <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Hiſtory of the World, <hi>p.</hi> 89. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Conſideration of them may be of uſe to us, when we ſhall come to treat of the Effects of the Flood upon the Earth. So I diſmiſs this firſt particular, and proceed to the ſecond: What were the inſtrumental Cauſes or Means of the Flood? Whether was it effected by natural or ſupernatural Means only? Whether was God no further concerned in it, than in ſo ordering ſecond
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65250:46"/>
Cauſes at firſt, as of themſelves neceſſarily to bring it in at ſuch a time?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe that hold this Deluge was altogether miraculous, and that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty created Waters on purpoſe to ſerve this occaſion, and when they had done their work deſtroyed them again, diſpatch the Buſineſs, and looſe or cut the Knot in a few words. And yet this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is not ſo abſurd and precarious, as at firſt ſight it may ſeem to be. For the World being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready full, there needed not, nor indeed could be any Creation of Water out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but only a Tranſmutation of ſome other body into Water. Now if we grant all natural Bodies, even the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be mutually tranſmutable, as few men doubt, and ſome think they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; why might not the Divine Power and Providence bring together at that time ſuch natural Agents, as might change the Air or <hi>Aether,</hi> or both together into Water; and ſo ſupply what was wanting in Rains, and extraordinary Eruptions of Springs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To them that argue the Improbability o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture aſſigning the Cauſes or Means of the Inundation, makes no mention of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Air into Water, but only of the breaking up the Fountains of the Great Deep, and the opening of the Windows of Heaven, I ſuppoſe thoſe Cauſes may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to work the Effect, and that we need not have recourſe to ſuch an Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe that make the Deluge Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and reſtrain it to a narrow compaſs of Land; their Opinion is I think ſufficiently confuted by the fore-mentioned ingenious Author, to whom therefore I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not undertake the Defence or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of any other <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> only tell you which at preſent ſeems to me moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and that is theirs, who for a partial cauſe of the Deluge, aſſign either a change of the Center of the Earth, or a violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

of the Surface of the Ocean, and a forcing the Waters up from the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abyſſe through the Channels of the Fountains that were then broken up and opened.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, let us conſider what Cauſes the Scripture aſſigns of the Flood; and they are two: 1. The breaking up the Fountains of the great Deep: 2. The opening of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Heaven. I ſhall firſt treat of this laſt. By the opening of the Windows of Heaven, is (I ſuppoſe) to be underſtood the cauſing of all the Water that was ſuſpended in the Air to deſcend down in Rain upon the Earth; the effect hereof here mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long continuing Rain of Forty, nay, perchance One Hundred and Fifty Days. And that theſe Treaſuries of the Air will afford no ſmall quantity of Water, may be made appear, both by Scripture and Reaſon. 1. By Scripture, which oppoſes the Waters that are above the Heavens or Firmament, to thoſe that are under them; which if they were not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and in ſome meaſure equal, it would never do. Gen. 1.6. <hi>God is</hi> ſaid <hi>to make a Firmament in the midſt of the Waters, and to divide the Waters which were under the Firmament, from the Waters which were above the Firmament.</hi> And this was the work of a whole day, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65250:48"/>
no inconſiderable thing. By the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens or Firmament in this place, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the inferiour Region of the Air, wherein the Fowls fly: who <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20. are ſaid to <hi>fly above the Earth, in the open Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Heaven</hi>; though elſewhere it be taken for the Celeſtial Regions, wherein the Sun, and Moon, and Stars are placed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame may be made appear, by Reaſon grounded upon Experience. I my ſelf have obſerved a Thunder-Cloud in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to have in leſs than two hours ſpace powred down ſo much Water upon the Earth, as beſides what ſunk into the parched and thirſty ground, and filled all Ditches and Ponds, cauſed a conſiderable Flood in the Rivers, ſetting all the Meadows on flote.

Now it is to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65250:48"/>
be conſidered, that not only the Air above the Dry Land, but alſo all that covers the whole Ocean, is charged with Vapours, which are nothing elſe but diffuſed Water: all which was brought together by Winds, or what other Means ſeem'd good to God, and cauſed to diſtil down in Rain upon the Earth. And you may eaſily gueſs that it was no ſmall quantity of Water that was ſupplyed this way, in that it ſufficed for a Rain that laſted more than Forty Days, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, if I underſtand the Text a right. And that no ordinary Rain neither, but Catarracts or Spouts of Water; for ſo the <hi>Septuagint</hi> interprets the words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I return now to the firſt Cauſe or Means of the <hi>Deluge</hi> aſſigned by the Scripture, and that is the <hi>breaking up of all the fountains of the great Deep.</hi> By the <hi>great Deep</hi> in this place, I ſuppoſe, is to be underſtood the Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Waters, which do and muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily communicate with the Sea. For we ſee, that the <hi>Caſpian</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, to mention no others, receive into themſelves many and great Rivers, and yet have no viſible Out-lets; nay, this latter, receives alſo abundance of Waters from the great
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65250:49"/>
Ocean, running in at the Streights of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar:</hi> and therefore by Subterraneous Paſſages, muſt needs diſcharge their Waters into the Abyſs of Waters under the Earth, and by its intervention into the Ocean again. By the breaking up of the Fountains of the <hi>Great Deep,</hi> is I conceive meant, the making great Iſſues and Apertures for theſe Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Waters to ruſh out. You will ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how could that be, ſith the Water keeps its level, and cannot aſcend to a greater height above the common Center, than the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Sea is, much leſs force its way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remove Obſtacles, and break open Paſſages?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, According to them that hold that all Rivers come from the Sea by Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Paſſages, it is no more than daily happens. For they muſt needs grant, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, that Rain affords no ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, is clear alſo from great Floods, wherein it might be proved, that in few days there deſcends more Water than would ſupply the ordinary Stream for a good part of Summer. Now to compare great things with ſmall: I have ſeen many of the biggeſt Rivers in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Danow, Rhine, Rhoſne</hi> and <hi>Po</hi>; and when I conſider the length of their courſes, the multitude of conſiderable Rivers and Brooks they receive; and all theſe from their firſt riſe, made up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by little Rivulets and Gills, like my neighbouring Brook; the huge Mountains and vaſt extent of higher Grounds they drain: To me it ſeems (and I have ſeen all their Streams near their Out-lets, except the <hi>Danows,</hi> and it's after Four Hundred Miles deſcent) that they do not bear any greater proportion to the Rivers and Rivulets they receive, and the immenſe Tracts of Land that feed them, than my Brook doth to its ſmall Rills and compaſs of Ground.</p>
                  <p>But in this, I confeſs, I do not deſcend to the niceneſs of Meaſuring and Calculation, but ſatisfie my ſelf with rude conjectures, taking my meaſures, as the <hi>Ceſtrians</hi> ſay, by the Scale of the Eye.</p>

1648. when there were many of them: —and to our purpoſe very remarkable it was, that in the 1654. ſeveral Springs and Rivulets were quite dryed up, by reaſon of the precedent Drought, which raged moſt in 1651, 1652, and 1653. As the Head of the <hi>Stour,</hi> that riſes near <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and runs through <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was dry for ſome Miles ſpace: and the like happened to the Stream that croſſeth the Road-way between <hi>Sittingburn</hi> and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> at <hi>Oſpring</hi> near <hi>Feverſham,</hi> which at other times ran with a plentiful current, but then wholly failed:</q> So we ſee that it is not infrequent for new Springs to break out in wet years; and for old ones to fail in great Droughts.</p>
                  <p>I cannot alſo here forbear to add, the probable account he gives of the Supply of the Spring-well on the Caſtle-hill at <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>; at which, I confeſs, I was ſomewhat puzzled.
<q>This Well, ſaith he, though it be upon the top of the Rock, not many Yards deep, and alſo upon the edge of the Cliff, is doubtleſs ſupplied by ſecret Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels within the ground, that convey the Rain and Showers into it, being placed on a dependent part of the Rock, near unto which there are alſo Cellars under an old ruinated Chappel, which after a great Rain

Cubical Paces of Water. Whence a late Learned Writer hath probably inferred, that all the Rivers in the World together, do daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge half an Ocean of Waters into the Sea, I muſt confeſs my ſelf to be unſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. I will not queſtion their Calculations, but I ſuſpect they are out in their <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Opinion of Mr. <hi>Edmund Halley,</hi> that Springs and Rivers owe their Original to Vapours condenſed on the ſides of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, rather than unto Rains, I acknowledge to be very ingenious, grounded upon good Obſervations, and worthy of its Author; and I will not deny it to be in part true in thoſe hot Countreys in the Torrid Zone, and near it; where, by reaſon of the great heats, the Vapours are more copiouſly exhaled out of the Earth, and its likely carryed up high in the form of Vapours. The inferiour Air at leaſt is ſo charged with them, and by that means ſo very moiſt, that in ſome places
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65250:55"/>
their Knives ruſt even in their Pockets; and in the Night, ſo very freſh and cold, partly alſo by reaſon of the length of the Nights; that expoſing the Body to it, cauſes Colds and Catarrhs, and is very dangerous: Whence alſo their Dews are ſo great, as in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to recompence the want of Rain, and ſerve for the nouriſhment of Plants; as they do even in <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall firſt of all propoſe this Opinion in the Words of the Author, and then diſcourſe a little upon it. After he had enumerated many of the high Ridges and Tracts of Mountains in the four Quarters of the World, he thus proceeds:
<q>Each of which far ſurpaſs the uſual height to which the Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vapours of themſelves aſcend, and on the tops of which the Air is ſo cold and rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as to retain but a ſmall part of thoſe Vapours that ſhall be brought thither by the Winds.</q>
Thoſe Vapours therefore that are raiſed copiouſly in the Sea, and by the Winds are carried over the Low Lands to thoſe Ridges of Mountains, are there compelled by the Stream of the Air, to mount up with it to the tops of the Mountains, where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſently precipitates, gleeting down by the Crannies of the Stone; and part of the Vapour entring into the Cavities of the Hills, the Water thereof gathers, as in an

from thence: I think it will be granted that ordinarily <hi>(communibus annis)</hi> the Rain that falls in a whole year amounts not to above one quarters continual Rain. Now if this ſuffices for a daily effuſion of half an Ocean, it is clear, that if it ſhould rain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermiſſion all the year round, the Rivers would pour out two Oceans into the Sea daily. And ſo in forty days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Rain there would diſtil down upon the Earth eighty Oceans of Water. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious quantity indeed and ſcarce credible, which if the Water be carried off as faſt as it comes on, infers a Circulation of a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water equal to the whole Ocean twice in twenty four hours. Suppoſing then thar ſo much Water daily deſcends upon the Earth, I argue thus, The Water falling upon the Earth muſt have ſome time to run down to the Sea, and according to the ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity of the Continent, (ſuppoſe the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains pared off and the Land levelled) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable one too: and we ſee it actually hath, ſo that the Floods in great Rivers follow ſome days after the falls of Rain upon the higher grounds. And ſo tho at the time of the general Deluge the Waters haſtned down to the Sea as faſt as the declivity of the Earth would permit, yet they breaking out of the Fountains of the Abyſs, and falling down
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65250:62"/>
from the Clouds abundantly faſter than they could run down the gentle declivity of the Earth, it deſerves to be conſidered whether by the end of forty days there might not have been water enough amaſſed to cover the Mountains fifteen Cubits high. And yet rhe Scripture doth not in plain terms ſay, that ever the waters of the Flood aroſe fifteen C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, to me it doth not ſeem clearly to limit the time of the Rains deſcent to forty days: but it may import that the Rain had continued ſo long before the Ark was lifted up above the Earth; and that it ceaſed not till one hundred and fifty days were over: for ſo long the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſaid to have prevailed upon the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.24. that is continued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; whereas had the Rain ceaſed, and the Fountains been ſtopped at forty day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65250:62"/>
the Sea, ſtraitning it into Channels, obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its paſſage, and forcing it to take Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, till it got above the Ridges and tops of them.</p>
                  <p>As to this Argumentation and Inference the caſe is the ſame, if we hold that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter circulates through the Veins of the Earth. For ſuppoſing the Rivers pour forth half an Ocean daily, and granting that in times of Floods their Streams are but double of their uſual Currents (though I verily believe they are more than quadruple) and that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of the Fountains be in like meaſure augmented, it will follow that the daily diſcharge of the Rivers will amount to two Oceans. Now at the time of the general Deluge both theſe Cauſes concurred. For there being a conſtant Rain of forty eight days, there muſt on that account be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Flood, and the Fountains of the great Deep being broken up, they muſt in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood afford as much Water as the Rain: which whither it would not ſuffice in forty natural days to produce a Flood as big as that of <hi>Noah,</hi> notwithſtanding the continual deſcent and going off of the Waters, I propoſe to the conſideration of the Ingenious. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if we allow, as is not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Divine Providence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65250:63"/>
might not firſt cauſe a contrary Wind to ſtop and inhibit the deſcent of the Waters, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he raiſed an aſſiſting one to carry them off.</p>
                  <p>I have but one thing more to add upon this Subject, that is, that I do not ſee how their Opinion can be true, who hold that ſome Seas are lower than others, as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the <hi>Red Sea</hi> than the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> For it being true that the Water keeps its level, that is, holds its ſuperfices every where equidiſtant from the Center of Gravity; or if by accident one part be lower, the reſt by reaſon of their fluidity will ſpeedily reduce the ſuperficies again to an equality. The waters of all Seas communicating either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, or under ground, or both ways, one Sea cannot be higher or lower than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but ſuppoſing any accident ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate or depreſs any, by reaſon of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or communication it would ſoon be reduced to a level again, as might demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively be proved.</p>
                  <p>But I return, to tell the Reader what I think the moſt probable of all the Cauſes I have heard aſſigned of the Deluge, which is, the Center of the Earth being at that time changed, and ſet nearer to the Cente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Atlantick</hi> &amp; <hi>Pacifick</hi> Oceans muſt needs preſs upon the Subterraneous Abyſs, and ſo, by mediation thereof, force the Water upward, and at laſt compell it to run out at thoſe wide mouths and apertures made by the Divine Power breaking up the Fountains of the great Deep. And we may ſuppoſe this to have been only a gentle and gradual Emotion, no faſter than that the Waters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out at the bottom of the Sea, might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly lowre the Superficies thereof ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, ſo that none needed run over the Shores. Theſe Waters thus powred out from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Fountains upon the Earth, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity being changed by the removal of the Center, could not flow down to the Sea again, but muſt needs ſtagnate upon the Earth, and overflow it; and afterwards the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to its old Center, return alſo to their former Receptacles.</p>

                     </gap> way of ſolving this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> and that is, by ſuppoſing that the Divine Power might at that time, by the inſtrumentality of ſome natural Agent, to us at preſent unknown, ſo depreſs the Surface of the Ocean, as to force the Waters of the Abyſs through the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Channels and Apertures, and ſo make them a partial and concurrent Cauſe of the Deluge.</p>
                  <p>That there are at ſome times in the courſe of Nature extraordinary preſſures upon the Surface of the Sea, which force the Water outwards upon the Shores to a great height is evident. We had upon our Coaſts the laſt year an extraordinary Tide, wherein the Water roſe ſo high, as to overflow all the Sea-banks, drown multitudes of Cattel, and fill the lower Rooms of the Houſes of many Villages that ſtood near the Sea, ſo that the Inhabitants, to ſave themſelves, were forced to get up into the upper Rooms and Garrets
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65250:64"/>
of their Houſes. Now how this could be effected, but by an unuſual preſſure upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Ocean, I cannot well conceive. In like manner that the Divine Providence might at the time of the Deluge ſo order and diſpoſe ſecond Cauſes, as to make ſo ſtrong a preſſure upon the face of the Waters, as to force them up to a height ſufficient to overflow the Earth, is no way unreaſonable to believe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> I propoſe, as ſeeming to me at preſent moſt facile and conſonant to Scripture, without any concern for either of them; and therefore am not folicitous to gather together, and heap up Arguments to confirm them, or to anſwer Objections that may be made againſt them, being as ready to relinquiſh them upon better information, as I was to admit and entertain them.</p>

And if the very inſpection of theſe Bodies, is not enough to convince any man, that they are no Stones, but real Teeth and Bones, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Columna</hi> proves it by ſeveral ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 1. Thoſe things which have a woody, bony or fleſhy nature, by burning are changed firſt into a Coal, before they go into a <hi>Calx</hi> or Aſhes: but thoſe which are of a tophaceous or ſtony ſubſtance, go not firſt into a Coal, but burn immediately into a <hi>Calx</hi> or Lime, unleſs by ſome vitreous or metallick mixture they be melted. Now theſe Teeth being burnt, paſs preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Coal, but the tophous ſubſtance adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them, doth not ſo; whence it is clear, that they are of an oſſeous, and no ſtony nature.</p>

buried in that tophous Earth, they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the Jaws of the Animal in thoſe volutations, and ſo in that manner mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated. Another Argument to prove them to be true Teeth and no Stones, he brings from their various parts and figures, which muſt elſe have been ſo wrought and formed in vain. The Tooth being not one homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Body, but compounded of parts of a different conſtitution, there muſt in the formation of it be made a various election of humors, one for the Root, one for the Inner Part, one for the Superficies of it. Then for the Figures, Magnitude, Situation or Poſture, and fitting of them; ſome are great, and broad, and almoſt triangular; others narrower and ſmaller, others very ſmall and narrow, of a pyramidal figure, ſome ſtreight, ſome crooked, bending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or toward the nether ſide, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining toward the left, others toward the right ſide: ſome ſerrate with ſmall Teeth, others with great Indentures (which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the leſſer triangular ones) ſome ſmooth without any Teeth, as the narrow pyramidal ones. All which things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Shark</hi>'s Teeth, not only by the Learned Naturaliſts, but alſo by Fiſher-men and Mariners. The firſt row of Teeth in theſe Animals hanging out of the mouth,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65250:71"/>
bend forward and downward; the ſecond row are ſtreight, eſpecially toward the ſides of the mouth, where they are triangular and broad, the other rows bend downward toward the inner part of the mouth. Thus far <note n="*" place="margin">Diſſert. De Gloſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petra.</note>

                  <p>Fourthly, If theſe formed Stones be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed original Productions of Nature, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Shells and Bones, how comes it to paſs, that there ſhould be none found, that reſemble any other natural Body, but the Shells and Bones of Fiſhes only?

As for ſuch that do not reſemble any part of a Fiſh, they are either Rock Plants, as the <hi>Aſtroites, Aſteriae tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites, &amp;c.</hi> or do ſhoot into that form, after the manner of Salts and Fluors, as the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnites</hi> and <hi>Selenites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Thoſe that deny theſe Bodies to have been the Shells and Bones of Fiſhes,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65250:71"/>
have given us no ſatisfactory account of the manner of their Production. For that they do not ſhoot into that form after the manner of Salts, may be proved by many Arguments. Firſt, All Salts that ſhoot their Cryſtals or Concretions, are of one uniform ſubſtance, and their Figures are more ſimple, and may be owing to the Figure of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whereof they are compounded: in other Bodies that ſhoot, as the <hi>Pyrites</hi> and <hi>Belemnites,</hi> one may obſerve ſtreight <hi>Radii</hi> or Fibres proceeding from one Center. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Did thoſe Bodies ſhoot into theſe Figures after the manner of Salts, it ſeems ſtrange to me, that two Shells ſhould be ſo adapted together at the heel, as to ſhoot out to the ſame extenſion round, and the upper and nether Valve be of different Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, as in natural Shells. Thirdly, Were theſe Bodies produced in the manner of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Concretions, it's ſtrange there ſhould be ſuch varieties of them, and their Shapes ſo regular, and exactly circumſcribed: ſo great a diverſity of Figures, arguing a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Salts, or of their modifications and mixtures, than are likely to be found in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the Curvilineous Concretions of Salts never, that I have yet ſeen, appearing in that regularity of Figure and due Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription, as in theſe Bodies: which is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65250:72"/>
an Argument of the Government of ſome Principle, ſuperior to Matter figured and moved, in their Formations.</p>
                  <p>4ly, Were theſe Bodies nothing but Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Salts or ſaline mixtures, it ſeems no leſs ſtrange, that ſo many Liquors impregnated with all ſorts of Salts and Mineral Juices, in all proportions, having been at one time or other induſtriouſly or accidentally expoſed to cryſtallize, and let ſtand long in Veſſels, there ſhould never have been found in them any ſuch Concretions. For if any had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, we ſhould doubtleſs have heard of them, and the Obſervers would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſuch an Experiment to the Production of the like Bodies at their pleaſure. So I have finiſhed what I have to alledge in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the latter part, That theſe formed Stones, were ſometimes the real Shells or Bones of Fiſhes, I mean the figured part of them.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to ſet down, what may be objected againſt this Opinion, or offered in aſſertion of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Bodies are primitive Productions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in imitation of the Shells and Bones of Fiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the former Opinion we have been pleading for, it may be objected, That there follow ſuch ſtrange and ſeemingly abſurd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65250:72"/>
Conſequences from it, as are hardly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to Scripture, or indeed to ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Waters muſt have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole Earth, even the higheſt Mountains, and that for a long time, there being found of theſe Shells, not only in the moſt mountainous parts of our Countrey, but in the higheſt Mountains in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Appennine</hi> and <hi>Alps</hi> themſelves, and that not only ſcattered, but amaſſed in great lumps, and lying thick in Beds of Sand, as we have before ſhewn. Now this could hardly be the effect of a ſhort Deluge, which if it had carried any Shell fiſh ſo high, would in all likelihood have ſcattered them very thin. Theſe Beds and Lumps of them neceſſarily inferring, that they muſt have bred there, which is a work of time.</p>
                  <p>Now the general Deluge laſted in the whole, but ten Months; and it's not likely the Tops of the Mountains were covered half that time. Neither is it leſs repugnant to Reaſon than Scripture; for if the Waters ſtood ſo high above the Earth, for ſo long a time, they muſt by reaſon of their Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be raiſed as high above the Sea too. But what is now become of this huge Maſs of Waters, equal to ſix or ſeven Oceans? May not the Stoicks here ſet in, and help us
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65250:73"/>
out at a dead lift? The Sun and Moon, ſay they, might poſſibly ſup it all up. Yea, but we cannot allow time enough for that; for according to the moderate Draughts they take now a-days, one Ocean would ſuffice to water them many Ages, unleſs perchance when they were young and hot, they might need more drink. But to be ſerious, I have no way to anſwer this Objection, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, that there are any Beds or great Lumps and Maſſes of theſe formed Stones to be found near the Tops of the <hi>Alps,</hi> or other high Mountains; but yet there might be ſome particular Shells ſcattered there by the general Deluge. Another thing there is as difficult to give an account off, as of the Shells getting up to the Tops of Mountains: that is, of thoſe ſeveral Beds or Floors of Earth and Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one above another, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in broken Mountains. For one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily imagine, whence theſe Floors o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Beds in the manner of <hi>Strata ſuper ſtrata</hi> (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) ſhould come, but from the Sediments of great Floods, which how or whence, they could bring ſo great a quantity of Earth down, when there was but little Land above the Sea, I cannot ſee. And one would likewiſe be apt to think, that ſuch a Bed of Sands, with plenty of Cockle-ſhells intermixt, as we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65250:73"/>
in the Mountain near <hi>Bononia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> muſt have been ſometimes the Bottom of the Sea. But before one can give a right judgment of theſe things, one muſt view the Mountains where ſuch Layers and Beds of Earth and Shells are found: for perchance they may not be elevated ſo high above the preſent Surface of the Sea, as one would judge by the deſcriptions of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It would hence follow, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Species of Shell-fiſh are loſt out of the World, which Philoſophers hitherto have been unwilling to admit, eſteeming the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any one Species a diſmembring of the Univerſe, and rendring it imperfect: whereas they think the Divine Providence is eſpecially concerned to ſecure and preſerve the Works of the Creation: and that it is ſo, appears, in that it was ſo careful to lodge all Land-Animals in the Ark at the time of the general Deluge. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is proved in that, Among theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Shells, there are many ſorts obſerved, which are not at this day, that we know of, any where to be found. Such are a whole <hi>genus</hi> of <hi>Cornua Ammonis,</hi> which ſome have ſuppoſed to be <hi>Nautili,</hi> though to me they do not ſeem ſo to be, but a different <hi>Genus</hi> by themſelves, of which there have not any been ſeen either caſt a ſhore, or raked
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65250:74"/>
out of the Sea, at any time, that ever I heard of. Nay, my very Learned and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friend Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> proceeds further, and ſaith, That when he particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shores for Shells, as alſo the Freſh Waters and the Fields, that he did never meet with any one of thoſe <hi>Species</hi> of Shells found at- <hi>Adderton</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Wansford</hi> bridge in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> and about <hi>Gunthorp</hi> and <hi>Beauvoir</hi>-Caſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any where elſe, but in their reſpective Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. What can we ſay to this? Why it is poſſible that many ſorts of Shell-Fiſh may be lodged ſo deep in the Seas, or on Rocks ſo remote from the Shores, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to our ſight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It follows alſo, that there have been Shell fiſh in theſe cold Northern Seas of greater bulk and dimenſions, than any now living; I do not ſay in theſe, but in the moſt Southernly and <hi>Indian</hi>; viz. <hi>Cornua Ammonis</hi> of two foot diameter, and of thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, That there are no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Shells that do in bigneſs much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe of the natural Shell fiſh found in our Seas, ſave the <hi>Cornua Ammonis</hi> only, which I ſuſpect to have never been, nor had any relation to any Shells of Fiſhes: or to imitate or reſemble them, at leaſt ſome of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65250:74"/>
them. As for the <hi>Nautili,</hi> they are much different from them. For the <hi>Nautili,</hi> at leaſt all the Species of them known to us, are (as Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> well obſerves) extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly broad at the mouth, and have not more than two other ſmall turns at the moſt, whereas the turns of the <hi>Ophiomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites</hi> are proportionable one to another; and in number many times four or five, and ſometimes ſix, if we may believe <hi>Aldrovand.</hi> And there are <hi>Nautili lapidei,</hi> which do as nearly reſemble the <hi>Nautilus</hi> Shells as any other <hi>Cochlites</hi> do their reſpective proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types, As Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> aſſures me he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many in Muſeums. And the Learned and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Richard Waller</hi> then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in a Letter to me dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 4.—87. writes, That he had been lately at <hi>Keinſham</hi> in <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> and making a ſearch after the <hi>Cornua Ammonis,</hi> found one of the true <hi>Nautilus</hi> ſhape, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſome places with a ſhelly Incruſtation with the Diaphragms to be ſeen to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Volutae,</hi> and in each Diaphragm, the hole by which they communicate one with another, by a ſtring or gut in the Fiſh. This was of a very hard Stone and large ſize, weighing at leaſt twenty eight pound, though ſome part was broken off. Another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they have no relation to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65250:75"/>
                     <hi>Nautili,</hi> is, that they break into pieces ſomewhat reſembling Vertebres, as I was firſt adviſed by the fore remembred Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> and have ſince noted my ſelf. I alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that very Ingenious and Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Gentleman, happy in making natural Diſcoveries, Mr. <hi>William Cole</hi> of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> ſuch an Account of a ſort or two of theſe <hi>Ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omorphus</hi> Bodies, as is enough to ſtagger any mans belief, if not utterly to overthrow his Opinion of their owning their original to any Sea-ſhell; which take in his words. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others of this kind of Bodies which I have obſerved, I ſhall inſtance in one, which can be reduced to none but the</hi> Ophiomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites, <hi>which I found growing between the thin Plates of a kind of brittle blew Slate in large Rocks, ſome a furlong within the Full-Sea Mark, and in ſome where the Water comes not at higheſt Tides, only in great Storms, when the Waves break, it is daſht ſometimes againſt them, being forced up by the Winds; which being broken with a convenient Tool, will ſhiver all into very thin Plates; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which I have found in abundance of thoſe Stones, but as brittle as the Slate in which they grew, and of the ſame conſiſtence; but ſo thin, that the broadeſt, being about four Inches, are not ſo thick as a Half-Crown Piece, ſome not half an Inch broad, were as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65250:75"/>
thin as a Groat, and ſo proportionably up to the largeſt, covered with a Superficies as thin, and exactly of the colour of Silver foil: and where the Sea water waſheth them, and they are expoſed to the Sun and Wind when the Tide is gone, they are tarniſhed, and appear of a Gold, Purple, Blew and Red; as any thing on which Silver foil is laid, being expoſed a conſiderable time to the Sun, Wind and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will do. Theſe have the ſame Spiral Figures, and as regular as the other Serpent-Stones, and being taken off with a Knife, leave the ſame impreſſions on both ſides of the Slate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In ſome ſuch Rocks of Slate, but much harder, I found ſome of thoſe Stones of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, thick in proportion to their breadth, from an Inch to twenty eight Inches broad; in the broadeſt one was at the great end (on which ſome Authors have fabulouſly reported the head to grow) ſix Inches thick: all of them cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with a white Scale, which will be taken off, one coat under another, as Pearls or the Shells of ſome Fiſhes. I ſaw ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as big as the Fore-wheel of a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> &amp;c. What ſhall we ſay to this? Were there ever any Shell-fiſh in ours or other Seas, as broad as a Coach-wheel? others as thin as a Groat? What is become of all this kind of <hi>Ophiomorphite</hi> Shell-fiſh? And yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65250:76"/>
(which is ſtrange) both theſe kinds by Mr. <hi>Cole</hi>'s deſcription, ſeem to have been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Shells.</p>
                  <p>By what I have ſaid concerning theſe <hi>Ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omorphous</hi> Stones not to have been <hi>Nautili,</hi> I would not be thought to reflect upon, or detract from the Veracity or Exactneſs of the Obſervations of Mr. <hi>Robert Hook,</hi> whom, for his Learning and deep Inſight into the Myſteries of Nature, I deſervedly honour. I queſtion not, but he found in the <hi>Keinſham Ophiomorphites</hi> perfect Diaphragms of a very diſtinct ſubſtance from that which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Cavities, and exactly of that kind which covered the out-ſide, being for the moſt part Whitiſh, or Mother of Pearl co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured. Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> fore-mentioned atteſts the ſame, writing in his Letter to me of <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1687. that in the ordinary Snake-ſtones there, the ſhelly Diaphragms were very viſible. In this reſpect they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <hi>Nautili</hi>; though for their Figure they are much different, and of a diſtinct <hi>Genus.</hi> I never broke any of the <hi>Keinſham</hi> Stones; but of thoſe found about <hi>Whitby</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> many; but could not obſerve in them any ſhell-like Diaphragms, only they broke into ſuch pieces as I mentioned before. And my Dear and much Honoured Friend Dr. <hi>Tancred Robinſon</hi> writes me, That he had
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65250:76"/>
broken ſeveral <hi>Cornua Ammonis,</hi> but could never find any Diaphragms or Valves in them, though he confeſſeth Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> ſhew'd him one with ſuch in his curious Collection of Petrifactions. So that theſe Diaphragms are not to be found in all the ſorts of them. But if they be found in ſome, it is a ſtrong preſumption, that they were at firſt in all, however they come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</p>
                  <p>In fine, theſe Ophiomorphous Stones do more puzzle and confound me, than any other of the formed Stones whatſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s Deſcription of theſe of <hi>Keinſham,</hi> they ſeem to have been, or to owe their Original to Shells; and yet there is nothing like them appears at this day in out or any other Seas, as far as I have heard or read.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A Second Argument to prove theſe formed Stones never to have been Shells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. <hi>Plot</hi> affords us,<note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt. nat. Oxf. <hi>p. 117.</hi>
                     </note> Becauſe that even thoſe Shells, which ſo exactly repreſent ſome ſorts of Shell-fiſh, that there can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon the account of Figure, but that they might formerly have been Shells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, at ſome places are found only with one Shell, and not the other. Thus in <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Common [in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi>] we meet only with the gibbous, not the flat Shell of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65250:77"/>
petrified <hi>Oyſter,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Eſcallop-Stones</hi> in the Quarries near <hi>Shotover:</hi> which if they had once been the Shells of <hi>Oyſters</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callops,</hi> had ſcarce been thus parted. To this I anſwer, That this Argument is not neceſſarily concluſive; becauſe there may poſſibly be ſome reaſon of it, though we know it not, nor can eaſily imagine any. The like Anſwer may be returned to his next Argument.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe (ſaith the Doctor) I can by no means ſatisfie my ſelf, how it ſhould come to paſs, that in caſe theſe Bodies had once been moulded in Shells, ſome of the ſame kind ſhould be found in Beds, as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites</hi> at <hi>Langley, Charlton, Adderbury</hi>; An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The other Arguments, the Doctor alledges, admit a plauſible ſolution, excepting ſuch as we have already touched, and given as good an anſwer to, as either the matter will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or we were able to give.</p>
                  <p>To the Firſt, That there are found Stones reſembling Shell-fiſh that ſtick to Rocks: I anſwer, That many of them might by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be rub'd off the Rocks they ſtick to, or thruſt off by Birds inſinuating their Bills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Shell and Rock, to feed upon their meat; but by what means ſoever it be, that they are ſometimes broken off, the matter of fact is certain; for we find many <hi>patelloe</hi> caſt upon the Shores by the working of the Sea, Why then might they not be brought up by the Flood?</p>
                  <p>To the Second, Why might not the Bones of Whales, Sea-horſes, all ſquamoſe Fiſhes, the great Shells of the <hi>Buccina, Murices, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Veneris, &amp; Solenes,</hi> and almoſt all the

cruſtaceous kind, as <hi>Crabs</hi> and <hi>Lobſters, &amp;c.</hi> as well have been brought up and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind by the Flood, and afterward petrified, as any of the teſtaceous kind? I anſwer, Of the great <hi>Buccina, Murices</hi> and <hi>Conchae Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> there are very few or none found in our Seas: it may be there are of them in the Mountains and Quarries of the <hi>Indies,</hi> were any man ſo curious as to ſearch them out: Though it's likely but few, becauſe being great things, eaſie to be ſeen, and that part of the World having been fully peopled ſoon after the Flood, their beauty might invite the Inhabitants to ſearch them out, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them up. But Secondly, Thoſe other kinds may poſſibly be leſs durable, and more apt to be wrought upon, to moulder, decay and be diſſolved in time by the Weather Rains and Moiſture of the Earth, or were not ſo ſuſceptive of petrifying Juices.</p>
                  <p>The Third Argument is already anſwered in the precedent Diſcourſe.</p>

They always ſink to the Eaſt more or leſs. There may therefore, for for ought we know, be Fire about the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth as well as any other Body, if it can find a <hi>Pabulum</hi> or Fewel there to maintain it.</q> And why may it not? ſince the Fires in thoſe ſubterraneous Caverns of <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius, Stromboli, Hecla</hi> and other burning Mountains or <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> have found wherewith to feed them for thouſands of

This is not impoſſible, and we have ſeen ſome <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in nature which bid fair towards a Probability of it. For what ſhould be the reaſon of new Stars ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and diſappearing again; as that noted one in <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> which at firſt ſhone with as great a luſtre as <hi>Venus,</hi> and then by degrees diminiſhing, after ſome two years vaniſh'd quite away? but that by great Supplies of combuſtible matter the internal Fire ſuddenly increaſing in quantity and force, either found or made its way through the Cracks or Vents of the <hi>maculae</hi> which incloſed it; and in an inſtant as it were overflowed the whole Surface of the Star, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that illuſtrious Light; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again gradually decayed, its Supply

in extraordinary hot Seaſons, the Air ſcarce ſufficeth for Reſpiration. To the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of this, let us a little conſider what Fire is. It ſeems to conſiſt of three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts of parts. 1. An extremely thin and ſubtil Body, whoſe Particles are in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vehement and rapid motion, 2. (A ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) nitrous <hi>Pabulum</hi> or Fewel, which it receives from the Air. 3. A Sulphureous or unctuous <hi>Pabulum,</hi> which it acts and preys upon, paſſing generally by the Name of Fewel. This forementioned ſubtil Body agitating the (ſuppoſed) nitrous Particles it receives from the Air, doth by their help, as by Wedges, to uſe that rude ſimilitude, penetrate the unctuous Bodies, upon which it acts, and divide them into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir immediate component Particles, and at length perchance into their firſt Principles: which Operation is called the Chymical Anatomy of mix'd Bodies. So we ſee Wood, for Example, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by Fire into Spirit, Oil, Water, Salt, and Earth.</p>
               <p>That Fire cannot live without thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles it receives from the Air is manifeſt, in that if you preclude the Acceſs of all Air, it is extinguiſhed immediately: and in that, where and when the Air is more charged with them, as in cold Countries, and cold Weather, the Fire rages moſt: That likewiſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65250:86"/>
it cannot be continued without an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous <hi>Pabulum</hi> or Fewel, I appeal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all Men.</p>
               <p>Now then in the rarified Air in the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Zone the nitrous Particles being propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably ſcattered and thin ſet, the Fire that might be kindled there would burn but very languidly and remiſsly, as we ſaid juſt now: and ſo the Eruptions of <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> if any ſuch happened, would not be like to do half the Execution there that they would do in cold Countries. And yet I never read of any ſpreading Conflagration cauſed by the Eruptions of any <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> either in hot Countries, or in cold. They uſually caſt out abundance of thick Smoak like Clouds darkening the Air: and likewiſe Aſhes and Stones, ſometimes of a vaſt Bigneſs; and ſome of them, as <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> Floods of Water, others, (as <hi>Aetna</hi>) Rivers of melted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, running down many Miles: as for the Flames that iſſue out of their Mouths at ſuch times, they are but tranſient, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards, ſeldom ſet any thing on Fire.</p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt upon this, I do affirm, that there hath not as yet been, nor for the future can be any ſuch drying or parching of the Earth under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> as ſome may imagine. That there hath not yet been I appeal to Experience, the Countries lying
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65250:86"/>
under the Courſe of the Sun, being at this day as fertile as ever they were, and wanting no more Moiſture now than of old they did; having as conſtant and plentiful Rains in their Seaſons as they then had. That they ſhall for the future ſuffer any more Drought than they have heretofore done, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe or imagine, the Face of the Earth being not altered, nor naturally alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to the main, more at preſent than it was heretofore. I ſhall now add the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why I think there can be no ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccation of the Earth in thoſe parts. It's true indeed, were there nothing to hinder them, the Vapours exhaled by the Sun-beams in thoſe hot Regions, would be caſt off to the North and to the South a great way, and not fall down in Rain there, but toward the Poles: But the long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Ridges or Chains of exceeding high Mountains are ſo diſpoſed by the great and wiſe Creator of the World, as, at leaſt in our Continent, to run Eaſt and Weſt, as <hi>Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in the life of <hi>Peireskius</hi> well obſerves, ſuch are <hi>Atlas, Taurus,</hi> and the <hi>Alps,</hi> to name no more: They are, I ſay, thus diſpoſed as if it were on purpoſe to obviate and ſtop the Evagation of the Vapours Northward, and reflect them back again, ſo that they muſt needs be condenſed, and fall upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65250:87"/>
out of which they were elevated. And on the South Side, being near the Sea, it is likely that the Wind, blowing for the moſt part from thence, hinders their excurſion that way. This I ſpeak by preſumption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in our Countrey for at leaſt three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the year the Wind blows from the great <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean: which was taken notice of by <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in the fifth of his Commentaries, <hi>De Bello Gallico.

               </p>
               <p>As for any Deſiccation of the Sea, I hold that by mere natural Cauſes to be impoſſible, unleſs we could ſuppoſe a Tranſmutation of Principles or ſimple Bodies, which for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged in a former Diſcourſe I cannot allow. I was then and am ſtill of opinion, that God Almighty did at firſt create a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and determinate number of Principles, or variouſly figured Corpuſcles, intranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the force of any natural Agent, even Fire it ſelf, (which can only ſeparate the parts of heterogeneous Bodies) yet not an equal number of each kind of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but of ſome abundantly more, as of <hi>Water, Earth, Air, Ether</hi>; and of others fewer, as of <hi>Oil, Salt, Metals, Minerals,</hi> &amp;c. Now that there may be ſome Bodies indiviſible by Fire is, I think, demonſtrable.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65250:87"/>
For how doth or can Fire be conceived to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, one can hardly imagine any other way than by its ſmall parts, by reaſon of their violent Agitation inſinuating themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to compound Bodies, and ſeparating their parts; which allowing, yet ſtill there is a term of Magnitude, below which it cannot divide, <hi>viz.</hi> it cannot divide a Body into ſmaller parts than thoſe whereof it ſelf is compounded. For taking, ſuppoſe, one leaſt Part of Fire, 'tis clear that it cannot inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it ſelf into a Body as little or leſs than it ſelf: and what is true of one is true of all: I ſay we can imagine no other way than this, unleſs perchance by a violent Stroke or Shock, the parts of the Body to be divided may be put into ſo impetuous a motion as to fall in ſunder of themſelves into leſſer Particles than thoſe of the impellent Body are, which I will not ſuppoſe at preſent. Now it is poſſible, that the Principles of ſome other ſimple Bodies may be as ſmall as the Particles of Fire. But however that be, it is enough, if the Principles of ſimple Bodies be by reaſon of their perfect Solidity naturally indiviſible, Such a ſimple Body, I ſuppoſe, Water ſeparated from all Heterogeneous Mixtures to be: and conſequently the ſame quantity thereof that was at firſt created doth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65250:88"/>
ſtill remain, and will continue always, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all natural Agents, unleſs it pleaſes the Omnipotent Creator to diſſolve it. And therefore there can be no Deſiccation of the Seas, unleſs by turning all its Water into Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, and ſuſpending it in the Air, which to do what an immenſe and long-continuing Fire would be requiſite? to the maintenance whereof all the inflammable Materials near the Superficies of the Earth would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Fewel enough. The Sun, we ſee, is ſo far from doing it, that it hath not made one ſtep towards it theſe four thouſand years, there being in all likelyhood as great a quantity of Water in the Ocean now as was immediately after the Flood: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there would probably remain as much in it, ſhould the World laſt four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years longer.</p>
               <p>This Fixedneſs and Intranſmutability of Principles ſecures the Univerſe from Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the prevailing of one Element over another, and turning it into its own Nature; which otherwiſe it would be in continual danger of. It ſecures likewiſe the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of all the <hi>Species</hi> in the World, many of which, if their Principles were tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, might by ſuch a change be quite loſt: And laſtly bars the Production or Creation

               <p>The Mention of theſe Principles or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Simple Bodies gives me a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making a ſecond Digreſſion, to Diſcourſe a little concerning the <hi>Primaeve Chaos,</hi> and Creation of the World.</p>

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void</hi>: and comprehended in the word <hi>Earth.</hi> By the word <hi>Chaos</hi> the Ancients underſtood a huge Maſs of Heterogeneous Bodies, or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Seeds of natural Bodies confuſedly and diſorderly mingled together in one lump: for ſo <hi>Ovid</hi> deſcribes it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt of his <hi>Metamorphoſis:</hi>

                  <p>I ſuppoſe therefore, that God Almighty did at firſt create this terreſtrial Globe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Seeds and Principles of all natural, viſible, ſublunary Bodies, variouſly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly commixt together, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called by the name of <hi>Chaos</hi>) part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſolid and more ponderous, partly of fluid and lighter parts; the ſolid and more ponderous naturally ſubſided, the fluid and watry, as being more light, got above them. That the Waters did at firſt cover the Earth ſeems to me clear from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Scripture. For in the Hiſtory of the Creation in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis, Verſ.</hi> 2. It is ſaid, <hi>Darkneſs was upon the face of the deep,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,</hi> intimating that the Waters were uppermoſt. And in <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. And God ſaid, <hi>Let the waters under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence, I think, it is manifeſt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time the Land was covered with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65250:90"/>
Water. And that this gathering together of Waters was not into any ſubterraneous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs, is likewiſe clear from the Text: For it is ſaid, that God called this Collection of Waters <hi>Seas,</hi> as if it had been on purpoſe to prevent ſuch a Miſtake. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.6. It is ſaid of the Earth at the Creation, <hi>Thou coveredſt it with the deep as with a garment; the waters ſtood above the mountains.</hi> And again <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>That they turn not again to cover the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more ſolid and ponderous parts, tho they were of various Figures, and perhaps Magnitudes, were all called by the common name of <hi>Earth,</hi> and the fluid by the name of <hi>Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſolid part of the Earth was made up of the Principles of many ſimple Bodies, variouſly commix'd, and irregularly diſperſt one among another; yet tho they ſeem to be thus diſorderly mingled, as tho they had been careleſly ſhaken and ſhuffled together, yet I do believe there was ſome Order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the moſt wiſe Creator in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of them.</p>
                  <p>The fluid part of this Globe (as we ſaid, and as of its own nature it muſt needs do) covered the ſolid, till it pleaſed God to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, and by providing great Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for the Waters, to gather them together
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65250:90"/>
into one place. Whether this were done by the immediate Application and Agency of his Almighty Power, or by the Intervention and Inſtrumentality of ſecond Cauſes I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine. It might poſſibly be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame Cauſes that Earthquakes are, <hi>viz.</hi> Subterraneous Fires and <hi>Flatuses.</hi> We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why then might not ſuch a proportionable quantity of ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials ſet on fire together raiſe up the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains themſelves, how great and ponderous ſoever they be, yea the whole Superficies of the dry Land (for it muſt all be elevated) above the Waters?

                     <hi>Flatus</hi> or Wild-fire, of quantity and force ſufficient to work ſuch an effect, that is, that bears as great a proportion to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perincumbent weight and bulk to be eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as thoſe under theſe ſmaller Hills did to theirs?</p>
                  <p>But we cannot doubt this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For notwithſtanding the Cavity in and under it, it hath ſtood firm and ſtaunch, without the leaſt ſinking or ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, for above an hundred and fifty years: neither is there any great ſinking or falling in at <hi>Aetna</hi> it ſelf; at leaſt in no degree anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to its ejected matter.

                  <p>Howbeit, I cannot poſitively aſſert the Mountains thus to have been raiſed. But yet whether without means, or by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever means it were, a Receptacle for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was prepared, and the dry Land and Mountains elevated, ſo as to caſt off the Waters, on the third day, and which is wonderful, the Cavities made to receive the Waters, and the whole <hi>terra firma,</hi> or dry Land with its Mountains were ſo proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one to the other, as that the one was as much depreſſed below the Shores, as the other was elevated above them. And, as if the one had been taken out of the other, The Sea with all its Creeks, and Bays, and In-lets, and other Appendants was made, and is very near equal to the whole dry Land with its Promontories and Mountains, if not in <hi>Superficies,</hi> yet in bulk or dimenſions, though ſome think in both. Which equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſtill conſtantly maintained, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all Inundations of Land, and Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Sea; becauſe one of theſe doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways nearly ballance the other, according to the Vulgar Proverb we have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,

                     <hi>What the Sea loſes in one place, it gains in another.</hi> If any ſhall demand, How the Sea comes to be gradually depreſſed, and deepeſt about the middle part; whereas the bottom of it was in all likelihood equal while the Waters covered the whole Earth? I anſwer, the ſame Cauſe that raiſed up the Earth, whether a ſubterraneous Fire or <hi>fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> raiſed up alſo the skirts of the Sea, the aſcent gradually decreaſing to the middle part, where, by reaſon of the ſolidity of the Earth, or gravity of the incumbent Water, the bottom was not elevated at all. For the encloſed Fire in thoſe parts where its firſt accenſion or greateſt ſtrength was, raiſed up the Earth firſt, and caſt off the Waters, and thence ſpreading by degrees, ſtill elevated the Land, and drove the Waters further and further; till at length the weight of them was too great to be raiſed, and then the Fire brake forth at the tops of the Mountains, where it found leaſt reſiſtance, and diſperſt it ſelf in the open Air. The Waters alſo, where they found the bottom ſandy or yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, made their way into all thoſe Cavities the Fire had made and left, filling them up as high as the level of the Ocean. Neither let any man imagine, that the Earth under the Water, was too ſoft and muddy to be in this manner raiſed by ſubterraneous Fire; for I have ſhewn before, that the bottom of the

Sea is ſo ſaddened and hardened by the weight of the incumbent Water, that the High-ways, beaten continually by Horſes and Carriages, are not more firm and ſolid. But omitting this (which is only a conjecture) I ſhall diſcourſe a little more concerning the Equality of Sea and Land.</p>
                  <p>It hath been obſerved by ſome, That where there are high Cliffs or Downs along the Shore, there the Sea adjoining is deep; and where there are low and level Grounds, it is ſhallow: the depth of the Sea anſwering to the Elevation of the Earth above it: and as the Earth from the Shores is gradually higher and higher, to the middle and parts moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Sea, as is evident by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents of the Rivers, they requiring a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant declivity to carry them down; ſo the Sea likewiſe is proportionably deeper and deeper from the Shores to the Middle. So that the riſing of the Earth from the Shores to the Mid-land is anſwerable to the deſcent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity of the bottom of the Sea from the ſame Shores to the Mid-Sea. This riſing of the Earth from the Shores gradually to the Midland, is ſo conſiderable, that it is very likely the Altitude of the Earth in thoſe Mid land parts above the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea, is greater than that of the Mountains above the level of the adjacent Lands. To the height of the Hills above the common
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65250:95"/>
                     <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth do anſwer in <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s Opinion the extraordinary Depths or Whirl-pools that are found in the Sea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending beneath the ordinary bottom of the Sea, as the Hills aſcend above the ordinary face of the Land. But this is but a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his, and to me it ſeems not very probable, becauſe it is not likely, there ſhould be in the Sea extraordinary Depths of that vaſt length and extenſion, as thoſe huge Ridges of Mountains that run almoſt quite through the Continents. And becauſe I have obſerved the Waters of Rivers that flow gently, but eſpecially of the Sea to level the bottoms of their Channels and Receptacles, as may be ſeen in thoſe parts of the Sea whoſe bottoms are uncovered at Low-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and in Dry-lands that have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Sea, as the Fens in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the <hi>Craux</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> which appear to be a perfect Level, as far as one can ken. Though poſſibly the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea may not deſcend down ſo low as thoſe Depths, and ſo may not level the bottoms of them.</p>
                  <p>Again, It is conſonant to the beſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the height of the Earth and its Mountains above the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea; and of the depth of the Sea, that the one is anſwerable to the other. So <hi>Varenius</hi> in his

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Brerewood</hi> in his Enquiries perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to our purpoſe, ſuppoſeth the depth of the Sea, to be a great deal more than the height of the Hills above the common ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth. —<q>For that in making eſtimation of the depth of the Sea, we are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65250:96"/>
not to reckon and conſider only the height of the Hills above the common <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth, but the advantage or height of all the dry Land above the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea:</q> Becauſe the whole Maſs of the Earth, that now appeareth above the Waters, being taken, as it were, out of the place which the Waters now poſſeſs, muſt be equal to the place out of which it was taken; and conſequently it ſeemeth, that the height or elevation of the one ſhould anſwer to the depth or deſcending of the other. And therefore, as I ſaid, in eſtimating the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sea, we are not to conſider only the erection of the Hills above the ordinary Land, but the advantage of all the dry Land above the Sea. Which latter, I mean the height of the ordinary Main land, is in my opinion more in large Continents above the Sea, than that of the Hills is above the Land. For that the plain and common face of the dry Land, is not level or equally diſtant from the Center, but hath great declivity and deſcent towards the Sea, and acclivity or riſing toward the Mid-land part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appear not ſo to the common view of the Eye, is to reaſon notwitſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. Becauſe, as it is found in that part of the Earth which the Sea covereth, that it deſcendeth lower and lower toward the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65250:97"/>
midſt of the Sea; for the Sea which touching the upper face of it is known to be level by nature, and evenly diſtant from the Center, is withal obſerved to wax deeper and deeper the further one ſaileth from the Shore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Main) Even ſo in that part which is uncovered the courſings and ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Rivers on all ſides from the Mid-land parts towards the Sea (whoſe property we know is to ſlide from the higher to the lower) evidently declare ſo much. <note n="*" place="margin">De fide Orthod. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſuppoſes, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs and irregularity, which is now ſeen in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Earth, was cauſed either by taking ſome parts out of the upper face of the Earth in ſundry places to make it more hollow, &amp; laying them in other places to make it more convex: or elſe (which in effect is equivalent to that) by raiſing up ſome, and depreſſing others to make room and receipt for the Sea: that Mutation being wrought by the Power of that Word, <hi>Let the Waters be gathered into one place that the dry land may appear.</hi> This proportioning of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities appointed to receive the Seas, to the protuberancy of the dry Land above the common <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Ocean, is to me a ſufficient Argument, to prove, that the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the Waters into one place, was a work of counſel and deſign;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65250:97"/>
and if not effected by the immediate Finger of God, yet at leaſt governed and directed by him. So the Scripture affirms the place to receive the Sea, to have been prepared by God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.8. Now in things of this nature, to the giving an account whereof whatever <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> we can poſſibly invent, can be but merely conjectural, thoſe are to be moſt approved that come neareſt to the Letter of Scripture, and thoſe that claſh with it to be rejected, how trim or conſiſtent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with themſelves they may ſeem to be: this being as much, as when God tells how he did make the World, for us to tell him how he ſhould have made it.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be objected, That the preſent Earth looks like a heap of Rubbiſh and Ruines; And that there are no greater examples of confuſion in Nature than Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſingly or jointly conſidered; and that there appear not the leaſt footſteps of any Art or Counſel either in the Figure and Shape, or Order and Diſpoſition of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks. Wherefore it is not likely they came ſo out of Gods hands; who by the Ancient Philoſophers is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and to make all things in number, weight and meaſure.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That the preſent face of the Earth with all its Mountains and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65250:98"/>
Hills, its Promontories and Rocks, as rude and deformed as they appear, ſeems to me a very beautiful and pleaſant object, and with all that variety of Hills, and Valleys, and Inequalities far more grateful to behold, than a perfectly level Countrey without any riſing or protuberancy, to terminate the ſight: As any one that hath but ſeen the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> or any the like Countrey muſt needs acknowledge. Neither is it only more pleaſant to behold, but more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for habitation, which is ſo plain, that I need not ſpend time to prove it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Land ſo diſtinguiſhed into Mountains, Valleys and Plains is alſo moſt convenient for the entertainment of the various ſorts of Animals, which God hath created, ſome whereof delight in cold, ſome in hot, ſome moiſt and watery, ſome in dry and upland places, and ſome of them could neither find nor gather their proper food in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Regions.

            <p>Such a Diſſolution of the World might indeed be effected by that natural Accident mentioned in the Anſwer to the precedent Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eruption of the Central Fire. But becauſe it is doubtful, whether there be any ſuch Fire in the middle of the Earth or no: and if there ever were, it is hard to give an account, how it could be maintained in that infernal Dungeon for want of Air and Fewel. And becauſe, if it ſhould break forth in the Conſiſtency of a thin Flame, it would in all likelyhood ſpeedily like Lightening mount up to Heaven, and quite vaniſh away; unleſs we could ſuppoſe Floods, nay Seas of melted Materials, or liquid Fire, enough to overflow the whole Earth, to be poured forth of thoſe Caverns.

            </argument>
            <p n="4">4. THE Fourth Queſtion is, Whether ſhall there be any Signs or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the Diſſolution of the World?</p>
            <p>In order to the Anſwering of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion we ſhall diſtinguiſh Signs into natural and arbitrarious, 1. <hi>natural</hi> Signs, ſo the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora,</hi> or Dawning of the Day, is a Sign of the Sun-riſing. Now if the Diſſolution be effected in the courſe of Nature, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Means, there will be ſome previous natural Signs of it. An old Houſe will threaten Ruin before it falls. The natural Death of Men and all Animals hath its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers, and old Men before their Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion feel the Impreſſion of Age; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the World their approaching Fate by Wrinkles, Gray Hairs, and Dimneſs of Sight. But we have formerly ſhewn, that there is no Conſeneſcency or Declenſion in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65250:105"/>
Nature: but that the World continues ſtill as firm and ſtaunch as it was three thouſand years ago; and why hereafter it ſhould founder and decay more than it hath done for ſo many Ages heretofore, what reaſon can be given? It is not therefore likely there ſhould be any natural Signs of the Diſſolution of the World; and conſequently that it ſhall be effected by natural Means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are arbitrary Signs, as a Garland hung out is a Sign of Wine to be ſold. Now if the Diſſolution of the World be effected by ſupernatural and extraordinary means. (as is moſt likely) the Signs of it muſt be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious. For tho they may be natural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Productions, yet would they not ſignifie the Deſtruction of the World, if they were not ordered by providence to happen at that time, and predicted as Forerunners of it; with which otherwiſe they have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Connexion. Such Signs are <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. The Sun being darkened, and the Moon not giving her Light, and the Stars falling from Heaven, and the Shaking of the Powers of Heaven. Theſe and many other Signs of his coming we find mentioned in Scripture: but what the meaning of theſe Expreſſions may be, is not ſo clear: For tho ſome of them may be taken in a Literal Senſe, yet it is manifeſt that others cannot. The Sun may
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65250:105"/>
indeed be ſo covered with a <hi>Macula,</hi> as to be quite obſcured; and thereupon the Moon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily loſe her Light, which ſhe borrows only from the Sun-beams: But how the Stars ſhould in a literal Senſe fall down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is inconceivable; it being almoſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively certain, that moſt of them are bigger than the whole Earth. We may therefore, keeping as near as we can to the Letter, thus interpret them. There ſhall be great Signs in Heaven, diſmal Eclipſes and Obſcurations of the Sun and Moon; new Stars and Comets ſhall appear, and others diſappear, and many fiery Meteors be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended in the Air. The very Foundations of the Earth ſhall be ſhaken, and the Sea ſhall roar and make a noiſe. But I muſt not here diſſemble a great Difficulty: How can ſuch illuſtrious Signs and Forerunners be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the ſuddenneſs and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's coming, and the end of the World? <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25. After the Evangeliſt had told us, <hi>That there ſhall be ſigns in the ſun, and in the moon; and in the ſtars — the ſea and the waves roaring,</hi> he adds, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereof, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>Mens hearts fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things that are coming on the earth.</hi> And indeed how could any Man poſſibly be buried in ſo profound a Lethargy of Senſeleſsneſs

and Security, as by ſuch ſtupendious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies not to be rowſed and awakened to an expectation of ſome diſmal and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Event? How could he ſing a <hi>Requiem</hi> to his Soul, and ſay Peace and Safety, when the World ſo manifeſtly threatens Ruin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Ears? For the reconciling of theſe Expreſſions to this ſudden coming of our Saviour to Judgment, it were moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to accept them in the Figurative and Metaphorical Senſe. For if we underſtand them of the Ruins and Devaſtations of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Countries, the Changes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Subverſions of Kingdoms and Commonwealths, the Falls and Depoſings of Princes, Nobles and Great Men; theſe happening more or leſs in every Age, tho the ſerious and inquiſitive Chriſtian, who ſearches and underſtands the Scriptures, may diſcern them to be the Signs of the World's <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi>; yet the careleſs and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the vicious and voluptuous are not like to be at all ſtartled or moved at them, but may notwithſtanding, looking upon them as ordinary and inſignificant Accidents, <hi>Dormire in utramque aurem,</hi> ſleep ſecurely till the laſt Trump awaken them.

            </argument>
            <p n="5">5. THE Fifth Queſtion is, At what Period of Time ſhall the World be diſſolved? I anſwer, This is abſolutely uncertain and indeterminable. For ſince this Diſſolution ſhall be effected by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Interpoſition of Providence; it cannot be to any man known, unleſs extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily revealed. And our Saviour tells us, that of that Day and Hour knows no man, no not the Angels of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 24.36. And again, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.17. It is not for us to know the times and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which the Father hath placed in his own power. And this Dr. <hi>Hakewyll</hi> brings as an Argument, that the World decays not, neither tends to corruption; becauſe if it did, the time of its actual Diſſolution might be collected and foretold; which, ſaith he, the Scripure denies. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this Argumentation, and infer; Becauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65250:107"/>
the World doth not decay, therefore the time of its Diſſolution cannot be known.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding this, many have ventured to fore-tell the time of the end of the World, of whom ſome are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, the term prefixt being paſt, and the World ſtill ſtanding. <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his time ſaid, Inſtitut. lib. 7. c. 15. <hi>Omnis expectatio non amplius quàm ducentorum videtur annorum, The longeſt expectation extends not further than two hundred years.</hi> The continuance of the World more than a thouſand years ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces him of a groſs Miſtake. <hi>Paulus Greb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus</hi> a high Pretender to a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, ſets it in the year 1613. induced thereto by a fond conceit of the Numeral Letters in the Latin Word <hi>Judicium.</hi> Other Enthuſiaſtical perſons of our own Countrey have placed it in the years 1646. and 1656.

That it doth ſo I am not ſatisfied; but if it doth, it is merely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, and hath no connexion with the end

of the World. But the moſt famous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and which hath found moſt Patrons and Followers even amongſt the Learned and Pious, is that of the Worlds duration for ſix thouſand years. For the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which Conceit they tell us, that as the World was created in ſix days, and then followed the Sabbath, ſo ſhall it remain ſix thouſand years, and then ſhall ſucceed the Eternal Sabbath. Heb. 4.9. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>There remains therefore a reſt or Sabbath to the people of God.</hi> Here we ſee that the Apoſtle inſtitutes a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between the heavenly reſt and the Sabbath. Therefore as God reſted upon the ſeventh day, ſo ſhall all the World of the Godly reſt after the ſix thouſandth year. <hi>For he that hath entred into his reſt ceaſeth from all his works as God did from his.</hi> Of this Opinion were many of the Ancient Fathers, as I ſhewed before, grounding themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Analogy between the ſix days of the Creation and the Sabbath; and the ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years of the Worlds duration, and the eternal reſt; For ſaith <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lib. 5. cap. ult. <hi>Hoc autem</hi> (that is, the Hiſtory of the ſix days Creation and ſucceeding Sabbath) <hi>eſt &amp; praeteritorum narratio, &amp; futurorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetia.

the Scriptures reckoning days of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years long, as in <hi>verſe</hi> 8. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.4.

I rather think with <hi>Reuterus,</hi> that the Author of it was ſome <hi>Rabbi</hi> of that name. The Tradition is, <hi>Sex millia annorum erit mundus: &amp; uno millenaria va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatio</hi> i. e. <hi>Sabbathum Dei: Duo millia inane: Duo millia Lex: Duo millia dies Meſſiae.

All theſe Proofs laid together do ſcarce ſuffice to make up a probability. Neither do thoſe Rabbinical Collections from the ſix Letters in <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65250:108"/>
to <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was caught up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and found no more, add much weight to this Opinion. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> very modeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes after a diſcuſſion of this Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time of the Worlds duration, <hi>Ego tempora dinumerare non audeo: nec ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem prophetam de hac re numerum annorum exiſtimo praefiniviſſe.

            <p>But though none but preſumptuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have undertaken peremptorily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that time, yet was it the common and received Opinion and Perſwaſion of the Ancient Chriſtians, that that day was not far off: and had they been to limit it, they would hardly have been induced to ſet the term ſo forward, and remote from their own Age, as by experience we find it proves to to be in their own times, or ſhortly after; and many places of Scripture ſeem to favour that Opinion, ſo that ſome have preſumed to ſay, that the Apoſtles themſelves were at firſt miſtaken in this particular, till after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illumination they were better informed. But though this be too bold a Conceit, yet that the Churches, at leaſt ſome of them, did at firſt miſtake the Apoſtles meaning in their Sermons and Epiſtles concerning this Point, and ſo underſtand them, as to think that the end of the World and final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p n="6">6. A Sixth Queſtion is, How far ſhall this Conflagration extend? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Ethereal Heavens, and all the Hoſt of them, Sun, Moon and Stars, or to the Aereal only?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, If we follow Ancient Tradition not only the Earth, but alſo the Heavens and heavenly Bodies will be involved in one common fate, as appears by thoſe Verſes quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Lucretius, Ovid, Lucan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of Chriſtians ſome exempt the Ethereal Region from this Deſtruction: for the two following Reaſons, which I ſhall ſet down in <hi>Reuterus</hi>'s words. 1. Becauſe in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conflagration is compared to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge in the time of <hi>Noah.</hi> But the Deluge extended not to the upper Regions of the Air, much leſs to the Heavens, the Waters ariſing only fifteen Cubits above the tops of the Mountains, if ſo much. Therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Conflagration tranſcend that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65250:110"/>
term. So <hi>Beza</hi> upon 2 Pet. 3.6. <hi>Tantum aſcendet ille ignis quantum aqua altior ſupra omnes montes. That fire ſhall aſcend as high as the Waters ſtood above the Mountains.</hi> This paſſage I do not find in the laſt Edition of his Notes. The ordinary Gloſs alſo upon theſe words, 2 Theſſ. 1.2. <hi>In flaming fire rendring vengeance,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſtum venturum praecedet ignis in mundo, qui tantum aſcendet quantum aqua in diluvio. There ſhall a fire go before Chriſt when he comes, which ſhall reach as high as did the Water in the Deluge.</hi> And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> De Civit. Dei lib. 20. cap. 18. <hi>Petrus etiam commemorans factum ante dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium, videtur admonuiſſe quodammodo, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus in fine hujus ſeculi iſtum mundum peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum eſſe credamus.</hi> Peter <hi>alſo mentioning the Ancient Deluge, ſeems in a manner to have adviſed us how far at the conſummation of time, we are to believe this World ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Argument is of no force, becauſe it is not the Apoſtles deſign in that place to deſcribe the limits of the Conflagration, but only againſt Scoffers, to ſhew, that the World ſhould one day periſh by Fire, as it had of old been deſtroyed by Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies are not ſubject to paſſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or corruption. They can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65250:110"/>
no filth, and ſo need no expurgation by Fire.</p>
            <p>To this we anſwer, not in the words of <hi>Reuter,</hi> but our own, That it is an idle and ill grounded conceit of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> That the Heavens are of their own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and unalterable: for on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is demonſtrable, that many of them are of the ſame nature with the Earth we live upon, and the moſt pure, as the Sun, and probably too the Fixt Stars, ſuffer Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; <hi>maculae</hi> or opaque Concretions being commonly generated and diſſolved in them. And <hi>Comets</hi> frequently, and ſometimes <hi>New Stars</hi> appear in the Etherial Regions. So that theſe Arguments are inſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the Heavens from Diſſolution; and on the other ſide many places there are in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which ſeem to ſubject them thereto: As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25, 26. recited <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10. which hath already often been quoted, <hi>The heavens are the works of thy hands, They ſhall periſh.</hi> Mat. 24.35. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away.</hi> Iſa. 65.17. &amp; 51.6. <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke.</hi> Yet am I not of opinion, that the laſt Fire ſhall reach the Heavens; They are too far diſtant from us to ſuffer by it: nor indeed doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture affirm it: but where it mentions the Diſſolution of the Heavens, it expreſſes it by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65250:111"/>
ſuch Phraſes as ſeem rather to intimate, that it ſhall come to paſs by a conſeneſcency and decay, than be effected by any ſudden and violent means. Pſal. 102.25, 26. <hi>They all ſhall wax old as doth a garment,</hi> &amp;c. Though I confeſs nothing of Certainty can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſuch expreſſions; for we find the ſame uſed concerning the Earth. Iſa. 51.6. <hi>The Heavens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke, and the Earth ſhall wax old as doth a garment.</hi> The heavenly Bodies are none of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and eternal; but may in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Earth be conſumed and deſtroyed, at what times and by what means, whether Fire or ſome other Element, the Amighty hath decreed, and ordered.</p>

Then when all the intermediate Bodies ſhall be annihilated, what a ſtrange Univerſe ſhall we have?

            <p>To all this I anſwer, That not only all Animals, but all Vegetables too, yea and their Seeds alſo, will doubtleſs be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and deſtroyed by the violence of the Conflagration; but that the ſame ſhould be reſtored, and endued with eternal life, I know no reaſon we have to believe; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there ſhall be new ones produced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

This Queſtion being anſwered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all that follows concerning the Earth remaining without any Furniture or Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> falls to the Ground.

            <p>Holineſs is an Equivocal Term. It is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed either to God, or to the Creature. When it is attributed to God, it ſignifies either,</p>

            <p>When Holineſs is attributed to Creatures, it ſignifies either an Inherent and Inward or a Relative or Outward, Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Inherent or Inward Holineſs is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Heart and Life to the Will of God: or as <note n="*" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Wilkin's</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Relative or Outward Holineſs reſults from a Separation and ſetting a part any thing from a prophane and common, and applying it to a Sacred or Religious uſe. For the Majeſty of God, who at firſt created, and continually ſuſtains and governs all things, being ſo great and inviolable, all perſons,

That it ſhall come is certain, when it ſhall come is uncertain, and it every day draws nearer and nearer, therefore it is not wiſdom to remove the evil day far from us: and as in reference to the day of death, it is an uſual and prudent advice, ſo to live every day, as if it were our laſt day; or at leaſt, as we would not be afraid to do ſhould it be ſo: becauſe we are ſure, that one day will be our laſt, and for ought we know the preſent may be it: ſo likewiſe is it rational counſel in reſpect of the End of the World, ſo to prepare our ſelves for it by a holy converſation, that we may get above the terror and dread which will otherwiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the apprehenſion of the approach of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

man hath any right to it; No man can lay any claim to it, but from this donation, and from the performance of theſe conditions. Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City. For without are dogs and whoremongers and ſorcerers,</hi> &amp;c. All the right they have depends upon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is conditionate, and accrues to them by the performance of the condition, which is the doing of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neceſſary not only by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in the very nature of the thing. Holineſs is the very quality and complexion of Heaven. No man without it is qualified to be a ſubject of that Kingdom: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into nothing that is impure or unclean can enter. Revel. 21.27. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it</hi> [the new Jeruſalem] <hi>any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abomination.</hi> In this <hi>new Heaven dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.15. Therefore 1 John 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himſelf as he is pure.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would naturally ſpue out and eject a wicked perſon, as one heterogeneous to it. Heaven and Hell are not more diſtant in place, than they are in nature. There is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65250:120"/>
not more antipathy between fire and water, between light and darkneſs, between ſtreight and crooked, neither are they more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible, or do more naturally reſiſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel one another, than holineſs which is the quality of Heaven, and wickedneſs which is the diſpoſition and temper of Hell. Some do think Heaven to be rather a ſtate, than a place; and that he that is partaker of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature hath Heaven within him: This is true, but this is not all. The whole notion of Heaven comprehends both a ſtate and a place. A man muſt be in a heavenly ſtate, before the local Heaven can receive him, or he brook it. Heaven without him would be no Heaven to the man who hath not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven within him. A wicked perſon could find no buſineſs or employment in Heaven; nothing to ſatisfie his corrupt and depraved affections, inclinations, and appetites. He would there meet with no ſuitable company; no perſons whoſe converſation he could take any delight and complacency in, but rather hate and abhor. <hi>For what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? or what communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14. Like naturally loves like, and unites with it, and doth refuſe, reſiſt, and hate that which is unlike it. For every thing is made to love it ſelf; and conſequently every
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65250:120"/>
thing that reſembles and comes near it, and is as it were a replication of it; and to hate the contrary. As therefore we would be glad to be Partakers of the bleſſedneſs of the local Heaven, ſo let us endeavour to get into our Minds and Spirits the qualities and conditions of Heaven; that ſo we may be fit Subjects for that Kingdom, fit companions for that Society. <hi>This is the time allotted us to purifie our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> There is no invention in the grave whither we are going, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this moment depends eternity. As the tree falls ſo it lies</hi>; and as Death leaves, ſo will Judgment find us. <hi>Quando iſthinc ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſum fuerit, nullus jam locus poenitentiae eſt. Hîc vita aut amittitur, aut tenetur: Hîc ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luti aeternae cultu Dei &amp; fructu fidei provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur.</hi> Cyprian. Serm. de Immortal. <hi>After we ſhall depart hence there remains no more place for repentance. Eternal life is here, either loſt or won. Here proviſion is made for everlaſting ſalvation by the worſhip of God, and fruit of faith. We muſt work while it is day, the night</hi> [of death] <hi>cometh wherein no man can work.</hi> John 9.4. And therefore the time our bodies ſhall reſt in the grave, ſhould it be a thouſand years, will little avail us: for if the ſoul be mean while awake,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65250:121"/>
the certain and dreadful expectation of the Sentence of Condemnation to an eternal Hell at the Day of Judgment, will be little leſs afflictive than the Torments thereof themſelves. I might add by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion that Sin and Wickedneſs is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally productive of. Hell in the Soul. A wicked Man carries Hell in his Breaſt. Sin neceſſarily infers Miſery: It is contrary to the nature of the Soul, and whatſoever is ſo muſt needs be grievous. Diverſion and Non-Attention to his Condition is the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man's only Security: I have heard it often from a <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctor</hi> Witchcot.</note> great Divine in his Sermons, <hi>That there is but a Thoughts Diſtance between a wicked Man and Hell.</hi> For do but fix and bind his Thoughts to the Conſideration of his Life and Actions, and he will antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate Hell himſelf, he ſhall need no infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Furies to laſh him, he will be his own Tormentor: ſuch a Man's Preſſures will be heavy enough, ſhould the Divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> ſuperadd no more. The Reaſon of this I have given in a former Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall now omit what elſe might have been added on this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II.</note>Secondly, It much concerns us, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the future Judgment which ſhall be at the Diſſolution of the World, to have our
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65250:121"/>
Converſation in all Holineſs, as we deſire to avoid that Shame and Miſery which will then otherwiſe certainly befall us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As we deſire to avoid that ſhame which will cover our Faces at that day. If here Shame and Diſgrace be more grievous and inſupportable than Death it ſelf, what will it be then, when the Soul ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more quick and apprehenſive and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſuch Impreſſions? There is nothing ſhameful but ſin, nothing elſe hath any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Turpitude in it. Shame follows Sin as the Shadow doth the Body: He that will commit the one cannot avoid the other. Therefore ſuch wicked perſons as have not quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Modeſty, and loſt all Senſe of Shame, eſpecially if guilty of ſecret Crimes, the Conſideration of a future. Judgment would be a powerful Curb to reſtrain them from Sin for the future: becauſe then <hi>God will</hi> produce and <hi>bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and diſcloſe and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the counſels of all hearts:</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. Then <hi>he will judge the ſecrets of men by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 2.16. <hi>Then will he bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.14. For would they but conſider and ponder what Confuſion will overwhelm them when this ſhall be done in the face of the whole World, and before all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65250:122"/>
that knew them, and they not able to make any denyal, or excuſe. This, I ſay, if any thing, would be a powerful Curb to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from thoſe Enormities to which this ſhame is appendant. It may be thou madeſt a great Figure in the World for Piety and Religion, wouldſt ſeem to be ſome Body in the Eyes of Men, when thou wert falſe and unſound, didſt harbour and nouriſh ſome Viper in thy Boſom,
<q>Introrſum turpis, ſpecioſa pelle decorus:</q>
When thy ſecret Faults ſhall be expoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Neighbours, and Friends, and Children, <hi>And the ſhame of thy nakedneſs ſhall be made to appear,</hi> Revel, 3.18. How wilt thou then be confounded, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and unable to lift up thy Head? What horrour will then ſeize thee, <hi>When thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſhall be continually before thee, and the ſhame of thy face ſhall cover thee</hi>? Pſalm 44.15. It concerns thee therefore to look about thee in time, and ſearch thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Bottom, to remove whatever grates, to caſt out whatever offends, tho never ſo cuſtomary, never ſo pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood: to apply thy ſelf to the Merits and Satisfaction of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for the Expiation of what is paſt; and for the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65250:122"/>
future to reſolve and endeavour the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whatſoever hath heretofore been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in thee; and to beg the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace to ſtrengthen in thee every good purpoſe and reſolution of heart, and to enable thee to bring it to iſſue and effect. And for thy ſecurity, I think it good advice, to reſolve ſo to behave thy ſelf in thy retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo to live in the ſecret of thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Cloſet, as though the doors were thrown open upon thee, and all the eyes of the World beheld thee; as though thou were't in the <hi>Arena</hi> of a publick Theatre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the view of Men and Angels. I remember the Ingenious Writer of Politick Diſcourſes <hi>Boccalini,</hi> doth often divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Reader with facetious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the contrivance of a Window into the Breaſt; which, if I miſtake not, he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon <hi>Lipſius.</hi> However he may deride it, I think it would be prudent counſel to give and take, for every Chriſtian. So to live and carry it in the ſecret of his heart, as if there were a Window into his Breaſt, that every one that paſſed by, might look in thereat, and ſee all the thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that paſſed there, that found any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

off,</hi> Pſal. 139.2. Yet ſuch is the hypocriſie of mankind, that they do for the moſt part more reverence the eyes of men, than of God: and will venture to do that in his preſence, which they would be aſhamed the eyes of man ſhould ſee them doing. You will ſay, Is it not better to be modeſt, than to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent? Is it not better to conceal, than to publiſh ones ſhame? Is it not better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence man, than neither God nor man? Doth not the Scripture condemn a Whores fore-head? Is it not a true Proverb, <hi>Paſt Shame, paſt Grace?</hi> Was it not good advice of a Cardinal (as I remember) <hi>Si non caſtè tamen cautè?</hi> He that hath devoured ſhame, what bridle is there left to reſtrain him from the worſt of evils? I anſwer, That it ſeems indeed to me, that publick ſins of the ſame nature, are more heinous than ſecret; and that impudence in ſinning, is an aggravation of the ſin. For open ſins dare God, and bid defiance to Heaven, and leave the ſinner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable, and are of more pernicious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I do not now ſpeak of the hypocriſie of feigning holineſs to ſerve our own ends, which is rightly eſteemed <hi>duplex iniquitas,</hi> but that of concealing and hiding vicious actions, to avoid the ſhame of men. And yet there is a great obliquity in this too. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe even this is a ſlighting and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65250:123"/>
of God, a preferring of man before him, ſetting a greater price and eſteem upon the praiſe and commendation of men, than the praiſe and approbation of God. <hi>John</hi> 12.43. God ſees the ſecreteſt actions, yea, the moſt retired thoughts. They that believe this, and yet make bold to do in his preſence, what the fear of man's eye would reſtrain them from, it is clear that they reverence man more than God, a poor, frail, impotent Creature like themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more than the moſt pure and ever bleſſed Creator. Nay, let the temptation to any ſin be never ſo ſtrong, and the natural inclination never ſo vehement, if the knowledge and conſcience of men be a motive and conſideration pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enough to enable us to reſiſt and repel them, had we but as firm a belief of the preſence and inſpection of God, and as great a reverence and dread of him, Why ſhould not theſe have the ſame influence and effect upon us? Let us then avoid the hypocriſie of deſiring to be thought better than we are, by endeavouring to our utmoſt to be as good as we would be thought to be, and if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, better. So ſhall we ſatisfie our ſelves that we ſeek the praiſe of God, more than the praiſe of men.</p>

at the general Reſurrection be the portion of them who perſiſt and die in their ſins; yet a ſerious and unfeigned Repentance, atteſted by a holy Converſation for the future, is an effectual means to deliver us from this ſhame, whatever our forepaſt ſins have been. For they ſhall not be produced againſt us, they ſhall not be objected to us at that day; they ſhall be buried in eternal ſilence and oblivion, and be as tho they had not been. And this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I hold 1. More agreeable to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which in this matter makes uſe of the Terms of hiding, and covering, and blotting out, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe trangreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Eſay 43.25. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</hi> Jerem. 48.34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their ſin no more.</hi> Ezek. 28.22. <hi>All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed they ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned unto him.</hi> Mich. 7.19. <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> And as it is more conſonant to the Scripture, ſo is it 2. More grateful and conſolatory to the Penitents. For the mere mentioning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of their ſins before ſuch an Aſſembly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65250:124"/>
muſt needs refreſh their ſhame and ſorrow, and ſo diminiſh their happineſs and joy. To which I might add, that it is written that our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saviour at the laſt judgment in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Sentence ſhall enumerate the good works of the Godly to their praiſe; but not a word ſaid of producing their ſins. I ſay I hold this Opinion more probable upon theſe accounts, than theirs who affirm they ſhall then be publiſhed, for the magnifying and advancing, the declaring and illuſtrating the Mercy and Grace of God in pardoning ſo great and heinous Offences.</p>
            <p>It concerns us much to live in all holy Converſation in this World, as we deſire to avoid that pain and miſery, which we ſhall otherwiſe moſt certainly be adjudged to at that day: that <hi>indignation and wrath, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and anguiſh,</hi> which God ſhall render to them <hi>that do not obey the truth, but obey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs</hi>: Rom. 2.8.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65250:125"/>
Here are pleaſures and delights in this World, which are very inviting and taking, and do highly gratifie my ſenſes and appetites. I hear likewiſe of future rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for thoſe that deny or fulfil their carnal luſts and deſires. Theſe ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I ſee, and taſte, and feel, and am ſure of, the other I do but only hear of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not, they cannot ſo ſtrongly affect me: Were Heaven and the happineſs thereof ſet before my eyes, and did I ſee it as plainly and clearly as I do theſe things below, then indeed I ſhould not need many motives to provoke me to endeavour the obtaining of it. But alas, that is far above out of our ſight, the joys of Heaven are by the Apoſtle termed things not ſeen. Again, theſe outward and temporal enjoyments are preſent and eaſily obtainable; the other at a great diſtance, future, and beſides very hard to come by; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Surely it cannot be wiſdom to loſe a certain good for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hope; and for an ungrounded fear of Hell hereafter, to undergo a Purgatory here.</p>
            <p>To this argumentation upon the falſe foundation of the uncertainty of a future eſtate of endleſs happineſs or miſery, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as we have behaved our ſelves in this life, I anſwer,</p>

for he makes (as we ſaw before) the fear of eternal pain and miſery, to be the foundation of all Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now becauſe theſe Objectors do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Religion to themſelves and others as a melancholick and diſconſolate thing: and think and ſay, that thoſe that enter into this ſtate muſt bid adieu to all the pleaſures of ſence, and taſte no ſweetneſs in any worldly object. I ſhall endeavour to remove this prejudice. I ſay therefore, That our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God doth not envy us any real good that the Creatures can afford us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath not denied us a moderate uſe and fruition of any of them. And ſeeing he hath annexed pleaſure to thoſe actions that are neceſſary for the ſupport of life, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of kind, as a bait to invite us to the performance of them, it ſeems to me highly abſurd and contradictious to affirm, that he hath forbidden us to partake or taſte thoſe enjoyments which himſelf had appointed as effectual means for the ſecurity of thoſe great ends; and which are ſo neceſſary conſequents of thoſe actions, that we cannot but partake
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65250:129"/>
them. Where the Appetite is eager, God hath indulged, I might ſay commanded, a moderate and regular ſatisfaction. And we know, nay, the blindneſs of Atheiſm cannot deny, that the greateſt pleaſure reſults from a moderate and well circumſtantiated uſe of pleaſures. <hi>Voluptates commendat rarior uſus:</hi> Now a religious man enjoys all the pleaſures of theſe worldly and ſenſible goods, without any of the pain, which is annexed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and irregular uſe, or indeed abuſe of them: and beſides, his pleaſure is enhanſed, in that he beholds and receives them as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, and tokens of his favour and affection; and is without all fear of a future ſad reckoning for his participation of them. Howbeit a denial of our ſelves for Gods ſake and cauſe in any thing which we might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lawfully enjoy, though it be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet is accepted, and ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him.</p>
            <p>Others there are who grant, That theſe words grammatically ſignifie as we contend, and that eternal puniſhments are indeed threatned to the wicked; but ſay they, theſe threatnings are intended only, as <hi>terricula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,</hi> or Bug-bears to Children, to terrifie and keep people in awe, and to preſerve the World in ſome tolerable condition of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65250:129"/>
quietneſs. And <hi>Origen</hi> himſelf, though he be of opinion, that theſe threatnings ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie only temporary pains; yet he ſaith, that ſuch myſteries are to be ſealed up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the vulgar, leſt wicked men ſhould ruſh into ſin with all fury and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, if this bridle were taken off, who by the opinion and fear of eternal and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhments can ſcarce be deterred and reſtrained from it.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That it ſeems to me indecorous and unſuitable to the Perſon and Majeſty of God, to make uſe of ſuch ſorry and weak means to bring about his ends, as grave men can hardly condeſcend to. 2. I do not ſee how it can conſiſt with his Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in plain terms, abſolutely to threaten and affirm what he never intends to do.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is queſtionable, Whether it be allowable in man: it being at beſt but an officious Lye: for it is a ſpeaking what we do not think, and that with an intention to deceive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I proceed now to a ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the eternity of the pains and ſufferings of the Damned, and that is, it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency with the Juſtice of God. What proportion can there be between a tranſient and temporary act, and an eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The moſt rigid Juſtice can exact no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65250:130"/>
more than a <hi>talio,</hi> to ſuffer as I have done.

if I have hurt, or grieved, or injured any man, to be puniſhed with the ſame, or an equivalent ſuffering: if I have taken any unreaſonable pleaſure, to compenſate it with an anſwerable pain. Indeed the enormities of my life cannot well deſerve ſo much, if it be conſidered, that I have been ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated and inclined, and as it were fatally driven upon all the evils which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by thoſe affections and appetites, which I made not for my ſelf, but found in my ſelf; and have been expoſed to ſtrong and almoſt inexpugnable temptations from without; beſet with ſnares, encompaſſed about with innumerable evils.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer Firſt, That every ſin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or offence is aggravated and enhanſed by the dignity or merit of the perſon againſt whom it is committed. So Parricide is eſteemed a greater Crime than ordinary Murther, and by the Laws of all Nations avenged with a ſorer puniſhment. The like may be ſaid of <hi>laeſa Majeſtas</hi> or Treaſon. Now God is an infinite perſon, and Sin being an injury and affront to him, as being a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Law, an infinite puniſhment muſt be due to it.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the choice being referred to us to take of the two which we beſt like, eternal Death ſet before on the one hand, to make eternal life the more infinitely reaſonable for us to chuſe on the other hand, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Hell (whenſoever we fall into it) being perfectly our own</hi> Act, <hi>neither forced on us by any abſolute Decree of God, nor irreſiſtible temptation of the Devil or our own fleſh; but as truly our wiſh and choice and mad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, nay, much more truly and properly, than</hi> eternal Heaven <hi>is</hi> (<hi>when our obedience is firſt wrought by Gods grace, and yet after that ſo abundantly rewarded by the</hi> Doner) <hi>it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if there be any thing irrational, it is in us unkind and perverſe creatures (ſo obſtinate to chuſe what God ſo paſſionately warns us to take heed of; ſo wilfully to dye, when God ſwears he wills not our death) and not in him, who hath done all that is imaginable to be done to reaſonable creatures (here in their way or courſe) to the reſcuing or ſaving of us.</hi>

               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65250:131"/>But to this may be replied, If the thing it ſelf be unjuſt, how can our chuſing of it make it juſt? How can it be juſt to annex ſuch a penalty as eternal Hell to a ſhort and tranſient offence? Suppoſe a Prince ſhould make a Law, that whoſoever did not riſe up and bow himſelf before an old man, ſhould be put to Death with torments; and one of his Subjects knowingly ſhould tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs this Law upon ſome great temptation; would it not be accounted Cruelty in the Prince to execute this Law upon him? Laws may be unjuſt upon account of diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate penalties. Neither doth our choice much help the matter, for that is but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our error or folly, or, if you will, madneſs, which doth as little deſerve eternal death as the ſin committed doth.</p>
            <p>If any man be diſſatisfied with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent anſwers, all that I have to add further, is, that before this ſentence adjudging to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death be pronounced againſt him, and executed upon him, there ſhall be ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made, as ſhall convince and ſatisfie him of the righteouſneſs thereof. And this the Apoſtle ſeems to intimate <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. when he calls the great day of Doom, the day of the Revelation of the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Then ſhall be made appear
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65250:131"/>
what now to our dimſighted reaſon is not penetrable; How the Juſtice of God can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the eternal damnation of the wicked.</p>
            <p>As for mans being as it were fatally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to evil by the ſtrength of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the violence of unruly and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong paſſions and appetites: I anſwer, That there are motives and conſiderations ſufficient to enable a man to reſiſt and repel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and overcome the moſt alluring and faſcinating temptations, the moſt urging and importunate appetites or affections; ſuch are certain ſhame and diſgrace, and that not long to come, eternal infamy and diſhonour; preſent death, ſtrong fear and dread of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death, or ſad and intolerable pains or calamities. Now the Divine threatnings are of the greateſt and moſt formidable evils and miſeries that Humane Nature is capable of ſuffering; and therefore were they but firmly believed and apprehended, they would be of force ſufficient to ſtir up in us ſuch ſtrong paſſions of fear and terror, as would eaſily chaſe away all temptations, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter all the baits of ſenſual pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There remains yet a third Objection againſt an eternal Hell, and that is, that it is inconſiſtent with the Divine Goodneſs. For
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65250:132"/>
the Unbeliever will ſay, It's contrary to all the Notions and <hi>Ideas</hi> I have of God, to conceive him to be ſo angry and furious a Being. How can it ſtand with Infinite Goodneſs to make a Creature that he fore-knew would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable? We men account it a piece of goodneſs to pardon offences: And all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are intended either for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and amendment of the Offender, or if he be unreclaimable to prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which he might otherwiſe do, or for an example to others to deter them from the like enormities: but I do not ſee for what ſuch end any man can be eternally tormented. So that of ſuch inflictions one may rationally demand, <hi>cui bono?</hi> What good comes of them? How then can they come from God, who by all mens confeſſion is infinitely Good?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer: Firſt, That God is juſt as well as good. You will ſay, what is Juſtice? It is an equal weighing of Actions, and rendring to every one his Right or Due. A ſetting ſtreight again what was perverted by the ſins and extravagancies of Men. Now that the breaking of order and equality in the world, this uſurping and encroaching upon others Rights is a great Evil and ought to be rectified, ſome may take an Argument
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65250:132"/>
from the ſtrong inclination and deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge Injuries, that is implanted in the nature of Man, and of all Creatures. You'll ſay, all deſire of revenge is abſolutely ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. I anſwer, I am no patron of Revenge. I know the very Heathen by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemned it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>

               </q>
               <hi>Revenge is the pleaſure of a weak and poor ſpirit.</hi> Yet let us hear what they have to ſay. 1. It is hard to affirm, that any innate appetite or deſire is in it ſelf ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and in all Circumſtances whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unlawful, for this ſeems to reflect upon the Author of Nature.</p>
            <p>To which may be anſwered, that a well circumſtantiated deſire of revenge may not be in it ſelf unlawful, yet for the evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of it, it may be, and is prohibited by a poſitive Law. 2. Divine perſons have prayed to God to avenge them, as <hi>David</hi> and the Prophets. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. prays God to <hi>reward Alexander the Copperſmith according to his works.</hi> To which may be anſwered, that thoſe Expreſſions are rather Predictions of what ſhould befal their
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65250:133"/>
Enemies, than deſires that they might. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whereas it is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>That the Souls of them under the altar that were ſlain for the word of God and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which they held, cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the earth:</hi> Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaith, it ſignifies no more, than that their Blood cries to God for Vengeance, as <hi>Abel</hi>'s is ſaid to do. The Nature of Forgiveneſs ſeems to imply the Lawfulneſs of ſome deſire of Revenge. For what is Forgiveneſs but a parting with, and a renouncing the Right I have to be avenged, and therefore before I forgive I do retain at leaſt ſome will to be revenged. And I am not obliged by our Saviour to forgive abſolutely, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Repentance. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>If thy brother ſin againſt thee rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him,</hi> &amp;c. And in the Lord's Prayer one Petition is, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> But God forgives not without Repentance. To which may be anſwered, That before Repentance, I may retain a will of puniſhing an Offender for his own Good and Reformation, but with no reſpect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging what is paſt. And if his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65250:133"/>
prevents his puniſhment, then I am to forgive him, that is, ceaſe to deſire his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But all allow Vengeance to be juſt in God, whoſe Actions are not to be ſcanned by our Meaſures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be juſt with God to propoſe to us ſuch a choice as Heaven upon condition of our Obedience to his Law, or Hell in caſe of Diſobedience; as we ſee ſome wiſe Men make no ſcruple to grant; then it cannot be injuſtice in him to inflict the puniſhments of Hell upon them that make it their choice. Nay I cannot ſee how it can conſiſt with his Veracity not to do it; why then ſhould any Argument from his Goodneſs move us to diſtruſt his Veracity? To which I ſhall add, That the very being of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in the World is as great an Argument againſt the Goodneſs of God, as the eternal puniſhment of it: Sith we muſt needs grant, that God Almighty Bleſſed for ever, could, if he had pleaſed, have prevented it. If any Man ſhall ſay, This was not poſſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing the very Nature of Man, and taking away the Liberty of his Will. To him I reply, How then can he confirm the Bleſſed, reſerving their Liberty? Or muſt we ſay with <hi>Origen,</hi> That they are in a mutable ſtate too and that Heaven will
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65250:134"/>
have an end as well as Hell? If any Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill unſatisfied with what hath been ſaid, I muſt refer him for full ſatisfaction to the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God at that great day, of which mention hath been already made.</p>
            <p>I am as unwilling as any Man to limit the Mercies of God: but yet I muſt refer it to him, whether he will be more favourable than he hath threatened or no, whether he will remit ſomething of the Severity of his Comminations. I am alſo willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and confine the ſenſe of theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as far as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text will permit. But let our Opinions and Hopes of the Mercies of God and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Hell be what they will; a temporary Hell, I ſay, or rather a <hi>Purgatory</hi> inſtead of Hell: For the word Hell, according to the uſual acception of it, includes Eternity. I ſhall propoſe two things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Origen</hi> the firſt Broacher of this Opinion of the Determination of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the Damned, doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the contrary Doctrine is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to reſtrain the common People from Sin: and that this is to be held as a great Secret, and ſtudiouſly concealed from them. Now if it be of ſuch eminent uſe to them, why
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65250:134"/>
may it not alſo be to the Learned and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; who, I fear me, may want ſuch a Bridle as well as they?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since God hath threatned eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, whether he intends to execute them upon us or no, it is clear, I think, he would have them be believed by us, elſe they cannot have that end and effect he deſigned them to; and therefore it muſt be unbelief and preſumption in us to deny or diſtruſt them, tho upon ſuppoſition, that they are irreconcileable with his Goodneſs; with which yet perhaps they may accord well enough, tho we cannot at preſent diſcern it. All Divine Revelations are to be believed and accepted by us, as well Threatnings as Promiſes; and if we may diſtruſt the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God in them, I know not but we may as well do it in theſe: if we deny the Eternity of the Torments of Hell, I do not ſee but that we may upon as good grounds with <hi>Origen</hi> deny the Eternity of the Joys of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Let not then the preſumption of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Hell encourage thee to go on in ſin: for, I fear, ſuch a Perſuaſion may have an ill influence on the manners of Men. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the very ſting of Hell: take that out, and the Sinner will think it tractable enough.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65250:135"/>
The very thought of an eternal Hell inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening (and it will often intrude it ſelf) ſtrikes a cold damp to his very Heart in the midſt of his Jollities, end will much qualifie and allay all his Pleaſures and Enjoyments. Rid him of this fear, and he will be apt to deſpiſe Hell and all its Torments, be they never ſo grievous or laſting. Take off this Bridle, and, as we hinted before, he will ruſh into Sin <hi>as a Horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi> He will be ready thereupon thus to argue with himſelf, What need I take ſo much pains to ſtrive againſt Sin? What need I ſwim againſt the Stream, and reſiſt the Tide and Eddy of my Paſſions, my natural Appetites and Inclinations, and the Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Company? What need I maintain ſuch a conſtant Watch and Ward againſt my ſpiritual Enemies, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh? If I fall into Hell at laſt, that is no eternal State, it laſteth but for a time, and will come to an end. I'll venture it: I hope I ſhall make a ſhift to rub through well enough. Let me ask thee, But how if thou ſhouldeſt find thy ſelf miſtaken? If the Event ftuſtrate thy Hopes, and fall out contrary to thy Expectation? What a ſad caſe wilt thou be in then? How will the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedneſs thereof double thy Miſery?
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65250:135"/>
               <hi>Improviſa graviùs feriunt.</hi> How wilt thou be ſtrucken as it were with a Thunderbolt, when the Almighty Judge ſhall fulminate againſt thee a dreadful indeed, but by thee formerly undreaded Sentence, adjudging thee to endleſs Puniſhments? How wilt thou damn thine own Credulity, who by a groundleſs Belief of a temporary Hell, haſt precipitated thy ſelf into an eternal, which otherwiſe thou mighteſt poſſibly have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided?</p>
            <p>Well, but ſuppoſe there be ſome ſhadow of hope of the determination of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Damned: It is by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a great piece of folly to leave matters of the higheſt moment, and which moſt nearly concern us, at uncertainties: and a point of Wiſdom, to ſecure the main chance, and to be provided againſt the worſt that can come. An eternal Heaven or ſtate of compleat happineſs is the main chance, and is not to come into any competition, or ſo much as to be put into the ballance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a few ſhort, tranſient, ſordid, loathed, and for the moſt part upon their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count repented pleaſures: To ſecure to our ſelves an intereſt in ſuch a ſtate is our greateſt wiſdom. And as for being provided againſt the worſt that may or can come.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65250:136"/>
What can be worſe than an eternal Hell? which, there is I do not ſay a poſſibility, but the greateſt probability imaginable, that it will be our portion; if we perſiſt in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, and dye in our ſins. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the beſt ſhould happen that we can hope or conceive, that Hell ſhould laſt only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for Ages of Ages, and at laſt determine: do we think this a ſmall matter? If we do, it is for want of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and experience of acute pains. Should any of us be under the ſenſe and ſuffering of a raging Paroxyſm of the Stone, or Gout, or Collick, I doubt not but rather than endure it for ten thouſand years he would willingly part with all his expectation of a bleſſed eſtate after that term were expired, yea, and his being to boot. But what are any of theſe pains to the torments and perpeſſions of Hell? or the duration of ten thouſand years to thoſe Ages of Ages? If thou makeſt light of all this, and nothing can reſtrain thee from ſin, but the eternity of puniſhment, thou art bound to thank God, who hath uſed this only effectual means, threatning an eternal Hell. And it ill becomes thee to complain of his rigour and ſeverity, who wouldeſt have made ſo pernicious an uſe of his lenity and goodneſs. But thou who haſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65250:136"/>
entertained ſuch an Opinion, and abuſeſt it to encourage thy ſelf to go on in thy ſins, though others ſhould eſcape with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary puniſhment, ſurely thou haſt no reaſon to expect any milder doom, than to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to an eternal.</p>

               <hi>Eſtimate of the Quantity of Vapour raiſed out of the Sea by the warmth of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. which upon ſecond Thoughts I find reaſon to revoke. For that the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea doth not communicate with the <hi>Ocean</hi> by any ſubterraneous Paſſages, nor thereby impart any Water to it, or receive any from it, may be demonſtrated, from that the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> of it is lower than the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Ocean, as appears from the Waters running in at the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi>; for if there were any ſuch Communications, the Water keeping its Level, the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> being the loweſt, muſt by thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages receive Waters from the <hi>Ocean</hi>; and not the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which is (as we have proved) the higheſt, from the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> Hence it neceſſarily follows, that the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſpends more in Vapour than it receives from the Rivers; which is Mr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Concluſion; tho in ſome of his Premiſes or <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> he is, I think, miſtaken, as 1. In that he enumerates the <hi>Tyber</hi> amongſt his nine great Rivers, each of which may yield ten times as much Water as the <hi>Thames</hi>; whereas I queſtion whether that yields once ſo much; and whereas
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65250:138"/>
he paſſes by all the reſt of the Rivers as ſmaller than it; there are two that I have ſeen in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, whereof the one, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Arnus,</hi> on which <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> ſtand, ſeemed to me not inferiour in bigneſs to the <hi>Tiber</hi>; and the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Atheſis</hi> on which <hi>Verona</hi> ſtands, I could not gueſs to be leſs than twice as big. 2. In that he thinks himſelf too liberal in allowing theſe nine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to carry down each of them ten times ſo much Water as the <hi>Thames</hi> doth. Whereas one of thoſe nine, and that none of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt neither, <hi>viz.</hi> the River <hi>Po,</hi> if <hi>Ricciolus</hi> his <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> and Calculations be good, affords more Water in an hour, than Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> ſuppoſes the <hi>Thames</hi> to do in a day; the hourly Effuſions of the <hi>Po</hi> being rated at eighteen millions of Cubical Paces by <hi>Ricciolus</hi>; whereas the daily ones of the <hi>Thames</hi> are computed to be no more than twenty five millions three hundred forty four thouſand Cubical Yards of Water by Mr. <hi>Halley:</hi> but a Geometrical Pace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains five Feet, <hi>i.e.</hi> 1⅔ of a Yard. Now if the <hi>Po</hi> pours ſo much Water hourly into the Sea, what then muſt the <hi>Danow</hi> and the <hi>Nile</hi> do? each of which cannot (I gueſs) be leſs than treble of the <hi>Po. Tanau, Boryſthenes</hi> and <hi>Rhodanus</hi> may equal, if not exceed it. Howbeit I cannot approve <hi>Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciolus</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:65250:138"/>
his <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> judging them to be too exceſſive, but do believe that as to the whole Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> comes nearer the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sure enough it is, that in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> the Receipts from the Rivers fall ſhort of the Expence in Vapour: tho in part of it, that is the <hi>Euxine,</hi> the Receipts exceed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that there is a conſtant Current ſets outward from thence through the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Boſphorus,</hi> and <hi>Helleſpont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> doth indeed evaporate more than it receives from the Rivers, yet I believe, the Caſe is not the ſame with the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea; the <hi>Superficies</hi> whereof ſeems to me not to bear any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion to the Waters of the Rivers that run into it, than that of the <hi>Euxine</hi> doth to it; which we have obſerved not to ſpend the whole Receipt in Vapour.</p>
            <p>You'll ſay, Why then do not great Floods raiſe the Seas? I anſwer, As to the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> if it communicates with the Ocean, whether the Rivers bring down more or leſs, its all one; if more, then the Water keeping its Level, the <hi>Caſpian</hi> raiſeth the <hi>Ocean</hi>; if leſs, then the <hi>Ocean</hi> communicates to the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> and raiſes that. But as to the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi> we may ſay, that when it receives more on the one ſide, it receives leſs on the other, the Floods and Ebbs of the <hi>Nilus</hi> and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65250:139"/>
the other Rivers counterbalancing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Beſides by reaſon of the Snows lying upon the Mountains all Winter, the greateſt Floods of thoſe great Rivers in <hi>Europe</hi> do not happen when the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates leaſt in the Winter-time; but in the Spring.</p>
            <p>You'll demand further, if the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> evaporates ſo much what becomes of all this Vapour? I anſwer, it is caſt off upon the Mountains, and on their ſides and tops is condenſed into Water; and ſo returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Rivers unto the Sea.</p>
            <p>If you proceed to ask what becomes of the Surpluſage of the Water, which the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> receives from the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and ſpends in vapour; I anſwer, It ſeems to me, that it muſt be caſt further off over the tops of the Mountains, and ſupply in part Rain to theſe Northern Countries: for we know that the South-Wind brings Rain, with us and all <hi>Europe</hi> over.</p>
            <p>As to the great Ocean, I do not believe that it evaporates ſo much as the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>; both 1. Becauſe the whole <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> excepting the <hi>Euxine,</hi> lies in a hot Climate, and a great part of it as it were in a Valley, Ridges of high Mountains, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Apennine,</hi> &amp;c. on the other running along it. And
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65250:139"/>
2. Becauſe the Surface of the whole <hi>Ocean</hi> bears a greater proportion to the Waters it receives from the Rivers of at leaſt this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, than that of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> doth to its. And therefore I think alſo that Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> exceeds in his Eſtimate of the Heat of the Superficies of the Sea Water. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade my ſelf, that were it all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, I mean the hotter part with the cooler all the Surface over to ſuch a thickneſs, it would equal the heat of our Air in the hotteſt time of Summer. But I leave that to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trial and Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Here give me leave to ſuggeſt, that we are not to think, that all the Vapours that ſupply our Rains and Dews proceed from the Sea; no a great part of them, <hi>viz.</hi> all that, when condenſed, waters the Earth, and ſerves for the Nutrition of Plants and Animals, (if not the ſame individual Water at leaſt ſo much) was exhaled out of the Earth before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again in Showers and Dews upon it. So that we receive no more from the Sea, than what the Rivers carry back, and pour into it again. But ſuppoſing Mr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> to be good, and that the <hi>Ocean</hi> doth evaporate, and caſt off to the dry Land 1/10 of an inch thickneſs daily, and this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for the Supply of all the Rivers; how intolerably extravagant muſt their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65250:140"/>
be, who ſuppoſe the Rivers of all the World together to yield half an Ocean of Water daily? Though I muſt confeſs my ſelf to be at a loſs as to thoſe vaſt Rivers of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> of ninety Miles broad; for if they ſhould run with any thing a ſwift Current, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ineſtimable what a quantity of Water they may pour forth. All therefore that I have to ſay of them is, that we want a true Hiſtory and Account of their <hi>Phaenomena</hi> from their Fountains to their Out-lets.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 72. <hi>lin.</hi> 29. and of Gravity;</p>
            <p>I add alſo of Magnitude: which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly convenient, as well for the facility as the equability of the Earths diurnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Continents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſperſed equally on all ſides of the Globe makes theſe Centers concur in one Point, whatever cauſe we aſſign of the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Dry Land at the firſt. Whereas if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Dry Land to have been raiſed by Earthquakes only on one ſide of the Globe, and to have caſt off the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the other, and alſo that the Water could find no way into the Caverns that were left within; then the watery ſide muſt needs preponderate the land-ſide, and bring the Center of Gravity nearer to its Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and ſo raiſe the land-ſide ſtill a great deal higher, and make a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65250:140"/>
between the Centers of Magnitude and of Gravity. In our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the equal diſperſion of the Continents and Iſlands no ſuch thing would happen: but each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, taking it with all its internal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, whether lighter or heavier than its bulk in Water, that is, Whether the Water did make its way into the Caverns thereof, or did not; (for in the firſt Caſe it would be heavier, in the ſecond lighter) would have its counterpoiſe on the oppoſite ſide; ſo that the Centers would ſtill concur. The Caſe would be the ſame if the Dry Land were diſcovered, and the Mountains raiſed by the immediate application of the Divine Power.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 94. after <hi>lin.</hi> 15. add,</p>
            <p>Since the receipt of this Letter, an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment (give me leave ſo to call it) occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me, which much confirmed me in the belief and perſuaſion of the truth of thoſe Hiſtories and Relations which Writers and Travellers have delivered to us concerning Dropping Trees in <hi>Ferro, S. Thome, Guiny, &amp;c.</hi> of which before I was ſomewhat diffident; and likewiſe in the approbation of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> of my Learned Friend Dr. <hi>Tancred Robinſon</hi> for the ſolving of that <hi>Phoenomenon.</hi> The ſame alſo induces me to believe, that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours may have a greater intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Springs even in temperate and cold
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65250:141"/>
Regions, than I had before thought. The Experiment or Obſervation is this,</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>December</hi> 1691. there happened to be a Miſt, and that no very thick one, which continued all day: the Vapour whereof, notwithſtanding the Trees were wholly diveſted of Leaves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed ſo faſt upon their naked Branches and Twigs, that they dropped all day at ſuch a rate, that I believe the Water deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from a large Tree in twenty four hours, had it been all received and reſerved in a Veſſel, might have amounted to a Hoggs-head. What then may we rationally conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, would have dropped from ſuch a Tree; had it been covered with Leaves of a denſe Texture, and ſmooth <hi>Superficies,</hi> apt to collect the Particles of the Vapour, and unite them into Drops?</p>
            <p>It is clear by this effect, that Trees do deſtil Water a pace when Clouds or Miſts hang about them; which they are reported by <hi>Benzo</hi> conſtantly to do about the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tree in <hi>Ferro</hi>; except when the Sun ſhines hot upon it. And others tell us, that that Tree grows upon a Mountain too: So that it is no wonder, that it ſhould drop abundance of Water. What do I ſpeak of that Tree? all the Trees of that kind grow on the ſides of vaſt Mountains, as Dr. <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:65250:141"/>
hath noted. Beſides that in hot Regions Trees may in the night time deſtil Water, though the Air be clear, and there be no Miſt about them, ſeems neceſſarily to follow, from Mr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Experiment.</p>
            <p>Now if there be in Miſts thus much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour condenſed upon Trees, doubtleſs alſo there is in proportion as much upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth and the Graſs: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, upon the Tops and Ridges of high Mountains, which are frequently covered with Clouds or Miſts, much more, ſo much as muſt needs have a great intereſt in the production and ſupply of Springs, even in temperate Countries.</p>
            <p>But that inviſible Vapours, when the Sky is clear, do at any time condenſe ſo faſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Trees, as to make them drop, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerved in <hi>England</hi> or elſewhere, no not in the Night-ſeaſon; though I do not deny, but upon the <hi>Appennine</hi> and Southern ſide of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and elſewhere in the hotter parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in Summer Nights they may. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſidering the Penetrancy of ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, that in moiſt Wether they will inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves deeply into the Pores of dry Wood, ſo that Doors will then hardly ſhut, and Chinks and Crannies in Boards and Floors be cloſed up, I know not but that they may likewiſe ſtrike deep into the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65250:142"/>
Ground, and together with Miſts contribute to the feeding and maintenance of Springs, in Winter-time, when the Sun exhales but little; it being an Obſervation of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note n="*" place="margin">Meteor lib. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> Artic. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Fromondus, Quod hyeme nec nivali, nec imbrifera fontes tamen aquam largiùs quàm aeſtate (niſi valdè pluvia ſit) vomant. That in Winters neither ſnowy nor rainy, yet foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains powre forth more Water than in Summer, unleſs it happen to be a very wet ſeaſon.</hi> Yet are their Contributions inconſiderable, if compared with the ſupplies that are afforded by Rains. And one reaſon why in Winter Fountains flow more plentifully may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Sun defrauds them not, nor exhales any thing out of the Earth, as in Summer time he doth.</p>
            <p>Therefore whenever in this Work I have aſſigned Rain to be a ſufficient or only cauſe of Springs and Rivers, I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to exclude, but to comprehend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Miſts and Vapours; which I grant to have ſome intereſt in the production of them, even in Temperate and Cold Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and a very conſiderable one in Hot. Though I cannot be perſuaded, that even there they are the ſole Cauſe of Springs, for that there fall ſuch plentiful and long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing Rains, both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> in the Summer Months: which muſt
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65250:142"/>
needs contribute ſomething to their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>

            <p>This end and uſe of Mountains I find aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Mr. <hi>Halley</hi> in his Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Original of Springs and Rivers,<note place="margin">Philoſ. Tranſ. num. <hi>192.</hi>
               </note> in theſe words: This, if we may allow Final Cauſes, (and why may we not? What needs this heſitancy and dubitation in a thing that is clear?) ſeems to be the Deſign of the Hills, That their Ridges being placed through the midſt of the Continents, might ſerve as it were Alembicks to diſtil freſh Water for the uſe of Man and Beaſt; and their heights to give a deſcent to thoſe Streams, to run gently like ſo many Veins of the Macrocoſm, to be the more beneficial to the Creation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 170. <hi>lin.</hi> 10. add,</p>
            <p>To ſumm up all relating to the Diviſion and Diſpoſition of the Water and Earth in brief.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, the Water being the lighter Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth naturally occupy the upper place, and ſtand above the Earth, and ſo at firſt it did. But now we ſee it doth not ſo; the Earth being contrary to its nature forcibly elevated above it; being (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> phraſeth it) founded above the Seas, and eſtabliſhed above the Floods: and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65250:143"/>
this becauſe it was beſt it ſhould be ſo, as I ſhall clearly prove and deduce in particulars in another Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dry Land is not elevated only upon one ſide of the Globe; for then had it had high Mountains in the middle of it, with ſuch vaſt empty Cavities within, as muſt be equal to the whole Bulk raiſed up, the Center of Magnitude muſt needs have been conſiderably diſtant from the Center of Gravity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which would have cauſed a very great and inconvenient inequality in the Motion of the parts of the Earth: but the Continents and Iſlands are ſo equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt all the Globe over as to counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance one another, ſo that the Centers of Magnitude and Gravity concur in one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Continents are not of exactly equal and level <hi>Superficies</hi> or Convexity. For then the Parts ſubject to the Courſe of the Sun, called the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> would have been, as the Ancients fancied them, unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable for Heat and Drought. But there are huge Ridges and extended Chains of lofty Mountains, directed for the moſt part to run Eaſt and Weſt; by which Means they give free Admittance and Paſſage to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours brought in by the Winds from the <hi>Atlantick</hi> and <hi>Pacifick</hi> Oceans; but ſtop and inhibit their Excurſions to the North and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65250:143"/>
South, either condenſing them upon their ſides into the Water, by a kind of external Deſtillation; or by ſtreightening and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of them compelling them to gather into Drops, and deſcend down in Rain.</p>
            <p>Theſe are great things, and worthy the Care, Direction, and Diſpoſal of the Great and Wiſe Creator and Governor of all things: And we ſee they are accordingly excellently ordered and provided by him.</p>
