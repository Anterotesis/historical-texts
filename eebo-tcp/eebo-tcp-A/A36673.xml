         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A Poem with so bold a Title, and a Name prefix'd, from which
the handling of so serious a Subject wou'd not be expected,
may reasonably oblige the Author, to say somewhat in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
both of himself, and of his undertaking. In the first
place, if it be objected to me that being a <hi>Layman,</hi> I ought not to have
concern'd my self with Speculations, which belong to the Profession of
<hi>Divinity;</hi> I cou'd Answer, that perhaps, Laymen, with equal advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Parts and Knowledge, are not the most incompetent Judges of
Sacred things; But in the due sense of my own weakness and want of
Learning, I plead not this: I pretend not to make my self a Judge of
Faith, in others, but onely to make a Confession of my own; I lay no
unhallow'd hand upon the Ark; but wait on it, with the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that becomes me at a distance: In the next place I will
ingenuously confess, that the helps I have us'd in this small
Treatise, were many of them taken from the Works of our own
Reverend Divines of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> so that the Weapons with
which I Combat Irreligion, are already Consecrated; though I suppose
they may be taken down as lawfully as the Sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> was by
<hi>David,</hi> when they are to be employed for the common Cause, against
the Enemies of Piety. I intend not by this to intitle them to any of my
errours; which, yet, I hope are only those of Charity to Mankind; and
such as my <hi>own</hi> Charity has caus'd me to commit, that of <hi>others</hi>
may more easily excuse. Being naturally inclin'd to Scepticism in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
I have no reason to impose my Opinions, in a Subject which
is above it: But whatever they are, I submit them with all reverence
to my Mother Church, accounting them no further mine, than as they
are Authoriz'd, or at least, uncondemn'd by her. And, indeed, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my self on this side, I have us'd the necessary Precaution, of show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Paper before it was Publish'd to a judicious and learned Friend,
a Man indefatigably zealous in the service of the Church and State:
and whose Writings, have highly deserv'd of both. He was pleas'd to
approve the body of the Discourse, and I hope he is more my Friend,
than to do it out of Complaisance: 'Tis true he had too good a tast to
<pb facs="tcp:48931:3"/>
like it all; and amongst some other faults recommended to my
second view, what I have written, perhaps too boldly on St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius:</hi>
which he advised me wholy to omit. I am sensible enough
that I had done more <hi>prudently</hi> to have follow'd his opinion: But then
I could not have satisfied my self, that I had done honestly not to have
written what was my own. It has always been my <hi>thought,</hi> that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who never did, nor without Miracle cou'd hear of the name of
Christ were yet in a possibility of Salvation. Neither will it enter easily
into my belief, that before the coming of our Saviour, the whole World,
excepting only the Iewish Nation, shou'd lye under the inevitable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of everlasting Punishment, for want of that Revelation, which was
confin'd to so small a spot of ground as that of <hi>Palaestine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Among the Sons
of <hi>Noah</hi> we read of one onely who was accurs'd; and if a blessing in the
ripeness of time was reserv'd for <hi>Iaphet,</hi> (of whose Progeny we are,) it
seems unaccountable to me, why so many Generations of the same
Offspring, as preceeded our Saviour in the Flesh, shou'd be all involv'd
in one common condemnation, and yet that their Posterity shou'd be
Intitled to the hopes of Salvation: As if a Bill of Exclusion had passed only
on the Fathers, which debar'd not the Sons from their Succession. Or
that so many Ages had been <hi>deliver'd over</hi> to Hell, and so many <hi>reserv'd</hi> for
Heaven, and that the Devil had the first choice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God the next. Truly I
am apt to think, that the revealed Religion which was taught by <hi>Noah</hi> to
all his Sons, might continue for some Ages in the whole Posterity. That
afterwards it was included wholly in the Family of <hi>Sem</hi> is manifest: but
when the Progenies of <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> swarm'd into Colonies, and those
Colonies were subdivided into many others; in process of time their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants
lost by little and little the Primitive and Purer Rites of Divine
Worship, retaining onely the notion of one Deity; to which succeeding
Generations added others: (for Men took their Degrees in those Ages
from Conquerours to Gods.) Revelation being thus Eclipsed to almost
all Mankind, the light of Nature as the next in Dignity was substituted;
and that is it which St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes to be the Rule of the Heathens;
and by which they are hereafter to be judg'd. If my supposition be
true, then the consequence which I have assum'd in my Poem may be
also true; namely, that Deism, or the Principles of Natural Worship,
are onely the faint remnants or dying flames of reveal'd Religion in the
Posterity of <hi>Noah:</hi> And that our Modern Philosophers, nay and some
of our Philosophisiing Divines have too much exalted the faculties of
our Souls, when they have maintain'd that by their force, mankind has
been able to find out that there is one Supream Agent or Intellectual
Being which we call God: that Praise and Prayer are his due Worship;
<pb facs="tcp:48931:3"/>
and the rest of those deducements, which I am confident are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
effects of Revelation, and unatainable by our Discourse, I mean
as simply considerd, and without the benefit of Divine Illumination. So
that we have not lifted up our selves to God, by the weak Pinions of
our Reason, but he has been pleasd to descend to us: and what <hi>Socrates</hi>
said of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what <hi>Plato</hi> writ, and the rest of the Heathen Philosophers
of several Nations, is all no more than the Twilight of Revelation, after
the Sun of it was set in the Race of <hi>Noah.</hi> That there is some thing above
us, some Principle of <hi>motion,</hi> our Reason can apprehend, though it
cannot discover what it is, by its own Vertue. And indeed 'tis very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we who by the strength of our faculties cannot enter into
the knowledg of any <hi>Beeing,</hi> not so much as of our <hi>own,</hi> should be
able to find out by them, that Supream Nature, which we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
define, than by saying it is Infinite; as if Infinite were definable,
or Infinity a Subject for our narrow understanding. They who wou'd
prove Religion by Reason, do but weaken the cause which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to support: 'tis to take away the Pillars from our Faith, and to
prop it onely with a twig: 'tis to design a Tower like that of <hi>Babel,</hi>
which if it were possible (as it is not) to reach Heaven, would come
to nothing by the confusion of the Workmen. For every man is Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a several way; impotently conceipted of his own Model, and his
own Materials: Reason is always striving, and always at a loss, and of
necessity it must so come to pass, while 'tis exercis'd about that which is
not its proper object. Let us be content at last, to know God, by his
own Methods; at least so much of him, as he is pleas'd to reveal to us,
in the sacred Scriptures; to apprehend them to be the word
of God, is all our Reason has to do; for all beyond it is the
work of Faith, which is the Seal of Heaven impress'd upon our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
understanding.</p>
            <p>And now for what concerns the Holy Bishop <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the Preface of
whose Creed seems inconsistent with my opinion; which is, That Heathens
may possibly be sav'd; in the first place I desire it may be consider'd that
it is the Preface onely, not the Creed it self, which, (till I am better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd)
is of too hard a digestion for my Charity. 'Tis not that I am
ignorant how many several Texts of Scripture seemingly support that
Cause; but neither am I ignorant how all those Texts may receive a
kinder, and more mollified Interpretation. Every man who is read in
Church History, knows <hi>that</hi> Belief was drawn up after a long contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with <hi>Arrius,</hi> concerning the Divinity of our Blessed Saviour, and
his being one Substance with the Father; and that thus compild, it was
sent abroad among the Christian Churches, as a kind of Test, which
<pb facs="tcp:48931:4"/>
whosoever took, was look'd on as an Orthodox Believer. 'Tis manifest
from hence, that the Heathen part of the Empire was not concerned in
it: for its business was not to distinguish betwixt Pagans and Christians,
but betwixt Heriticks and true Believers. This, well consider'd, takes
off the heavy weight of Censure, which I wou'd willingly avoid from so
venerable a Man; for if this Proportion, <hi>whosoever will be sav'd,</hi> be
restrained onely, to those to whom it was intended, and for whom it was
compos'd, I mean the Christians; then the Anathema, reaches not the
Heathens, who had never heard of Christ, and were nothing interessed
in that dispute. After all, I am far from blaming even that Prefatory
addition to the Creed, and as far from cavilling at the continuation of
it in the Liturgy of the Church; where on the days appointed, 'tis pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
read: For I suppose there is the same reason for it now, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Socinians, as there was then against the Arrians; the one
being a Heresy, which seems to have been refin'd out of the other; and
with how much more plausibility of Reason it combats our Religion,
with so much more caution to be avoided: and therefore the prudence
of our Church is to be commended which has interpos'd her Authority
for the recommendation of this Creed. Yet to such as are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the true belief, those explanatory Creeds, the <hi>Nicene</hi> and this of
<hi>Athanasius</hi> might perhaps be spar'd: for what is supernatural, will always
be a mystery in spight of Exposition: and for my own part the plain
Apostles Creed, is most sutable to my weak understanding; as the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest
diet is the most easy of Digestion.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt longer on this Subject than I intended; and longer than,
perhaps, I ought; for having laid down, as my Foundation, that the
Scripture is a Rule; that in all things needfull to Salvation, it is clear,
sufficient, and ordain'd by God Almighty for that purpose, I have left
my self no right to interpret obscure places, such as concern the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of eternal happiness to Heathens: because whatsoever is obscure
is concluded not necessary to be known.</p>
            <p>But, by asserting the Scripture to be the Canon of our Faith, I have
unavoidably created to my self two sorts of Enemies: The Papists indeed,
more directly, because they have kept the Scripture from us, what they
cou'd; and have reserv'd to themselves a right of Interpreting what they
have deliver'd under the pretence of Infalibility: and the Fanaticks
more collaterally, because they have assum'd what amounts to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falibility,
in the private Spirit: and have detorted those Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are not necessary to Salvation, to the damnable uses of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
disturbance and destruction of the Civil Government. To begin
with the Papists, and to speak freely, I think them the less dangerous (at
<pb facs="tcp:48931:4"/>
least in appearance to our present State; for not onely the Penal Laws are
in Force against them, and their number is contemptible; but also their
Peerage and Commons are excluded from Parliaments, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
those Laws in no probability of being Repeal'd. A General
and Uninterrupted Plot of their Clergy, ever since the Reformation,
I suppose all Protestants believe. For 'tis not reasonable to think but
that so many of their Orders, as were outed from their fat possessions,
wou'd endeavour a reentrance against those whom they account Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
As for the late design, Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters, for ought I know
are the best Evidence; and what they discover, without wyre-drawing
their Sence, or malicious Glosses, all Men of reason conclude credible.
If there be any thing more than this requir'd of me, I must believe it
as well as I am able, in spight of the Witnesses, and out of a decent
conformity to the Votes of Parliament: For I suppose the Fanaticks
will not allow the private Spirit in this Case: Here the Infallibility is at
least in one part of the Government; and our understandings as well
as our wills are represented. But to return to the Roman Catholicks,
how can we be secure from the practice of Jesuited Papists in that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
For not two or three of that Order, as some of them would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon us, but almost the whole Body of them are of opinion, that
their Infallible Master has a right over Kings, not onely in Spirituals but
Temporals. Not to name <hi>Mariana, Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa, Molina, Santarel
Simancha,</hi> and at the least twenty others of Foreign Countries; we can
produce of our own Nation, <hi>Campian,</hi> and <hi>Doleman</hi> or <hi>Parsons,</hi> besides
many are nam'd whom I have not read, who all of them attest this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that the Pope can Depose and give away the Right of any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince, <hi>si vel paulum deflexerit,</hi> if he shall never so little Warpe: but
if he once comes to be Excommunicated, then the Bond of obedience is
taken off from Subjects; and they may and ought to drive him like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, ex hominum Christianorum Dominatu,</hi> from exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Dominion over Christians: and to this they are bound by virtue of
Divine Precept, and by all the tyes of Conscience under no less Penalty
than Damnation. If they answer me (as a Learned Priest has lately
Written,) that this Doctrine of the Jesuits is not <hi>de fide,</hi> and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they are not oblig'd by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must pardon me, if I think they
have said nothing to the purpose; for 'tis a Maxim in their Church,
where Points of Faith are not decided, and that Doctors are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinions, they may follow which part they please; but more
safely the most receiv'd and most Authoriz'd. And their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> has told the World, in his Apology, that the
King of <hi>England</hi> is a Vassal to the Pope, <hi>ratione directi Dominii,</hi> and that

was again ejected when our King submitted to the Church, and the
Crown receiv'd under the sordid Condition of a Vassalage.</p>
            <p>'Tis not sufficient for the more moderate and well-meaning Papists,
(of which I doubt not there are many) to produce the Evidences of
their Loyalty to the late King, and to declare their Innocency in this
Plot; I will grant their behaviour in the first, to have been as
Loyal and as brave as they desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will be willing to hold them
excus'd as to the second, (I mean when it comes to my turn, and after
my betters; for 'tis a madness to be sober alone, while the Nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
Drunk:) but that saying of their Father <hi>Cres</hi>: is still running in
my head, that they may be dispens'd with in their Obedience to an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
Prince, while the necessity of the times shall oblige them to it:
(for that (as another of them tells us,) is onely the effect of Christian
Prudence) but when once they shall get power to shake him off, an
Heretick is no lawful King, and consequently to rise against him is no
Rebellion. I should be glad there fore, that they wou'd follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which was charitably given them by a Reverend Prelate of our
Church; namely, that they would joyn in a publick Act of disowning
and detesting those Jesuitick Principles; and subscribe to all Doctrines
which deny the Popes Authority of Deposing Kings, and releasing
Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance: to which I shou'd think they
might easily be induc'd, if it be true that this present Pope has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
the Doctrine of King-killing (a Thesis of the Jesuites) amongst
others <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> (as they call it) or in open consistory.</p>
            <p>Leaving them, therefore, in so fair a way (if they please themselves)
of satisfying all reasonable Men, of their sincerity and good meaning
to the Government, I shall make bold to consider that other extream of
our Religion, I mean the Fanaticks, or Schismaticks, of the English
Church. Since the Bible has been Translated into our Tongue, they have
us'd it so, as if their business was not to be sa'vd but to be damnd by its
Contents. If we consider onely them, better had it been for the English
Nation, that it had still remain'd in the original Greek and Hebrew, or
at least in the honest Latine of St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> than that several Texts in it,
should have been prevaricated to the destruction of that Government,
which put it into so ungrateful hands.</p>
            <p>How many Heresies the first Translation of <hi>Tyndal</hi> produced in few
years, let my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>'s History of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth inform you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Insomuch that for the gross errours in it, and the great mischiefs it
<pb facs="tcp:48931:5"/>
occasion'd, a Sentence pass'd on the first Edition of the Bible, too shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
almost to be repeated. After the short Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth
(who had continued to carry on the Reformation, on other principles
than it was begun) every one knows that not onely the chief promoters
of that work, but many others, whose Consciences wou'd not dispence
with Popery, were forc'd, for fear of persecution, to change Climates:
from whence returning at the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them who had been in <hi>France,</hi> and at <hi>Geneva,</hi> brought back the
rigid opinions and imperious discipline of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to graffe upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Which, though they cunningly conceal'd at first, (as well
knowing how nauseously that Drug wou'd go down in a lawfull Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
which was prescrib'd for a rebellious Common-wealth) yet they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept it in reserve; and were never wanting to themselves either in
Court or Parliament, when either they had any prospect of a numerous
Party of Fanatique Members in the one, or the encouragement of any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
in the other, whose Covetousness was gaping at the Patrimony
of the Church. They who will consult the Works of our venerable
<hi>Hooker,</hi> or the account of his Life, or more particularly the Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to him on this Subject, by <hi>George Cranmer,</hi> may see by what grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they proceeded; from the dislike of Cap and Surplice, the very
next step was Admonitions to the Parliament against the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Ecclesiastical: then came out Volumes in English and Latin in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Tenets: and immediately, practices were set on foot to
erect their Discipline without Authority. Those not succeeding, Satyre
and Rayling was the next: And <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate</hi> (the <hi>Marvel</hi> of those
times) was the first Presbyterian Scribler, who sanctify'd Libels and Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
to the use of the Good Old Cause. Which was done (says my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour)
upon this account; that (their serious Treatises having been fully
answered and refuted) they might compass by rayling what they had
lost by reasoning; and when their Cause was sunk in Court and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they might at least hedge in a stake amongst the Rabble: for to
their ignorance all things are Wit which are abusive; but if Church
and State were made the Theme, then the Doctoral Degree of Wit was
to be taken at <hi>Billingsgate:</hi> even the most Saintlike of the Party, though
they durst not excuse this contempt and villifying of the Government,
yet were pleas'd, and grin'd at it with a pious smile; and call'd it a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God against the Hierarchy. Thus Sectaries, we may see, were
born with teeth, foul-mouth'd and scurrilous from their Infancy: and if
Spiritual Pride, Venome, Violence, Contempt of Superiours and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
had been the marks of Orthodox Belief; the Presbytery and the rest
of our Schismaticks, which are their Spawn, were always the most visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church in the Christian World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48931:6"/>
'Tis true, the Government was too strong at that time for a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but to shew what proficiency they had made in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s School, even
<hi>Then</hi> their mouths water'd at it: for two of their gifted Brotherhood
(<hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi>) as the Story tells us, got up into a Pease-Cart, and
harangued the People, to dispose them to an insurrection, and to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
their Discipline by force: so that however it comes about, that now
they celebrate Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Birth-night, as that of their Saint and
Patroness; yet then they were for doing the work of the Lord by Arms
against her; and in all probability, they wanted but a Fanatique Lord
Mayor and two Sheriffs of their Party to have compass'd it.</p>
            <p>Our venerable <hi>Hooker,</hi> after many Admonitions which he had given
them, toward the end of his Preface, breaks out into this Prophetick
speech. <q>There is in every one of these Considerations most just cause to fear,
lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous Consequence <hi>(meaning the
Presbyterian Discipline)</hi> should cause Posterity to feel those Evils, which as yet
are more easy for us to prevent, than they would be for them to remedy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How fatally this <hi>Cassandra</hi> has foretold we know too well by sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
the Seeds were sown in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the bloudy
Harvest ripened in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr: and because
all the Sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some of the
loose Grains, another Crop is too like to follow; nay I fear 'tis unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
if the Conventiclers be permitted still to scatter.</p>
            <p>A man may be suffer'd to quote an Adversary to our Religion, when
he speaks Truth: and 'tis the observation of <hi>Meimbourg</hi> in his History of
Calvinism, that where-ever that Discipline was planted and embrac'd,
Rebellion, Civil War and Misery attended it. And how indeed should
it happen otherwise? Reformation of Church and State has always been
the ground of our Divisions in <hi>England.</hi> While we were Papists, our
Holy Father rid us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by pretending authority out of the Scriptures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Princes, when we shook off his Authority, the Sectaries furnish'd
themselves with the same Weapons; and out of the same Magazine,
the Bible. So that the Scriptures, which are in themselves the greatest
security of Governours, as commanding express obedience to them,
are now turn'd to their destruction; and never since the Reformation,
has there wanted a Text of their interpreting to authorize a Rebel.
And 'tis to be noted by the way, that the Doctrines of King-killing
and Deposing, which have been taken up onely by the worst Party
of the Papists, the most frontless Flatterers of the Pope's Authority,
have been espous'd, defended and are still maintain'd by the whole
Body of Nonconformists and Republicans. 'Tis but dubbing themselves
the People of God, which 'tis the interest of their Preachers to tell them
they are, and their own interest to believe; and after that; they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:48931:6"/>
dip into the Bible, but one Text or another will turn up for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
If they are under Persecution (as they call it,) then that is a mark
of their Election; if they flourish, then God works Miracles for their
Deliverance, and the Saints are to possess the Earth.</p>
            <p>They may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this Paper;
but I who know best how far I could have gone on this Subject, must
be bold to tell them they are spar'd: though at the same time I am not
ignorant that they interpret the mildness of a Writer to them, as they
do the mercy of the Government; in the one they think it Fear, and
conclude it Weakness in the other. The best way for them to confute
me, is, as I before advis'd the Papists, to disclaim their Principles, and
renounce their Practices. We shall all be glad to think them true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen
when they obey the King, and true Protestants when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Church Discipline.</p>
            <p>It remains that I acquaint the Reader, that the Verses were written
for an ingenious young Gentleman my Friend; upon his Translation of
<hi>The Critical History of the Old Testament,</hi> compos'd by the learned Father <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi>
The Verses therefore are address'd to the Translatour of that Work,
and the style of them is, what it ought to be, Epistolary.</p>
            <p>If any one be so lamentable a Critique as to require the Smoothness,
the Numbers and the Turn of Heroick Poetry in this Poem; I must tell
him, that if he has not read <hi>Horace,</hi> I have studied him, and hope the
style of his Epistles is not ill imitated here. The Expressions of a Poem,
design'd purely for Instruction, ought to be Plain and Natural, and yet
Majestick: for here the Poet is presum'd to be a kind of Law-giver, and
those three qualities which I have nam'd are proper to the Legislative
style. The Florid, Elevated and Figurative way is for the Passions; for
Love and Hatred, Fear and Anger, are begotten in the Soul by shewing
their Objects out of their true proportion; either greater than the Life,
or less; but Instruction is to be given by shewing them what they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
are. A Man is to be cheated into Passion, but to be reason'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Truth.</p>

            <l>If <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heirs must still hold fast the Key.</l>
            <l>The house which many Mansions shou'd contain,</l>

            <l>If the streight-gate still entrance must refuse.</l>
            <l>The onely free enriching Port God made</l>
            <l>What shamefull Monopoly did invade?</l>
            <l>One Factious Company ingross'd the Trade.</l>

            <l>Too long has captiv'd Reason been enslav'd,</l>

            <l>Listning t' each proud Enthusiastick Fool,</l>
            <l>Pretending Conscience, but designing Rule;</l>
            <l>Whilst Law, Form, Interest, Ignorance, Design,</l>
            <l>Did in the holy Cheat together joyn.</l>
            <l>Like vain Astrologers gazing on the Skyes,</l>
            <l>We fell, and did not dare to trust our Eyes.</l>
            <l>'Tis time at last to fix the trembling Soul,</l>

Neither so rich a Treasure to forgo;</l>
               <l>Nor proudly seek beyond our pow'r to know:</l>
               <l>Faith is not built on disquisitions vain;</l>
               <l>The things we <hi>must</hi> believe, are <hi>few,</hi> and <hi>plain:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But since men <hi>will</hi> believe more than they <hi>need;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And every man will make <hi>himself</hi> a Creed:</l>
               <l>In doubtfull questions 'tis the safest way</l>
               <l>To learn what unsuspected Ancients say:</l>
               <l>For 'tis not likely <hi>we</hi> shou'd higher Soar</l>
               <l>In search of Heav'n, than <hi>all the Church before:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nor can we be deceiv'd, unless we see</l>
               <l>The <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers disagree.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If after all, they stand suspected still,</l>
               <l>(For no man's Faith depends upon his Will;)</l>
               <l>'Tis some Relief, that points not clearly known,</l>
               <l>Without much hazard may be let alone:</l>
               <l>And, after hearing what our Church can say,</l>
               <l>If still our Reason runs another way,</l>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48931:23"/>
That private Reason 'tis more Just to curb,</l>
               <l>Than by Disputes the publick Peace disturb.</l>
               <l>For points obscure are of small use to learn:</l>

               <l>Thus have I made my own Opinions clear:</l>
               <l>Yet neither Praise expect, nor Censure fear:</l>
               <l>And this unpolish'd, rugged Verse, I chose;</l>
               <l>As fittest for Discourse, and nearest Prose:</l>
               <l>For, while from <hi>Sacred Truth</hi> I do not swerve,</l>
