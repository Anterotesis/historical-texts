            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER from Monſ. <hi>de Cros,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been informed of the Calumnies that Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> hath cauſed to be Printed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. I know very well that Sir <hi>W.</hi> is of great Worth, and deſerves well; and that he hath been a long time employed, and that too upon important occaſions; but I am as certain, that he had but a ſmall ſhare in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of the late King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Deſigns in the greateſt part of the Affairs, for which he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, from 72, till 79, which is the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Work.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration alone might not perhaps have given me the curioſity, or at leaſt, any great earneſtneſs to read his Memoirs; and I might have very well judged that I could draw from them no ſufficient light and inſight for the diſcovery of ſo many Intrigues.</p>
            <p>Nay beſides, I might have doubted whether or no theſe Memoirs might not have been his own Panegyrick upon himſelf, and the diminution and undervaluing of the real Worth and Glory of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons of Quality, and diſtinguiſhed by their Merit; whoſe Fortune and Reputation Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> hath ſo much envied: for I am particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with Sir <hi>W</hi>'s Pride. He looks upon himſelf to have the greateſt Reach, to be the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63280:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wiſeſt and ableſt Politician of his Time; and a man may perceive abundance of Satyrical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions ſcattered here and there in his Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt moſt illuſtrious Perſons, and that he hath ſtuffed his Memoirs with his own Praiſe, and the fond over-weening Opinion he hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Without doubt this is quite different from that Sincerity and Modeſty which reigns throughout the Memoirs of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> in the Negotiations and Tranſactions of <hi>Jeanin,</hi> in the Letters of Card. <hi>Doſſat,</hi> thoſe mighty and truly eminent Perſons, eſteemed as ſuch by the greateſt Princes of their Age; and even ſtill are to this day, by the ableſt Politicians, with much more Juſtice and Glory than Sir <hi>W</hi>'s Book-Seller ſtiles him, <hi>One of the Greateſt Men of this Age.</hi> It had been Sir <hi>W</hi>'s du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have regulated himſelf according to their moſt excellent Pattern.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at preſent only quote one Paſſage, which I accidentally light on at the firſt opening his Book, whereby one may eaſily gueſs at the greatneſs of his preſumption; in a ſhorttime, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſhall give you occaſion to obſerve many others. <hi>The Negotiations,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I managed and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted at the</hi> Hague, <hi>at</hi> Bruſſels, <hi>at</hi> Aix la Chapelle, <hi>which ſaved</hi> Flanders <hi>from the</hi> French <hi>Clutches, in</hi> 68. <hi>made People believe I had ſome Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation amongſt the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>as well as in</hi> Holland.</p>
            <p>'Twas a Piece of ſtrange Ingratitude of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as of his own dear Country-men, ſo much concern'd for the preſervation of <hi>Flanders,</hi> not to rear him a Statue, which, he ſaith, ſome-where elſe, Mr. <hi>Godolphin</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63280:3"/>
had promiſed him. Could Sir. <hi>W. T.</hi> have done any thing to deſerve it more; or was there any thing more worthy of Triumph than to have preſerved <hi>Flanders,</hi> a Country ſo important to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the only Bulwark of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England?</hi> But Sir <hi>W.</hi> was apt to believe he could not find any one who was better able to hammer out his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than himſelf; and he flattered himſelf with the Opinion that he ſhould erect himſelf as many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as there are places in his Memoirs, crouded with intolerable and ridiculous Vain-glory.</p>
            <p>It was not the Negotiations, my Lord, that Sir <hi>W.</hi> tells us he managed at the <hi>Hague, Bruſſels,</hi> and at <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> which ſaved <hi>Flanders</hi> from the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> in 1668. The <hi>French</hi> publiſhed that they were beholding to the moſt Chriſtian Kings Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for that Peace; who was willing to put a ſtop to the progreſs and courſe of his victorious Arms. But the truth of it is, they moſt juſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed all the Merit, and all the Glory of the Peace, and of the Triple League, to the generous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtedfaſtneſs of the States-General. They made uſe, upon this occaſion, of a Miniſter of State far beyond Sir <hi>W.</hi> in Prudence, Experience, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, one, who was in the Opinion even of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the moſt able Manager of Affairs of his Age.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake, my Lord, in this place, ſtrictly to examine Sir <hi>W. Temple</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs:</hi> I will do it ſhortly if God ſpare me with Life; nay, and I promiſe you a Volume of Remarks, at leaſt, as large as his Book.</p>
            <p>If, like him, I had the Vanity to procure the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Memoirs, during my life-time, I could now have a fair pretence ſo to do, and without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63280:3"/>
I ſhould publiſh more juſt and ſolid ones than his are. Not, that I have the preſumption to judge my ſelf more capable to do it; but, in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he relates ſome things falſly, whereof I am much better informed. The only Hero of my piece ſhall be Truth, without Complaiſance or Flattery; without Paſſion, no not ſo much as againſt him: So that I ſhall do him the ſatisfaction and kindneſs to inſtruct him better, even touching divers Matters, which he performed and executed, without knowing ſo much as the reaſon why he was made to act ſo.</p>
            <p>It is not likewiſe, becauſe I have been one of the Council of the King his Maſter; yet I have had the Happineſs, during ſome Years, to partake in the Confidence of a Miniſter of State, who was in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral important, weighty Occaſions, as it were the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of that Conduct and Management that ſurprized all the World. You know, my Lord, what Credit he had, and of what nature his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences were. Sir <hi>W.</hi> may well imagine that I did not ill improve this able Miniſters Confidence, when Sir <hi>W.</hi> tells us, <hi>That I had wholly devoted my ſelf to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are not ignorant likewiſe, that oftentimes I have had ſome acceſs to the King's Miniſters of State, and even near to the King himſelf,; it did more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially appear, in the buſineſs for which I took my Journey to <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and it would be a great ſhame that a Man <hi>more cunning and ſubtil than them all,</hi> according to the King's own Teſtimony, as Sir <hi>W.</hi> relates it, ſhould not have had (conſidering ſo much freedom of acceſs and eaſineſs) the addreſs and cunning to dive into the moſt hidden Springs of Deliberations and Reſolutions, wherein the <hi>Swede</hi> and my Maſter had ſo great an Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63280:4"/>
Be therefore aſſured, my Lord, that after my Death, nay perhaps, whilſt I am alive, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and if I be obliged thereto, there will appear ſome Memoirs, which will divulge ſome Matters the truth whereof is ſtill ſo carefully concealed, Sir <hi>W.</hi> doth ingeniouſly confeſs that hither to he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them; He, who hath ſo much quickneſs of Penetration, and ſeems to make us believe that he was the King his Maſter's Confident.</p>
            <p>You your ſelf, my Lord, have often urged me to acquaint you with ſuch important Secrets, and of ſuch great Conſequence; and altho' I could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly refuſe, upon the account of that honour you do me to afford me any ſhare in your Favours, to let you have a glympſe of one part of what paſs'd in one of the moſt important Negotiations of that time; yet you had ſo much Generoſity as not to take the advantage of it you might have done, to the infallible ruine, as was believed, of a Miniſter whom you take for one of your greateſt Enemies; yet on this occaſion one could not well lay any thing to his charge, beſides his blind obedience to the Will of his Maſter.</p>
            <p>The Truth of it is, I am not obliged to have the ſame Conſiderations that with held me at that time, but yet I preſerve a profound reſpect for the Memory of the late King, and alſo a great reſpect for ſome Perſons, who are even at this time of the day ſo much concerned, that I ſhould hold my tongue, if it were not for that reaſon, it would be a very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter for me, to make appear without any more adoe, how baſely Sir <hi>W.</hi> is miſtaken in what he delivers concerning divers Negotiations of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and eſpecially concerning my Journey to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63280:4"/>
My Deſign is not at all, my Lord, to write you a Letter full of Invectives againſt Sir <hi>W.</hi> I ſhall not deſcend to the Particulars of his Behaviour, and ſhall tell you no more of them at preſent, than what is needful to let your ſelf and every body elſe judge that I have means in my hand to be revenged for the Injury he hath done me.</p>
            <p>They will be without doubt more juſt Invectives, than thoſe that he fills his Book withal. He ſet upon me firſt. He writes out of a Spirit of Revenge, with a great deal of Heat and Paſſion, and like a Man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd himſelf touch'd and wrong'd to the purpoſe. As for my part, my Lord, I proteſt I write to you in cold Blood, I do ſo much ſcorn the Injury that Sir <hi>W.</hi> affects to do me, that I ſhould but laugh at it, if my ſilence was not able to perſuade you, and thoſe perſons whoſe eſteem of me doth do me ſo much honour, that I have but ſmall care of my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>W.</hi> hath ſhined a long time, 'tis true; but yet he hath borrowed all his Splendour firſt of all from the protection of a Lord, whom he betray'd at laſt, of whom he ſpeaks too inſolently in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, and with abundance of Ingratitude; and then again he advanced himſelf by the protection of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other perſons to whom he was devoted, to the prejudice of his bounden Duty: <hi>He did ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate himſelf</hi> (that I may make uſe of the Terms he makes uſe of in ſpeaking of me) into the Favours and into the Confidence of thoſe, near to whom it was neceſſary for him to have acceſs, that he might have been in a capacity to render conſiderable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the King his Maſter, and to his Country, if ſo be he had made better uſe of this advantage;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63280:5"/>
but he kept it juſt after the ſame manner as he had got it; that is to ſay, that he often came ſhort of exact Faithfulneſs and Loyalty, which a Miniſter of S tate is obliged to maintain inviolably even in the leaſt Matters, that doth plainly appear in his Memoirs.</p>
            <p>The late King of <hi>England</hi> perceived it, and was ſo far convinced of it, that he never made uſe of him in the laſt Commiſſions he committed to his charge, to the States-General; but only out of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Acquaintance he had there, who made people conjecture that Sir <hi>W.</hi> might have ſome Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as in <hi>Holland,</hi> as he himſelf aſſures us he had.</p>
            <p>Neither was he employed, but only upon ſome Occaſions, wherein one would not employ a Man who was a Favourite of the Prince, or for whom he had any value, or in whom he might confide; 'tis a Truth owned and confeſs'd by Sir <hi>W.</hi> himſelf in his Memoirs; and a Man may judge of it by the ſo oppoſite falſe ſteps, that he complains, they cauſed him to make, and by all the things that were done contrary to the Meaſures that he had taken, juſt as if the Court had had a mind to expoſe him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the King ſlighted him after the Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and laid him aſide, making very little uſe of him; it was not, what he would make us believe, his love for his own eaſe, and his Indiſpoſitions of body, that made him decline his Employments. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did Man deſire more to have an hand in Affairs; he was removed by reaſon of the King's ſecret diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction at his Services, by that Conduct and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, which in executing the King's Orders, when they were contrary to his Opinion, and diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to his Friends, ſmelt very much like perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63280:5"/>
and Treachery, as may principally appear in whatſoever he did for to evade and fruſtrate the King's Orders, contained in the diſpatch I left with him at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> for the concluſion of the Peace, by Order of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It is concerning this buſineſs that has made ſo great a noiſe for which Sir <hi>W.</hi> takes occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, that I am going to relate you ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in the Reflections, that I am obliged to make upon what he ſays concerning my ſelf. Do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, my Lord, that I ſhould teach you here the true Cauſe of ſo extraordinary a Reſolution which ſo much ſurprized Sir <hi>W.</hi> with which Penſioner <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> was ſo much aſtoniſhed, and which in Sirs <hi>W</hi>'s opinion did entirely change the Fate of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould pleaſe him very much, if I ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo important a Secret, in which many perſons in the late and preſent Reigns have been concerned. I do not doubt but Sir <hi>W.</hi> extremely deſires it; he knows very well the greater knowledge of theſe Practices would perhaps raiſe a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Parliament to ſome people, whoſe Ruine he deſires at the bottom of his Heart, being little concerned for the reputation of the late King, and envious of the eſteem of thoſe that protected him, and who have beſtowed ſo many favours upou him.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf at this Conjuncture, in which K. <hi>William</hi> endeavours the repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Happineſs of <hi>England</hi> with ſo much Zeal and Glory, I will not ſtir up the envy and hatred which has too much appeared in <hi>England;</hi> and, which may perhaps be a great Obſtacle to that Union which is ſo neceſſary to the happy Execution of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this great Monarch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63280:6"/>
There arrived, ſaid Sir <hi>W. at that time from</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>one whoſe name was</hi> de Cros. I ſhall not ſtop, my Lord, upon this Term of Contempt, <hi>One called;</hi> it is a very malicious Expreſſion, in reſpect of my ſelf; the late King of <hi>England</hi> himſelf did me the Honour to treat me in Paſsports, in his Letters, in his Commiſſions which he charged me with: It is very impudent and rude to ſpeak ſo of a Man, who is of a good Family, who has had the honour of being employed for almoſt twenty years, and whom a great Prince and a King have not diſdain'd to uſe as Councellor of State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was</hi> (continues Sir <hi>W.) a French Monk who had lately quitted his Frock for a Petticoat.</hi> Here is a reproach which ill becomes an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of a Monarch, who is Defender of the Faith, and of the Proteſtant Religion; of one who declared ſo openly at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that he would have nothing to do with the Pope's <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio.</hi> I do not know, my Lord, that it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to be a Monk; and much leſs, to have been one formerly: There are indeed amongſt them, as well asamongſt the reſt of Mankind, ſome miſerable Wretches, of a mean Birth, and of a diſorderly and infamous Life; People of no uſe, without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and without Reputation: Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> thought, without doubt, that I was of that Number; but there are likewiſe ſeveral very famous for the Sanctity of their Lives, of an extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of the greateſt Quality, Sons of Princes and Kings, and Kings themſelves, and Popes: But if this ſort of Life is not now, as formerly it was, ſo certain a Character of a good and honeſt Man, do's Sir <hi>W.</hi> think he can diſhonour me, in reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me for leaving a Profeſſion which himſelf
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63280:6"/>
thinks ſo contemptible, for a <hi>Petticoat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not be material in this place to ſay how I was engaged therein in my tender years. There is nothing more uſual in <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where ancient Houſes do ſacrifice a good part of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in Monaſteries; 'tis a Maxim, to ſay the truth, moſt cruel and horrid.</p>
            <p>Neither will I relate how, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I came out of it; however, it was not for a Petticoat. I have remained ſeveral years without ſo much as having any inclination to it; and it hath been apparent that I have had much a-do, and was very much unreſolved as to this Choice.</p>
            <p>There was too great advantage to throw off my Frock for the Petticoat that I have taken, not to do it. It is a Petticoat of a Scotch Stuff, and which hath been a greater Ornament, and done the Crown of <hi>England</hi> more good than Sir <hi>W.</hi> himſelf; if he do not know it, the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in theſe late Times may inform him. I ſhall enlarge no further, that I may not engage my ſelf to publiſh the Misfortunes and Diſorders of Sir <hi>W</hi>'s Family; which, I ſuppoſe would not be like a Gentleman. I have no reaſon that I know of, to complain, neither of his Lady, nor his Son, nor of his Daughters.</p>
            <p>Beſides, had I even caſt off the Monk's Habit for a Petticoat, I ſhould have done no more than a great many worthy deferving Perſons have done; yea, ſome of the Pope's <hi>Nuncio's,</hi> Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Kings and Princeſſes too, who have quitted the Veil for the Breeches, whoſe Poſterity, I make no queſtion is highly eſteemed and reverenced by Sir <hi>W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63280:7"/>
               <hi>I did ſo well inſinuate my ſelf,</hi> ſaith Sir <hi>W. into the Court of</hi> Sweden, <hi>that I obtained. from thence a Commiſſion to be a kind of an Agent in</hi> England. That is very dirty. I have had the management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and the Quality of Envoy, when Sir <hi>W.</hi> had no more than that of an Agent or Reſident at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> I was Envoy at the Court of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever I was in <hi>Sweden,</hi> or before ever I had any acquaintance there.</p>
            <p>I went the firſt time to <hi>Sweden</hi> juſt at that time the late King of <hi>England</hi> ſent me into <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> about the beginning of the Year 1676. The Pretence was for to demand the free paſſage of Letters; which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> refuſed, for haſtening the Congreſs of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the expedition of Paſsports, requiſite to the Miniſters of State who were to compoſe the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and alſo to urge the Departure of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors belonging to thoſe two Northern Crowns. But now the true Cauſe was quite another Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of greater conſequence; not for the King of <hi>England,</hi> but indeed for another Potentate.—That ſhall be made appear ſome time or other in my Memoirs.</p>
            <p>Had I been a kind of a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Agent, I ſhould not have defended my ſelf in that Point; I ſhould have held it as a great piece of Honour, ſince it could not chuſe but be very glorious and ſplendid, to have the Affairs of ſo great a King, in ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Conjunctures as thoſe were, committed to ones charge and care; but at the very time Sir <hi>W.</hi> ſpeaks of, I was dignified with the Quality of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy Extraordinary from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torv,</hi> acknowledged and received at the Court of <hi>England</hi> for ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63280:7"/>
Sir <hi>W.</hi> knows that very well, there was ſent him divers Memoirs to <hi>Nimeguen</hi> whilſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation laſted, which I had delivered in at <hi>London,</hi> concerning the re-ſetling my Maſter; but the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Concerns of this Prince were ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to him, that I was fain to beg of my Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to recommend them more particularly to Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkyns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, you may ſee Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> mentions in his Memoirs all the Potentates that had any intereſt in the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> except the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein Gottorp,</hi> notwithſtanding he had two Miniſters at the Congreſs, and although <hi>France</hi> had ſtipulated for his re-eſtabliſhment in the ſecond Article or Condition of the Peace, ſuch who ſhall peruſe the Memoirs of Sir <hi>W.</hi> might be apt to think that the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> was reckoned as no body in the World, and that he had no part at all in what paſs'd in Chriſtendoom, from the commencing of the War in 1672, until the concluſion of the Peace 1679<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Thanks be to God Sir <hi>W.</hi> is not the Steward of Glory and Immortality.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>W.</hi> therefore muſt have often read my Name and Character in the Letters, and Orders of the Court, and cannot have forgot that he came to render me a Viſit at my Lodgings, at ſuch time as he, by the King's Order, was to confer with me upon what account Monſieur <hi>Olivencrantz</hi> might be obliged to paſs from <hi>Nimeguen</hi> into <hi>England:</hi> That <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſador lodg'd at that time in my houſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, as the Intereſts of my Maſter were inſeparable from thoſe of <hi>Sweden,</hi> I found my ſelf engaged to be very much concerned in the Intereſts of that Crown in whatſoever might
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63280:8"/>
depend on my care: There was an Envoy extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary from <hi>Sweden</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> and yet for all that, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors did me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to maintain a very regular Correſpondence by Letters with me: The King of <hi>England</hi> was alſo graciouſly pleaſed to hear me in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Affairs of the <hi>Swede,</hi> although I was no otherwiſe authorized for it. Monſieur <hi>Oliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crantz,</hi> his Voyage to <hi>London</hi> was contrived firſt of all by the King and my ſelf, without the leaſt medling or intervention of any one of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and then again in the Negotiation, whereof my Voyage to <hi>Nimeguen</hi> was a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Reſtitution of <hi>Sweden</hi> was eſpecially inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>All this made many Men believe, that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Management of the Affairs of this Crown; and Monſieur <hi>Van Beuninguen</hi> believed it ſo to be, in the Letter he writ to the Lords States-General, which hath ſince been printed; where he ſpeaks with ſo much uncertainty concerning the Voyage I was about to make to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Negotiation, that it was evident it was a very great Secret.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since his being at</hi> London, ſaith Sir <hi>W.</hi> ſpeaking of me, <hi>he hath wholly devoted himſelf to Monſieur</hi> Barillon, <hi>the</hi> French <hi>Ambaſſador, under pretence to act for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of</hi> Sweden. Monſieur <hi>Barillon</hi> was not at that time in <hi>London,</hi> when I was ſent thither, he came not thither till a long time after; I found Monſieur <hi>le Marquis de Ruvigni</hi> there, whom Monſieur <hi>Courtin</hi> ſucceeded; and after that Monſieur <hi>Barillon</hi> came to take the place of Monſieur <hi>Courtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never devoted my ſelf to this Ambaſſador, and I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63280:8"/>
never had any Correſpondence or was in League with him prejudicial to my Duty. Nay, it happened the King of <hi>England</hi> one day, having a deſign more eſpecially to take into Conſideration the <hi>Swediſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, Monſieur <hi>de Barillon</hi> diverted him from it; whether for fear leſt a particular Peace ſhould be clapp'd up between the <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns, or elſe out of Jealouſie, that he might leave the Glory of the Reſtitution of this Crown to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and depriving it of all other relief, might keep it in the mean time in a greater dependance.</p>
            <p>I was ſo much put to it, and fell out with Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>

            <p>It's pity, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, that all the King his Maſter's Council (if one can believe it) that a Man, who if he had pleaſed himſelf, might have been ſeveral times Secretary of State, ſhould be ſo little informed, I will not ſay during his abſence, while he remained at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and at <hi>Nimeguin,</hi> but even ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> of what paſt there, and chiefly in that very affair, wherein Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> was more exerciſed than in any other Buſineſs that he ever undertook.</p>
            <p>But how he could be know it, ſince neither the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> nor my Lord Treaſurer, not hardly the King himſelf (if we may believe Monſieur <hi>T.)</hi> knew any thing of it; And <hi>that theſe Orders were made in one morning, in an hours time, at the Dutcheſs of</hi> Portſmouths <hi>Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Interception of Monſieur</hi> Barillon.</p>
            <p>Obſerve now, if you pleaſe, my Lord, the Malice of Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> in Relation to Monſieur <hi>Williamſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> on whom he would give in this place, the Character of Perfidy, as he hath done in diverſe other parts of his Memoirs. Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> ought to have had at leaſt, ſome reſpect for the King, whoſe Orders Monſieur <hi>Williamſon</hi> did Execute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I never talkt of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſays Monſieur <hi>T. to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State</hi> Williamſon, as if he would ſay
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63280:10"/>
that he was ſufficiently perſwaded that Monſieur <hi>Williamſon</hi> was a Man altogether for <hi>France,</hi> and that he was intirely devoted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as my ſelf, to Monſieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> and that he was the Author of this Diſpatch.</p>
            <p>Is it not clear that Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> would make us imagine that Monſieur the <hi>Chevalier Williamſon,</hi> Secretary of State, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> promiſed theſe Orders. As for me, tho' I had the Diſpatch given me, yet he does not accuſe me openly in this place of bearing any other part in this Affair, than only as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger entruſted with the Conveyance. And not only ſo, but I never went to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouths</hi> Lodgings, ſhe having an irreconcilable averſion for me, and I for her.</p>
            <p>Can there be a greater abſurdity than this? To endeavour to perſwade his Readers that the moſt important affair of that time on which depended (ſays Monſieur <hi>T.) The Fate of Chriſtendom was concluded and made up, in one hours time, in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the Dutcheſs of</hi> Portſmouth, <hi>by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Monſieur</hi> Barillon.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> is accuſtomed ſo little to ſpare the King's Reputation, that he fears not on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to proſtitute it, in a ſtrange manner. He does not only charge him with partiality and connivance, in ſuffering <hi>Valentiennes, Cambray,</hi> St. <hi>Omer,</hi> and ſeveral other places in <hi>Flanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to be taken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Murmur or Oppoſition; But the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> obliged as much as could be, in the Quality of a Mediator, and more through the Intereſt of his Kingdoms to procure the Repoſe of Chriſtendom, yet corrupted by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, and by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63280:11"/>
the Charms of a Miſtreſs, Sacrifices all <hi>Europe,</hi> and his own Eſtate, to a Power that is naturally an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>England.</hi> And this without Ceremony, in an hours time, without the advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and hides himſelf in the Apartment of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as if he was ſenſible that he went about an action the moſt unworthy of the Majeſty of a Prince, and the moſt oppoſite to the Felicity of his People that could be. For what other Conſtruction can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one make of what Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> ſays, and can any man conclude, otherwiſe when he reads this worthy paſſage in his Memoirs?</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that this Diſpatch was made up by Monſieur <hi>Williamſon,</hi> and by the Kings Order. And ſince the King was pleaſed to avoid opening his mind hereon to Monſi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur <hi>T.</hi> giving him no other anſwer, but that I had been <hi>more cunning than all of 'em;</hi> Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> might poſſibly Addreſs himſelf to Monſieur <hi>Williamſon,</hi> who, it may be, might tell him, <hi>by whoſe means, and how</hi> Du Croſs <hi>had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Diſpatch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain that Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> deſpairs of penetrating into this Affair; that he knows not where about he is when he ſpeaks of it; and that he only ſeeks to blacken the Reputation of the King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. If the Peace of <hi>Aix la chapelle</hi> is his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, becauſe he hath the Vanity to believe it to be intirely his own work; 'tis eaſie ſeen that the Peace of <hi>Nimiguen</hi> is his Averſion, becauſe he is aſhamed to have had ſo ſmall a Part in it as he had, and that the moſt glorious part of his Life is not to be ſound in that Negotiation.</p>
            <p>I would have this Complaiſance for Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> though he treats me ſo ill; I would, at leaſt, in ſome
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63280:11"/>
part, draw him out of this great incertainty, on the ſubject of the Diſpatch which I brought him.</p>
            <p>He is deceived, when he imputes this Reſolution to the Intrigues and Perſwaſions of <hi>France.</hi> It was neither managed, nor taken, nor diſpatcht, at the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s; nor was it by the means or intervention of Monſieur <hi>Barillon.</hi> The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour had no part in it, but on the very Inſtant when the affair was concluding. He was not ſo much as preſent at the Expedition, as he had not been at any time at the Deliberations. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Ruvigny,</hi> the Son, carryed the firſt News to the King, his Maſter, the ſame day that I parted for <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Williamſon</hi> knew well what was contained in the Diſpatch to Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> in which there was nothing very myſterious. But he was never privy to the ſecret of the Negotiation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tho' he was preſent when I took my leave of the King in Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi>'s Office, yet he was then ignorant of the true ſubject of my Voyage, and perhaps he never knew it.</p>
            <p>The King was not at all precipitate, and the affair was not concluded and diſpatcht in an hours time. It was treated on, and deliberately conſidered near Three weeks. There was time given to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of <hi>Swedeland</hi> to reſolve themſelves, and make their Anſwer. The King's deſign was doubtleſs aimed for the good of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the publick tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in truth, he had not in his Eye, nor did he certainly believe <hi>that happy Fate of Chriſtendome,</hi> for which Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> labours ſo earneſtly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort with ſome particular Perſons, Enemies to the State, Seditious, and Diſturbers of the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63280:12"/>
But <hi>the King ſaid pleaſantly,</hi> adds Monſieur <hi>T. that the Rogue</hi> (Coquin) du Croſs <hi>had outwitted them all.</hi> If Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> had not made the King ſay this, and had ſaid it himſelf, I might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him, with as much Juſtice as any man in the World, theſe Verſes which <hi>I</hi> have read ſomewhere,</p>
            <p>Coquin,<hi> he calls me, with mighty diſdain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, I ſhould anſwer Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seek your</hi> Coquins <hi>elſewhere, you're one your ſelf.</hi> But the Perſon of Kings is ſacred. Beſides, Can that be an abuſe, which is ſpoken <hi>pleaſantly,</hi> without the leaſt deſign perhaps of offending. For <hi>Coquin</hi> is a word which the Late King of <hi>England</hi> often uſed, when he ſpoke of People for whom he had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Reſpect and Conſideration. 'Tis true, he uſed the word alſo very familiarly, when he was angry, but at ſuch times he ſpoke with indignation, and not pleaſantly.</p>
            <p>The Parliament preſented an Addreſs to the King (as Monſieur <hi>T.</hi> reports) in which they repreſented the Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Arms, and deſired him to ſtop it before it became more dangerous to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the other Neighbouring Countries. <hi>Den Bernard de Salinas</hi> (continues Monſieur <hi>T.)</hi> ſaid to certain Members of the Commons, that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs had ſo exaſperated the King, that he ſaid thoſe who were the Authors of it were a Company of <hi>Coquins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remembred at my Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> in 1675. before I was to go into <hi>France</hi> in Quality of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, whither <hi>I</hi> acknowledge his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would not permit me to come, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had informed him that I had embraced the Proteſtant Religion, or it may be becauſe the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63280:12"/>
King of <hi>France</hi> would not receive his own Subjects, in the Quality of Miniſters of other Princes. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I ſay, that the King of <hi>England</hi> (to whom alſo I had a Commiſſion) bid the <hi>Marquiſs of Ruvigni,</hi> one Evening, bring me to his Cabinet, and himſelf come in with me.</p>
            <p>The King enquired of me, at the firſt, what news I could tell him of the Condition of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Army in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> through which <hi>I</hi> paſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt much concern that the <hi>Conſtable Wrangle,</hi> not minding to paſs forward into the Empire (as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>T.</hi> ſays) had thereby different pretences, had attacked the Elector of <hi>Branderburg</hi> as vigorouſly and with as much ſucceſs as he could. I told the King the reaſon, which concerns not my preſent ſubject to report here.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, I having informed the King of the State of<hi> Germany, </hi>the King believing that I was to paſs into<hi> France, </hi>ſpoke to me in theſe very words.<hi> Monſieur, tell the King, my Brother, that it is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my mind that I have made Peace with theſe </hi>Coquins,<hi> the </hi>Hollanders,<hi> Monſieur the Marquiſs of </hi>Ruvigny,<hi> who ſtands here, knows it well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime before the making of this Peace, the King talking with Monſieur <hi>de Shrenborn</hi> Envoy from <hi>Mayence,</hi> told him alſo, in Relation to the <hi>Hollanders, In a little time, Monſieur, I will bring theſe</hi> Coquins <hi>to Reaſon.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Barillon</hi> writ to the Count <hi>d' Auaux,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at the <hi>Hague,</hi> certain Diſcourſes which the King had concerning the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The Count <hi>d' Auaux</hi> made uſe of this to encreaſe the juſt Suſpicions of the <hi>Eſttates.</hi> He carried the Letters of Monſieur <hi>Baril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> to Monſieur <hi>Fagel.</hi> Whereupon, the <hi>States</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63280:13"/>
made a terrible Complaint, and the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſaid on this Occaſion to the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> that <hi>Monſieur</hi> Barillon, <hi>and the Count d'</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux <hi>were</hi> Coquins.</p>
            <p>Had the King called me <hi>Coquin,</hi> ſeriouſly, I ought not to think it any very ſtrange thing; ſince he hath treated in the ſame manner the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and wiſeſt Republick of the World, to whom he had ſo great Obligations; two Ambaſſadours of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, of extraordinary merit, and as honeſt Men as <hi>France</hi> ever had; and alſo the greateſt Lords of his own Kingdom who were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Addreſs which the Commons preſented him.</p>
            <p>There is alſo this difference, that the King, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thoſe Lords, thoſe Ambaſſadours, and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he called them <hi>Coquins</hi> in anger, but when he ſpoke of me, he ſaid it <hi>pleaſantly</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Monſieur <hi>T.) and that I was a cunning</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, <hi>more cunning than the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>my Lord Treaſurer, the Secretary of State</hi> Williamſon, <hi>and even the King himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either I am much deceived, or all the Miniſters of the Conſederates that were then at <hi>London,</hi> would have been all <hi>Coquins</hi> at this rate, and Monſieur <hi>Temple</hi> himſelf, and would have deceived thoſe who abuſed and deceived them. For beſides, there is more credit methinks on ſuch like Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>to be a cunning Rogue,</hi> and to paſs for a more able Man than the moſt able Miniſters of State, than to be the laughing-ſtock, and the Fool of a <hi>Monk</hi> and a ſort of Agent; Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> and ſome others, were truly ſo on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63280:13"/>
But I would acquaint Sir <hi>W. Temple</hi> of what he has not perhaps heard of, as he has done the like to me, I do not invent it to revenge my ſelf, and <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f I would make uſe of falſhoods, I might make recourſe to more heinous Affronts; the truth of my Remarks upon his Memoirs, ſhall be my full ſatisfaction. What I ſhall relate may be found in my Letters upon that account to the Prince my Maſter, and his Miniſters: I took no particular care to divulge it immediately to Mounſieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> to whom I was ſo much devoted; were he alive he might witneſs that as well as the Averſion the King of <hi>England</hi> always bore to Sir <hi>W. Temple;</hi> and the little Eſteem he had of him at bottom. Upon my return from <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> I went immediately to Court, as ſoon as I came there I meet Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who askt me with a ſterne Countenance if the Peace was Concluded, I anſwered him in the Affirmative, upon which he cryed out and ſaid, <hi>O Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> After having had the Honour to give his Majeſty an account of what was paſt, I told him of the ill humour I perceived Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> to be in, and what I knew of his neglect of his Majeſties Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; The King ſeemed very angry with Sir <hi>W</hi>'s. Proceedings, and ſaid, <hi>he was a very impertinent R—to find fault with my Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the late K. of <hi>England,</hi> did not approve of my Conduct in the affairs of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> which in effect he declared at firſt in Publick not to be pleaſed with, in which he play'd his part to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: If againſt his will, I had truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the ſeveral Deputies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> how that the two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were

               </hi> and what endeavours ſoever the Engliſh Court had made, there were no ways to repair the Breach. If I was a Fool, a piece of an Agent, o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Why did he recompence me for my Voyage from <hi>Nimeguen?</hi> Upon what account did the King beſtow ſeveral other Favours upon me? How comes it, that I haveing made a great Entertainment and Fireworks, to ſhew my joy for the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Duke my Maſter to his Teritories, that the whole Court ſhould do me that Honour as to be preſent thereat?</p>
            <p>It was not my quality of Envoy Extraordinary of the Duke <hi>de Gottorp,</hi> that hindred the King to expreſs ſome kind of reſentment againſt me, and thereupon to bid me avoid the Kingdom. I do well remember the King was juſt npon the point of making Mounſieur <hi>Van Beuningen</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the States General, to withdraw and get him out of the Land, becauſe he had got the word <hi>Connivance,</hi> to be foiſted into a Memorial he preſented to the King, for the recalling of the Engliſh Forces, which bore Armes in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Barnard de Salinas</hi> was the Spaniſh Envoy; the King made much of him, yea and loved him for the particular care he had in <hi>Flanders</hi> of the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the E. of <hi>Plym.</hi> one of the Ks.

T.</hi> his own Memoirs, but yet I am acquainted with ſome particulars upon this Subject that make my hair ſtand an end, nay, and I have not only learnt them from My Lord <hi>Arlingtons</hi> own mouth, but alſo from a noted Miniſter of thoſe times.</p>

To arraign them, I ſay, ſome for A varice, others for Partiality, I had almoſt ſaid for betraying their Truſt. But above all, to give ſuch diſad antagious repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the E. of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and of Sir <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Jenkyns;</hi> that, it would have been all one if he had ſaid, that Sir <hi>Leoline,</hi> was a man of the other World, a plain downright Ideot, void of inſight and Experience: And that <hi>Law. Hyde,</hi> now E. of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was a Lord altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and no ways fit for the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King gave him at <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, Sir <hi>Leoline</hi> was made Secretary of State, and no notice at all taken of Sir <hi>W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Laurence Hyde,</hi> Sir <hi>W.</hi> ſpeaks firſt of him, as if he were a Youth, that ſhould have been ſent to the Univerſity, <hi>I plainly perceive,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the chief deſign of that Commiſſion was to introduce Mr.</hi> Hyde <hi>into this ſort of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and to let him underſtand the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the men behave themſelves in the ſame,</hi> then he adds, <hi>He excuſed himſelf out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, to have any thing to do with any Conference, and Compiling Diſpatches.</hi> Was it out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he owed to Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> or for want of Capacity, that My Lord ſhewed ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, that he would neither make Diſpatches, nor meddle with Conferences, what, he who had been ingaged already, as he was afterwards in very important Affairs; who had been Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour in the principal Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> who was choſen as Chief of the Embaſie at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnen,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:63280:16"/>
one who in all reſpects, is ſo far above Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> for all theſe great qualities; yet My Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affords Sir <hi>W.</hi> juſt as much <hi>difference,</hi> as a petty Scholar does a famous Pedant. And to reward him, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>W. T.</hi> would make him paſs in the world, for an Embaſſadour that was but at beſt his Scholar.</p>
            <p>I make account to tell you, what Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>W.</hi> dare not acknowledge. Mr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> being more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and of greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Abilities than Sir <hi>W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and of that quality too, that was not to be expoſed, would not intermeddle in a Mediation, which was like to ſuffer ſo groſs Indignities, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of <hi>England</hi> ſuffered at the Treaty of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen.</hi> One time or other I ſhall publiſh thoſe Indignities in my Memoires, together with the weakneſs, and tameneſs wherewith they were content to ſuffer them.</p>
            <p>But now, if Sir <hi>W.

            <p>My Lord, If I be not miſtaken, here is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion of Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> being vext at me.

Now the Parliament got nothing by it, and the greateſt advantage accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Spaniard, who upon this occaſion made him really believe it, and ſo took him for a Cully. A ſad acknowledgment for having <hi>alone ſaved</hi> Flanders <hi>for</hi> Spain! I ridiculed this Treaty, I made obſervations thereon, that were publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT, Concerning the Foregoing Letter.</head>
            <p>IT is now, ſome Months ago ſince the Foreign Journals gave us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>Monſieur de Croſs,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Author of the foregoing Treatiſe, was meditating an Anſwer to Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s Memoirs. As nothing more ſenſibly touches us, than to have our Reputation wounded by thoſe Perſons whom we never injured. We are not to admire that our Author who thought himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:63280:18"/>
unjuſtly attacked in theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> took the first opportunity to juſtifie his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the World: and if he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falls out into ſevere or indecent Language, it is to be remembred that he was not the firſt Agreſſor, but that his Adverſary taught him the way. How well <hi>M. de Croſs</hi> has acquitted himſelf in this Affair, I will by no means take upon me to determine. Let the Reader, without prejudice or partiality, confider what both Parties ſay, and then let him judge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>When theſe <hi>Memoirs</hi> firſt appeared in publick, I remember the <hi>Criticks</hi> in Town were much divided in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about them; ſome found fault with the Stile, as too Iuſcious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; others cenſured the Digreſſions, as Foreign to the Buſineſs in hand, and particularly the Story of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Parrot, that (to uſe Sir <hi>William</hi>'s own Expreſſion, <hi>p. 58.) ſpoke, and asked,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:63280:18"/>
               <hi>and anſwered common Queſtions, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ike a reaſonable Creature.</hi> Laſtly, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Graver ſort of People were ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized to ſee ſeveral Perſons eminent both for their Station and Quality, and ſome of them ſtill Living, treated with ſo much Freedom, and with ſo little Ceremony; adding, that the Author every where appeared too full of himſelf, which I find is the very Character, which the <hi>French</hi> Relator of the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> has been pleaſed to beſtow upon him.</p>
            <p>Indeed, as for the Language of the <hi>Memoirs,</hi> a Man needs but turn over half a dozen Pages to be convinced that the firſt Objection is juſt and reaſonable. Every Leaf almoſt ſtands charged with <hi>Galliciſms,</hi> more or leſs; and indeed 'tis odd enough to ſee a Man of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temples</hi>'s Conſtitution, who all along declares ſuch an invincible Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>French</hi> Nation, ſo fondly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:63280:19"/>
upon their Expreſſions, even where he had no neceſſity to uſe them. But at the ſame time, I confeſs, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that his Digreſſions are not ſo faulty, it being not amiſs in a juſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but eſpecially in <hi>Memoirs,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a ſerious Scene, now and then, with ſomething that is diverting and agreeable. As for the laſt Objection, I have nothing to ſay to it at preſent, ſince it is not improbable but that the following Book of <hi>Monſieur de Croſs</hi> may prevail with him to attempt his own Juſtification.</p>
