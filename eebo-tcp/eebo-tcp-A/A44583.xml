            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and when Madmen, in two Extreams, ſhall agree to made common ſenſe Treaſon, and joyn to fix an ill Character upon the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men in the Nntion who deſerve a good one; I am no longer Maſter of my better Reſolution to let the World alone, and muſt break looſe from my more reaſonable Thoughts, to expoſe theſe falſe Coyners, who would make their Copper Wares paſs upon us for good Payment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amongſt all the Engines of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, there has been none more powerful in all Times, than the fixing Names upon one another of Contumely and Reproach, and the reaſon is plain, in reſpect of the People, who tho' generally they are uncapable of making a Syllogiſm or forming an Argument, yet they can pronounce a word; and that ſerves their turn to throw it with
<pb facs="tcp:57209:5"/>
their dull malice at the Head of thoſe they do not like; ſuch things ever begin in Jeſt, and end in Blood, and the ſame word which at firſt makes the Company merry, grows in time to a Military Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to cut one anothers Throats.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Miſtakes are to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' not eaſily cured, being ſuitable enough to the corrupted Nature of Mankind; but 'tis hard, that Men will not only invent ill Names, but they will wreſt and miſinterpret good one; ſo afraid ſome are even of a reconciling ſound, that they raiſe another noiſe to keep it from being heard, left it ſhould ſet up and encourage a dangerous ſort of Men, who prefer Peace and Agreement, before Violence and Confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Were it not for this, why, after we have played the Fool with throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This innocent word</hi> Trimmer <hi>ſignifies no more than this, That if Men are together in a Boat, and one part of the Company would weigh it down on one ſide, another would make make it lean as much to the contrary; it happens there is a third Opinion of thoſe, who conceive it would do as well, if the Boat w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>But ſo it happens, that the poor</hi> Trimmer <hi>has now all the Powder ſpent upon him alone, while the</hi> Whig <hi>is a forgotten, or at leaſt a neglected Enemy; there is no danger now to the State (if ſome Men may be believed) but from the Beaſt called a</hi> Trimmer, <hi>take heed of him, he is the Inſtrument that muſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>But it may be worth the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, whether he is ſuch a Beaſt as he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ainted. I am not of that Opinion, and am ſo far from thinking him an Infidel either in Church or State, that I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afraid to expoſe the Articles
<pb facs="tcp:57209:7"/>
of his Faith in Relation to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor to ſay that I prefer them before any other Political Creed, that either our angry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, or our refined States-men would impoſe upon us.</hi>

                  <head>THE Trimmer's Opinion OF THE LAWS AND GOVERNMENT.</head>
                  <p>OUr Trimmer, as he has a great Veneration for Laws in general, ſo he has more particular for our own, he looks upon them as the Chains that tye up our unruly Paſſions, which elſe, like wild Beaſts let looſe, would reduce the world into its firſt State of Barbariſm and Hoſtility; the good things we enjoy, we owe to them; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57209:8"/>
all the ill things we are freed from is by their Protection.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf thought it not enough to be a Creator, without being Law-giver, and his goodneſs had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective towards mankind in making them, if he had not preſcribed Rules to make them happy too.</p>
                  <p>All Laws flow from that of Nature, and where that is not the Foundation, they may be legally impos'd, but they will be lamely obeyed: By this Nature is not meant that which Fools and Madmen miſquote to juſtify their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; it is innocent and uncorrupted Nature, that which diſpoſes Men to chuſe Vertue, without its being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, and which is ſo far from inſpiring ill thoughts into us, that we take pains to ſuppreſs the good ones it infuſes.</p>
                  <p>The Civilized World has ever paid a willing ſubjection to Laws, even Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors have done homage to them; as the <hi>Romans,</hi> who took Patterns of good Laws, even from thoſe they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and at the ſame time that they Triumph'd over an enſlav'd People, the very Laws of that place did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remain ſafe, but became Victorious;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57209:8"/>
their new Maſters, inſtead of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, paid them more reſpect than they had from thoſe who firſt made them: and by this wiſe method they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to ſuch an admirable Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws, that to this day they Reign by them; the Excellency of them Triumphs ſtill, and the World pays now an acknowledgment of their obedience to that Mighty Empire, though ſo many Ages after it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and by a later inſtance, the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who, in practice uſe their Laws pretty familiarly, yet think their Picture is drawn with moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon their Seals, when they are placed in the Seat of Juſtice; and tho' the Hicroglyphick is not there of ſo much uſe to the People as they would wiſh, yet it ſhews that no Prince is ſo Great, as not to think fit, for his own Credit at leaſt, to give an outward, when he refuſes a real worſhip to the Laws.</p>
                  <p>They are to mankind that which the Sun is to Plants, whilſt it cheriſhes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves 'em. Where they have their force &amp; are not clouded or ſuppreſt, every thing ſmiles and flouriſhes; but where they are darkened, and not ſuffered to ſhine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57209:9"/>
out, it makes every thing to wither and decay.</p>
                  <p>They ſecure Men not only againſt one another, but againſt themſelves too; they are a Sanctuary to which the Crown has occaſion to reſort as often as the People, ſo that it is an Intereſt as well as a Duty to preſerve them.</p>
                  <p>There would be no end of making a Panegyrick of Laws; let it be enough to add, that without Laws the World would become a Wilderneſs, and Men little leſs than Beaſts; but with all this, the beſt things may come to be the worſt, if they are not in good hands; and if it be true that the wiſeſt Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally make the Laws, it is as true, that the ſtrongeſt do often Interpret them: and as Rivers belong as much to the Channel where they run, as to the Spring from whence they firſt riſe, ſo the Laws depend as much upon the Pipes thro' which they are to paſs, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fountain from whence they flow.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of a King who is Head of the Law, as well as the Dignity of Publick juſtice, is debaſed, when the clear ſtream of the Law is puddled and diſturbed by Bunglers, or convey'd by unclean Inſtruments to the People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57209:9"/>
Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their full luſtre, and would be grieved to ſee the day, when, inſtead of ſpeaking with Authority from the Seats of Juſtice, they ſhould ſpeak out of a Grate, with a lamenting voice like Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that deſire to be reſcu'd.</p>
                  <p>He wiſhes that the Bench may have a Natural as well as a Legal Superiority to the Bar; he thinks Mens abilities very much miſplac'd, when the Reaſon of him that pleads is viſibly too ſtrong for thoſe who Judge and give Sentence.</p>
                  <p>When thoſe from the Bar ſeem to dictate to their Superiours upon the Bench, their Furrs will look ſcurvily. about them, and the reſpect of the World will leave the bare Character of a Judge, to follow the Eſſential know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Lawyer, who may be greater in himſelf, than the other can be with all his Trappings.</p>
                  <p>An unconteſted Superiority in any Calling, will have the better of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Name that Authority can put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and therefore if ever ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Method ſhould be introduc'd, it is then that <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> might be ſaid to ſtand upon its Head, and though Juſtice it ſelf can never be ſo, yet the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57209:10"/>
Adminiſtration of it would be rendered Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>A Judge has ſuch power lodg'd in him, that the King will never be thought to have choſen well, where the voice of Mankind has not before-hand recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Man to his Station; when Men are made Judges of what they do not underſtand, the World cenſures ſuch a Choice, not out of ill-will to the Men, but fear to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>If the King had the ſole power of chuſing Phyſicians, Men would tremble to ſee Bunglers preferred, yet the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of taking Phyſick from a Doctor, is generally not ſo great as that of reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice from a Judge; and yet the Inferences will be very ſevere in ſuch caſes, for either it will be thought that ſuch Men bought what they were not able to deſerve, or which is as bad, that Obedience ſhall be lookd upon as a better Qualification in a Judge, than Skill or Integrity, when ſuch ſacred things as the Laws are not only touchd, but guided by prophane hands; Men will fear that out of the Tree of the Law, from whence we expect Shade and Shelter, ſuch Workmen will make Cudgels to beat us with, or rather that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57209:10"/>
they will turn the Cannon upon our Properties, that were intruſted with them for their Defence.</p>
                  <p>To ſee the Laws Mangled, Diſguiſed, Speak quite another Language than their own, to ſee them thrown from the Dignity of protecting Mankind, to the diſgraceful Office of deſtroying them; and, notwithſtanding their Innocence in themſelves, to be made the worſt Inſtruments that the moſt refined vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany can make uſe of, will raiſe Mens Anger above the power of laying it down again, and tempt them to follow the Evil Examples given them of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Hearing, when ſo provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their deſire of Revenge. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore, as he thinks the Laws are Jewels, ſo he believes they are no better ſet, than in the conſtitution of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and carefully preſerved.</p>
                  <p>It would be too great Partiality to ſay they are perfect or liable to no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; ſuch things are not of this world; but if they have more Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and fewer Faults than any other we know, it is enough to recommend them to our Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57209:11"/>
The Diſpute, which is a greater Beauty, a Monarchy or a Common-wealth, has laſted long between their contending Lovers, and (they have behav'd themſelves ſo like Lovers, who in good Manners muſt be out of their Wits,) who uſed ſuch Figures to exalt their own Idols on either ſide, and ſuch angry Aggravations, to reproach one another in the Conteſt, that moderate men have in all times ſmil'd upon this eagerneſs, and thought it differ'd very little from a downright Frenzy: we in <hi>England,</hi> by a happy uſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, conclude them both in the wrong, and reject them from being our Pattern, not taking the words in the utmoſt extent, which is a thing, that Monarchy, leaves men no Liberty, and a Common-wealth ſuch a one, as allows them no Quiet.</p>
                  <p>We think that a wiſe Mean, between theſe barbarous Extreams, is that which ſelf-Preſervation ought to dictate to our Wiſhes; and we may ſay we have attained to this Mean in a greater meaſure, than any Nation now in being, or perhaps any we have read of; tho never ſo much Celebrated for the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Felicity of their Conſtitutions:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57209:11"/>
We take from one the too great power of doing hurt, and yet leave enough to govern and protect us; we take from the other, the Confuſion, the Parity, the Animoſities, and the Licenſe, and yet reſerve a due care of ſuch a Liberty, as may conſiſt with Mens Allegiance; but it being hard, if not impoſſible, to be exactly even, our Government has much the ſtronger Biaſs towards Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which by the general Conſent and Practice of Mankind, ſeems to have the Advantage in diſpute againſt a Commonwealth: The Rules of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth are too hard for the Bulk of Mankind to come up to; that Form of Government requires ſuch a ſpirit to carry it on, as dos not dwell in great Numbers, but is reſtrained to ſo very few, eſpecially in this Age, that let the Methods appear never ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably in Paper, they muſt fail in Practice, which will ever be ſuited more to Mens Nature as it is, than as it ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Monarchy is lik'd by the People, for the Bells and the Tinſel, the outward Pomp and Gilding, and there muſt be milk for Babes, ſince the greateſt part of Mankind are, and ever will be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57209:12"/>
in that Liſt; and it is approv'd by wiſe and thinking Men, (all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Objections impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderd) that it has ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage above all other Forms, when the Adminiſtration of that Power falls in good hands; that all other Governments look out of Countenance, when they are ſet in Competition with it. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> might have ſav'd himſelf the trouble of making laws, if either he had been Immortal, or that he could have ſecur'd to Poſterity, a ſucceeding Race of Princes like himſelf; his own Example was a better Law, than he could with all his skill tell how to make; ſuch a Prince is a Living Law, that dictates to his ſubjects, whoſe thoughts in that caſe never riſe above their Obedience, the Confidence they have in the vertue and Knowledge of the maſter, preventing the Scruples and Apprehenſions to which Men are naturally inclin'd, in relation to thoſe that govern them; ſuch a Magiſtrate is the Life and Soul of Juſtice, whereas the Law is but a Body and a dead one too, without his influence to give it warmth and vigour, and by the irreſiſtible Power of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he do's ſo reconcile Dominion and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57209:12"/>
Allegiance, that all diſputes between them are ſilenced and ſubdued, and indeed no Monarchy can be Perfect and Abſolute without exception, but where the Prince is Superior by his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as well as by his Character and his Power; ſo that to ſcrew out Preſidents and unlimited Power, is a plain diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Prince that Nature has made Great, and who had better make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a glorious Example to Poſterity, than borrow an Authority from Dark Records, raiſed out of the Grave, which beſides their Non-uſage, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in them matter of Controverſie and Debate, and it may be affirmed, that the inſtances are very rare of Princes having the worſt in the diſpute with their People, if they were Eminent for Juſtice in time of Peace, or Conduct in time of War, ſuch advantage the Crown giveth to thoſe who adorn it by their own Perſonal vertues.</p>
                  <p>But ſince for the greater Honour of Good and Wiſe Princes, and the better to ſet off their Character by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, Heaven has decreed there muſt be a mixture, and that ſuch as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and inſufficient, or at leaſt both, are perhaps to have their equal turns in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57209:13"/>
the Government of the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the Will of Man is ſo various, and ſo unbounded a thing, and ſo fatal too when joined with Power miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd; it is no wonder if thoſe who are to be govern'd, are unwilling to have ſo dangerous as well as ſo uncertain a Standard of their Obedience.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be therefore Rules and Laws: for want of which, or at leaſt the Obſervation of them, it was as Capital for a Man to ſay that <hi>Nero</hi> did not play well upon the Lute, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treaſon, or Blaſpheme the Gods. And even <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> himſelf had like to have loſt his Life, for ſleeping whilſt he ſhould have attended and admir'd that Emperours Impertinence upon the Stage. There is a wantonneſs in great Power that Men are generally too apt to be corrupted with, and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a wiſe Prince, to prevent the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariſing from common frailty, would chooſe to Govern by Rules for his own Sake, as well as for his Peoples, ſince it only ſecures him from Errors, and does not leſſen the real Authority, that a good Magiſtrate would care to be poſſeſs'd of; for if the Will of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57209:13"/>
Prince is contrary either to Reaſon it ſelf, or to the univerſal Opinion of his Subjects, the Law by a kind reſtraint reſcues him from a diſeaſe that would undo him; if his will on the other ſide is reaſonable or well directed, that Will immediately becomes a Law, and he is arbitrary by an eaſie and natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, without taking pains, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the World for it.</p>
                  <p>If Princes conſider Laws as things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on them, they have the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Fetters of Iron, but to ſuch as would make them their choice as well as their practice, they are Chains of Gold; and in that reſpect are Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as in others they are a defence to them, and by a Compariſon, not improper for God's Vicegerents upon Earth; as our Maker never Commands our obedience to any thing, that as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures we ought not to make our own Election; ſo a good and wiſe Governor, tho' all Laws were aboliſh'd, would by the voluntary direction of his own Reaſon, do without reſtraint the very ſame things that they would have enjoyned.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinks that the King and Kingdom ought to be one Creature,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57209:14"/>
not to be ſeparated in their Political Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; and when either of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to act a-part, it is like the crawling of Worms after they are cut in pieces, which cannot be a laſting motion, the whole Creature not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at a time. If the Body has a dead Palſie, the Head cannot make it move; and God hath not yet delegated ſuch a healing power to Princes, as that they can in a moment ſay to a Languiſhing People oppreſs'd and in deſpair, take up your beds and walk.</p>
                  <p>The Figure of a King, is ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive and exalted a thing, that it is a kind of degrading him to lodge that power ſeparately in his own Natural Perſon, which can never be ſafely or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally great, but where the People are ſo united to him as to be Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone; for when he is reduc'd to the ſingle definition of a man, he ſinks into ſo low a Character, that it is a temptation upon Mens Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and an impairing that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which is neceſſary to preſerve their Duty to him; whereas a Prince who is ſo joined to his people that they ſeem to be his Limbs, rather than his Subjects, Cloathed with Mercy and

the Inſtruments he uſes, and out of the danger of receiving hurt from them; but Princes can never lodge Power in any hands, which may not at ſome time turn it back upon them; for tho' it is poſſible enough for a King to have power to ſatisfy his Ambition; yet no Kingdom has Money enough to ſatisfie the avarice of under-Work-men, who learn from that Prince who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act more than belongs to him, to expect from him much more than they deſerve, and growing angry upon the firſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, they are the Devils which grow terrible to the Conjurers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who brought them up, and can't ſend them down again; And beſides that, there can be no laſting Radical Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but where the Governed are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Governours. It muſt be a Dominion very unpleaſant to a Prince of an elevated Mind, to impoſe an abject and ſordid ſervility, inſtead of receiving the willing Sacrifice of Duty and Obedience. The brav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes in all times, who were uncapable of any other kind of fear, have fear'd to grieve their own People; ſuch a fear is a glory, and in this ſenſe 'tis an infamy not to be a Coward: So that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57209:16"/>
the miſtaken Heroes who are void of this generous kind of fear, need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aggravation to compleat their ill Characters.</p>
                  <p>When a Deſpotick Prince has bruiſed all his Subjects with a ſlaviſh Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, all the force he can uſe cannot ſubdue his own fears, Enemies of his own Creation, to which he can never be reconciled, it being impoſſible to do injuſtice, and not to fear Revenge: there is no cure for this fear, but the not deſerving to be hurt, and therefore a Prince who does not allow his thoughts to ſtray beyond the Rules of Juſtice, has always the bleſſing of an inward quiet and aſſurance, as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effect of his good meaning to his People, and tho he will not neglect due precautions to ſecure himſelf in all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, yet he is uncapable of entertaining vain and remote ſuſpicions of thoſe, of whom he reſolves never to deſerve ill.</p>
                  <p>It is very hard for a Prince to fear Rebellion, who neither does, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do any thing to provoke it; therefore too great a diligence in the Governours, to raiſe and improve dangers and fears from the People, is no very good Symptom, and naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57209:16"/>
an inference, that they have thoughts of putting their Subjects Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to a Tryal; and therefore not without ſome Reaſon fear before hand, that the Irregularities they intend, may raiſe Men to a Reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinks it no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a Government, to endeavour the ſuppreſſing all kind of Right which may remain in the Body of the People, or to employ ſmall Authors in it, whoſe Officiouſneſs or want of Money may encourage them to write, tho' it is not very eaſie to have Abilities equal to ſuch a Subject; they forget that in their too high ſtrained Arguments for the Rights of Princes, they very often plead againſt humane Nature, which will always give a Biaſs to thoſe Reaſons which ſeem of her ſide; it is the People that Reads thoſe Books, and it is the People that muſt judge of them; and therefore no Maxims ſhould be laid down for the Right of Government, to which there can be any Reaſonable Objection; for the World has an Intereſt, and for that Reaſon is more than ordinary diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find out the weak ſides of ſuch Arguments as are intended to do them hurt; and it is a diminution to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57209:17"/>
to Promote or Countenance ſuch well affected miſtakes which are turned upon it with diſadvantage, whenever they are detected and exposd; and Naturally the too earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to take from Men the Right they have, tempt them, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to Claim that which they have not.</p>
                  <p>In Power, as in moſt other things, the way for Princes to keep it, is not to graſp more than their Arms can well hold; the nice and unneceſſary enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into theſe things, or the Licenſing ſome Books, and ſuppreſſing ſome others without ſufficient Reaſon to Juſtifie the doing-either, is ſo far from being an Advantage to a Government, that it expoſes it to the Cenſure of being Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and to the ſuſpicion, of having ſome hidden deſigns to be carried on by theſe unuſual methods.</p>
                  <p>When all is ſaid, there is a Natural Reaſon of State, and undefinable thing, grounded upon the Common Good of Mankind, which is immortal, and in all Changes and Revolutions, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its Original Right of ſaving a Nation, when the Letter of the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would deſtroy it; and by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57209:17"/>
means it moves, carrieth a Power with it, that admits of no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, being ſupported by Nature, which inſpires an immediate conſent at ſome Critical times into every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Member, to that which viſibly tendeth to preſervation of the whole; and this being ſo, a Wiſe Prince inſtead of Controverting the right of this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, will by all means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it may be of his ſide, and then he will be ſecure.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot conceive that the Power of any Prince can be laſting, but where 'tis built upon the foundation of his own unborrowed vertue, he muſt not only be the firſt Mover and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from whence the great Acts of State originally flow, but he muſt be thought ſo to his People that they may preſerve their veneration for him; he muſt be jealous of his Power, and not impart ſo much of it to any about him, as that he may ſuffer an Eclipſe by it.</p>
                  <p>He cannot take too much care to keep himſelf up, for when a Prince is thought to be led by thoſe, with whom he ſhould onely adviſe, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he gives are tranſmitted through him, and are not of his own growth;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57209:18"/>
the World will look upon him as a bird adorned with Feathers that are not his own, or conſider him rather as an Engine than a living Creature; beſides, 'twould be a Contradiction for a Prince to fear a Common-wealth, and at the ſame time create one himſelf, be dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating ſuch a Power to any Number of Men near him, as is inconſiſtant with the Figure of a Monarch: it is the worſt kind of Co-ordination the Crown can ſubmit to; for it is the exerciſe of Power that draws the reſpect along with it, and when that is parted with, the bare Character of a King is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep it up; but tho' it is a diminution to a Prince, to parcel out ſo liberally his Power amongſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, it's worſe to divide with any other Man, and to bring himſelf in Competition with a ſingle Rival; a Partner in Government is ſo unnatural a thing, that it is a ſquint-ey'd Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that muſt be paid to ſuch a double bottomd Monarchy. The two Czars of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are an Example that the more civiliz'd part of the World will not be proud to follow, whatſoever Gloſs may be put upon this method, by thoſe to whom it may be of ſome uſe, the Prince
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57209:18"/>
will do well to remember, and reflectup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Story of certain Men who had ſet up a Statue in Honour of the Sun, yet in a very litle time they turned their backs to the Sun, and their Faces to the Statue.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Myſtical Unions are better plac'd in the other World, than they are in this, and we ſhall have much ado to find, that in a Monarchy Gods Vicegerency is delegated to more Heads than that which is annointed.</p>
                  <p>Princes may lend ſome of their Light to make another ſhine, but they muſt ſtill preſerve the ſuperiority of being the brighter Planet, and when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the Reverſion is in Mens Eyes, there is more care neceſſary to keep up the Dignity of Poſſeſſions, that Men may not forget who is King, either out of their hopes or fears who ſhall be. If the Sun ſhou'd part with all his Light to any of the Stars, the <hi>Indians</hi> would not know where to find their God, after he had ſo depoſed himſelf, and would make the Light (wherever it went) the Object of their Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>All Uſurpation is alike upon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, its no matter from what hand it coms; and Crowned Heads
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57209:19"/>
are to be the more Circumſpect, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Mens thoughts are naturally apt to ramble beyond what is preſent, they love to work at a diſtance, and in their greedy Expectations; which their minds may be fill'd with of a new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the old one may be left to look a little out of Countenance.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> owns a Paſſion for liberty, yet ſo reſtrained, that it does not in the leaſt impair or taint his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, he thinks it hard for a Soul that does not love Liberty, ever to raiſe it ſelf to another World he takes it to be the foundation of all vertue, and the only ſeaſoning that gives a reliſh to life, and tho' the lazineſs of a ſlaviſh ſubjection, has its Charms for the more groſs and earthly part of Mankind, yet to men made of a better ſort of Clay, all that the World can give without Liberty has no taſte; it is true, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſold ſo cheap by unthinking men, but that does no more leſſen the real value of it, than a Country Fellows Ignorance does that of a Diamond, in ſelling it for a Pot of Ale. Liberty is the Miſtreſs of Mankind, ſhe has power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Charms which do ſo dazzle us, that we find Beauties in her which perhaps
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57209:19"/>
are not there, as we do in other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes; yet if ſhe was not a Beauty, the World would not run mad for her; therefore ſince the reaſonable deſire of of it ought not to be reſtrain'd, and that even the unreaſonable deſire of it cannot be intirely ſuppreſs'd, thoſe who would take it away from a People poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of it, are likely to fail in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting, or be very unquiet in the keeping of it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> admires our bleſſed Conſtitutions, in which Dominion and Liberty are ſo well reconciled; it gives to the Prince the glorious Power of Commanding Free-men, and to the Subject, the ſatifaction of ſeeing the Power ſo lodged, as that their Liberties are ſecure; it dos not allow the Crown ſuch a Ruining Power, as that no graſs can grow where e're it treads, but a Cheriſhing and Protecting Power; ſuch a one as hath a grim Aſpect only to the offending Subjects, but is the Joy and the Pride of all the good ones; their own intereſt being ſo bound up in it, as to engage them to defend and ſupport it; and tho in ſome inſtances the King is reſtrain'd yet nothing in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can move without him; our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57209:20"/>
Laws make a diſtinction between Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage and Obedience; between devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prerogatives, and a Licentious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Freedom: and as of all the Orders of Building, the Compoſite is the beſt, ſo ours by a happy mixture and a wiſe choice of what is beſt in others, is brought into a Form that is our Felicity who live under it, and the envy of our Neighbour that cannot imitate it.</p>
                  <p>The Crown has power ſufficient to protect our Liberties. The People have ſo much Liberty as is neceſſary to make them uſeful to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Our Government is in a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no Tympany, no unnatural ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either of Power or Liberty; and whereas in all overgrown Monarchies, Reaſon, Learning, and Enquiry are hang'd in Effigy for Mutineers; here they are encouraged and cheriſhed as the ſureſt Friends to a Government eſtabliſh'd upon the Foundation of Law and Juſtice When all is done, thoſe who look for Perfection in this World, may look as the <hi>Jews</hi> have for their <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and therefore our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not ſo unreaſonably Partial as to free our Governments; and from all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no doubt there have been fatal Inſtances of its Sickneſs, and more than
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57209:20"/>
that, of its Mortality, for ſometime, tho' by a Miracle, it hath been revivd again: but till we have another race of Mankind, in all Conſtitutions that are bounded, there will ever be ſome matter of Strife, and Contention, and rather than want pretenſions, Mens Paſſions and Intereſts will raiſe them from the moſt inconſiderable Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Our Government is like our Climate, there are Winds which are ſometimes loud and unquiet, and yet with all the Trouble they give us, we owe great part of our Health unto them, they clear the Air, which elſe would be like a ſtanding Pool, and inſtead of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be a Diſeaſe unto us.</p>
                  <p>There may be freſh Gales of aſſerting Liberty, without turning into ſuch ſtorms of Hurricane, as that the State ſhould run any hazard of being Caſt away by them; theſe ſtruglings which are natural to all mixed Governments, while they are kept from growing in Convulſions, do by a mutual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſeveral parts, rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſtrengthen, than weaken or maim the Conſtitution; and the whole frame, inſtead of being torn or diſjoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, comes to be the better and cloſer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57209:21"/>
knit by being thus exerciſed; but what ever faults our Government may have, or a diſcerning Critick may find in it, when he looks upon it alone; let any other be ſet againſt it, and then it ſhews its Comparative Beauty; let us look upon the moſt glittering outſide of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Anthority, and upon a nearer enquiry, we ſhall find nothing but poor and miſerable deformity within; let us imagine a Prince living in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as if in a great Gally, his Subjects tugging at the Oar, laden with Chains, and reduced to real Rags, that they may gain him imaginary Lawrels; let us Repreſent him gazing among his Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and receiving their falſe Worſhip, like a Child never Contradicted, and therefore always Cozen'd: or like a Lady complemented only to be abuſed, condemned never to hear Truth, and conſequently never to do Juſtice, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the ſoft Bed of wanton and unbridled Greatneſs, not leſs odious to the Inſtruments themſelves, than to the Objects of his Tyranny; blown up into an Ambitious Dropſy, never to be ſatisfied by the Conqueſt of other People, or by the Oppreſſion of his own; by aiming to be more than a Man,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57209:21"/>
he falls lower than the meaneſt of 'em, a miſtaken Creature, ſwelled with Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks, &amp; flattered out of his Senſes, and not only an Incumbrance, but a Nuiſance to Mankind, a hardened and unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, and like ſome Creatures that grow fat with Poiſons, he grows great by other Mens Miſeries; an Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ape of the Divine Greatneſs, an unruly Gyant that would ſtorm even Heaven it ſelf, but that his ſcaling Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are not long enough; in ſhort, a Wild and devouring Creature in rich Trappings, and with all his Pride no more than a Whip in God Almighty's hand, to be thrown into the Fire when the World has been ſufficiently ſcourged with it: This Picture laid in right Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours would not incite Men to wiſh for ſuch a Government, but rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the happineſs of our own, under which we enjoy all the Priviledge Reaſonable Men can deſire, and avoid all the Miſeries many others are ſubject too; ſo that out <hi>Trimmer</hi> would keep it with all its faults, and does as little forgive thoſe who give the occaſion of breaking it, as he does thoſe that take it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is a Friend to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57209:22"/>
notwithſtanding all their faults, and exceſſes, which of late have given ſuch matter of Objection to them; he thinks that tho' they may at ſometimes be troubleſome to Authority, yet they add the greateſt ſtrength to it under a wiſe Adminiſtration; he believes no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is perfect except a kind of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence reſide in it, to exerciſed upon great Occaſions: Now this cannot be obtained by force alone upon People, let it be never ſo great, there muſt be their conſent too, or elſe a Nation moves only by being driven, a ſluggiſh &amp; conſtrained Motion, void of that Life and Vigour which is neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great things, whereas the virtual Conſent of the whole being included in their Repreſentatives, and the King gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſanction to the united ſenſe of the People, every Act done by ſuch an Authority, ſeems to be an effect of their choice as well as a part of their Duty; and they do with an eagerneſs, of which Men are uncapable whilſt under a force, execute whatſoever is ſo enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their own Wills, better explained by Parliament, rather than from the terrour of ic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57209:22"/>
this Political Omnipotence, what ever Sap or Juice there is in a Nation, may be to the laſt drop be produc'd, whilſt it riſes naturally from the Root; whereas all power exercis'd without conſent, is like the giving Wounds and Gaſhes, and tapping a Tree at unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Times, for the preſent occaſion, which in a very little time muſt needs deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> believes, that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our Scituation, there can hardly any ſuch ſudden Diſeaſe come upon us, but that the King may have time enough left to conſult with his Phyſitians in Parliament; pretences indeed may be made, but a real neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſo preſſing, that no delay is to be admitted, is hardly to be imagin'd, and it will be neither eaſie to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any ſuch thing for the time paſt, or reaſonable to preſume it will ever happen for the time to come: but if that ſtrange thing ſhould fall out, our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not ſo ſtrait-lac'd, as to let a Nation dye, or to be ſtifled, rather than it ſhould be help'd by any but the proper Officers. The Caſes themſelves will bring the Remedies along with them; and he is not afraid to allow
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57209:23"/>
that in order to its preſervation, there is a hidden Power in Government, which would be loſt if it was deſigned, a certain Myſtery, by virtue of which a Nation may at ſome Critical times be ſecur'd from Ruine, but then it muſt be kept as a Myſtery; it is rendered uſeleſs when touch'd by unskilful hands; and no Government ever had, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to have that Power, which was ſo unwary as to anticipate their claim to it: Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had been better, if the Triennial Act had been obſerv'd; becauſe 'tis the Law, and he would not have the Crown, by ſuch an example, teach the Nation to break it; all irregularity is catching, it has a Contagion in it, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in an Age, ſo much enclin'd to follow ill Patterns than good ones.</p>
                  <p>He would have a Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis an Eſſential part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, even without the Law, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Proviſion in extraordinary Caſes, in which there would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no Remedy, and there can be no greater Soleciſm in Government, than a failure of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>He would have had one, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can unite and heal us, all

other Means are meer Shifts and Projects, Houſes of Cards, to be blown down with the leaſt Breath, and cannot reſiſt the difficulties which are ever preſum'd in things of this kind; and he would have had one, becauſe it might have done the King good, and could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have done him hurt, without his conſent, which in that Caſe is not to be ſuppoſed, and therefore for him to fear it, is ſo ſtrange and ſo little to be comprehended, that the Reaſons can never be preſum'd to grow in our Soyl, or to thrive in it when Tranſplanted from any other Country; and no doubt there are ſuch irreſiſtable Arguments for calling a Parliament, and tho it might be deny'd to the unmannerly mutinous Petitions of men, that are malicious and diſaffected, it will be granted to the ſoft and obſequious Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of his Majeſtys beſt Subjects, and there will be ſuch Rhetorick in their ſilent Grief, that it will at laſt prevail againſt the Artifices of thoſe, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Guilt or Intereſt, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to throw themſelves upon their Country, knowing how ſcurvily they have uſed it; that day of Judgment

it has been the Foundation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and tho falſe Gods have been impos'd upon the Credulous part of the World, yet they were Gods ſtill in their Opinion, and the Awe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Men had to them and their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, kept them within bounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, which the Laws with all their Authority could never have effected without the help of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the Laws would not be able to ſubdue the perverſeneſs of Mens Wills, which are Wild Beaſts, and require a double Chain to keep them down; for this Reaſon 'tis ſaid, That it is not a ſufficient ground to make War upon a Neighbouring State, becauſe they are of another Religion, let it be never ſo differing; yet if they Worſhip'd nor Acknowledg'd any Deity at all, they may be Invaded as Publick Enemies of Mankind, becauſe they reject the only thing that can bind them to live well with one another; the conſideration of Religion is ſo twiſted with that of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it is never to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and tho the Foundations of it ought to be Eternal and Unchangeable, yet the Terms and Circumſtances of Diſcipline, are to be ſuited to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Climates and Conſtitutions, ſo that they may keep men in a willing Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence unto them, without diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the World by nice diſputes, which can never be of equal moment with the publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>Our Religion here in <hi>England</hi> ſeems to be diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar effect of God Almighty's goodneſs, in permiting it to be introduc'd, or rather reſtored, by a more regular Method than the Circumſtances of moſt other Reformed Churches would allow them to do, in relation to the Government; and the Dignity with which it has ſupported it ſelf ſince, and the great Men our Church hath produced, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the eſteem of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants at leaſt: Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is very partial to it, for theſe Reaſons, and many more, and deſires that it may preſerve its due Juriſdiction and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? ſo far he is from wiſhing it oppreſſed by the unreaſonable and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Cavils of thoſe who take pains to raiſe Objections againſt it.</p>

Diſſenters of all ſorts: I will firſt lay this for a ground, That as there can be no true Religion without Charity, ſo there can be no true humane prudence without bearing and condeſcenſion: This Principle does not extend to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Church always to yield to thoſe who are diſpoſed to Conteſt with her, the expediency of doing it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and determined according to the occaſion, and this leads me to lay open the thoughts of our <hi>Trimmer,</hi> in reference, firſt, to the Proteſtants, and then to the Popiſh Recuſants.</p>
                     <p>What has lately hapned among us, makes an Apology neceſſary for ſaying any thing that looks like favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſort of Men who has brought themſelves under ſuch a diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>The late Conſpiracy hath ſuch broad Symptoms of the diſaffection of the whole Party, that upon the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, while our thoughts are warm, it would almoſt perſwade us to put them out of the protection of our good Nature, and to think that the Chriſtian Indulgence with our compaſſion for other Mens Sufferings cannot eaſily deny, ſeems not only to be forfeited by the ill appearances that are againſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57209:27"/>
them, but even becomes a Crime when it is ſo miſapplied; yet for all this, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond and cooler thoughts, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men will not be ſo ready to involve a whole Party in the guilt of a few, and to admit inferences and Preſumptions to be Evidence in a Caſe, where the Sentence muſt be ſo heavy, as it ought to be againſt all thoſe who have a fixed reſolution againſt the Goverement eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed? beſides, Men who act by a Principle grounded upon Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, can never let it be clearly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the moſt repeated Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if a right thing agreeable to Nature and good Sence taks root in the heart of a Man, that is impartial and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs'd, no outward Circumſtances can ever deſtroy it; its true, the degrees of a Mans Zeal for the proſecution of it may be differing, faults of other Men, the conſideration of the publick, and the ſeaſonable Prudence by which Wiſe Men will ever be directed, may give great Allays; they may leſſen and for a time perhaps ſuppreſs the exerciſe of that, which in general Propoſition may be reaſonable, but ſtill whatever is ſo will inevitably grow and ſpring up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, having a Foundation in Nature,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57209:27"/>
which is never to be deſtroy'd.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore endeavours to ſeparate the deteſtation of thoſe who had either a hand or a thought in the late Plot, from the Principle of Prudential as well as Chriſtian Charity towards Mankind, and for that reaſon would fain uſe the means of reclaiming ſuch of the Diſſenters as are not incurable, and even bearing to a degree thoſe that are, as far as may conſiſt with the Publick Intereſt and Security; he is far from juſtifying an affected ſeparation from the Communion of the Church, and even in thoſe that mean well, and are miſtaken; he looks upon it as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that has ſeized upon their Minds, very troubleſome as well as dangerous, by the Conſequence it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: he does not go about to excuſe their making it an indiſpenſable duty, to meet in numbers to ſay their Prayers, ſuch meetings may prove miſchievous to the State at leaſt; the Laws which are the beſt Judges, have determined that there is danger in them: he has good nature enough to lament that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of a Part ſhould have drawn Rigorous Laws upon the whole Body of the Diſſenters, but when they are once
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57209:28"/>
made, no private Opinion muſt ſtand in Oppoſition to them; if they are in themſelves reaſonable, they are in that reſpect to be regarded, even without being enjoyned, if by the Change of Time and Circumſtances they ſhould become leſs reaſonable than when they were firſt made, even then they are to be obey'd too, becauſe they are Laws, till they are mended or repealed by the ſame Authority that Enacted them.</p>
                     <p>He has too much deference to the Conſtitution of our Government, to wiſh for more Prerogative Declarations in favour of ſcrupulous Men, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with Penal Laws in ſuch manner, or to ſuch an end, that ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men might with ſome reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that ſo hated a thing as Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could never make way for it ſelf with any hopes of Succeſs, otherwiſe than by preparing the deluded World by a falſe proſpect of Liberty and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The inward Springs and Wheels whereby the Engine moved, are now ſo fully laid open and expos'd, that it is not ſuppoſable that ſuch a baffled Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ever be tryed again, the effect it had at the time, and the Spirit it raiſed, will not eaſily be forgotten,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57209:28"/>
and it may be preſum'd the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it may ſecure us from any more attempts of that Nature for the future; we muſt no more break a Law to give Men eaſe, than we are to Rifle an Houſe with a devout intention of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the plunder to the Poor; in this caſe, our Compaſſion would be as ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, as our Charity in the other.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the veneration due to the Laws is never to be thrown off, let the pretences be never ſo ſpecious; yet with all this he cannot bring himſelf to think, that an extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to take the uttermoſt penalty of Laws, upon the poor offending Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is of it ſelf ſuch an all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vertue, that without any thing elſe to recommend Men, it ſhould Entitle them to all kind of Preferments and Rewards; he would not detract from the merits of thoſe who execute the Laws, yet he cannot think ſuch a piece of ſervice as this, can entirely change the Man, and either make him a better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or a more knowing Magiſtrate than he was before, eſpecially if it be done with a partial and unequal hand, in Reverence to greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Offenders.</p>

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57209:29"/>
Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Men ready to throw themſelves into the arms of the Church, and he would have thoſe arms as ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them that ſhall come to us; he would have no ſupercilious look to fright thoſe ſtrayed Sheep from coming into the Fold again; no ill-natur'd maxims of an Eternal ſuſpicion, or a belief that thoſe who have once been in the wrong can never be in the right again; but a viſible preparation of mind to recieve with joy all the Proſelites that come amongſt us, and much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er earneſtneſs to reclaim than puniſh them: It is to be confeſs'd, there is a great deal to forgive, a hard task enough for the Charity of a Church ſo provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that muſt not cut off all hopes of being reconciled, yet if there muſt be ſome anger left ſtill, let it break out into a Chriſtian Revenge, and by being kinder to the Children of Diſobedience than they deſerve, let the injur'd Church Triumph, by throwing ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of face upon them; there ſhould not always be Storms and Thunder, a clear Sky would ſometime make the Church look more like Heaven, and would do more towards the reclaiming
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57209:29"/>
thoſe wanderers, than a perpetual ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which ſeemed to have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; for there is in many, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> a miſtaken pleaſure, in reſiſting the dictates of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Authority; a Stomach that riſeth againſt a hard impoſition, nay, in ſome, raiſe even a luſt in ſuffering from a wrong point of Honour, which does not want the applauſe, from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of Mankind, who have not learnt to diſtinguiſh; conſtancy will be thought a virtue even where it is a miſtake; and the ill Judging World will be apt to think that Opinion moſt right, which produces the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who are willing to ſuffer for it; all this is prevented, and falls to the ground, by uſing well-timed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; and the ſtubborn Adverſary who values himſelf upon his reſiſtance whilſt he is oppreſs'd, yields inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to kind Methods, when they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to him, and the ſame Man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally melts into Conformity, who perhaps would never have been beaten into it. We may be taught by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that attendeth the moſt Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men when they are Condemned, that Faults are much more natural
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57209:30"/>
things than Puniſhments, and that even the moſt neceſſary acts of ſeverity do ſome kind of violence to our Nature, whoſe Indulgence will not be confined within the ſtrait bounds of inexorable Juſtice; ſo that this ſhould be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for gentleneſs, beſides that it is the likelieſt way to make theſe Men aſham'd of their Separation, whilſt the preſſing them too hard, tends rather to make them proud of it.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have the Clergy ſupported in their lawful Rights, and in all the Power and Dignity that belongs to them, and yet he thinks that poſſibly there may be in ſome of them a too great eagerneſs to extend the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Juriſdiction; which tho it may be well intended, yet the ſtraining of it too high has an appearance of Ambition that raiſes mens Objections to it, and is far unlike the Apoſtolick Zeal, which was quite otherwiſe employ'd, that the World draws inferences from it, which do the Church no ſervice.</p>
                     <p>He is troubled to ſee Men of all ſides ſick of a Calenture of a miſtaken Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it ſeems to him that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Fire of miſtaken Charity with which the Primitive Chriſtians were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57209:30"/>
is long ſince extinguiſh'd, and inſtead of it a devouring Fire of Anger and Perſecution breaks out in the World; we wrangle now one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother about Religion till the Blood comes, whilſt the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have no more authority with us, than if they were ſo many obſolete Laws or Proclamations out of date; he thinks that a Nation will hardly be mended by Principles of Religion, where Morality is made a Hereſy; and therefore as he believes Devotion miſplaced when it gets into a Conventicle, he concludes that Loyalty is ſo too, when lodg'd in a Drunken Club; thoſe Vertues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a better Seat of Empire, and they are degraded, when ſuch Men undertake their defence, as have too great need of an Apology themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> wiſhes that ſome knowledge may go along with the Zeal on the right ſide, and that thoſe who are in poſſeſſion of the Pulpit, would quote at leaſt ſo often the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures as they do that of the State; there are many who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row too often Arguments from the Government, to uſe againſt their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and neglect thoſe that are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57209:31"/>
more proper, and would be more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; a Divine grows leſs, and puts a diminution on his own Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he quoteth any Law but that of God Almighty, to get the better of thoſe who conteſt with him; and it is a ſign of a decay'd Conſtitution, when Nature with good diet cannot expel noxious Humours without calling Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Drugs to her Aſſiſtance; So it looks like want of health in a Church, when inſtead of depending upon the power of that Truth which it holds, and the good Examples of them that teach it, to ſupport it ſelf, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Errors, it ſhould have a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al recourſe to the ſecular Authority, and even upon the ſlighteſt occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> has his Objections to the too buſy diligence, and to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of ſome of the diſſenting Clergy, and he does as little approve of thoſe of our Church, who wear God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Liveries, as ſome old Warders in the <hi>Tower</hi> do the King's, who do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their place but receive their Wages for it; he thinks that the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the late times gave men ſo much Light, and diffuſed it ſo univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, that they are not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57209:31"/>
now to be dealt with, as they might have been in Ages of leſs enquiry; and therefore in ſome well choſen and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Auditories, good reſolute Nonſenſe back'd with Authority may prevail, yet generally Men are become ſo good Judges of what they hear, that the Clergy ought to be very wary how they go about to impoſe upon their Underſtandings, which are grown leſs humble than they were in former times, when the Men in black had made Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſin in the Laity, that for fear of offending, they made a Conſcience of being able to read; but now the World is grown ſawcy, and expects Reaſons, and good ones too, before they give up their own Opinions to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Dictates, tho never ſo Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially deliver'd to them.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is far from approving the Hypocricie which ſeems to be the reigning Vice amongſt ſome of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Clergy, he thinks it the moſt provoking ſin Men can be guilty of, in Relation to Heaven, and yet (which may ſeem ſtrange) that very ſin which ſhall deſtroy the Soul of the Man who preaches, may help to ſave thoſe of the Company that hear him, and even
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57209:32"/>
thoſe who are cheated by the falſe Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his ſtrictneſs of life, may by that Pattern be encouraged to the real Practice of thoſe Chriſtian Vertues which he does ſo deceitfully profeſs; ſo that the deteſtation of this fault may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be carry'd on too far by our own Orthodox Divines, if they think it cannot be enough expreſs'd without bending the Stick another way; a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Method, and a worſe Extream for Men of that Character, who by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the outmoſt line of Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, will certainly encourage others to go beyond it: No Man does leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ill-bred Methods of ſome of the Diſſenters, in rebuking Authority, who behave themſelves as if they thought ill manners neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet he cannot but diſtinguiſh and deſire a Mean between the ſawcyneſs of ſome of the <hi>Scotch Apoſtles,</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Courtſhip of ſome of the Silken Divines, who, one would think, do practice to bow at the Altar, only to learn to make the better Legs at Court.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> approves the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Church, that Dominion is not founded in Grace, and that our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is to be given to a Popiſh King
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57209:32"/>
in other things, at the ſame time that our Compliance with him in his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to be deny'd; yet he cannot but think it a very extraordinary thing if a Proteſtant Church ſhould by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Election, chuſe a Papiſt for their Guardian, and receive Directions for ſupporting their Religion, from one who muſt believe it a Mortal Sin not to endeavour to deſtroy it; ſuch a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned piece of Breeding would not ſeem to be very well plac'd in the Clergy, who will hardly find Preſidents to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy; ſuch an extravagant piece of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and which is ſo unlike the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Methods, which ought to be our Pattern; he hath no ſuch unreaſonable tenderneſs for any ſorts of Men, as to expect their faults ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially laid open as often as they give occaſion for it; and yet he cannot but ſmile to ſee that the ſame Man, who ſets up all the Sails of his Rhetorick, to fall upon Diſſenters; when Popery is to be handled, he does it ſo gingerly, that he looketh like an Aſs mumbling of Thiſtles, ſo afraid he is of letting himſelf looſe where he may be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of etting his Duty get the better of his Diſcretion.</p>

Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is far from reliſhing the impertinent Wandrings of thoſe who pour out long Prayers upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and all from their own Stock, which God knows, for the moſt part is a barren Soil, which produces Weeds inſtead of Flowers, and by this means they expoſe Religion it ſelf, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than promote Mens Devotions: On the other ſide, there may be too great Reſtraint put upon Men, whom God and Nature hath diſtinguiſhed from their Fellow Labourers, by bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with a happier Talent, and by giving them not only good Senſe, but a powerful Utterance too, has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to guſh out upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Auditory, with a mighty ſtream of Devout and unaffected Eloquence; when a Man ſo qualified, endued with Learning too, and above all, adorn'd with a good Life, breaks out into a warm and well deliver'd Prayer before his Sermon, it has the appearance of a Divine Rapture, he raiſes and leads the Hearts of the Aſſembly in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than the moſt Compos'd or beſt Studied Form of Set Words can ever do; and the Pray-wees, who ſerve up all their Sermons with the ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57209:33"/>
would, look like ſo many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or Men of Straw in the Pulpit, compar'd with thoſe who ſpeak with ſuch a powerful Zeal, that Men are tempted at the moment to belive Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf has dictated their words to em.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not ſo unreaſonably indulgent to the Diſſenters, as to excuſe the Irregularities of their Complaints, and to approve their threatning Stiles, which are ſo ill-ſuited to their Circumſtances as well as their Duty; he would have them to ſhew their Grief, and not their Anger to the Government, and by ſuch a Submiſſion to Authority, as becomes them, if they cannot acquieſce in what is impoſed; let them deſerve a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Remedy to their Sufferings, there being no other way to give them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect redreſs; and either to ſeek it, or pretend to give it by any other Method, would not only be vain, but Criminal too in thoſe that go about it; yet with all this, there may in the mean time be a prudential Latitude left, as to the manner of preventing the Laws now in force againſt them: The Government is in ſome degree anſwerable for ſuch an Adminiſtration of them, as may be free from the Cenſure of Impartial
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57209:34"/>
Judges; and in order to that, it would be neceſſary that one of theſe methods be purſued, either to let looſe the Laws to their utmoſt extent, without any Moderation or Reſtraint, in which at leaſt the Equality of the Government would be without Objection, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties being exacted without Remiſſion from the Diſſenters of all kinds; or if that will not be done (and indeed there is no reaſon it ſhould) there is a neceſſity of ſome connivance to the Proteſtant Diſſenters to execute that which in Humanity muſt be allowed to the Papiſts, even without any leaning towards them, which muſt be ſuppoſed in thoſe who are or ſhall be in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of publick Buſineſs; and it will follow that, according to our Circumſtances, the diſtribution of ſuch connivance muſt be made in ſuch a manner, that the greateſt part of it may fall on the Proteſtant ſide, or elſe the Objections will be ſo ſtrong, and the Inferences ſo clear, that the Friends, as well as the Enemies of the Crown, will be ſure to take hold of them.</p>
                     <p>It will not be ſufficient to ſay that the Papiſts may be conniv'd at, becauſe they are good Subiects and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57209:34"/>
Diſſenters, muſt ſuffer becauſe they are ill ones; theſe general Maxims will not convince diſcerning Men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any late Inſtances make them forget what paſſed at other times in the World; both ſides have had their Turns in being good and ill Subjects. And therefore 'tis eaſie to imagine what ſuſpicions would ariſe in the preſent conjuncture, if ſuch a partial Argument as this ſhould be impos'd upon us; the truth is, this Matter ſpeaks ſo much of it ſelf; that it is not only unneceſſary, but it may be unmannerly to ſay any more of it.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore could wiſh, that ſince notwithſtanding the Laws which deny Churches to ſay Maſs in; even not only the Exerciſe, but alſo the Oſtentation of Popery is as well or better performed in the Chappels of ſo many Foreign Miniſters, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> openly reſort in ſpight of Proclamations and Orders of Council, which are grown to be as harmleſs things to them, as the Popes Bulls and Excommunications are to Hereticks who are out of his reach; I ſay he could wiſh that by a ſeaſonable as well as an equal piece of Juſtice, there might be ſo

might have been perhaps as perfect as in any other Place, if the ſhort Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, and the ſucceſſion of a Popiſh Queen had not given ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to that Religion, that it has ſubſiſted ever ſince under all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that have been put upon it; it has been a ſtrong Compact Body, and made the more ſo by theſe Sufferings; it was not ſtrong enough to prevail, but it was able, with the help of foreign ſupport, to carry on an Intereſt which gave the Crown trouble, and to make a conſiderable (not to ſay dangerous) Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Nation; ſo much as this could not have been done without ſome hopes, nor theſe hopes kept up without ſome reaſonable grounds: In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Zeal for their Religion, and the Revenge for 88, gave warmth to the Papiſts here, and above all the Right of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to ſuceeed, was while ſhe lived ſufficient to give them a better proſpect of their Affairs: In King <hi>James</hi>'s time their hopes were ſupported by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, and his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them, which they were ready to interpret more in their own Favour, than was either reaſonable or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57209:38"/>
became them, ſo little tenderneſs they have, even where it is moſt due, if the Intereſt of their Religion comes in competition with it.</p>
                     <p>As for the late King, tho he gave the moſt Glorious Evidence that ever Man did of his being a Proteſtant, yet, by the more than ordinary Influence the Queen was thought to have over him, and it ſo happening that the greateſt part of his Anger was directed againſt the <hi>Puritans,</hi> there was ſuch an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Men diſpos'd to ſuſpect, that they were ready to interpret it a leaning towards Popery, without which handle it was Morally impoſſible, that the ill-affected part of the Nation could ever have ſeduc'd the reſt into a Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>That which help'd to confirm ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well meaning Men in their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions of the King, was the long and unuſual intermiſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; ſo that every year that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſad without one, made up a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to increaſe their Suſpicion, and made them preſume that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts had a principal hand in keeping them off: This raiſed ſuch Heats in Mens Minds, to think that Men who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57209:38"/>
were obnoxious to the Laws, inſtead of being puniſhed, ſhould have Credit enough to ſerve themſelves, even at the price of deſtroying the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitution; that it broke but into a Flame, which, before it could be quenched, had almoſt reduc'd the Nation ro Aſhes.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the miſerable Effects of that unnatural War, none hath been more fatal to us, than the forcing our Princes to breathe in another Air, and to receive the early impreſſions of a Foreign Education; the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Queen Mother, (as generally Ladies do with Age) grew moſt devout and earneſt in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and beſides, the temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of getting larger Subſidies from the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, ſhe had Motives
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57209:39"/>
of another kind, to perſwade her to ſhew her Zeal; and ſince by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Diſpenſatory, a Soul converted to the Church is a Soveraign Remedy, and lays up a mighty ſtock of merit; ſhe was ſolicitous to ſecure her ſelf in all Events, and therefore firſt ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſo much upon her good will, that ſhe might for that reaſon have been induc'd to believe, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt would not be difficult; but it ſo fell out, that he either from his own Conſtancy, or that he had thoſe near him by whom he was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways advis'd, choſe rather to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her importunity, than by ſtaying to bear the continual weight of it: It is belie v'd ſhe had better ſucceſs with another of her Sons, who, if he was not quite brought off from our Religion, at leaſt ſuch beginnings were made, as made them very eaſie to be finiſh'd; his being of a generous and aſpiring Nature, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, leſs patient in the drudgery of Arguing, might probably help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a Church to him, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts the Laity from the vexation of enquiring; perhaps he might (tho
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57209:39"/>
by miſtake) look upon that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as more favourable to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Power of Kings, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which might have its weight with a young Prince in his warm blood, and that was brought up in Arms.</p>
                     <p>I cannot hinder my ſelf from a ſmall digreſſion, to conſider with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that the old Lady of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all her wrinkles, ſhould yet have charms, able to ſubdue great Princes; ſo far from handſom, and yet ſo imperious; ſo painted, and yet ſo pretending; after having abus'd, depos'd, and murther'd ſo many of her Lovers, ſhe ſtill finds others glad and proud of their new Chains; a thing ſo ſtrange, to indifferent Judges, that thoſe who will allow no other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt needs grant that this is one not to be conteſted; ſhe ſits in her Shop, and ſells at dear Rates her Rattles and her Hobby-Horſes, whilſt the deluded World ſtill continues to furniſh her with Cuſtomers.</p>
                     <p>But whither am I carried with this Contemplation? it is high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Text, and to conſider the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57209:40"/>
wonderful manner of the Kings coming home again, led by the hand of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and called by the Voice of his own People, who receiv'd him, if poſſible, with Joys equal to the Bleſſing of Peace and Union which his Reſtauration brought along with it; by this there was an end put to the hopes ſome might have abroad, of making uſe of his leſs happy Circumſtances, to throw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foreign Intereſts and Opinions, which had been wholly inconſiſtent with our Religion, our Laws, and all other things that are dear to us; yet for all this, ſome of thoſe Tinctures and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions might ſo far remain, as tho' they were very innocent in him, yet they might have ill effects here, by ſoftning the Animoſity which ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Defender of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Faith, in oppoſition to ſuch a powerful and irreconcileable an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>You may be ſure, that among all the ſorts of Men who apply'd themſelves to the King at his firſt coming home, for his Protection, the Papiſts were not the laſt, nor, as they fain would have flatter'd themſelves, the leaſt welcome; having their paſt Sufferings, as well as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57209:40"/>
their preſent Profeſſions to recommend them; and there was ſomething that look'd like a particular Conſideration of them, ſince it ſo happened, that the Indulgence promiſed to Diſſenters at <hi>Breda,</hi> was carried on in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Papiſts were to divide with them, and tho' the Parliament, notwithſtanding its Reſignation to the Crown in all things, rejected with ſcorn and anger a Declaration fram'd for this purpoſe, yet the Birth and ſteps of it gave ſuch an alarm, that Mens ſuſpicious once raiſed, were not eaſily laid aſleep again.</p>
                     <p>To omit other things, the breach of the Tripple League, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> War with its appurtenances, carried Jealouſies to the higheſt pitch imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and fed the hopes of one Party, and the fears of the Other to ſuch a degree, that ſome Critical Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were generally expectad, when the ill ſucceſs of that War, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>France</hi> thought fit to make of the Papiſts here, to their own intereſt abroad, gave them another Check; and the Act of enjoyning the Teſt to all in Offices, was thought to be no ill Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Nation, tho' bought at the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57209:41"/>
Price of 1200000 pound, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney apply'd to continue the War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> than which nothing could be more unpopular or leſs approved. Notwithſtanding the diſcouragements, Popery is a Plant that may be mowed down, but the Root will ſtill remain, and in ſpite of the Laws, it will ſprout up &amp; grow again; eſpecially if it ſhould happen that there ſhould be Men in Power, who in weeding it out of our Garden, will take care to Cheriſh and keep it alive; and tho' the Law for excluding them from Places of Truſt was tolerably kept as to their outward Form, yet there were many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which being improved by the quick-ſighted Malice of ill affected Men, did help to keep up the World in their ſuſpicions, and to blow up Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies to ſuch a heighth both in and out of Parliament, that the remembrance of them is very unpleaſant, and the Example ſo extravagant, that it is to be hop'd nothing in our Age like it will be re-attempted; but to come cloſer to the Caſe in queſtion, in this Condition we ſtand with the Papiſts, what ſhall now be done according to our <hi>Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Opinion, in order to the better
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57209:41"/>
Bearing this grievance, ſince as I have ſaid before, there is no hopes of being entirely free from it; Papiſts we muſt have among us, and if their Religion keep them from bringing honey to the Hive, let the Government try at leaſt by gentle means to take away the Sting from them. The firſt Foundation to be laid is, that a diſtinct Conſideration is to be had of the Popiſh Clergy, who have ſuch an eternal Intereſt againſt all accommodation, that it is a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing to propoſe any thing to them leſs than all; their Stomachs have been ſet for it ever ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they have pinned themſelves to a Principle that admits no mean: they believe Proteſtants will be damn'd, and therefore by an extraordinary Effect of Chriſtian Charity, they would deſtroy one half of <hi>England</hi> that the other might be ſaved; then for this World, they muſt be in poſſeſſion for God Almighty, to receive his Rents for him, not to accompt till the Day of Judgment, which is a good kind of Tenure, and ye cannot well blame the good Men, that will ſtir up the Laity to run any hazard in order to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them reſtor'd. What is it to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57209:42"/>
Prieſt, if the deluded Zealot undoes himſelf in the Attempt? he ſings Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as jollily, and with as good a Voice at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>St. Omers</hi> as ever he did; is a ſingle Man, and can have no wants but ſuch as may be eaſily ſupplyd, yet that he may not ſeem altogether inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or ungrateful to thoſe that are his Martyrs, he is ready to aſſure their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and if they pleaſe, will procure a Grant <hi>ſub Annulo Piſcatoris,</hi> that the good Man by being changed, has got a good Bargain, and ſav'd the ſinging of ſome hundred of years, which he would elſe have had in Purgatory. There's no Cure for this Order of Men, no Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be propos'd, ſo that tho the utmoſt ſeverity of the Laws againſt them, may in ſome ſort be mittigated, yet no Treaty can be made with Men who in this Caſe have left themſelves no free Will, but are ſo muffled by Zeal, tyed by Vows, and kept up by ſuch unchangeable Maxims of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that they are to be left as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Patients, and look'd upon as Men that will continue in an Eternal State of Hoſtility, till the Nation is entirely ſubdued to them. It is then only the Lay Papiſts that are capable of being treated with, and we are to examine
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57209:42"/>
of what temper they are, and what Arguments are the moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon them, and how far 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable for the Government to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to them; the Lay Papiſts ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally keep their Religion, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not break Company with thoſe of their Party, than out of any ſettled Zeal that hath Root in them; moſt of them do by the Mediation of the Prieſts Marry amongſt one another, to keep up an ignorant Poſition by hearing only one ſide; others by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake look upon it as the Eſcutcheons of the more Antient Religion of the two; and as ſome Men of a good Pedigree, will deſpiſe meaner Men, tho' never ſo much ſuperior to them by Nature, ſo theſe undervalue Reformation as an Upſtart, and think there is more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in ſupporting an old Errour, than in embracing what ſeems to them to be a new Truth; the Laws have made them Men of Pleaſure, by excluding them from Publick Buſineſs, and it happens well they are ſo, ſince they will the more eaſily be perſwaded by Arguments of Eaſe and Conveniency <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

between the merit of ſuffering for a good Cauſe, and the fooliſh oſtentation of drawing inconveniencies upon himſelf; and therefore will not be unwilling to be convinc'd that our Proteſtant Creed may make him happy in the other World, and the eaſier in this.

On the other ſide, let not the Papiſts ſuffer themſelves to be led by any hopes, tho never ſo flattering, to a Confidence or Oſtentation which muſt provoke Men to be leſs kind to them; let them uſe Modeſty on their ſides, and the Proteſtants Indulgence on theirs; and by this means there will be an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking of all Venial Faults, a tacit connivanee at all things that do not carry Scandal with them, and would amount to a kind of Natural Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the the ſevere Laws, ſince there would be no more Accuſers to be found, when the occaſions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Animoſity are once remov'd; let the Papiſts in the mean time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that there is a reſpect due from all leſſer numbers to greater, a deference to be paid by an Opinion that is Exploded, to one that is Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

Power of Chriſtendom, and that either by Inheritance or Conqueſt, the better part of <hi>France</hi> receiv'd Laws from us; after that we being reduc'd into our own Limits, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> became the Rivals for the Univerſal Monarchy, and our third Power, tho in it ſelf leſs than either of the other, hapned to be Superiour to any of them, by that choice we had of throwing the Scales on that ſide to which we gave our Friendſhip. I do not know whether this Figure did not make us as great as our former Conqueſt, to be a perpetual Umpire of two great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Powers, who gave us all their Courtſhip, and offer'd all their Incenſe at our Altar, whilſt the Fate of either Prince ſeemed to depend upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we delivered; for the King of <hi>England</hi> to ſit on his Throne, as in the Supream Court of Juſtice, to which the two great Monarchs appeal, pleading their Cauſe, and expecting their Sentence. declaring which ſide was in the right, or at leaſt if we pleas'd which ſide ſhould have the better of it, was a piece of Greatneſs which was peculiar to us, and no wonder if we endeavour
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57209:47"/>
to preſerve it, as we did for a conſiderable time, it being our Safety, as well as Glory, to maintain it; but by a Fatality upon our Councils, or by the refin'd Policy of this latter Age, we have thought fit to uſe induſtry to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this mighty Power, which we have ſo long enjoyed; and that equality between the Two Monarchs, which we might for ever have preſerved, has been chiefly broken by us, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was above all others to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; when one of them, like the overflowing of the Sea, had gained more upon the other than our conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, or indeed our ſafety, would allow; inſtead of mending the Banks, or making new ones, we our ſelves with our own hands helpt to cut them, to invite and make way for a farther Inundation. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have had their ſeveral turns in making uſe of our Miſtakes, and we have been formerly as deaf to the Inſtances of the then weaker part of the World to help them againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as we can now be to the Earneſtneſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> that we would aſſiſt them againſt the Power of <hi>France. Gondamar</hi> was as ſawcy, and as powerful too in King
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57209:48"/>
                        <hi>James</hi> his Court, as any French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour can have been at any time ſince, when men talkt as wrong then on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, and made their Court by it, as well as any can have done ſince by talking as much for the <hi>French;</hi> ſo that from that time, inſtead of weighing in a wiſeBalance the power of either Crown, it looks as if we had learnt only to weigh the Penſions, and take the heavieſt.</p>
                     <p>It would be tedious, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome, to recapitulate all our wrong ſteps, ſo that I will go no farther than the King's Reſtauration, at which time the Balance was on the ſide of <hi>France,</hi> and that by the means of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who for a ſeparate Intereſt of his own had ſacrificed that of the Nation, by joining with the ſtronger ſide, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he ought to have ſupported. Such a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was natural enough to an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſhew'd he was not the Lawful Father of the People, by his having ſo little care of them; and the Example coming from that hand, one would think ſhould, for that Reaſon, be leſs likely to be follow'd. But to go on, home comes the King, followed with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57209:48"/>
Courtſhips from all Nations abroad, of which ſome did it not only to make them forget how familiarly they had us'd him when he was in other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but to beſpeak the Friendſhip of a Prince, who, beſides his other Greatneſs, was yet more conſiderable by being re-eſtabliſhed by the love of his people. <hi>France</hi> had an Intereſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſpoſe us to ſo much good will, or at leaſt to put us into ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we might give no Oppoſition to their Deſigns; and <hi>Flanders</hi> being a perpetual Object in their Eye, a laſting Beauty for which they have an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſion, and not being kind enough to conſent to them, they meditated to commit a Rape upon her, which they thought would not be eaſie to do, whilſt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to reſcue her, when-ever they ſhould hear her cry out for help to them; to this end they put in practice Seaſonable and Artificial Whiſpers, to widen things between us, and the States. <hi>Amboyna</hi> and the Fiſhery muſt be talk'd of here; the freedom of the Seas, and the preſervation of Trade muſt be inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated there; and there being combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter on both ſides, in a little
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57209:49"/>
time it took Fire, which gave thoſe that kindled it, ſufficient cauſe to ſmile and hug themſelves, to ſee us both fall into the Net they had laid for us. And it is obſervable and of good example to us, if we will take it, That their Deſign being to ſet us together at Cuffs to weaken us, they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Lookers on till our Victories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to break the Balance; then the King of <hi>France,</hi> like a wiſe Prince, was reſolved to ſupport the beaten ſide, and would no more let the Power of the Sea, than we ought to ſuffer the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Europe,</hi> to fall into one hand: In purſuance to this, he took part with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and in a little time made himſelf Umpire of the Peace between us; ſome time after, upon pretence of his Queen's Title to part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by Right of Devolution, he falls into it with a mighty Force, for which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was ſo little prepared, that he made a very ſwift Progreſs, and had ſuch a Torrent of undiſputed Victory, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> tho the Wounds they had given one another were yet green, being ſtruck with the apprehenſion of ſo near a danger to them, thought it neceſſary, for their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57209:49"/>
own defence, to make up a ſudden League, into which <hi>Sweden</hi> was taken to interpoſe for a Peace between the two Crowns.</p>
                     <p>This had ſo good an effect, that <hi>France</hi> was ſtopt in its Career, and the Peace of <hi>Aix le Chapelle</hi> was a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concluded. 'Twas a forc'd putt; and tho <hi>France</hi> wiſely diſſembled their inward diſſatisfaction, yet from the very moment they reſolv'd to unty the Triple knot, whatever it coſt them; for his Chriſtian Majeſty, after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Meals, ever riſes with a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and he lik'd the Pattern ſo well, that it gave him a longing deſire to have the whole Piece. Amongſt the other means uſed for the attaining this end, the ſending over the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was not the leaſt powerful; ſhe was a very welcome Gueſt here, and her own Charms and Dexterity joined with other Advantages, that might help her perſwaſions, gave her ſuch an Aſcendant, that ſhe could hardly fail of ſucceſs. One of the Preliminaries of her Treaty, tho a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial thing in it ſelf, yet was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the conſequence, as very ſmall circumſtances often are in relation to the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57209:50"/>
Government of the World. About this time a general Humour, in oppoſition to <hi>France,</hi> had made us throw off their Faſhion, and put on Veſts, that we might look more like a diſtinct People, and not be under the ſervility of imitation, which ever pays a greater deference to the Original, than is conſiſtent with the Equality all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Nations ſhould pretend to; <hi>France</hi> did not like this ſmall beginning of ill Humours, at leaſt of Emulation, and wiſely conſidering that it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Introduction firſt to make the World their Apes, that they may be afterwards their Slaves. It was thought that one of the Inſtructions Madam brought along with her, was to laugh us out of theſe Veſts, which ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſo effectually, that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like ſo many Footmen who had quitted their Maſters Livery, we all took it again, and returned to our old Service; ſo that the very time of doing it gave a very critical Advantage to <hi>France,</hi> ſince it lookt like an Evidence of our returning to their Intereſt, as well as to their Faſhion, and would give ſuch a diſtruſt of us to our new Allies, that it might facilitate the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57209:50"/>
of the knot, which tied them ſo within their bounds, that they were very impatient till they were freed from the reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>But the Lady had a more extended Commiſſion than this, and without doubt we double-laid the Foundation of a new ſtrict Alliance, quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the other, in which we had been ſo lately engag'd. And of this there were ſuch early appearances, that the World began to look upon us as falling into Apoſtacy from the common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>France</hi> did not neglect at the ſame time to give good words to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to feed them with hopes of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them againſt us, when on a ſudden, that never to be forgotten De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of War againſt them comes out, only to vindicate his own Glory, and to revenge the Injuries done to his Brother in <hi>England,</hi> by which he became our Second in this Duel; ſo humble can this Prince be, when at the ſame time he does more Honour than we deſerve, he lays a greater ſhare of the blame upon our Shoulders, than did naturally belong to us; the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that War, our part in it while we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57209:51"/>
ſtaid in, and when we were out of breath, our leaving the <hi>French</hi> to make an end of it, are things too well known to make it neceſſary, and too unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in themſelves to incite me to repeat them; only the wiſdom of <hi>France</hi> is in this to be obſerved, That when we had made a ſeparate Peace, which left them ſingle to oppoſe the united Force of the Confederates, they were ſo far from being angry, that they would not ſhew ſo much as the leaſt coldneſs, hoping to get as much by our Mediation for a Peace, as they would have expected from our Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the War, our Circumſtances at that time conſidered. This ſeaſonable piece of Indulgence in not reproaching us, but rather allowing thoſe Neceſſities of State which we gave for our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, was ſuch an engaging Method, that it went a great way to keep us ſtill in their Chains, when, to the Eye of the World, we had abſolutely broke looſe from them: And what paſsed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at <hi>Nimoguen,</hi> tho the King's Neutrality gave him the outward Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Mediator, it appear'd that his Interpoſition was extremely ſuſpected of Partiality by the Confederates, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57209:51"/>
upon that Ground did both at and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Concluſion of that Treaty, treat his Miniſters there with a great deal of neglect. In this Peace, as well as that in the <hi>Pirenean</hi> and <hi>Aix le Chapelle,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> at the Moment of making it, had the thought of breaking it; for a very little time after he broach'd his Pretenſions upon <hi>Aloſt,</hi> which were things that if they had been offer'd by a leſs formidable hand, would have been ſmiled at; but ill Arguments being ſeconded by good Armies, carry ſuch a power with them, that naked ſenſe is a very unequal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. It was thought that theſe aie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Claims were chiefly rais'd with the proſpect of getting <hi>Luxemburg</hi> for the Equivalent; and this Opinion was confirm'd by the blocking it up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, pretending to the Country of <hi>Chimay,</hi> that it might be entirely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the French Dominions, and it was ſo preſſed that it might have fallen in a little time, if the King of <hi>France</hi> had not ſent Orders to his Troops to retire, and his Chriſtian Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity which was aſſign'd for the reaſon of it, made the World ſmile, ſince it is ſeen how differently his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout

Zeal works in <hi>Hungary:</hi> that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reaſon was in many reſpects ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim'd, and <hi>France</hi> it ſelf gave it ſo faintly, that at the very time it look'd out of Countenance; the true ground of his Retiring is worth our obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for at the inſtance of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, Offices were done, and Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als given, but all ineffectual till the word <hi>Parliament</hi> was put into them; that powerful word had ſuch an effect, that even at that diſtance it rais'd the Siege, which may convince us of what efficacy the King of <hi>England</hi>'s words are, when he will give them their full weight, and threaten with his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> it is then that he appears that great Figure we ought to repreſent him in our Minds, the Nation his Body, he the Head, and joined with that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that every word he pronounces is the Word of a Kingdom: Such words, as appears by this Example, are as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual as Fleets and Armies, becauſe they can create them, and without this his word ſounds abroad like a faint Whiſper, that is either not heard, or (which is worſe) not minded. But tho <hi>France</hi> had made this ſtep of forced Compliance, it did not mean to leave

off the purſuit of their pretenſions; and therefore immediately propoſed the Arbitration to the King; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, that notwithſtanding his <hi>Merit</hi> towards the Confederates, in ſaving <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> the remembrances of what had paſſed before, had left ſuch an ill taſte in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> that they could not Reliſh our being put into a Condition to diſpoſe of their Intereſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declin d it by inſiſting upon a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treaty, to which <hi>France</hi> has ever ſince continued to be averſe; our great earneſtneſs alſo to perſwade the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to conſent to it, was ſo unuſual, and ſo ſuſpicious a method, that it might naturally make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>France</hi> ſpake to them by our <hi>Mouth,</hi> and for that Reaſon, if there has been no other, might hinder the accepting it; and ſo little care hath been taken to cure this, or other Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies the Confederates may have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that quite contrary, their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> here every day take freſh Alarms, from what they obſerve in ſmall, as well as in greater Circumſtances; and they being apt both to take and improve apprehenſions of this kind, draw ſuch Inferences from them, as make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſpair of us.</p>

Then the variety of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed by <hi>France</hi> in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is very obſervable: In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> nothing inſiſted on but the Greatneſs and Authority of the Crown; on the other ſide, the Great Men in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are commended, who differ in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57209:55"/>
with the King, and they argue like Friends to the Priviledge of the Dyet, againſt the ſeparate Power of the Crown: In <hi>Sweden</hi> they are troubled that the King ſhould have chang'd ſomething there of late, by his ſingle Authority, from the antient and ſettled Authority and Conſtitutions: at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone,</hi> the moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Liberties of all the Electors, and free States, into his immediate protection, and tells them the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is a dangerous Man, an aſpiring Hero, that would infallibly devour them, if he was not at hand to reſiſt him on their behalf; but above all in <hi>Holland,</hi> he has the moſt obliging tenderneſs for the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and is in ſuch diſquiets, leſt it ſhould be invaded by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that they can do no leſs in gratitude, than undo themſelves when he bids them, to ſhow how ſenſible they are of his exceſſive good Nature; yet in ſpight of all theſe Contradictions, there are in the World ſuch refin'd <hi>States-men,</hi> as will upon their Credit affirm the following Paradoxes to be real truth; firſt that <hi>France</hi> alone is ſincere and keeps its Faith, and conſequently
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57209:56"/>
that it is the only Friend we can rely upon; that the King of <hi>France,</hi> of all Men living, has the leaſt mind to be a Conqueror; that he is a ſleepy, tame Creature, void of all Ambition, a poor kind of a Man, that has no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts than to be quiet; that he is charm'd by his Friendſhip to us, that it is impoſſible he ſhould ever do us hurt, and therefore tho <hi>Flanders</hi> was loſt, it would not in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us; that he would fain help the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to be abſolute, which would be to take pains to put it into a condition to oppoſe him, as it is, and muſt be our Intereſt, as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in ſuch an overballancing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>Such a Creed as this, if once receiv'd, might prepare our belief for greater things, and as he that taught Men to eat a Dagger, began firſt with a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife; ſo if we can be prevail'd with to digeſt the ſmaller Miſtakes, we may at laſt make our ſtomachs ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for that of Tranſubſtantiation. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted out of his ſenſes by theſe State Sophiſters, and yet he has no ſuch peeviſh Obſtinacy as to reject all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57209:56"/>
with <hi>France,</hi> becauſe we ought to be apprehenſive of the too great power of it; he would not have the Kings Friendſhip to the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates extended to the involving him in any unreaſonable or dangerous Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neither would he have him lay aſide the conſideration of his better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment at home, out of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Zeal to ſecure his Allies abroad; but ſure there might be a Mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two oppoſite Extreams, and it may be wiſh'd that our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>France</hi> ſhould at leaſt be ſo bounded, that it may conſiſt with the humour as well as the intereſt of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> There is no Woman but has the fears of contracting too near an intimacy with a much greater Beauty, becauſe it expoſes her too often to a Compariſon that is not advantageous to her; and ſure it may become a Prince to be as jealous of his Dignity, as a Lady can be of her good looks, and to be as much out of Countenance, to be thought an humble Companion to ſo much a greater Power; to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeen in an ill Light, to be ſo darkned by the brightneſs of a greater Star, is ſomewhat mortifying; and

when <hi>England</hi> might ride Admiral at the head of the Confederates, to look like the Kitching-Yatch to the Grand <hi>Louis,</hi> is but a ſcurvy Figure for us to make in the Map of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> it would riſe up in our <hi>Trimmer's</hi> ſtomach, if ever (which God forbid) the power of calling and intermitting Parliaments here, ſhould be transferred to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and that all the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our own ſettlements at home ſhould give way to their Projects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and that our Intereſt ſhould be ſo far ſacrific'd to our Compliance, that all the Omnipotence of <hi>France</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make us full amends for it. In the mean time, he ſhrinks at the diſmal proſpect he can by no means drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his thoughts, that when <hi>France</hi> has gatherd all the fruit ariſing from our Miſtakes, and that we can bear no more with them, they will cut down the Tree and throw it into the fire; for all this while, ſome Superfine States-Men, to comfort us, would fain perſwade the World that this or that accident may ſave us, and for all that is or ought to be dear to us, would have us to rely wholly upon Chance, not conſidering that Fortune is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

Creature, and that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loves to be on the Wiſeſt as well as the Strongeſt ſide; therefore this is ſuch a miſerable ſhift, ſuch a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Evaſion, that they would be laught to death for it, if the ruining Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Miſtake did not more diſpoſe Men to rage, and a deteſtation of it.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is far from Idolatry in other things, in one thing only he comes near it, his Country is in ſome degree his Idol; he does not Worſhip the Sun, becauſe 'tis not peculiar to us, it rambles about the World, and is leſs kind to us than others; but for the Earth of <hi>England,</hi> tho perhaps inferior to that of many places abroad, to him there is Divinity in it, and he would rather dye, than ſee a piece of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Glaſs trampled down by a Foreign Treſpaſſer: he thinks there are a great many of his mind, for all Plants are apt to taſte of the Soyl in which they grow, and we that grow here, have a Root that produces in us a Stalk of Engliſh Juice, which is not to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grafting or foreign infuſion; and I do not know whether any thing leſs will prevail, than the Modern Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

by which the Blood of one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is tranſinitted into another; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, before the <hi>French</hi> can be let into our Bodies, every drop of ourown muſt be drawn out of them.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot but lament, that by a Sacrifice too great for one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, we ſhould be like a rich Mine, made uſeleſs only for want of being wrought, and that the Life and Vigour which ſhould move us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Enemies is miſerably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to tear our own Bowels; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by our happy ſcituation, not only ſafer, but if we pleaſe greater too, than other Countries which far exceed us in extent; that having Courage by Nature, Learning by Induſtry, and Riches by Trade, we ſhould corrupt all theſe Advantages, ſo as to make them inſignificant, and by a fatality which ſeems peculiar to us, miſplace our active rage one againſt another, whilſt we are turn'd into Statues on that ſide where lies our greateſt danger; to be unconcern'd not only at our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ruine but our own, and let our Iſland lye like a great Hulk in the Sea, without Rudder or Sail, all the Men caſt away in her, or as if we were all Children in a great Cradle, and rockt aſleep to a foreign Tune.</p>

I ſay when our <hi>Trimmer</hi> repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his Mind, our Roſes blaſted and diſcolourd, whilſt the Lillies Triumph and grow Inſolent, upon the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; when he conſiders our own once flouriſhing Lawrel, now withered and dying, and nothing left us but a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a better part in Hiſtory, than we ſhall make in the next Age; which will be no more to us than an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon hung upon our Door when we are dead; when he foreſees from hence, growing Infamy from abroad, confuſion at home, and all this without the poſſibility of a Cure, in reſpect of the voluntary fetters good Men put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves by their Allegiance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a good meaſure of preventing Grace, he would be tempted to go out of the World like a <hi>Roman</hi> Philoſopher, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than endure the burthen of Life under ſuch a diſcouraging Proſpect. But Miſtakes, as all other things, have their Periods, and many times the neareſt way to Cure, is not to oppoſe them, but ſtay till they are cruſht with their own weight: for Nature will not allow any thing to continue long that is violent; violence is a wound, and as a wound, muſt be curable in a little
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57209:59"/>
time, or elſe 'tis Mortal; but a Nation comes near to be Immortal, therefore the wound will one time or another be cured, tho perhaps by ſuch rough Methods, if too long forborn, as may even make the beſt Remedies we can prepare, to be at the ſame time a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Contemplation to us; there is but one thing (God Almighties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence excepted) to ſupport a Man from ſinking under theſe afflicting thoughts, and that is the hopes we draw ſingly from the King himſelf, without the mixture of any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p>Tho the Nation was laviſh of their Kindneſs to him at his firſt coming, yet there remains ſtill a ſtock of Warmth in Mens Hearts for him.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the good Influences of his happy Planet are not yet all ſpent, and tho the Stars of Men paſt their youth are generally declining, and have leſs Force, like the Eyes of decaying Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet by a Bleſſing peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we may yet hope to be ſav'd by his Autumnal Fortune: He has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about him that will draw down a healing Miracle for his and our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; a Prince which ſeems fitted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57209:59"/>
for ſuch an offending Age, in which Mens Crimes have been ſo general, that the not forgiving his People has been the deſtroying of them, whoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gives him a natural Dominion that hath no bounds, with ſuch a noble mixture of Greatneſs and Condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an engaging Look, that diſarms Men of their ill Humours, and their Reſentments; ſomething in him that wanteth a Name, and can be no more defined than it can be reſiſted; a Gift of Heaven, of its laſt finiſhing, where it will be peculiarly kind; the only Prince in the World that dares be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, or that has right to triumph over thoſe forms which were firſt invented to give awe to thoſe who could not judge, and to hide Defects from thoſe that could; a Prince that has exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by his Liberality, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd himſelf by his Mercy; who out-ſhines by his own Light and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues all the varniſh of ſtudied Acquiſitions; his Faults are like Shades to a good Picture, or like Allay to Gold, to make it the more uſeful, he may have ſome, but for any Man to ſee them through ſo many reconciling Virtues, is a Sacrilegious piece of of ill nature, of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57209:60"/>
which no generous Mind can be guilty; a Prince that deſerves to be lov'd for his own ſake, even without the help of a Compariſon; our Love, our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and our Danger, all join to cement our Obedience to him; in ſhort, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can do, it is no more poſſible for us to be angry with him, than with a Bank that ſecures us from the raging Sea, the kind Shade that hides us from the ſcorching Sun, the welcom Hand that reaches us a Reprieve, or with the Guardian-Angel, that reſcues our Souls from the devouring Jaws of wretched Eternity.</p>

                     <p>TO Conclude, our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is ſo fully ſatisfy'd of the Truth of theſe Principles, by which he is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in reference to the Publick, that he will neither be Hectored and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Laught, nor Drunk cut of them; and inſtead of being converted by the Arguments of his Adverſaries to their Opinions, he is very much confirmed in his own by them; he profeſſes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly that were it in his Power to

chuſe, he would rather have his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bounded by the Commands of a Great and Wiſe Maſter, than let it range with a Popular Licence, tho crown'd with ſucceſs; yet he cannot commit ſuch a Sin againſt the glorious thing call'd Liberty, nor let his Soul ſtoop ſo much below it ſelf, as to be content without repining to have his Reaſon wholly ſubdu'd, or the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Acting like a ſenſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, torn from him by the imperious Dictates of unlimited Authority, in what hand ſoever it happens to be plac'd.

Theſe Arbitrary Methods, beſides the injuſtice of them, are (God be thanked) very unskilful too, for they fright the Birds, by talking ſo loud, from coming into the Nets that are laid for them; and when Men agree to rifle a Houſe, they ſeldom give warning, or blow a

Trumpet; but there are ſome ſmall States-Men, who are ſo full charg'd with their own Expectations, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain.</p>
                     <p>And kind Heaven by ſending ſuch a ſeaſonable Curſe upon their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, has made their ignorance an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt their Malice; ſome of theſe cannot treat peaceably, yielding will not ſatisfy them, they will have Men by ſtorm; there are others, that muſt have Plots, to make their Service more neceſſary, and have an Intereſt to keep them alive, ſince they are to live upon them; and perſwade the King to retrench his own Greatneſs, ſo as to ſhrink into the head of a Party, which is the betraying him into ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princely miſtake, and to ſuch a wilful diminution of himſelf, that they are the laſt Enemies he ought to allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to forgive; ſuch Men, if they could, would prevail with the Sun to ſhine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them and their Friends, and to leave all the reſt of the World in the dark; this is a very unuſual Monopoly, and may come within the Equity of the Law, which makes it Treaſon to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the King, when ſuch unfitting bounds are put to his Favour, and he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57209:61"/>
confin'd to the narrow limits of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſet of Men, that would incloſe him; theſe Honeſt and only Loyal Gentlemen, if they may be allow'd to bear Witneſs for themſelves, make a King their Engine, and degrade him into a property at the very time that their Flattery would make him believe they paid Divine Worſhip to him; beſides theſe there is a flying Squadron on both ſides, that are afraid the World ſhould agree, ſmall dabblers in Conjuring, that raiſe angry Apparitions to keep Men from being reconcil'd, like Waſps that fly up and down, buz and ſting to keep Men unquiet; but theſe Inſects are commonly ſhort-liv'd Creatures, and no doubt in a little time Mankind will be rid of them; they were Gyants at leaſt who fought once againſt Heaven, but for ſuch Pigmies as theſe to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, is ſuch a provoking Folly, that the inſolent Bunglers ought to be laught and hiſt out of the World for it; they ſhould conſider there is a Soul in that great body of the People, which may for a time be drowzy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, but when the Leviathan is rouz'd, it moves like an angry Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and will neither be convinc'd nor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57209:62"/>
reſiſted: the People can never agree to ſhew their united Powers, till they are extremely tempted and provoked to it, ſo that to apply Cupping-Glaſſes to a great Beaſt naturally diſpos'd to ſleep, and to force the Tame thing whether it will or no to be Valiant, muſt be learnt out of ſome other Book than <hi>Machiavil,</hi> who would never have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd ſuch a propoſterous Method. It is to be remembred, that if Princes have Law and Authority on their ſides, the People on theirs may have Nature, which is a formidable Adverſary; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Juſtice, Religion, nay, even Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prudence too, bids the People ſuffer any thing rather than reſiſt; but uncorrected Nature, where e're it feels the ſmart will run to the neareſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Mens Paſſions in this Caſe are to be conſider'd as well as their Duty, let it be never ſo ſtrongly enforc'd, for if their Paſſions are provok'd, they being as much a part of us as our Limbs, they lead Men into a ſhort way of Arguing, that admits no diſtinction, and from the foundation of Self-Defence, they will draw Inferences, that will have miſerable effects upon the quiet of a Government.</p>

Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore dreads a general diſcontent, becauſe he thinks it differs from a Rebellion, only as a Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fever does from the Plague, the ſame Species under a lower degree of Malignity; it works ſeveral ways, ſometimes like a ſlow Poyſon that has its Effects at a great diſtance from the time it was given, ſometimes like dry Flax prepared to catch at the firſt Fire, or like Seed in the Ground ready to ſprout upon the firſt Shower; in every ſhape 'tis fatal, and our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinks no pains or precaution can be ſo great as to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort he thinks himſelf in the right, grounding his Opinion upon that Truth, which equally hates to be under the Oppreſſions of wrangling Sophiſtry of the one hand, or the ſhort dictates of miſtaken Authority on the other.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> adores the Goddeſs Truth, tho' in all Ages ſhe has been ſcurvily uſed, as well as thoſe that Worſhipped her; 'tis of late become ſuch a ruining Virtue, that Mankind ſeems to be agreed to commend and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; yet the want of Practice which Repeals the other Laws, has no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Law of Truth, becauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57209:63"/>
it has root in Heaven, and an Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick value in it ſelf, that can never be impaired; ſhe ſhews her Greatneſs in this, that her Enemies even when they are ſucceſsful are aſham'd to own it; nothing but Power full of Truth has the prerogative of Triumphing, not only after Victories, but in ſpite of them, and to put Conqueſt her ſelf out of Countenance; ſhe may be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſuppreſt, but her Dignity ſtill remains with her, even when ſhe is in Chains; Falſhood with all her Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, has not enough to ſpeak ill of her before her Face, ſuch Majeſty ſhe carries about her, that her moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Enemies are fain to whiſper their Treaſon; all the Power upon Earth can never extinguiſh her, ſhe has lived in all Ages; and let the Miſtaken Zeal of prevailing Authority, Chriſten any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it, with what Name they pleaſe, ſhe makes it not only an ugly and unmannerly, but a dangerous thing to perſiſt; ſhe has lived very retired indeed, nay ſometime ſo buried, that only ſome few of the diſcerning part of Mankind could have a Glimpſe of her; with all that ſhe has Eternity in her, ſhe knows not how to dye, and from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57209:63"/>
the darkeſt Clouds that ſhade and cover her, ſhe breaks from time to time with Triumph for her Friends, and Terrour to her Enemies.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore inſpired by this Divine Virtue, thinks fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with theſe Aſſertions, That our Climate is a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> between that part of the World where men are Roaſted, and the other where they are Frozen; That our Church is a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> between the Phrenzy of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Viſions, and the Lethargick Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Popiſh Dreams; That our Laws are <hi>Trimmers,</hi> between the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of unbounded Power, and the Extravagance of Liberty not enough reſtrained; That true Virtue has ever been thought a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> and to have its dwelling in the middle between the two Extreams; That even God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty himſelf is divided between his two great Attributes, his Mercy and his Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch Company, our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not aſham'd of his Name, and willingly leaves to the bold Champions of either Extream, the Honour of contending with no leſs Adverſaries, than Nature, Religion, Liberty, Prudence, Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Common Senſe.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57209:69"/>
that the <hi>Wounds</hi> we give are <hi>Meritorious,</hi> and that we are fighting God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Quarrel; when the truth is, we are only ſetting out our ſelves. Our <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> too often breaketh out into that <hi>Shape</hi> which moſt agreeth with our particular <hi>Temper.</hi> The <hi>Cholerick</hi> grow into a hardned Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all who diſſent from them; ſnatch at all the Texts of Scripture that ſuit with their <hi>Complexion;</hi> and becauſe God's Wrath was ſome time kindled, they conclude, That <hi>Anger</hi> is a Divine Vertue; and are ſo far from ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining their ill natur'd <hi>Zeal</hi> requireth an <hi>Apology,</hi> that they value themſelves upon it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57209:70"/>
and triumph in it. <hi>Others,</hi> whoſe Nature is more Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than ordinary, admit no Bounds or Meaſure to it; they grow as proud of extending their <hi>Faith,</hi> as Princes are of enlarging their <hi>Dominions;</hi> not conſidering, that our <hi>Faith,</hi> like our Stomach, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being over-charg'd; and that as the laſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by taking in more than it can digeſt, ſo our <hi>Reaſon</hi> may be extinguiſh'd by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it with the weight of too many ſtrange things; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we are forbidden to chew what we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſwallow. The <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> and the <hi>Sullen</hi> are apt to place a great part of their <hi>Religion</hi> in dejected or ill-humour'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57209:70"/>
                        <hi>Looks,</hi> putting on an unſociable Face, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt the Innocent Entertainments of <hi>Life,</hi> with as much ſharpneſs as they could beſtow upon the greateſt <hi>Crimes.</hi> This generally is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Vizard,</hi> there is ſeldom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing real in it. No other thing is the better for being <hi>Sowre;</hi> and it would be hard that <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould be ſo, which is the beſt of things. In the mean time it may be ſaid with truth, That this <hi>ſurly</hi> kind of <hi>Devotion</hi> hath perhaps done little leſs hurt in the World, by frighting, than the moſt ſcandalous <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> have done by infecting it.</p>

Having told you, in theſe few Inſtances, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what is not true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> it is time to deſcribe to you, what is ſo. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Definitions</hi> of it are no more like it, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sign-poſts are like the Princes they would repreſent. The unskilful <hi>Dawbers</hi> in all Ages have generally laid on ſuch ill <hi>Colours,</hi> and drawn ſuch harſh <hi>Lines,</hi> that the Beauty of it is not eaſily to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned: They have put in all the forbidding Features that can be thought of; and in the firſt place, have made it an irreconcilable Enemy to <hi>Nature;</hi> when, in reality, they are not only <hi>Friends</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57209:71"/>
but <hi>Twins,</hi> born together at the ſame time; and it is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to them both, to go about to have them ſeparated. Nothing is ſo kind and ſo inviting as true and <hi>unſophiſticated Religion:</hi> Inſtead of impoſing unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Burdens upon our <hi>Nature,</hi> it eaſeth us of the greater weight of our <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes:</hi> Inſtead of ſubduing us with <hi>Rigour,</hi> it redeemeth us from the <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> we are in to our ſelves, who are the moſt ſevere Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whilſt we are under the Uſurpation of our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> let looſe and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Religion</hi> is a chearſul thing, ſo far from being always at

Nothing unpleaſant belongs to it, though the <hi>Spiritual Cooks</hi> have done their unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part to give an ill <hi>Reliſh</hi> to it. A wiſe <hi>Epicure</hi> would be <hi>Religious</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> Good Senſe is the Foundation of both; and he is a <hi>Bungler</hi> who aimeth at true <hi>Luxury,</hi> but where they are join'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Religion</hi> is exalted <hi>Reaſon,</hi> refin'd and ſifted from the groſſer parts of it: It dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the upper Region of the <hi>Mind,</hi> where there are feweſt <hi>Clouds</hi> or <hi>Miſts</hi> to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or offend it: It is both the Foundation and the Crown of all Vertues: It is

                        <hi>Morality</hi> improv'd and rais'd to its height, by being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried nearer <hi>Heaven,</hi> the only place where <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> reſideth. It cleanſeth the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off the Earth that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about our <hi>Souls.</hi> It doth not want the <hi>Hopes</hi> and the <hi>Terrors</hi> which are made uſe of to ſupport it; neither ought it to deſcend to the borrowing any Argument out of it ſelf, ſince there we may find every thing that ſhould invite us. If we were to be hired to <hi>Religion,</hi> it is able to out-bid the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted World, with all it can offer to us, being ſo much the <hi>Richer</hi> of the two, in every thing where <hi>Reaſon</hi> is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57209:73"/>
to be a Judge of the Value.</p>
                     <p>Since this is ſo, it is worth your pains to make <hi>Religion</hi> your choice, and not make uſe of it only as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</hi> There are Ladies, who finding by the too viſible decay of their good. Looks, that they can ſhine no more by that <hi>Light,</hi> put on the <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> of an affected Devotion, to keep up ſome kind of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World. They take Sanctuary in the <hi>Church,</hi> when they are purſued by growing <hi>Contempt,</hi> which will not be ſtopt, but followeth them to the <hi>Altar.</hi> Such late penitence is only a diſguiſe for the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting grief of being no more handſome. That is the killing thought which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57209:73"/>
the ſighs and tears, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear outwardly to be applied to a beter end.</p>
                     <p>There are many who have an <hi>Aguiſh Devotion,</hi> Hot and Cold Fits, long Intermiſſions, and violent Raptures. This uneverneſs is by all means to be avoided. Let your method be a ſteady courſe of good <hi>Life,</hi> that may run like a ſmooth Stream, and be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Spring to furniſh to the continued <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi> Your <hi>Devotion</hi> may be earneſt, but it muſt be unconſtrained; and like other Duties, you muſt make it your <hi>Pleaſure</hi> too, or elſe it will have very little effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. By this <hi>Rule</hi> you may beſt judge of your own
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57209:74"/>
Heart. Whilſt thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> are <hi>Joys,</hi> it is an Evidence of their being ſincere; but when they are a <hi>Penance,</hi> it is a ſign that your <hi>Nature</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome reſiſtance; and whilſt that laſteth, you can never be entirely ſecure of your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>If you are often unquiet, and too nearly touch'd by the croſs Accidents of <hi>Life,</hi> your <hi>Devotion</hi> is not of the right <hi>Standard;</hi> there is too much <hi>Allay</hi> in it. That which is right and unmixt, taketh away the <hi>Sting</hi> of every thing that would trouble you: It is like a healing <hi>Balm,</hi> that extinguiſheth the ſharpneſs of the Bloud; ſo this ſofteneth and diſſolveth the <hi>Anguiſh</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57209:74"/>
the <hi>Mind.</hi> A devout <hi>Mind</hi> hath the Privilege of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from <hi>Paſſions,</hi> as ſome Climates are from all venomous kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It will raiſe you above the little <hi>Vexations</hi> to which others for want of it, will be expos'd, and bring you to a <hi>Temper,</hi> not of ſtupid <hi>Indifference,</hi> but of ſuch a wiſe <hi>Reſignation,</hi> that you may live in the <hi>World,</hi> ſo as it may hang about you like a looſe Garment, and not tied too cloſe to you.</p>
                     <p>Take heed of running into that common <hi>Error,</hi> of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Judgments upon particular Occaſions. Our Weights and Meaſures are not competent to make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution

either of his <hi>Mercy</hi> or his <hi>Juſtice:</hi> He hath thrown a Veilover theſe things, which makes it not only an <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,</hi> but a kind of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> for us to give Sentence in them without his <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to your particular <hi>Faith,</hi> keep to the <hi>Religion</hi> that is grown up with you, both as it is the beſt in it ſelf, and that the reaſon of ſtaying in it upon that Ground is ſomewhat ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for your <hi>Sex,</hi> than it will perhaps be allow'd to be for ours; in reſpect that the Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous enquiries into the <hi>Truth,</hi> by Reading, are leſs expected from you.

are fix'd and ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in your own <hi>Mind,</hi> you will do beſt to keep vain <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> at ſuch a diſtance, that they may give you no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>

It is one of the <hi>Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> belonging to your <hi>Sex,</hi> that young Women are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom permitted to make their own <hi>Choice;</hi> their Friends Care and Experience are thought ſafer Guides to them, than their own <hi>Fancies;</hi> and their <hi>Modeſty</hi> often forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to refuſe when their Parents recommend, though their <hi>inward Conſent</hi> may not entirely go along with it.

                     <p>You muſt firſt lay it down for a Foundation in general, That there is <hi>Inequality</hi> in the <hi>Sexes,</hi> and that for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oeconomy of the World, the <hi>Men,</hi> who were to be the Law-givers, had the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhare of <hi>Reaſon</hi> beſtow'd upon them; by which means your Sex is the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the <hi>Compliance</hi> that is neceſſary for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> which ſeem to be moſt properly aſſign'd to it.

is partial on our ſide.

ſuch an unkind diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and ſo very unſuitable to the exceſs of <hi>Good Manners,</hi> which generally goes before it.

of a larger <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> might be erected, where ſome <hi>Wives</hi> might reſort and plead <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> And in ſuch inſtances, where Nature is ſo kind, as to raiſe them above the <hi>level</hi> of their own <hi>Sex,</hi> they might have <hi>Relief,</hi> and obtain a <hi>Mitigation</hi> in their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, of a <hi>Sentence</hi> which was given generally againſt <hi>Woman kind.</hi> The cauſes of <hi>Separation</hi> are now ſo very courſe, that few are <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> enough to buy their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> at the price of having their Modeſty ſo expoſed.

Men, by whom they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd. This and a great deal more might be ſaid to give a colour to the Complaint.</p>
                     <p>But the Anſwer to it, in ſhort, is, That the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> is too ſacred to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>objecting</hi> to it; That the ſuppoſition of yours being the weaker <hi>Sex,</hi> having without all doubt a good Foundation, maketh it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſubject it to the <hi>Maſculine Dominion;</hi> That no <hi>Rule</hi> can be ſo <hi>perfect,</hi> as not to admit ſome <hi>Exceptions;</hi> But the Law preſumeth there would be ſo few found in this Caſe, who would have a ſufficient Right to ſuch a Privilege, that it is ſafer ſome <hi>Injuſtice</hi> ſhould be <hi>conniv'd</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57209:80"/>
at in a very few Inſtances, than to break into an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, upon which the Order of Humane Society doth ſo much depend.</p>
                     <p>You are therefore to make your beſt of what is <hi>ſettled</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and not vainly imagine, that it will be <hi>changed</hi> for your ſake. But that you may not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, as if you lay under the weight of an <hi>incurable Grievance,</hi> you are to know, that by a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>dexterous</hi> Conduct, it will be in your power to <hi>relieve</hi> your ſelf from any thing that looketh like a diſadvantage in it. For your better direction, I will give a hint of the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                     <p>Firſt then, you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, you live in a time which hath rendred ſome kind of Frailties ſo habitual, that they lay claim to large <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Allowance.</hi> The World in this is ſomewhat unequal, and our Sex ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to play the <hi>Tyrant</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing <hi>partially</hi> for our ſelves, by making that in the utmoſt degree <hi>Criminal</hi> in the <hi>Woman,</hi> which in a <hi>Man</hi> paſſeth under a much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57209:81"/>
                        <hi>gentler Cenſure.</hi> The Root and the Excuſe of this Injuſtice is the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of Families from any <hi>Mixture</hi> which may bring a Blemiſh to them: And whilſt the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> continues to be ſo plac'd, it ſeems unavoidable to give your <hi>Sex,</hi> the greater ſhare of the Penalty. But if in this it lieth under any <hi>Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> you are more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd, by having the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Families</hi> in your keeping. The Conſideration ſo great a Truſt muſt give you, maketh full amends; and this Power the World hath lodged in you, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail to reſtrain the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an <hi>ill</hi> Husband, and to improve the Kindneſs and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57209:81"/>
Eſteem of a <hi>good</hi> one. This being ſo, remember, That next to the danger of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> the Fault your ſelf, the greateſt is that of <hi>ſeeing</hi> it in your <hi>Husband.</hi> Do not ſeem to look or hear that way: If he is a Man of Senſe, he will reclaim him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the Folly of it, is of it ſelf ſufficient to cure him: if he is not ſo, he will be provok'd, but not reform'd. To expoſtulate in theſe Caſes, looketh like declaring War, and preparing Repriſals; which to a <hi>thinking Husband</hi> would be a dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion. Beſides, it is ſo courſe a Reaſon which will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for a Lady's too great Warmth upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

that Modeſty no leſs than Prudence ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her; ſince ſuch an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Complaint makes a Wife much more ridiculous, than the Injury that provoketh her to it. But it is yet worſe, and more unskilful, to <hi>blaze it</hi> in the World, expecting it ſhould riſe up in Arms to take her part: Whereas ſhe will find, it can have no other Effect, than that ſhe will be ſerved up in all Companies, as the <hi>reigning Jeſt</hi> at that time; and will continue to be the common Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till ſhe is reſcu'd by ſome <hi>newer Folly</hi> that cometh upon the Stage, and driveth her away from it. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of ſuch Methods
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57209:82"/>
is ſo plain, that it doth not deſerve the pains of being laid open. Be aſſur'd, that in theſe Caſes your <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> will be the moſt <hi>prevailing Reproof.</hi> An <hi>affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ignorance,</hi> which is ſeldom a <hi>Vertue,</hi> is a great one here: And when your <hi>Husband</hi> ſeeth how unwilling you are to be uneaſie, there is no ſtronger Argument to perſwade him not to be unjuſt to you. Beſides, it will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally make him more <hi>yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in other things: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to <hi>cover</hi> or redeem his <hi>Offence,</hi> you may have the good Effects of it whileſt it laſteth, and all that while have the moſt reaſonable Ground that can be, of preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57209:83"/>
ſuch a Behaviour will at laſt entirely convert him. There is nothing ſo glorious to a <hi>Wife,</hi> as a Victory ſo gain'd: A Man ſo reclaim'd, is for ever after ſubjected to her <hi>Vertue;</hi> and her <hi>bearing</hi> for a time, is more than rewarded by a Triumph that will continue as long as her Life.</p>
                     <p>The next thing I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is, That your <hi>Husband</hi> may love <hi>Wine</hi> more than is convenient. It will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That though there are Vices of a deeper dye, there are none that have greater <hi>Deformity</hi> than this, when it is not reſtrain'd: But with all this, the ſame Cuſtom which is the more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for its being ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57209:83"/>
ſhould make it leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar who is to ſuffer by the Effects of it: So that in the firſt place, it will be no new thing if you ſhould have a <hi>Drunkard</hi> for your <hi>Husband;</hi> and there is by too frequent Examples evidence enough, that ſuch a thing may happen, and yet a <hi>Wife</hi> may live too without being miſerable. <hi>Self-love</hi> dictateth aggravating words to every thing we feel; <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> are the Terms we apply to whatever we do not like, forgetting the Mixture allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by the Condition of Human Life, by which it is not intended we ſhould be quite exempt from trouble.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57209:84"/>
It is fair, if we can eſcape ſuch a degree of it as would oppreſs us, and enjoy ſo much of the pleaſant part as may leſſen the ill taſte of ſuch things as are unwelcome to us. Every thing hath two Sides, and for our own eaſe we ought to direct our Thoughts to that which may be leaſt liable to exception. To fall upon the <hi>worſt ſide</hi> of a <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi> giveth ſo unpleaſant a proſpect, that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to dwell upon it. Let us paſs then to the more <hi>favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part,</hi> as far as a <hi>Wife</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it.</p>
                     <p>I am tempted to ſay (if the Irregularity of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion could in ſtrictneſs be juſtified) That a <hi>Wife</hi> is to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57209:84"/>
thank God her <hi>Husband</hi> hath <hi>Faults.</hi> Mark the ſeeming Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox my Dear, for your own Inſtruction, it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no further. A <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> without <hi>Faults</hi> is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Obſerver; he hath an Eye ſo piercing, and ſeeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſo plain, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to his full Cenſure. And though I will not doubt but that your <hi>Vertue</hi> will diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ſharpeſt Enquiries; yet few Women can bear the having all they ſay or do <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented</hi> in the clear Glaſs of an Underſtanding without <hi>Faults.</hi> Nothing ſoftneth the <hi>Arrogance</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> like a Mixture of ſome <hi>Frailties.</hi> It is by them we are beſt told, that we muſt not ſtrike too
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57209:85"/>
hard upon others, becauſe we our ſelves do ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Blows: They pull our Rage by the Sleeve, and whiſper Gentleneſs to us in our Cenſures, even when they are rightly applied. The <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> of <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> bring them down to you, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live upon leſs une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Terms, than Faultleſs Men would be willing to ſtoop to; ſo haughty is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind till humbled by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Weakneſſes and Defects, which in our corrupted State contribute more towards the reconciling us to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than all the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</hi> So that where the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57209:85"/>
                        <hi>Errors</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi> make amends for the <hi>Diſadvantages</hi> of yours it is more your part to make uſe of the <hi>Benefit,</hi> than to quarrel at the <hi>Fault.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus in caſe a <hi>Drunken Husband</hi> ſhould fall to your ſhare, if you will be <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> his <hi>Wine</hi> ſhall be of your ſide; it will throw a <hi>Veil</hi> over your Miſtakes, and will ſet cut and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove every thing you do, that he is pleaſed with. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will like him leſs, and by that means he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps like you the more. When after having dined too well, he is received at home without a <hi>Storm,</hi> or ſo much as a <hi>reproaching Look,</hi> the <hi>Wine</hi> will naturally work
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57209:86"/>
out all in Kindneſs, which a <hi>Wife</hi> muſt encourage, let it be wrapped up in never ſo much Impertinence. On the other ſide it would boil up into <hi>Rage,</hi> if the miſtaken <hi>Wife</hi> ſhould treat him rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like a certain thing called a <hi>kind Shrew,</hi> than which the World, with all its Plenty, cannot ſhew a more Senſeleſs, ill-bred, forbidding Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Conſider, that where the Man will give ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Intermiſſions of the uſe of his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> inſenſibly getteth a Right of <hi>Governing</hi> in the Vacancy, and that raiſeth her <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> in the Family, to a higher pitch than perhaps could be done under a <hi>ſober
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57209:86"/>
Husband,</hi> who never putteth himſelf into an Incapacity of holding the <hi>Reins.</hi> If theſe are not intire <hi>Conſolations,</hi> at leaſt they are <hi>Remedies</hi> to ſome Degree. They cannot make <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> a <hi>Vertue,</hi> nor a <hi>Husband</hi> given to it a <hi>Felicity;</hi> but you will do your ſelf no ill office in the endeavouring, by theſe means, to make the beſt of ſuch a <hi>Lot,</hi> in caſe it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be yours, and by the help of a wiſe Obſervation, to make that very ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which would otherwiſe be a <hi>Load</hi> that would oppreſs you.</p>
                     <p>The next Caſe I will put is that your <hi>Husband</hi> may be <hi>Cholerick</hi> or <hi>Ill-humour'd.</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57209:87"/>
To this it may be ſaid, That <hi>paſſionate</hi> Men generally make amends at the Foot of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Such a Man, if he is angry one day without any <hi>Senſe,</hi> will the next day be as kind without any <hi>Reaſon.</hi> So that by marking how the <hi>Wheels</hi> of ſuch a Man's Head are uſed to move, you may eaſily bring over all his <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to your Party. Inſtead of being ſtruck down by his Thunder, you ſhall direct it where and upon whom you ſhall think it beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Thus are the <hi>ſtrongeſt Poiſons</hi> turn'd to the <hi>beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;</hi> but then there muſt be <hi>Art</hi> in it, and a <hi>skilful Hand,</hi> elſe the leaſt <hi>bungling</hi> maketh in mortal. There is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57209:87"/>
a great deal of nice Care re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to deal with a Man of this Complexion. <hi>Choler</hi> proceedeth from <hi>Pride,</hi> and maketh a Man ſo partial to himſelf that he ſwelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Contradiction; and thinketh he is leſſened if he is oppoſed. You muſt in this Caſe take heed of <hi>increaſing the Storm</hi> by an <hi>unwary Word,</hi> or <hi>kindling the Fire</hi> whilſt the Wind is in a Corner which may blow it in your Face: You are dextrouſly to yield every thing till he beginneth to cool, and then by ſlow degrees you may riſe and gain upon him: Your <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> well timed, will, like a Charm, diſpel his Anger ill placed; a <hi>kind
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57209:88"/>
Smile</hi> will <hi>reclaim,</hi> when a <hi>ſhrill pettiſh Anſwer</hi> would <hi>provoke</hi> him; rather than fail upon ſuch occaſions, when other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi> are too weak, a little <hi>Flattery</hi> may be admitted, which by being neceſſary, will ceaſe to be Criminal.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Ill-Humours</hi> and <hi>Sullenneſs,</hi> and not open and ſudden Heat is his Diſeaſe, there is a way of treating that too, ſo as to make it a Grievance to be endured. In order to it, you are firſt to know, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>good Senſe</hi> hath a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>ſurly</hi> in it: and there being ſo much <hi>Folly</hi> in the World, and for the moſt part ſo trumphant, it giveth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Temptations to raiſe the <hi>Spleen</hi> of Men who think
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57209:88"/>
right. Therefore that which may generally be call'd <hi>Ill-Humour,</hi> is not always a Fault; it becometh one when either it is wrong applied, or that it is continued too long, when it is not ſo: For this Reaſon you muſt not too haſtily fix an ill name upon that which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not deſerve it; and though the Caſe ſhould be, that your <hi>Husband</hi> might too ſowerly reſent any thing he diſliketh, it may ſo happen, that more Blame ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to your <hi>Miſtake,</hi> than to his <hi>Ill-Humour.</hi> If a <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> behaveth himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with an <hi>Indifference</hi> that a <hi>Wife</hi> may think offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſhe is in the wrong to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57209:89"/>
put the worſt ſence upon it, if by any Means it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a better. Some <hi>Wives</hi> will call it <hi>Ill-humour</hi> if their Husbands change their <hi>Style</hi> from that which they uſed whilſt they made their firſt Addreſſes to them: Others will allow no <hi>Intermiſſion</hi> or <hi>Abatement</hi> in the Expreſſions of Kindneſs to them, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough diſtinguiſhing Times, and forgetting that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Men to keep themſelves up all their Lives to the height of ſome <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Moments.</hi> A Man may at ſome times be leſs careful in little things; without any cold or diſobliging Reaſon for it; as a <hi>Wiſe</hi> may be too expecting in ſmaller matters,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57209:89"/>
without drawing upon herſelf the inference of being <hi>unkind.</hi> And if your <hi>Husband</hi> ſhould be really ſullen, and have ſuch frequent Fits, as might take away the excuſe of it, it concerneth you to have an Eye prepared to diſcern the firſt Appearances of Cloudy Weather, and to watch when the Fit goeth off, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom laſteth long if it is let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But whilſt the Mind is ſore, every thing galleth it, and that maketh it neceſſary to let the <hi>Black Humour</hi> begin to ſpend it ſelf, before you come in and venture to undertake it.</p>
                     <p>If in the Lottery of the World you ſhould draw a <hi>Covetous Husband,</hi> I confeſs it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57209:90"/>
will not make you proud of your <hi>good Luck;</hi> yet even ſuch a one may be endured too, though there are few Paſſions more untractable than that of <hi>Avarice.</hi> You muſt firſt take care that your <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Avarice</hi> may not be a Miſtake. You are to examine every Circumſtance of your <hi>Husband</hi>'s Fortune, and weigh the Reaſon of every thing you expect from him before you have right to pronounce that ſentence. The Complaint is now ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral againſt all <hi>Husbands,</hi> that it giveth great ſuſpicion of its being often ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; it is impoſſible they ſhould all deſerve that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57209:90"/>
that it is many times miſapplied. He that <hi>ſpareth</hi> in every thing is an <hi>inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Niggard;</hi> he that <hi>ſpareth</hi> in nothing is as <hi>inexcuſable a Madman.</hi> The <hi>mean</hi> is, to ſpare in what is leaſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to lay out more liberally in what is moſt required in our ſeveral circumſtances. Yet this will not always ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. There are <hi>Wives</hi> who are impatient of the Rules of Oeconomy, and are apt to call their <hi>Husband</hi>'s Kindneſs in queſtion, if any other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is put to their expence than that of their own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Be ſure to avoid this dangerous Error, ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to your Self, which is ſo offenſive to an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57209:91"/>
Man, that he will very ill bear a <hi>Wife</hi>'s giving her ſelf ſuch an injurious <hi>preference</hi> to all the <hi>Family,</hi> and whatever belongeth to it.</p>
                     <p>But to admit the worſt, and that your <hi>Husband</hi> is really a <hi>Cloſe-handed Wretch,</hi> you muſt in this, as in other Caſes, endeavour to make it leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting to you; and firſt you muſt obſerve <hi>ſeaſonable hours</hi> of ſpeaking. When you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing in oppoſition to this reigning Humour, a <hi>third hand</hi> and a <hi>wiſe Friend,</hi> may often prevail more than you will be allowed to do in your own Cauſe. Sometimes you are deuterouſly to go along with him in things, where you ſee that the niggardly part of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57209:91"/>
his Mind is moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by which you will have the better opportunity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him in things where he may be more indifferent. Our <hi>Paſſions</hi> are very unequal, and are apt to be raiſed or leſſened, according as they work upon different Objects; they are not to be <hi>ſtopped</hi> or <hi>reſtrained</hi> in thoſe things where our Mind is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly engaged. In other matters they are more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and will ſometimes give Reaſon a hearing, and admit a fair Diſpute. More than that, there are few Men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this inſtance of <hi>Avarice,</hi> ſo intirely abandoned to it, that at ſome hours, and upon ſome occaſions, will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57209:92"/>
their natures, and for that time turn Prodigal. The ſame Man who will <hi>grudge</hi> himſelf what is neceſſary, let his <hi>Pride</hi> be raiſed and he ſhall be <hi>profuſe;</hi> at another time his <hi>Anger</hi> ſhall have the ſame effect; a fit of <hi>Vanity, Ambition,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> ſhall open and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his <hi>narrow Mind;</hi> a Doſe of Wine will work upon this tough humor, and for the time diſſolve it. Your buſineſs muſt be, if this Caſe happeneth, to watch theſe <hi>critical moments,</hi> and not let one of them ſlip without making your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it: and a <hi>Wife</hi> may be ſaid to want <hi>skill,</hi> if by theſe means ſhe is not able to ſecure her ſelf in a good meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57209:92"/>
the Inconveniences this ſcurvy quality in a <hi>Husband</hi> might bring upon her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he ſhould be ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable <hi>Monſter;</hi> as I hope will never fall to your ſhare.</p>
                     <p>The laſt ſuppoſition I will make, is, That your <hi>Huſband</hi> ſhould be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> to make uſe of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that belong to him. It will be yielded, that ſuch a one leaveth room for a great many Objections. But God, Almighty ſeldom ſendeth a <hi>Grievance</hi> without a <hi>Remedy,</hi> or at leaſt ſuch a Mitigation as taketh away a great part of the ſting, and the ſmart of it. To make ſuch a <hi>Misfortune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> leſs heavy, you are firſt to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57209:93"/>
bring to your Obſervation, That a <hi>Wife</hi> very often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth better Figure, for her <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>'s making no great one: And there ſeemeth to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon, why the ſame <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> that chuſeth a <hi>Waiting-Woman</hi> with <hi>worſe Looks,</hi> may not be content with a <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> with <hi>leſs Wit;</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument being equal from the advantage of the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If you will be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed in ſome Caſes, of ſuch a <hi>Husband,</hi> you will be leſs afraid than you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be of a wiſe one. His <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonable Weakneſs</hi> may no doubt ſometimes grieve you, but then ſet againſt this, that it giveth you the <hi>Dominion,</hi> if you will make the right

uſe of it. It is next to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, in which Caſe the <hi>Wife</hi> hath right to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; therefore be ſure, if you have ſuch an Idiot, that none, except your ſelf, may have the benefit of the forfeiture; Such a Fool is a dangerous Beaſt, if others have the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; and you muſt be very undexterous if when your <hi>Husband</hi> ſhall reſolve to be an <hi>Aſs,</hi> you do not take care he may be <hi>your Aſs.</hi> But you muſt go skilfully about it, and above all things, take heed of diſtinguiſhing in publick what kind of <hi>Husband</hi> he is: Your inward thoughts muſt not hinder the outward pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the conſideration that is due to him: Your <hi>ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

him in <hi>Company,</hi> beſides that it would, to a diſcerning By ſtander, give too great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for the making nearer applications to you, is in it ſelf ſuch an undecent way of aſſuming, that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the tame Creature to break looſe, and to ſhew his <hi>Dominion</hi> for his Credit, which he was content to forget for his Eaſe. In ſhort, the ſureſt and the moſt approved me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will be to do like a wiſe <hi>Miniſter</hi> to an eaſie <hi>Prince;</hi> firſt give him the Orders you afterwards receive from him.</p>
                     <p>With all this, that which you are to pray for; is a <hi>Wiſe Husband,</hi> one that by knowing how to be a <hi>Maſter,</hi> for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57209:94"/>
reaſon will not let you feel the weight of it; one whoſe Authority is ſo ſoften'd by his Kindneſs, that it giveth you eaſe without abridging your <hi>Liberty;</hi> one that will return ſo much tenderneſs for your <hi>Juſt Eſteem</hi> of him, that you will never want <hi>power,</hi> though you will ſeldom care to uſe it. Such a <hi>Husband</hi> is as much above all the other Kinds of them, as a <hi>rational ſubjection</hi> to a Prince, great in himſelf, is to be preferr'd before the diſquiet and uneaſineſs of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Liberty.</hi>

                     <p>Before I leave this Head, I muſt add a little concerning your <hi>Behaviour</hi> to your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Friends,</hi> which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the moſt refined part of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57209:95"/>
your Underſtanding to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit your ſelf well of it. You are to ſtudy how to live with them with more care than you are to apply to any other part of your Life; eſpecially at firſt, that you may not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the firſt ſetting out. The <hi>Family</hi> into which you are grafted will generally be apt to expect, that like a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a Foreign Country, you ſhould conform to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and not bring in a new Model by your own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Friends</hi> in ſuch a Caſe are tempted to riſe up in Arms as againſt an unlawful Invaſion, ſo that you are with the utmoſt Caution to avoid the leaſt appearances of any thing of this Kind. And that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57209:95"/>
you may with leſs difficulty afterwards give your Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, be ſure at firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>'s Friends. Gain them to you by early applying to them, and they will be ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that as nothing is more thankful than Pride, when it is complied with, they will ſtrive which of them ſhall moſt recommend you; and when they have helped you to take Root in your <hi>Husband</hi>'s good Opinion, you will have leſs dependence upon theirs, though you muſt not neglect any reaſonable means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it. You are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that a Man govern'd by his <hi>Friends,</hi> is very eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by them; and that one
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57209:96"/>
who is not ſo, will yet for his own ſake expect to have them conſider'd. It is eaſily impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a point of Honour in a <hi>Husband,</hi> not to have his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> neglected; and nothing is more dangerous, than to raiſe an Objection, which is grounded upon <hi>Pride:</hi> It is the moſt ſtubborn and laſting Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we are ſubject to, and where it is the firſt cauſe of the <hi>War,</hi> it is very hard to make a ſecure <hi>Peace.</hi> Your <hi>Caution</hi> in this is of the laſt importance to you.</p>
                     <p>And that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceed in it, carry a ſtrict Eye upon the <hi>Impertinence</hi> of your <hi>Servants;</hi> take heed that their <hi>Ill-humour</hi> may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to take Exceptions,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57209:96"/>
or their too much aſſuming in ſmall matters, raiſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which may bring you under great Diſadvantage. Remember that in the caſe of a <hi>Royal Bride,</hi> thoſe about her are generally ſo far ſuſpected to bring in a Foreign Intereſt, that in moſt Countries they are inſenſibly reduced to a very ſmall number, and thoſe of ſo low a Figure, that it doth not admit the being <hi>Jealous</hi> of them. In little and in the Proportion, this may be the Caſe of every <hi>New married Woman,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be more adviſeable for you, to gain the <hi>Servants</hi> you find in a Family than to tie your ſelf too faſt to thoſe you carry into it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57209:97"/>
You are not to overlook theſe ſmall Reflections, becauſe they may appear low and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; for it may be ſaid, that as the <hi>greateſt ſtreams</hi> are made up of the <hi>ſmall drops</hi> at the head of the Springs from whence they are derived, ſo the <hi>greater circumſtances</hi> of your Life, will be in ſome degree di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by theſe ſeeming <hi>trifles,</hi> which having the advantage of being the firſt acts of it, have a greater effect than ſingly in their own nature they could pretend to.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude this Article with my Advice, That you would, as much as Nature will give you leave, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to forget the great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> you have found at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57209:97"/>
home. After ſuch a gentle Diſcipline as you have been under, every thing you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like will ſeem the harſher to you. The tenderneſs we have had for you, <hi>My Dear,</hi> is of another nature, peculiar to kind Parents, and differing from that which you will meet with firſt in any Family into which you ſhall be tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet they may be very kind too, and afford no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable reaſon to you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. You muſt not be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the firſt Appearances of a <hi>differing Scene;</hi> for when you are uſed to it, you may like the Houſe you go to, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that you left; and your <hi>Husband</hi>'s Kindneſs will have ſo much advantage of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57209:98"/>
ours, that we ſhall yield up all <hi>Competition,</hi> and as well as we love you, be very well contented to Surrender to ſuch a <hi>Rival.</hi>

                     <p>YOU muſt lay before you, <hi>My Dear,</hi> there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Care to recommend your ſelf to the World in the ſeveral parts of your Life. In many things, though the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them well may raiſe your <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Eſteem,</hi> yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them would draw no immediate reproach upon you: In others, where your duty is more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57209:98"/>
the <hi>neglect</hi> of them is amongſt thoſe Faults which are not forgiven, and will bring you under a <hi>Cenſure,</hi> which will be much a heavier thing than the trouble you would avoid. Of this kind is the <hi>Government</hi> of your <hi>Houſe, Family,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> which ſince it is the Province allotted to your Sex, and that the <hi>diſcharging it well,</hi> will for that reaſon be expected from you, if you either deſert it out of <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> or manage it ill for <hi>want of skill,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Help</hi> you will be an <hi>Incumbrance</hi> to the <hi>Family</hi> where you are placed.</p>
                     <p>I muſt tell you, that no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> is laſting, but that which is produced by our being in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57209:99"/>
ſome degree uſeful to thoſe that pay it. Where that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Homage and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence go along with it, and fly to others where ſomething may be expected in exchange for them. And upon this principle the <hi>reſpects</hi> even of the <hi>Children</hi> and the <hi>Servants</hi> will not ſtay with one that doth not think them worth their Care, and the old <hi>Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper</hi> ſhall make a better Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Family, than the <hi>Lady</hi> with all her fine Cloaths, if ſhe wilfully relinquiſhes her Title to the <hi>Government.</hi> Therefore, take heed of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying your <hi>good Breeding</hi> to ſuch a height, as to be good for nothing, and to be proud of it. Some think it hath a great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57209:99"/>
Air to be above troubling their thoughts with ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things as their <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Family;</hi> others dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Cares</hi> for fear they ſhould haſten <hi>Wrinkles?</hi> miſtaken <hi>Pride</hi> maketh ſome think they muſt keep themſelves up, and not deſcend to theſe Duties, which do not ſeem enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for great <hi>Ladies</hi> to be imploy'd in; forgetting all this while, that it is more than the greateſt <hi>Princes</hi> can do, at once to preſerve reſpect, and to neglect their Buſineſs. No <hi>Age</hi> ever erected <hi>Altars</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Gods;</hi> they had all ſome quality applied to them to draw <hi>worſhip</hi> from <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> this maketh it the more unreaſonable for a <hi>Lady</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57209:100"/>
to be conſider'd, and at the ſame time reſolve not to deſerve it. <hi>Good looks</hi> alone will not do; they are not ſuch a laſting <hi>Tenure,</hi> as to be relied upon; and if they ſhould ſtay longer than they uſually do, it will by no means be ſafe to depend upon them: For when time hath abated the violence of the firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and that the <hi>Napp</hi> is a little worn off, though ſtill a good degree of kindneſs may remain, Men recover their ſight which before might be dazell'd, and allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to object as well as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a Caſe, when a <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> ſeeth an empty airy thing ſail up and down the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57209:100"/>
Houſe to no kind of purpoſe, and look as if ſhe came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only to make a Viſit. When he findeth that after her <hi>Emptineſs</hi> hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme buſie about ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſeleſs thing, ſhe eats her Breakfaſt half an hour before Dinner, to be at greater liberty to afflict the Company with her Diſcourſe; then calleth for her Coach, that ſhe may trouble her Acquaintance, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cloy'd with her: And having ſome <hi>proper Dialogues</hi> ready to diſplay her <hi>Fooliſh Eloquence</hi> at the top of the Stairs, ſhe ſetteth out like a Ship out of the Harbour, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with trifles and cometh back with them: at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſhe repeateth to her
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57209:101"/>
faithful waiting-Woman, the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of that day's <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence;</hi> then wrap'd up in Flattery and clean Linen, goeth to Bed ſo ſatisfied, that it throweth her into pleaſant Dreams of her own Felicity. Such a one is ſeldom ſerious but with her <hi>Taylor;</hi> her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and Family may now and then have a random thought, but ſhe never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth aim but at ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Impertinent. I ſay, when a <hi>Husband,</hi> whoſe Province is without Doors, and to whom the Oeconomy of the Houſe would be in ſome degree Indecent, findeth no <hi>Order</hi> nor <hi>Quiet</hi> in his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> meeteth with <hi>Complaints</hi> of all kinds-ſpringing from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57209:101"/>
this Root; The <hi>Miſtaken La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> who thinketh to make <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends</hi> for all this, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a well-choſen <hi>Petty Coat,</hi> will at laſt be convinced of her <hi>Error,</hi> and with grief be forced to undergo the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that belong to thoſe who are willfully <hi>Inſignificant.</hi> When this ſcurvy hour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon her, ſhe firſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Angry;</hi> then when the time of it is paſt, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps grow <hi>wiſer,</hi> not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that we can no more have <hi>Wiſdom</hi> than <hi>Grace,</hi> whenever we think fit to call for it. There are Times and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods fix'd for both; and when they are too long neglected, the Puniſhment is, that they are <hi>Irrecoverable,</hi> and nothing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57209:102"/>
remaineth but an uſeleſs <hi>Grief</hi> for the Folly of having thrown them out of our power. You are to think what a mean Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure a Woman maketh, when ſhe is ſo degraded by her own Fault; whereas there is nothing in thoſe Duties which are expected from you, that can be a leſſening to you except your want of <hi>Conduct</hi> makes it ſo. You may love your <hi>Children</hi> without living in the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> and you may have a <hi>competent</hi> and <hi>diſcreet care</hi> of them, without letting it break out upon the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or expoſing your ſelf by turning your Diſcourſe that way, which is a kind of <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children</hi> to the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and it can hardly be done any
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57209:102"/>
where, that thoſe who hear it will be ſo forgiving, as not to think they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with them. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's <hi>tenderneſs</hi> to her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> is one of the leaſt deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Evidences of the Vertue; but yet the way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, muſt be ſubject to the Rules of <hi>good Breeding:</hi> And though a <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> ought not to be leſs kind to them, than <hi>Mothers</hi> of the <hi>Meaneſt Rank</hi> are to theirs, yet ſhe may diſtinguiſh her ſelf in the <hi>manner,</hi> and avoid the courſe Methods, which in Women of a lower ſize might be more excuſable. You muſt begin early to make them <hi>love</hi> you, that they may <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> you. This Mixture is no
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57209:103"/>
where more neceſſary than in Children And I muſt tell you, that you are not to expect Returns of Kindneſs from yours, if ever you have any, without Grains of Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and yet it is not ſo much a <hi>defect</hi> in their <hi>good Nature,</hi> as a <hi>ſhortneſs of Thought</hi> in them. Their firſt <hi>Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> maketh them lean ſo entirely upon their <hi>Parents</hi> for what is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that the <hi>habit</hi> of it maketh them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame <hi>Expectations</hi> for what is <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> and as often as they are <hi>denied,</hi> ſo often they think they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured:</hi> and whilſt their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> are ſtrong, and their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> yet in the Cradle, their <hi>Anger</hi> looketh no farther than
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57209:103"/>
the thing they long for and cannot have; And to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed</hi> for their <hi>own good,</hi> is a <hi>Maxim</hi> they are very ſlow to underſtand: So that you may conclude, the firſt Thoughts of your <hi>Children</hi> will have no ſmall Mixture of Mutiny; which being ſo natural, you muſt not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, except you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. You muſt deny them as feldom as you can, and when there is no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, you muſt do it <hi>gently;</hi> you muſt flatter away their ill Humour, and take the next Opportunity of pleaſing them in ſome other thing, before they either ask or look for it: This will ſtrengthen your <hi>Authority,</hi> by making it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57209:104"/>
ſoft to them; and confirm their <hi>Obedience,</hi> by making it their Intereſt You are to have as ſtrict a Guard upon your ſelf amongſt your <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> as if you were amongſt your <hi>Enemies.</hi> They are apt to make wrong Inferences, to take Encouragement from half Words, and miſapply what you may ſay or do, ſo as either to leſſen their <hi>Duty,</hi> or to extend their <hi>Liberty</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than is convenient. Let them be more in awe of your <hi>Kindneſs</hi> than of your <hi>Power.</hi> And above all, take heed of ſupporting a <hi>Favourite Child</hi> in its Impertinence, which will give Right to the reſt of claiming the ſame Privilege. If you have a divided Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57209:104"/>
leave the <hi>Boys</hi> to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s more peculiar Care, that you may with the greater Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice pretend to a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Juriſdiction over thoſe of your own <hi>Sex.</hi> You are to live ſo with them, that they may never chuſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void you, except when they have <hi>offended;</hi> and then let them tremble, that they may diſtinguiſh: But their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt not continue ſo long as to grow too <hi>ſowre</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Stomachs,</hi> that it may not <hi>harden</hi> in ſtead of <hi>correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them: The kind and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Part muſt have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>turns</hi> ſeaſonably appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but your <hi>Indulgence</hi> is to have the broader mixture, that <hi>Love,</hi> rather than <hi>Fear,</hi>

                     <p>Your <hi>Servants</hi> are in the next place to be conſidered; and you muſt remember not to fall into the miſtake of thinking, that becauſe they receive Wages, and are ſo much <hi>Inferiour</hi> to you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are <hi>below</hi> your Care to know how to manage them. It would be as good Reaſon for a <hi>Maſter Workman</hi> to deſpiſe the <hi>Wheels</hi> of his <hi>Engines,</hi> becauſe they are made of <hi>Wood.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Wheels</hi> of your <hi>Family;</hi> and let your Directions be never ſo faultleſs, yet if theſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi> ſtop or move wrong, the whole Order of your <hi>Houſe</hi> is either at a ſtand, or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57209:105"/>
diſcompoſed. Beſides, the <hi>Inequality</hi> which is between you, muſt not make you forget, that <hi>Nature</hi> maketh no ſuch diſtinction, but that <hi>Servants</hi> may be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>humble Friends,</hi> and that <hi>Returns</hi> of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> are as much due to ſuch of them as deſerve it, as their <hi>Service</hi> is due to <hi>us</hi> when we require it. <hi>A fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh haughtineſs</hi> in the Style of <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> or in the manner of <hi>commanding</hi> them, is in it ſelf very undecent; beſides that it begetteth an <hi>Averſion</hi> in them, of which the leaſt ill Effect to be expected, is, that they will be <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> in all that is injoyned them: And you will find it true by

your Experience, that you will be ſo much the more <hi>obeyed</hi> as you are leſs <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> Be not <hi>too haſty</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your <hi>Orders,</hi> nor <hi>too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi> when they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>obſerved;</hi> much leſs are you to be loud, and too much diſturbed: An <hi>evenneſs</hi> in diſtinguiſhing when they do well or <hi>ill,</hi> is that which will make your <hi>Family</hi> move by a Rule, and without Noiſe, and will the better ſet out your Skill in conducting it with Eaſe and Silence, that it may be like a well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Army; which knoweth how to anticipate the <hi>Orders</hi> that are fit to be given them. You are never to neglect the Duty of the <hi>preſent Hour,</hi> to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57209:106"/>
do another thing, which though it may be better in it ſelf, is not to be unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably preferred. Allot well choſen Hours for the Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of your <hi>Family,</hi> which may be ſo diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of your Time, that the <hi>neceſſary Cares</hi> may come in their proper Place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Influence upon your good Humour, or Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other things. By theſe Methods you will put your ſelf in poſſeſſion of being valued by your Servants, and then their <hi>Obedience</hi> will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget one of the greateſt <hi>Articles</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Family,</hi> which is the <hi>Expence.</hi> It muſt not be ſuch,

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57209:107"/>
difficult in the Caſe of a <hi>Wife,</hi> who is accountable to her <hi>Husband</hi> for her miſtakes in it. It is not only his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> his <hi>Credit</hi> too is at Stake, if what lyeth under the <hi>Wife</hi>'s Care is managed, either with undecent <hi>Thrift,</hi> or too looſe <hi>Profuſion.</hi> You are therefore to keep the <hi>Mean</hi> between theſe two <hi>Extremes,</hi> and it being hardly poſſible to hold the Balance exactly even, let it rather incline towards the <hi>Liberal</hi> ſide as more ſuitable to your <hi>Quality,</hi> and leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Reproach.</hi> Of the two a little <hi>Money</hi> miſpent is ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>recovered,</hi> than the <hi>Credit</hi> which is loſt by having it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely <hi>ſaved;</hi> and a Wiſe <hi>Husband</hi> will leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

a ſhameful piece of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimony,</hi> than a little <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,</hi> if it be not too often repeated.

                     <p>In your <hi>Clothes</hi> avoid too much Gaudy; do not value your ſelf upon an <hi>Imbroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gown;</hi> and remember, that a <hi>reaſonable Word,</hi> or an <hi>obliging Look,</hi> will gain you more reſpect; than all your <hi>fine Trappings.</hi> This is not ſaid to reſtrain you from a <hi>decent Compliance</hi> with the World, provided you take the wiſer, and not the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher

part of your Sex for your Pattern. Some <hi>diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are to be allowed, whilſt they are well ſuited to your <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> and in the diſtribution of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, it ſeemeth to me that a <hi>full Attendance,</hi> and <hi>well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Ornaments</hi> for your Houſe, will make you a better Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, than <hi>too much glittering</hi> in what you wear, which may with more eaſe be imitated by thoſe that are below you. Yet this muſt not tempt you to ſtarve every thing but your own Appartment; or in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to more abundance there, give juſt cauſe to the leaſt Servant you have, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Want of what is neceſſary. Above all, fix
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57209:109"/>
it in your thoughts, as an unchangeable <hi>Maxim,</hi> That nothing is <hi>truly fine</hi> but what is <hi>fit,</hi> and that juſt ſo much as is proper for your <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of their ſeveral kinds, is much finer than all you can add to it. When you once break through theſe bounds, you launch into a wide Sea of <hi>Extravagance.</hi> Every thing will become neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have a mind to it; and you have a mind to it, not becauſe it is <hi>fit</hi> for you, but becauſe ſome body elſe <hi>hath it.</hi> This <hi>Lady's Logick</hi> ſetteth <hi>Reaſon</hi> upon its Head, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the <hi>Rule from</hi> things to <hi>Perſons,</hi> and appealing from what is <hi>right</hi> to every Fool that is in the <hi>wrong.</hi> The

word <hi>neceſſary</hi> is miſerably applyed, it diſordereth <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and overturneth <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> by being ſo abuſed. Remember that <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> want every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want Wit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh: and therefore there is no ſtronger Evidence of a <hi>Crazy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> than the making too large a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of things neceſſary, when in truth there are ſo very few things that have a right to be placed in it.

                     <p>There is one ſhing, yet more to be avoided, which is the <hi>Example</hi> of thoſe who intend nothing farther than the Vanity of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57209:120"/>
think themſelves ſecure of not having their Honour tainted by it. Some are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their <hi>Vertue</hi> is too <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,</hi> and not <hi>enough known,</hi> except it is expoſed to a <hi>broader Light,</hi> and ſet out to its beſt advantage, by ſome publick Trials.

It is as ſafe to play with <hi>Fire,</hi> as to dally with <hi>Gallantry. Love</hi> is a Paſſion that hath Friends in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and for that reaſon muſt by a Woman be kept at ſuch a diſtance, that ſhe may not be within the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of doing the moſt uſual
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57209:120"/>
thing in the World, which is conſpiring againſt her Self: Elſe the humble Gallant, who is only admitted as a Trophy, very often becometh the Conquerour; he putteth on the ſtyle of victory, and from an <hi>Admirer</hi> groweth into a <hi>Maſter,</hi> for ſo he may be called from the moment he is in Poſſeſſion. The firſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of ſtopping at good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and Eſteem, grow weaker by degrees againſt the Charms of <hi>Courtſhip</hi> skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied. A Lady is apt to think a Man ſpeaketh ſo much reaſon whilſt he is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending</hi> her, that ſhe hath much ado to believe him in the wrong when he is making Love to her: And when
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57209:121"/>
beſides the natural Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments your Sex hath to be merciful, ſhe is bribed by well choſen <hi>Flattery,</hi> the poor Creature is in danger of being caught like a Bird liſtening to the Whiſtle of one that hath a Snare for it. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is ſo tempting a thing, that it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten maketh Women miſtake Men's <hi>Submiſſions;</hi> which with all their fair Appearance, have generally leſs <hi>Reſpect</hi> than <hi>Art</hi> in them. You are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Men who ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme fine things, many times ſay them moſt for their own ſakes; and that the vain Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant is often as well pleaſed with his own <hi>Compliments,</hi> as he could be with the <hi>kindeſt anſwer.</hi> Where there is not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57209:121"/>
that <hi>Oſtentation</hi> you are to ſuſpect there is <hi>Deſign.</hi> And as ſtrong <hi>perfumes</hi> are ſeldom uſed but where they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſmother an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>ſcent;</hi> ſo <hi>Exceſſive good Words</hi> leave room to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are ſtrewed to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſomething, which is to gain admittance under a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. You muſt therefore be upon your Guard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that of the two, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> is more dangerous than <hi>Anger.</hi> It puts even the beſt Underſtandings out of their place for the time, till their ſecond thoughts reſtore them; it ſtealeth upon us inſenſibly, throweth down our <hi>Defences,</hi> and maketh it too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, after we have given it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57209:122"/>
that advantage. Whereas rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling goeth away in ſound; it hath ſo much noiſe in it, that by giving warning it beſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Caution. <hi>Reſpect</hi> is a ſlow and a ſure <hi>Poiſon,</hi> and like <hi>Poiſon</hi> ſwelleth us within our ſelves. Where it prevaileth too much, it groweth to be a kind of <hi>Apoplexie</hi> in the Mind, turneth it quite round, and after it hath once ſeized the underſtanding, becometh <hi>mortal</hi> to it. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the ſafeſt way is to treat it like a ſly Enemy, and to be perpetually upon the watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                     <p>I will add one <hi>Advice</hi> to conclude this head, which is that you will let every ſeven years make ſome alteration in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57209:122"/>
you towards the <hi>Graver</hi> ſide, and not be like the <hi>Girls</hi> of Fifty, who reſolve to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Young,</hi> whatever <hi>Time</hi> with his Iron Teeth hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to the contrary. Unnatural things carry a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> in them never to be <hi>Diſguiſed;</hi> the <hi>Livelineſs</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> in a riper Age, looketh like a <hi>new patch</hi> upon an <hi>old Gown;</hi> ſo that a <hi>Gay Matron,</hi> a cheerful <hi>old Fool</hi> may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably put into the Liſt of the <hi>Tamer</hi> kind of <hi>Monſters.</hi> There is a certain Creature call'd a <hi>Grave Hobby-Horſe,</hi> a kind of a ſhe <hi>Numps,</hi> that pretendeth to be pulled to a Play, and muſt needs go to <hi>Bartholomew Fair,</hi> to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the young Folks, whom ſhe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57209:123"/>
only ſeemeth to make her care, in reality ſhe taketh them for her excuſe. Such an old <hi>Butterfly</hi> is of all <hi>Creatures,</hi> the moſt ridiculous, and the ſooneſt found out. It is good to be early in your Caution, to avoid any thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within diſtance of ſuch deſpicable Patterns, and not like ſome <hi>Ladies,</hi> who defer their <hi>Converſion,</hi> till they have been ſo long in poſſeſſion of being laughed at, that the World doth not know how to change their ſtyle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are reclaimed from that which gave the firſt occaſion for it.</p>
                     <p>The advantages of being <hi>reſerved</hi> are too many to be ſet down, I will only ſay, that

                     <p>A Woman is not to be proud of her fine Gown; nor when ſhe hath leſs Wit than her Neighbours, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her ſelf that ſhe hath more Lace. Some Ladies put
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57209:140"/>
ſo much weight upon <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that if one could ſee into their Hearts, it would be found, that even the Thought of <hi>Death</hi> is made leſs heavy to them by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of their being <hi>laid out</hi> in <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attended</hi> to the <hi>Grave.</hi> One may come a good deal ſhort of ſuch an <hi>Extream,</hi> and yet ſtill be ſufficiently <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,</hi> by ſetting a wrong Value upon things, which ought to be uſed with more indifference. A Lady muſt not appear ſollicitous to ingroſs <hi>Reſpect</hi> to her ſelf, but be content with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Diſtribution,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to others, that ſhe may have it returned to her.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57209:140"/>
She is not to be troubleſomly <hi>nice,</hi> nor diſtinguiſh her ſelf by being too <hi>delicate,</hi> as if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things were too <hi>courſe</hi> for her; this is an <hi>unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and an <hi>offenſive</hi> Pride, and where it is practiſed, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to be mortified, of which it ſeldom faileth. She is not to lean too much upon her Quality, much leſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe who are below it. Some make <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Idol,</hi> and then their <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt fall down and Worſhip it. They would have the World think, that no amends can ever be made for the want of a <hi>great Title,</hi> or an ancient <hi>Coat of Arms:</hi> They imagine, that with theſe <hi>advantages</hi> they ſtand upon the <hi>higher Ground,</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57209:141"/>
which maketh them look down upon <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> as things inferiour to them. This miſtake is not only <hi>ſenſeleſs,</hi> but <hi>criminal</hi> too, in putting a greater Price upon that which is a piece of <hi>good luck,</hi> than upon things which are valuable in themſelves. <hi>Laughing</hi> is not enough for ſuch a <hi>Folly;</hi> it muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely <hi>whipped,</hi> as it juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. It will be confeſſed, there are frequent <hi>Temptations</hi> given by <hi>pert <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts</hi> to be angry, and by that to have our Judgments corrupted in theſe Caſes: But they are to be reſiſted; and the utmoſt that is to be allowed, is, when thoſe of a <hi>new Edition</hi> will forget themſelves, ſo as either
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57209:141"/>
to brag of their <hi>weak ſide,</hi> or to endeavour to hide their <hi>Meanneſs</hi> by their <hi>Inſolence,</hi> to cure them by a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Raillery,</hi> a little <hi>Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> well placed, without dwelling too long upon it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and many other kinds of <hi>Pride</hi> are to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>That which is to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to you, is an <hi>Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to raiſe your ſelf to a <hi>Character,</hi> by which you may be diſtinguiſhed; an Eagerneſs for precedence in <hi>Vertue,</hi> and all ſuch other things as may gain you a greater ſhare of the good opinion of the World. <hi>Eſteem</hi> to <hi>Vertue</hi> is like a <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Air</hi> to <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which maketh them blow and proſper; and for that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57209:142"/>
reaſon it may be allowed to be in ſome degree the <hi>Cauſe</hi> as well as the <hi>Reward</hi> of it. That <hi>Pride</hi> which leadeth to a <hi>good End,</hi> cannot be a <hi>Vice,</hi> ſince it is the beginning of a <hi>Vertue;</hi> and to be pleaſed with juſt <hi>Applauſe,</hi> is ſo far from a <hi>Fault,</hi> that it would be an <hi>ill Symptom</hi> in a Woman, who ſhould not place the greateſt part of her <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in it. <hi>Humility</hi> is no doubt a great <hi>Vertue;</hi> but it ceaſeth to be ſo, when it is afraid to ſcorn an <hi>ill thing.</hi> Againſt <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> it is becoming your <hi>Sex</hi> to be <hi>haughty;</hi> but you muſt not carry the <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>things</hi> to <hi>Arrogance</hi> towards <hi>Perſons,</hi> and it muſt be done with fitting <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> elſe

it may be <hi>Inconvenient</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſeaſonable. A <hi>Pride</hi> that raiſeth a little <hi>Anger</hi> to be out-done in any thing that is good, will have ſo good an <hi>Effect,</hi> that it is very hard to allow it to be a Fault.</p>
                     <p>It is no eaſie matte to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry even between theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kinds ſo deſcribed; but remember that it is ſafer for a <hi>Woman</hi> to be thought too <hi>proud,</hi> than too familiar.</p>
