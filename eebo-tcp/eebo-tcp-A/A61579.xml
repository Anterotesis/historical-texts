            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Design of the following Book is to give as clear and distinct a View of the State and Condition of the <hi>British Churches,</hi> from their first Plantation to the Conversion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as could be had at so great a distance, and by such a degree of Light as is left us concerning them. When I first undertook this Subject I intended no more than an <hi>Introduction</hi> to something else; but being entred into it, and laying the several parts of it before me, I found so many obscure and doubtfull pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to be clear'd, so many common mistakes to be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, so many considerable parts of Church-History which tended to illustrate it, that either I must give a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Account of it, or so much exceed the proportions of a Preface, that I concluded I had better alter my design and with more Pains and Materials make it an intire Work of it self. To this end I laid aside whatever related to the first Occasion of my undertaking it, reserving that for its proper Place and Season; and then I resumed the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this present Argument, with larger and freer thoughts, and resolved to attempt something towards the rescuing this part of <hi>Church-History,</hi> wherein we are so much concerned, from those <hi>Fabulous Antiquities</hi> which had so much debased the Value and eclipsed the Glory of it.</p>
            <p>This I knew was a Work, not onely of much Labour and Industry in searching and comparing good and bad Authours Printed and MS. foreign and domestick; but which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired more than ordinary care and judgment in separating the Oar from the Dross; which being done as it ought, the question might be, whether it would not fall out here as in some Mines, that the quantity of good Oar would be so small as hardly to compensate for the Pains of digging and refining it. But this was not all the difficulty to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen; for some Mens Eyes are still so tender as not to be
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:62156:5"/>
able to bear the strong impressions of Light; especially in what relates to the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of their own Countrey.</p>
            <p>For whatever the reason be, of that Love Mankind do naturally bear to the Countrey they are born in, we find it so universal, that even the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Samoyeds</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire no Countrey like their own; and are impatient of any contradiction to their Fancies of the Beauties and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of it. And it is pity to rob Men of any such false Idea's, not entrenching upon Religion or Morality, which tend so much to the Ease and Comfort of their Lives. For, if Men will be in love with a cold Air and a barren Soil, with Ice and Mountains, with living in Caves and Hutts, and travelling upon the hardned Snow, to what purpose should any go about to confute them, by proving that the <hi>Elysian Fields</hi> are more pleasant than those Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Climats? And so strong is the inclination that is rooted in Mankind to the Love of their Countrey, that some learned and witty Men, who have been born in none of the most tempting Climats have used great Art and Industry to represent them with such advantage to the World, as though <hi>Paradise</hi> were but another Name for their Native Countrey. Of which we have a remarkable instance in the late Work of an ingenious Person, who with mighty pains hath endeavoured to prove not onely that <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Atlantick Island,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ola Rudbeck. Atlantic.</hi> c. 7.23.</note> but the <hi>Elysian Fields</hi> themselves are to be found in one of the remotest Northern Countries.</p>
            <p>And it is to little purpose to go about to alter such Mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which are not so much founded on Reason, as on an over bearing Passion for their native Soil, which hurts no other Part of the World, and makes their own seem more pleasant to themselves. Some will be apt to think, the greatest punishment to such Persons, is to let them live at Home and enjoy their own Opinions; but I rather look on it as an effect of the Wisedom of Divine Providence to make Men contented with the Places of their Habitations: For if all Mankind should love and admire one and the same Countrey, there would be nothing but destroying one another in hopes to enjoy it; whereas now, since the true Paradise is lost, it seems to be most convenient for the World, that every Nation should believe they have it at Home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:62156:5"/>If therefore any of our Neighbour Nations should think their own the richest, the pleasantest, the fruitfullest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in the World, I should by no means think it fit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute it with them, no more than I would the Wisedom or Goodness of their Parents. For, however the Truth of things be, it is best for Children to believe well of them; and it may prove of very ill consequence to alter a mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good Opinion in them; for it makes them less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and less fit to be governed than before; and living under such a mispersuasion can never doe them so much hurt as the unseasonable discovery of their Errour doth. From hence I look on all National Quarrels as very foolish and mischievous, it being reasonable that all Persons should love their own Countrey as they do their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and no Man ought to suffer in his esteem for that which it was never in his Power to help. But whosoever fixes an ill Character upon a Person on the account of his Countrey, makes a whole Nation his Enemies, which no wise Man will ever doe; and whoever doeth it will one time or other see cause to repent his Folly.</p>
            <p>But is it not possible for learned and ingenuous Men to enquire into and debate the several <hi>Antiquities</hi> of their <hi>Nations</hi> without making a <hi>National Quarrel</hi> about them? In matter of Self-defence there is a <hi>Moderamen incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patae tutelae</hi> to be observed; and so there ought certainly to be in the defence of our Countrey; especially when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute relates neither to the safety, nor Profit, nor the true Honour or esteem of it, but onely to a mere point of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> wherein wise and learned Men may differ from each other that are Natives of the same Countrey. And these matters are not to be decided in the Field, nor at the Bar, nor by a majority of voices, but depend upon the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ancient Histories, the credibility of Testimonies, and a sagacity in searching, and skill in judging concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them. It is not every one that can plead eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Bar, or quote Authours at second Hand, or dispute warmly out of common Places, that is presently fit to judge about such things; for he that takes upon him to doe that ought not onely to have a general skill in <hi>Antiquity</hi> and the best Authours, but to compare the Histories and Annals, the successions and the settlements of the Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together, and then with great impartiality to deliver
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:62156:6"/>
his judgment; but by no means to espouse any particular Interest, as though he were retained on that side. Which he plainly discovers if he appear resolved to maintain one side against the strongest evidence, and to cry down the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an ignominious and reproachfull manner; as though nothing but <hi>particular Piques</hi> and <hi>Animosities,</hi> or which is far worse, <hi>ill Will to the Government,</hi> could lead Men into such debates; nay as though <hi>it were a degree of Lese-Majesty,</hi> (as it is termed) to call in question some very remote and very uncertain Traditions about the first Succession of the Kings of a Neighbour Nation. This I have particular reason to take notice of, from the usage the very learned and judicious Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> hath lately met with in this kind,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Historical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ancient Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in</hi> Great Britain <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> merely because in his late excellent Book he rejects <hi>the long Succession of Kings from</hi> Fergus <hi>the Son of</hi> Ferquard, <hi>from the time of</hi> Alexander<hi>'s taking of</hi> Babylon; which he doth chiefly on these two grounds, 1. Because he proves from good Authorities in his Book, that the <hi>Scots</hi> could not be so early setled in <hi>Britain.</hi> 2. Because those <hi>Scotish Historians</hi> who have asserted it are not of sufficient Authority to be relied upon; which he shews at large in his <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon this occasion, <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s <hi>learned Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in</hi> Scotland, hath been pleased to think it a part of his Duty to answer this part of the Bishop's Book, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some kind of sharpness and unhandsome Reflexions on a Person of his Character and Merit; but none like this, <hi>That he admires that any of the Subjects of</hi> Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>did not think it a degree of Lese-Majesty to injure and shorten the Royal Line of their Kings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Letter to Lord Chancellour, p.</hi> 11.</note> But there is more Reason to admire at the strangeness of this Accusation, unless it were intended to shew that he could as well <hi>prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> as write against the Bishop by virtue of his Office, for disputing their Antiquities. As though the fundamental Constitution of the <hi>British Monarchy</hi> were at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Credit of <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> for upon it, as I shall presently shew, the main stress of this matter doth rest.</p>
            <p>But because these are dangerous insinuations, and may as well be urged against some part of the following Book, I shall here make it clear how very unjust and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are. For it is not the <hi>Antiquity of the Royal
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:62156:6"/>
Line</hi> which is in dispute, but the <hi>Succession</hi> of it in such a Place; the <hi>Irish Antiquaries</hi> carrying the <hi>Succession</hi> much farther back than <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> or <hi>Lesly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Gratian. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium</hi> in <hi>Cambr.</hi> Evers. p. 248, 249.</note> or <hi>Buchanan</hi> do. And therefore they charge others far more with <hi>shortning the Royal Line,</hi> making it to begin with <hi>Fergus;</hi> when they derive it long before by a continued Succession from <hi>Simon Brek,</hi> and <hi>Herimon,</hi> and <hi>Gathelus,</hi> who they say was but six Descents from <hi>Japhet.</hi> But if there be <hi>any degree of Lese-Majesty</hi> (for I am very unwilling to put these hard Words into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per English) in those who debate any thing wherein <hi>the Honour of the Royal Line</hi> is concerned, let them clear themselves of it, who lay the foundation of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the Election of <hi>Fergus.</hi> For that is truly the State of the case; those who contend so earnestly for the Succession of the <hi>Royal Line</hi> from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferchard,</hi> placing his Title to the <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the choice of the Heads of the Tribes; which will appear from the Words of <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> who is in truth the main support of all this Tradition.</p>
            <p>For, although <hi>Fordon</hi> doth mention the <hi>Succession</hi> of many Kings from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferquard</hi> to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus II.</hi> yet he professes he could find nothing particular concerning them; although he quotes several <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and we are told he had the View of their <hi>Annals,</hi> such as they were, of <hi>Paslay, Scoon</hi> and other Places. He names indeed 45. <hi>Kings,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">
                  <hi>A primo quidem hujus Regni Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusio filio Ferchardi ad hunc Regem Fergusium filium Erch inclusive,</hi> 45. <hi>Reges ejusdem gentis &amp; generis in hac Insula regnaverunt: sed &amp; horum sigillatim distinguere tempora prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatuum ad praesens omittimus, nam ad plenum Scripta non reperimus.</hi> Fordon Scotichr. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>but he desires to be excused as to the several times of their Reigns, for he had not met with them written at large, but from the time of</hi> Fergus <hi>II. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to be very distinct and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> Yet after him comes <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> of whom the learned Advocate tells us <hi>that</hi> Erasmus <hi>said he could not lie;</hi>

Of this he informs us from <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> himself (and can we have a better Authority than his that could not lie?) <hi>That he had several Books from</hi> Icolmkill, <hi>which he followed in writing his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</hi> I cannot now enter upon the consideration of the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:62156:7"/>

            <p>But that which I am now to shew is, that if <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> his <hi>Authority</hi> be allowed, those who lengthen the <hi>Royal Line</hi> doe more <hi>injury to the Monarchy</hi> than those who shorten it. For the first Account he gives of it is this,<note place="margin">

               <q>That the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> being pressed by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> they sent over into <hi>Ireland</hi> for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence; <hi>Ferquard</hi> sent his Son <hi>Fergus</hi> with Supplies; who, saith he, left it to the choice of the Heads of the Tribes, what Government they would have, whether a <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy</hi> or <hi>a Commonwealth;</hi> and they pitched upon a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and made <hi>Fergus</hi> their King: which he saith was just 330 years before <hi>Christ</hi>'s Nativity. After which he sets down <hi>Fergus</hi> his owning that he received his Authority from the People; and their <hi>Fundamental Contract</hi> to adhere to him and to his Line,<note place="margin">

The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whereof was, that <hi>Ferlegus</hi> attempting to recover his Right from <hi>Feritharis</hi> was banished and utterly excluded. <hi>Hector</hi> himself confesses <hi>he was at just Age when he demanded the Crown,</hi>

               <hi>that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in his Absence;</hi> but he would fain reconcile this practice to their former Oath; (although the <hi>Advocate</hi> himself saith,<note place="margin">

               <hi>this Oath did in Law and Reason bind them to obey the Lineal Successour according to the proximity of Bloud)</hi> but <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s pretence is <hi>because the present King during the Minority of the Heir, was but a King in trust, and the Heir at such an Age was to succeed.</hi> But how well that was observed appears by this first instance, and in truth, <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> and the rest after him do put the whole power as to these Matters, in the hands of the People, or at least of the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Clanns;</hi> as will appear more afterwards.</p>
            <p>It cannot therefore but be very surprising to us to see his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s <hi>Advocate</hi> so zealously defending this History of the <hi>first Succession</hi> of their <hi>Kings,</hi>

And yet he cannot deny that this Law <hi>was the Occasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bloudy Civil Wars between the Uncles and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews;</hi> and he calls it <hi>the Dispute betwixt such as were for the Crown and such as were for Popular Elections.</hi> From whence it follows, That <hi>Hector Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> his History of the first Succession from <hi>Fergus</hi> is to set up the popular Claim. And quite through that first Race <hi>Hector</hi> makes the supreme unaccountable power in all cases of Male Administration to be lodged in the Heads of the People, and the <hi>Ministerial</hi> in the <hi>Monarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, we should have thought it had better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his <hi>Majesty's Advocate</hi> to have overthrown such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Principles to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as are contained in this account of the <hi>first Race</hi> of their Kings from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferquard.</hi> And although <hi>Buchanan,</hi> among the half-learned, bear the blame of these <hi>Antimonarchical Principles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Just Right of Monarchy, p.</hi> 26.</note> yet it is evident that he onely built on the Foundations laid by those who set up this first Race, as the Advocate himself confesseth, whose Words are, <hi>All</hi> Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan<hi>'s Arguments for restraining Kings being founded on the Authority of our Historians, who,</hi> as he saith, <hi>assert that King</hi> Fergus <hi>was first elected King by the People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leslae. <hi>Hist. p.</hi> 77.79.</note> And therefore those Historians who set up this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in such a manner had no kindness to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as appears by what <hi>Lesly</hi> himself saith about King <hi>Fergus</hi> and his Successours.</p>

               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:62156:8"/>It is true that the learned Advocate hath, according to his duty, published a <hi>Just Defence of the Monarchy of Scotland;</hi> but I must crave leave to say that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be defended upon good grounds unless the Account of <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferquard,</hi> and the Succession of Kings from him as delivered by <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> and <hi>Lesly</hi> as well as <hi>Buchanan</hi> be rejected.

After this, we find a greater difference, for instead of <hi>Finnanus, Durstus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus, Gillus, Euenus II. Ederus, Euenus III.

            <p>Now by comparing this <hi>Genealogy</hi> and <hi>Hector Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> together, I am convinced that he did not forge all the Names of his <hi>first Race of Kings,</hi> between the two <hi>Fergusses;</hi> but yet from hence it appears, (1.)

and when he did so he had some end to serve in it.

Eugenius VIII.</hi> in their Account, after him follows <hi>Alphin;</hi> but between these, they have inserted <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus III. Solvathius, Achaius, Convallus</hi> and <hi>Dongal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> They all agree with the Genealogist, that <hi>Kenneth</hi>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:62156:10"/>
immediately succeeded <hi>Alphin;</hi> but then follows a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull difference; for here they put in no fewer than 13 Kings between <hi>Kenneth</hi> and <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Son of <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> whom the <hi>Genealogist</hi> places next after him; then follows <hi>Duncan</hi> in all; between whom and <hi>Malcolm Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir</hi> they put in <hi>Machabaeus.</hi> After <hi>Malcolm</hi> he takes no notice of four Kings they insert between him and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and where they put another <hi>Malcolm</hi> he placeth <hi>Henry,</hi> and then they agree in <hi>William, Alexander</hi> and his Son <hi>Alexander;</hi> in whom the <hi>Genealogy</hi> begins, and so runs backward in a lineal Ascent.</p>
            <p>Now it deserves very well to be considered, that this ancient Genealogist hath so much shortned the <hi>Succession</hi> as will bring the whole into a much less compass: For the modern <hi>Historians</hi> have inserted more Kings in the second Race from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Erk</hi> than are contained in the <hi>Genealogy</hi> from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferquard</hi> to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus II.</hi> and so the whole Succession will stand within the same time that it now doth, from <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Erk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if <hi>the shortening the Royal Line be such an injury to it,</hi> as the <hi>Advocate</hi> supposeth, it is well for this ancient Genealogist that he lived so long since, or else he might have had a cast of the <hi>Advocate</hi>'s Office.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Authority of this Genealogist to be sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the learned Advocate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Defence of the Antiquity of the Royal Line, p.</hi> 20, 21.</note> since himself giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>how their Tradition might have been, and was preserved,</hi> he brings this very instance of <hi>the Genealogy of King</hi> Alexander <hi>in the year</hi> 1242. <hi>before</hi> Fordon<hi>'s time, and related so by him that his Relation cannot but be credited;</hi> and so he repeats the beginning of it as it is in <hi>Fordon.</hi> But if he had taken the pains to compare it, he would have found how much it overthrew the Credit of their Historians. For if this was the Way their Tradition was preserved, then by this Way, we are to judge of the Truth of their ancient Tradition; and consequently we must reject those Kings whose Names are not preserved in this ancient Genealogy.</p>
            <p>And to confirm this we have another said to be more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in <hi>Fordon,</hi> which the <hi>Advocate</hi> attributes to <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredus, Abbat</hi> of <hi>Melros,</hi> (otherwise called <hi>Ealredus,</hi>

<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:62156:11"/>
find, that <hi>Fordon</hi> attributes this Genealogy to <hi>Baldredus,</hi> for he saith <hi>he had it from</hi> Walter de Wardlaw,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scotich l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 59.</note> Cardinal <hi>and the Bishop of</hi> Glasgow, <hi>who lived in the time of</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert <hi>II.</hi> saith <hi>Lesly</hi>:<note place="margin">Leslae. <hi>p.</hi> 250.</note> (which helps to discover <hi>Fordon</hi>'s Age) And in this <hi>Genealogy</hi> the first part from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Fergus</hi> is cut off with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the other part from <hi>Fergus II.</hi> up to <hi>Fergus I.</hi> is preserved entire, and except in the spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of some few Names, exactly agrees with the former <hi>Genealogy,</hi> leaving out all those Kings which are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the other. But the latter <hi>Genealogy</hi> having been corrupted before <hi>Fordon</hi>'s time, he would not have it stand upon Record against him; which caution he forgot when he came to <hi>Alexander III.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is still a third <hi>Genealogy</hi> in <hi>Fordon,</hi> which supplies in some measure the defects in that of King <hi>David,</hi> and it is the <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Kenneth,</hi> the first <hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> (the <hi>Picts</hi> being totally subdued by him) and then he makes no more between them but <hi>Alphin,</hi> and then <hi>Achai</hi> (which seems to be truer than the other which calls <hi>Alphin</hi>'s Father <hi>Ethas)</hi> before him he places <hi>Ethfin</hi> called <hi>Ethafind</hi> in the other; next him is <hi>Eugenius</hi> in the other <hi>Ethodac;</hi> then <hi>Dongard</hi> the Son of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald Brek;</hi> whereas in the other this <hi>Dongard</hi> is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; before <hi>Donewald-brek</hi> in this Genealogy, is <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius-bind</hi> called <hi>Occahebind</hi> in the other; then <hi>Aida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in the other <hi>Edanus;</hi> then <hi>Gouran</hi> called there <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bren,</hi> then <hi>Dongard,</hi> and so we are come to <hi>Fergus</hi> the <hi>great;</hi> and there is but one difference, <hi>i. e.</hi> about <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> in these Genealogies. And this makes but 10 Kings between <hi>Fergus</hi> and <hi>Kenneth,</hi> whereas the common Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans make 28. which is a very unreasonable Addition to their own most ancient Genealogies. But if this were not done there would appear no probability, that <hi>the first</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus <hi>should have come into</hi> Scotland 330 <hi>years before Christ</hi>'s <hi>Nativity.</hi> Which the learned Advocate affirms in the very beginning of his Defence, <hi>that all their Historians are agreed on.</hi> And yet farther to confirm these Genealogies he tells us <hi>he had seen an old Genealogy of the Kings of the</hi> Albanian Scots, <hi>agreeing with that mentioned at the Coronation of King</hi> Alexander <hi>II. and which has still been preserv'd as sacred there,</hi> i. e. at <hi>Icolm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill,</hi> I suppose, or the Island <hi>Jona.</hi> But it is observable

that <hi>Hector</hi> mentioning the Coronation of this <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hect.

And to confirm all these Genealogies, the <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogies in <hi>Gratianus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> agree with them in excluding so many Kings,<note place="margin">Gratian. <hi>Luc.

            <p>But when <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> found 330 years before Christ pitched upon by <hi>Fordon</hi> for the <hi>Scots</hi> coming into <hi>Scotland</hi> with so much punctuality,<note place="margin">

But <hi>Fordon</hi> quotes no Authour for this wild computation; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he subjoins a passage out of the Legend of S. <hi>Congall,</hi> which mentions the coming of <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quard</hi> out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> and after he mentions <hi>Rether</hi> for one of <hi>his Successours, the same,</hi> he saith, with <hi>Bede</hi>'s <hi>Reuda.</hi> Suppose all this be granted, yet what shadow of proof is there, <hi>that</hi> Fergus <hi>came into</hi> Scotland <hi>so long before Christ's Nativity? Fordon</hi> confesses <hi>he knew not how long any of those Kings after</hi> Fergus <hi>reigned;</hi> how then came he to know so exactly the time of their coming? What certain Note or Character of time had they to help them in their Calculation? If they could produce any such, and be able to adjust the times of the <hi>Succession</hi> of their several Kings by them, there might be a great deal said for this pretended <hi>Antiquity;</hi> but when it is at the same time confessed they had no such thing, how could they satisfie any reasonable enquirer into these Antiquities?</p>
            <p>Things standing thus, and <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> with the help of his <hi>Physician</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> (who,<note place="margin">

And so he begins his History very formally in imitation of the best <hi>Roman</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, with deducing their History from <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Scota,</hi> deriving their Succession from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> did theirs from the <hi>Trojans.</hi> This I do not attribute to his invention, for it is at large in <hi>Fordon;</hi>

But to doe right to <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> in this matter, he saith ingenuously <hi>that their People follow'd the custome of other Nations therein.</hi> And as I have shew'd in the following Book at large (where I treat of these <hi>Antiquities)</hi> this humour had overspread all the Northern Nations,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> as soon as they shook off the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, and began not onely to be distinct Kingdoms, but to have some affectation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Learning, and to have Persons of their own Nation who began to write their Histories; who thought they did nothing for the honour of their Countrey unless they could, some way or other, derive themselves from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom they met with so often in the <hi>Roman Authours;</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> in most Provinces mixing together with the Northern People, excited a greater Ambition in them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be like the <hi>Romans,</hi> or to exceed them in their pretended Antiquities. And their inventions not being extraordinary, there is very little variety in their several Accounts, as will appear by comparing them in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Places.</p>
            <p>In this point <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> hath acquitted himself well enough; but finding the <hi>Succession</hi> of their Kings ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short and meagre, having no flesh to fill it, nor nerves to support it, nor colour to adorn it; therefore he sets himself to make up what he found defective, and to put it together under the Names of <hi>Veremundus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> or others; out of these he frames a long series or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue</hi> of Kings, which looked big, and raised Mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and seem'd well enough contrived to serve the
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:62156:12"/>
pretence to so great Antiquity. This being done, he fills up the Story of these Kings, not out of their <hi>old Annals</hi> (as far as yet appears) but in a great measure out of his own invention, so as to mix the <hi>Commonwealth-Learning</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> with the History of their ancient Kings. Which hath done great prejudice to the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy;</hi> for <hi>Hector</hi>'s History took so much among the Nobility, (for very good Reasons to them) that all that have written since him, have depended upon his Authority, as appears both by <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Lesly;</hi> unless it were where he grosly contradicted the <hi>Roman History,</hi> and there <hi>Buchanan</hi> leaves him, but for the main of his History he relies upon him;<note place="margin">Leslae.

            <p>But I must beg pardon of his Majesty's Advocate, if I take the freedom to say he hath not taken the right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to doe it. For he ought first to have proved the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in dispute by clear and indubitable Testimonies, before he had made his severe Reflexions and Inferences; but as <hi>Cicero</hi> said of the <hi>Musician</hi> who defined the <hi>Soul</hi> to be <hi>Harmony, ab Arte sua non recessit,</hi> so this ingenious Gentleman hath managed this whole debate in a way more agreeing to the Character of an <hi>Advocate</hi> than of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary.</hi> For why so many insinuations, as though some <hi>injury were intended to the Royal Line,</hi> which I dare say, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> doth really honour and esteem as much as his <hi>Majesty's Advocate</hi> himself. For, doth any Man of understanding think that it is any <hi>injury</hi> to the <hi>Royal Line</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> to have the <hi>fabulous Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> concerning the <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>British Kings</hi> down from <hi>Brutus</hi> confuted?

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> But why not, as well from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians?</hi> But the <hi>Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> is so just to Truth, and so little a Friend to popular Fables, that he fairly gives up <hi>Geoffrey</hi> before he attacks <hi>Hector Boethius;</hi> could any thing be more fairly and impartially done? or more convincing, that he onely designed to find out Truth in these matters, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that fondness some Men still have for these <hi>British Antiquities</hi>? For there are and will be some (and those
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:62156:13"/>
not wholly unlearned) who are naturally inclined to believe Fables; and have so passionate a zeal for such things, that they cry out upon all discoveries of this kind, as inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to their Countrey, if not to the <hi>Royal Line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may it not justly seem strange, that when our polite and learned Neighbours have endeavoured with so much care to reform their Histories, and to purge away all <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Antiquities</hi> out of them; we of this Island should grow angry and impatient when any undertake so generous a design? What injury is it thought to be to the Royal Line of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Hunibaldus</hi> his <hi>Antiquities</hi> find no longer place in their Histories? And yet nothing seems more glorious, than to have their Royal Line deduced long before the time that <hi>Alexander</hi> took <hi>Babylon.</hi> For according to <hi>Hunibaldus</hi> his Account, which he took he saith out of an ancient MS. of <hi>Vastaldus</hi> (such another Authour as <hi>Veremundus)</hi> the <hi>Franks</hi> went from <hi>Troy</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Francio</hi> towards the <hi>Palus Maeotis</hi> just about the time that <hi>Aeneas</hi> went for <hi>Italy,</hi> where they fixed and built the City <hi>Sicambria,</hi> and at last removed into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> under <hi>Marcomir</hi> the Son of <hi>Priamus,</hi> and <hi>Sunno</hi> the Son of <hi>Antenor.</hi> After <hi>Francio, Hunibaldus</hi> sets down a formal Succession of Kings of two several Races, 16 in the first, and 31 in the second.

So that these <hi>Antiquities</hi> were so far from being universally received abroad that they went down very hardly at home.

               <hi>but what the People gave him; and that it is in their Power to take it away;</hi> which he not onely asserts, but endeavours to prove in a <hi>Scholastick</hi> manner as far as <hi>Septimò &amp; Finaliter.</hi> And is not this <hi>a degree of Lese-Majesty</hi> above the endeavouring to shorten the <hi>Royal Line?</hi> And they had far better deny any such Person as <hi>Fergus,</hi> than to make him a King upon such terms, which overthrow the <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who are these foreign <hi>Historians, Antiquaries</hi> and <hi>Criticks,</hi> who at any time have so much applauded these Antiquities? <hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi> did indeed applaud his own Wit for his Criticism about <hi>Scoto-Brigantes</hi> in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s Verses.

               <hi>as brought under the</hi> Roman <hi>Power. Scoti sunt in Hibernia adhuc, non in Britannia,</hi> are <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s own Words.

               <hi>too learned to be answered by any Adversary.</hi> What doth he mean by their <hi>Antiquity?</hi> That of the Nation? No one denies it.

                  <note place="margin">Pausan. <hi>in.</hi> Arcad.</note> and the <hi>Inscriptions</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein mention is made of the <hi>Leg.</hi> 2. which signifie very little to this purpose.</q> For why could not the <hi>second Legion</hi> fight against the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> supposing them to be <hi>Britains,</hi> as well as supposing them to be <hi>Irish?</hi> But <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was this, <q>The <hi>Brigantes</hi> and the <hi>Britains</hi> were two distinct People; while they continued at home, they were called by no other Name, but when they made excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions abroad, then they were called <hi>Scotobrigantes</hi> and <hi>Scotobritanni;</hi> and so the word <hi>Scot,</hi> he saith, is not a proper Name, but Appellative; and not <hi>Irish</hi> but <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi> for those who go from home in hopes of Booty, as the names of <hi>Bedwin</hi> and <hi>Saracen;</hi> and so as the <hi>Arabs</hi> were after called <hi>Saracens,</hi> so these <hi>Brigantes,</hi> when they so much infested <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>Claudian</hi>'s time, and after were called <hi>Scoti.</hi>
               </q> Now what there is in all this, that should so much please the <hi>Advocate,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. He is very angry with the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> for representing their Ancestours as a company of <hi>barbarous Pilferers and Robbers</hi> (although he onely produces the Testimony of <hi>Gildas)</hi> how then comes he to be so much pleased with <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Defence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 104, 106, 108.</note> who makes the Name <hi>Scot</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie so much? I had thought he should have been more concerned to have disproved such a reproachfull Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie than to have magnified this Discourse of <hi>Scaliger</hi> so highly. But where is it that he mentions <hi>the first Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of their Kings</hi> with approbation, or Fergus <hi>his
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:62156:16"/>
coming into</hi> Scotland <hi>before Christ's Nativity?</hi> All that he saith is, <q>That the <hi>Scots</hi> might be a Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were known by that Name, (and who doubts it) as the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> were: and that the <hi>Brigantes</hi> out of <hi>Ireland</hi> might make inroads and excursions into <hi>Britain</hi> in the flourishing times of the Empire.</q> And I see no reason to deny this, although it be not sufficiently proved. But the question is about a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> from the time of <hi>Fergus I.</hi> and of this <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith not a word. For these <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> coming out of <hi>Ireland</hi> might fix there for some time, and return again to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as <hi>Gildas</hi> saith they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, or they might fix as a scatter'd People not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as <hi>Fordon</hi> saith, they did before <hi>Fergus</hi> his coming. So that if their Antiquities be no more applauded by other Antiquaries and Criticks than they are by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> this Argument will come to very little.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Salmasius</hi> and the rest he mentions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Defence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 126.</note> say much less than <hi>Scaliger; Salmasius</hi> onely useth <hi>Scaliger's</hi> Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism about the <hi>Scoto-Brigantes</hi> without adding any thing. <hi>Lipsius</hi> unhappily calls <hi>Galgacus</hi> a <hi>Scot;</hi> which was an improper expression, as I have proved in the proper place; because it is so evident from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that the <hi>Caledoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were not <hi>Scots;</hi> unless it be taken for <hi>Scythians,</hi> (of which afterwards) but by <hi>Scots</hi> here we mean such as came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to settle in <hi>Britain;</hi> and such <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacus</hi> and his Souldiers were not.

            <p>Therefore from the Testimony of <hi>Historians, Antiquaries</hi> and <hi>Criticks,</hi> I proceed to examine the Argumentative part of his Book; and setting aside all <hi>common Places</hi> about <hi>Historical certainty, Tradition, common Fame,</hi> &amp;c.

               <note place="margin">Liv. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>init.</hi>
               </note> in which he saith, <hi>that the use of Letters was not then ordinary; the onely certain preserver of the memory of things past</hi> (so <hi>Livy</hi>'s Words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>rarae per ea tempora Literae, una custodia fidelis memoriae rerum gestarum,</hi> and not as the Advocate with too much art, hath translated them, that <hi>the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords were the faithfull Remembrance of things past.</hi> For if this were <hi>Livy</hi>'s meaning why doth he complain of the want of the <hi>common use of Letters,</hi> when he saith <hi>Tradition is the best way to preserve the memory of things?</hi> Which is to make <hi>Livy</hi> speak inconsequently.) But he goes on saying, <hi>that what Memorials were left by the High Priests, or were in publick or private hands were most part destroyed in the burning of the Town.</hi> He doth not say <hi>all were lost,</hi> but <hi>the most part.</hi> This <hi>Livy</hi> alledgeth to excuse the shortness and obscurity of his first Books for want of sufficient Records; and he speaks like a very judicious Historian in it. <q>And when he gives an Account of the remote <hi>Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he is far from confident asserting them, but he speaks with great Modesty and Discretion about them; saying that he would neither affirm nor deny them; being rather built on Poetical Fables than any certain Monuments of affairs at that time, that an allowance must be made to Antiquity; which was wont <hi>consecrare Origines suas,</hi> to make their beginnings as sacred and venerable as they could. But as to such things he would be no Advocate either for or against them.</q> Then he proceeds to deliver the common Tradition about <hi>Aeneas</hi> his coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Ascanius</hi> succeeding him; but he cannot tell whether <hi>Ascanius</hi> the Son of <hi>Creusa,</hi> or another the Son of <hi>Lavinia; quis enim rem tam veterem pro certo affirmet?</hi> Who can be certain in such remote Antiquities? And yet at that time it was thought a great disparagement to the <hi>Royal Line</hi> to have it question'd whether it were the elder <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> because the <hi>Julian Family,</hi> as <hi>Livy</hi> there saith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived themselves from him who was called <hi>Julus.</hi> It is true, <hi>Livy</hi> after this, relates the <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities down to the burning of the City, when so many Records were lost; but we are to consider, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had certain <hi>Annals</hi> before that time, and that some of them
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:62156:18"/>
were preserved. That they had <hi>Annals both publick and private</hi> appears by <hi>Livy</hi>'s own Words, who mentions both the <hi>Commentarii Pontificum</hi> and the <hi>publica &amp; priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta monumenta</hi>;<note place="margin">De Orat. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> and <hi>Cicero</hi> affirms that the <hi>Romans</hi> from the beginning had <hi>Annals</hi> made up by the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> of the transactions of every year; and these were publickly exposed in a Table in his House that the People might be satisfied about them; and these he saith were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Annales Maximi;</hi> which he adds were continued down to the time of <hi>Mucius Scaevola,</hi> who was <hi>Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> about <hi>A.

               <note place="margin">

<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:62156:19"/>
               <hi>Jewish Priests.</hi> Whatever <hi>Josephus</hi> or other <hi>Jews</hi> might say in defence of their <hi>Antiquities</hi> against the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we that own our selves to be Christians ought to look on <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> under a higher Character. I know a late <hi>Critick</hi> in great Vogue among some, hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reduce the <hi>Sacred History</hi> to the Authority of the <hi>ancient Annals of the</hi> Iews, but withall adding <hi>that we have onely some imperfect Abridgments of them,</hi> much like that which the <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Ranfrew</hi> made of the <hi>Book of</hi> Pasley,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 32, 33.</note> which the <hi>Advocate</hi> saw in Sir <hi>R. Sibbald</hi>'s Library. A Doctrine so unreasonable and mischievous in the Consequences of it, that I wonder it hath hitherto passed so easily through so many hands. But this is not my present business. I am now onely to shew the vast disparity of these <hi>Antiquities</hi> in question, and those of the <hi>Jews.</hi> It's very true that <hi>Apion</hi> did object against them, because the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers took so little notice of them. But how doth <hi>Josephus</hi> answer him? He shews, <q>That the <hi>Greeks</hi> were very late Writers of History, and therefore incompetent Iudges of matters of so great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; and he proves that the more ancient Nations as the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Phoenicians</hi> had a most lasting way of preserving their Histories, for they had publick Annals made by their wisest Men and kept in sacred Places, but the <hi>Greeks</hi> were very defective in these things; having no publick Writings in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or elsewhere; and that they had not the use of Letters in the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; and their first Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were little elder than the <hi>Persians</hi> War against the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And this reason he gives of the dissonancy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians, because they had no publick Annals, which would have prevented Errours, and kept Men from a power of deceiving. But great care he saith from the most ancient times was taken of such things among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians.</hi> And for their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, he saith they exceeded all others in their exactness this way, committing the care of these things to their High Priests and Prophets. But the authority of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was not allow'd promiscuously to all, but certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were pitched upon who wrote the most remote Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities by divine inspiration, and the matters in their own times plainly and according to Truth; and therefore
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:62156:19"/>
saith he, we have no such multitude of Books differing from each other, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> have, but onely 22, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an account of all times past, written with great Fidelity and Authority. Afterwards their Annals were continued, but not with equal Authority, the Succession of their Prophets failing. And to shew of how great credit these Books (of the first sort) are among us; in so long time, saith he, no Man hath dared either to add, or to take away, or to transpose any thing.</q> Which is utterly inconsistent with the Principles of the late Critick; for without a liberty of abridging and transposing and inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, his new Inventions come to nothing. <q>But as to the silence of other Nations about them, he shews, that they were a People who lived in great retirement, that the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves were a considerable People before the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew them; and after all he shews they were known to the <hi>Egyptians, Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> which he proves from many particular Testimonies.</q> Now what is there parallel to these things in the present case? Have they produced any such publick and sacred Annals writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and preserved with so much care, as the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> had? Have they had a Succession of Prophets among them whose Books are preserved to this day with great Veneration without addition or diminution? What mean then such strange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons? Can they produce any one Authour contemporary with <hi>Fergus I.</hi> and his Successours, who mention that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession? As <hi>Josephus</hi> brings the <hi>Egyptian, Phoenician, Chaldean</hi> Writers to attest the Story of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) As to the <hi>Greek</hi> Antiquities he saith <hi>the</hi> Greeks <hi>could have no Records for many hundreds of years before they wrote.</hi> And what follows,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great uncertainty in the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> till that time? For which reason <hi>Varro,</hi>

for the utmost Eastern Nations the</hi> Chineses, <hi>and the utmost Western the</hi> Irish <hi>have preserved their Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties far beyond the time which</hi> Varro <hi>allows for true History.</hi> I grant <hi>Varro</hi> intended this chiefly for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who made the greatest noise with their <hi>Antiquities</hi> then; and yet <hi>Varro</hi> himself, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civit.

And in the <hi>Fabulous times,</hi> he might endeavour to pick out what <hi>Antiquities</hi> he thought came nearests to History. As to the <hi>Chineses,</hi> they are very remote from us, and we have had different accounts of them, as appears by comparing <hi>Gonsales Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi> and <hi>Martinius</hi> together;<note place="margin">Mendoza de Reg.

Which the World hath since in great measure received by <hi>Martinius,</hi> both in his description of the Countrey, and the <hi>first Decad</hi> of the <hi>History</hi> from the beginning of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the Nativity of Christ. But their way of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Antiquities was peculiar to themselves, and therefore these cannot very well be made a Parallel for the <hi>Scotish</hi> or <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Antiquities. Martinius</hi> hath indeed given a very plausible Account of the remote Antiquities of <hi>China,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Martin. Sinic. Histor. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 12.20.</note> but in such a manner as shews that even the <hi>Chineses</hi> had a <hi>dark and fabulous time</hi> as well as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and he tells us, <hi>that themselves acknowledge that before the Reign of</hi> Fohius <hi>they have no certain account of things because then they had no use of Letters;</hi> but afterwards, they look upon the Succession of their Kings as delivered down to them with great Fidelity. But there are two things this certainty of their History depended upon. (1.) A fixed Rule for the computation of Times, without which it is impossible any Nation should have an exact account of the ancient Succession of their Kings. And herein lay the great accuracy of the <hi>Chineses</hi> that they were very early
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:62156:20"/>
given to the finding out the best methods for calculation; and they used a Cycle of 60 years, 2670 years before Christ's Nativity; and therefore <hi>Martinius</hi> magnifies the <hi>Chineses,</hi> especially for <hi>their skill and exactness in the Succession of their Princes;</hi> which it is impossible to give a certain account of without a fixed measure of time; and therefore it hath been so often said <hi>that the</hi> Greeks <hi>had no certain History before the Olympiads.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Chineses</hi> did not suffer any Persons to write History that would, but some of great Reputation were appointed after the Emperours decease to write his Life; which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, was allowed as the onely authentick History of him, and these being put together made up their <hi>publick An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> which are preserved to this day. For, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Persecution of their Histories in the time of <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> who endeavoured to suppress them,<note place="margin">Martin. Sinic. Hist. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 241.</note> that he might be thought the Founder of the Empire; yet his Son opposing his design, and many learned Men being banished upon it, there were means used to preserve their <hi>Annals;</hi> but <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medo</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Semedo <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 22.</note> they could never recover a perfect Account of the first beginning of that famous Empire.</p>
            <p>Now before any other Nation can presume to vye with the exactness of the <hi>Chineses</hi> in their <hi>Antiquities,</hi> they must first shew us what means they had for the computation of times, by which we may judge of their Antiquity and Succession of their Kings; and next they must give an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Account of the Care taken time enough to preserve their History of <hi>publick Annals,</hi> as the Eastern People and the <hi>Romans</hi> did.</p>
            <p>For instance,<note place="margin">

Opinion, unless there were some Characters of Time fixed and certain by Eclipses and Astronomical observations, or certain Periods of time, or coincident passages, which might connect the year of their descent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with such a year of the World, or after the Floud. If nothing of this kind be produced, we must be excused if we do not yet think the <hi>Irish Antiquities</hi> parallel to those of <hi>China.</hi> For if there be no such <hi>Characters</hi> of Time which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in comparing one thing with another, it is possible that there may be one or two thousand years difference in the Computation, and yet neither able to confute the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For suppose I should say that the Posterity of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus,</hi> came into <hi>Ireland</hi> just 308 years before <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Nativity,</hi> here is 1000 years difference. <hi>That is a small matter,</hi> you will say, <hi>in so great Antiquity;</hi> but as small as it is, some account ought to be given of <hi>a thousand years.</hi> Now I desire to have some evident proof brought me of some Event in the World which happened 1308 years before <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Nativity,</hi> to which the <hi>Irish</hi> descent must be coincident. To make this more plain by Example, suppose the Question be in what Age of the World the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> War began; we should by no means think it sufficient for any Man presently to set down, it was such a year of the World, such a year from the Floud, so long before Christ; but we demand some certain <hi>Character</hi> of this time, <hi>i. e.</hi> such which agrees to that and to no other; and here, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intends to give satisfaction, will search <hi>Thucydides, Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to find out some undoubted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; as that <hi>Thucydides</hi> saith that <hi>Pythodorus</hi> was then <hi>Archon</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and it was the year of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympick Solemnities. Diodorus</hi> saith, this was the 87, <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and that <hi>Apseudes</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Ptolemy</hi> saith he was <hi>Archon</hi> in the year of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonassar</hi> 316. So by comparing the <hi>Olympiads</hi> and the years of <hi>Nabonassar</hi> with the years of the World, we may come to a certainty in this matter. And besides <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> mentions a great Eclipse the first year of the War, which the <hi>Astronomers</hi> say was 317 of <hi>Nabonassar,</hi> when <hi>Euthydemus</hi> succeeded <hi>Pythodorus</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> Such a method of proceeding by certain <hi>Characters</hi> of time, is a Way to convince reasonable Men; but without any of these to think to impose upon Mankind under a pretence of exact Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:62156:21"/>
argues too great presumption upon the Credulity of Mankind. Thus as to the coming of <hi>Fergus I</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> just 330 <hi>years before Christ,</hi> which the Advocate saith <hi>all their Historians affirm;</hi> let them produce any one certain Character of that time out of such <hi>Annals</hi> as were written within the compass of knowing the Truth of it, and we will never dispute this matter more.</p>
            <p>But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) As to the <hi>French Antiquities;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> which the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate saith, <hi>may be more justly questioned on these Grounds than theirs,</hi> we onely desire them to be as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as the late learned Writers of their <hi>Antiquities</hi> have been, who reject all before the <hi>Merovingian Race,</hi> as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fabulous, or so doubtfull and uncertain, that they make no Account of it, unless it be what they find in the <hi>Roman</hi> Authours concerning the <hi>Franks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rer. Francis. To. 1.</note> as may be seen in <hi>Hadrianus Valesius,</hi> a learned <hi>Historian, Antiquary</hi> and <hi>Critick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) As to the <hi>Spanish,</hi> which are joined with the <hi>French;</hi> what relates to their <hi>Antiquities</hi> before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans War</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> we grant to be parallel with theirs. For although <hi>Strabo</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Strab. Geogr. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 96.</note> 
               <hi>they had the use of Letters, and had some Records of ancient times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them;</hi> yet they are utterly lost. And although <hi>Reinesius de Deo Endovellico</hi> seems to think, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> had some Fragments of those <hi>Antiquities</hi> which he mixed with his own Inventions, yet I can see no reason for it; because he would then have alledged the old <hi>Spanish Records,</hi> and not have fathered his <hi>Antiquities</hi> on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so remote as <hi>Berosus</hi> and <hi>Manetho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if they had the use of Letters and Records a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, might not the</hi> Irish <hi>and</hi> Scotish <hi>derive both from them?</hi> I answer, That the coming of the <hi>Irish</hi> immediately from <hi>Spain</hi> and not from <hi>Britain</hi> is not so evidently proved that any thing can be built upon it. <q>

                  </q> and the inhabitants <hi>Britains;</hi> the conveniency of passage from <hi>Britain</hi> thither;
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:62156:22"/>
which seem to be of far greater moment than any thing brought to prove the Legend of <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Scota</hi> and their posterity coming out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </q> But because this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth not seem to give any account of the <hi>Scoti</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (from whence they certainly went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as is now confessed on all hands) therefore I shall endeavour to clear this Matter, by proposing what seems most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me concerning the first Peopling of these Islands.</p>
            <p>We are then to consider that the most ancient Geographers, as <hi>Strabo</hi> observes out of <hi>Ephorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Strab. Geogr. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> divided the then known World into four Parts, the Eastern they called <hi>India,</hi> the Southern <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the Western <hi>Celtia,</hi> and the Northern <hi>Scythia.</hi> And in the <hi>European</hi> Parts they knew but of two Nations beside the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and those are the <hi>Celtae</hi> and the <hi>Scythae. Those that inhabited Northward,</hi> saith <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Strab. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
               <hi>were called</hi> Scythae, <hi>and those to the West</hi> Celtae; who were likewise called <hi>Iberi</hi> and <hi>Celtiberi,</hi> as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms; and these peopled <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and from thence spread into the Neighbour Countries; and among the rest came over into <hi>Britain</hi>: Which in the Book <hi>de Mundo</hi> commonly attributed to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but by <hi>Buchanan</hi> to <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> is said, <hi>together with</hi> Ireland, (which are both there called <hi>the British Islands) to be situate in the Ocean not far from the</hi> Scythae <hi>and the</hi> Celtae. But the latter were so much nearer in <hi>Gaul,</hi> that it is very reasonable to believe the first habitation here was by the <hi>Celtae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vit. Agric.</note> who came from thence. And <hi>Tacitus</hi> truly observes, <hi>the agreement was so very great between the</hi> Gauls <hi>and the old</hi> Britains, <hi>that although he suspected the</hi> Silures <hi>might come immediately from</hi> Spain, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the <hi>Iberi,</hi> which <hi>Strabo</hi> saith was a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Name, and some of these went into <hi>Ireland) but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, he concluded all the Southern parts of</hi> Britain <hi>to have been peopled immediately from</hi> Gaul. But as to the <hi>Caledonians</hi> he affirms them to have been of a <hi>German extraction: i. e.</hi> taking <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> in the extent he took it in, which went as far as <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and took in <hi>Scandinavia;</hi> from whence in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the Northern Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> were first peopled. It is true that <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls them <hi>Britains</hi> as well as the <hi>Celtae;</hi> and however they were united in interest against the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Galgacus</hi> shews in his excellent Speech
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:62156:22"/>
to them, yet <hi>Tacitus,</hi> we see, makes them of a different Extraction. And these were originally from the <hi>European Scythae,</hi> or from <hi>Scandinavia,</hi> which was abundantly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and supplied other Countries, as <hi>Jornandes</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Iornand. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Get. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> and that they were provided of Shipping very early, I have proved in the following Book, where I speak of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> of the <hi>Picts.</hi> And besides what is there said to shew that those who dwell in those Northern parts, were then called <hi>Scythians, Scymnus Chius</hi> lately published out of <hi>Holstenius</hi> his Papers affirms <hi>that the</hi> Scythians <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the</hi> Palus Maeotis <hi>to Countries wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the</hi> Greeks.<note place="margin">Holsten. Not. in in Steph. de Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibus, <hi>p.</hi> 378.</note> For being tempted by the <hi>Rivers,</hi> as <hi>Olaus Rudbeck</hi> conjectures,<note place="margin">Atlantic. <hi>c.</hi> 3. § 10.</note> having no skill in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Astronomy, and the Woods in the first Ages of the World being unpassable, the People still went farther and farther by the Rivers side, till at last finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bounded by the vast Mountains in those Northern parts and the Sea beyond them, they sate down there, and in time so replenished those parts, that they were willing to discharge themselves by sending Colonies abroad. To which end they accustomed themselves to the Sea, and so from thence these <hi>Scythians</hi> came into the Northern parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> where they had the Name of <hi>Caledonians;</hi> and upon new Supplies coming after the <hi>Romans</hi> had subdued the Southern Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> were then called <hi>Picts.</hi> But of these things afterwards. That which I now design, is to shew that some of these <hi>Scythae</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Adventures of others who had settled in <hi>Britain,</hi> passed by the Northern Islands and went into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and so the <hi>Celtae</hi> from <hi>Britain,</hi> who were called <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri</hi> in <hi>Strabo,</hi> and these <hi>Scythae</hi> met there as they did in <hi>Britain.</hi> But <hi>Britain</hi> still retained its Name; and therefore to distinguish themselves from those who remained there, their Countrey was called <hi>Ibernia</hi> from the <hi>Iberi,</hi> and <hi>Scotia</hi> from these <hi>Scythae;</hi> for saith <hi>Walsingham,</hi>

been, if the <hi>Scots</hi> had come out of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi> out of <hi>Scandinavia.</hi> I know <hi>Bede</hi> there makes the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Languages to be different; but so they might be in continuance of time, although at first of the same origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; as appears by the several Languages now in <hi>Europe,</hi> derived from the Original <hi>Gothick</hi> or <hi>Scythick Tongue,</hi> which is Mother to most of them; onely the <hi>Celtick</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> being mixed with it.

in his own Words. <hi>Quod autem ad Bardos &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neciones veteris memoriae custodes quidam confugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, prorsus perridicule faciunt.</hi> 
               <q>Which he proves, because the <hi>Bards</hi> were an ignorant sort of People, that had no Monuments of Antiquity; and the <hi>Sanachies</hi> were Men wholly without Learning, and who lived by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering great Men; and therefore no certain Account of things can be expected from them. And withall, saith he, since we find Historians liable to so many mistakes after all the pains and care they take to search after the Truth of things, what credit can be given to those who pretend to deliver History merely by their Memories?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Advocate objects,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>that the Laws of</hi> Lycurgus <hi>were preserved in the Memories of Men for</hi> 600 <hi>years, as</hi> Plutarch <hi>observes; and the</hi> Scots <hi>and other Nations have preserved Laws for much longer time, without the help of Letters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is there no difference between Laws of daily Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and <hi>Antiquities,</hi> which depend merely upon Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where there is no use of Letters? And as to Laws themselves I shall onely desire the learned Advocate to give an Account of their <hi>Macalpine</hi> Laws,<note place="margin">Scotich. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> which <hi>Fordon</hi> saith <hi>were composed by</hi> Kenneth, <hi>who subdued the</hi> Picts.

               <note place="margin">Hect. Boeth.

But was it not fit that he who had so many Kings should make a Body of Laws too? <hi>Fordon</hi> never pretends to know them, onely <hi>he thinks there were some of them still remaining. Joh. Major</hi> takes no notice of them; <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi> just mentions them, and saith <hi>they continued long after him,</hi> but how long he could not tell. But it is observable, that when he comes to mention the Laws of <hi>Alexander III.</hi> so long after him (for he died <hi>A. D.</hi> 1285. and the other, according to him, <hi>A. D.</hi> 854) he saith <hi>they were all antiquated by the negligence of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the length of Time.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Buch. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 71.2.</note> Now if the Laws so much later were quite forgotten, how come the <hi>Macalpin</hi> Laws to be so exactly preserved?

which <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> saith <hi>Fergus</hi> brought from the Sacking of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Alaric.</hi> Yet even that would prove that Records are the best preservers of Laws; and one would think no Advocate in the World could be of another opinion.</p>

Now we are fallen into an Age of some Light, such as it is, but whether it will be to the Advocate's satisfaction I know not. For <hi>Cummeneus Albus</hi> and <hi>Adamnanus,</hi> both Abbats of <hi>Hy</hi> not long after <hi>Columba,</hi> have given an Account of <hi>Columba</hi> the Founder of that Monastery; and both wrote before <hi>Bede</hi>'s time. By them it appears that <hi>Columba</hi> came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> thither; and <hi>Adamnanus</hi> saith, <hi>he was the Son of</hi> Fedlimid <hi>the Son of</hi> Fergus, which <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But suppose all this, that <hi>Columba</hi> was descended from one <hi>Fergus</hi> and related to the other, who went over with the <hi>Dalredians</hi> into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that he was there in the time of <hi>Conallus</hi> Son to <hi>Comgill,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to this <hi>Fergus,</hi> how doth it hence appear that there was not another <hi>Fergus</hi> long before, and a Succession of Kings in <hi>Scotland</hi> from him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Irish</hi> Antiquaries reply, that their ancient <hi>Annals</hi> do give a clear Account of this <hi>Fergus</hi> his Race and Time of going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but although they have the Succession of the Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> long before, and the remarkable things done in their time, yet there is no mention at all of any <hi>Fergus</hi> or his Successours going to settle in <hi>Britain</hi> before this time. They do believe that there were Excursions made by some of the Kings of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before; and I see no reason to question it,<note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 464.</note> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the times mentioned by <hi>Gildas;</hi> but they utterly deny any foundation of a Monarchy there by <hi>Scots</hi> going out of <hi>Ireland</hi> before the time of <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Eric,</hi> and that 100 years later than the <hi>Scotish</hi> Antiquaries do place his coming;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 472.</note> for they make the first coming of this Colony to be <hi>A.

            </p>
            <p>The Question now comes to this, whether the <hi>Irish</hi> or the <hi>Scotish</hi> Antiquaries go upon the better Grounds? For, here the Advocate's Common Places of <hi>Historical Faith,
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:62156:26"/>
Common Fame, Domestick Tradition,</hi> &amp;c. can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing since these are equal on both sides, and yet there is a contradiction to each other about a matter of Fact. We must then appeal to the Records on both sides; and those who can produce the more Authentick Testimonies from thence are to be believed. The Advocate pleads that it is very credible that they had such, <hi>because they had Druids and Sanachies and Monks as well as those in</hi> Ireland; <hi>and that</hi> Columba <hi>founded a Monastery at</hi> Icolmkill, <hi>and their Kings were buried there for a long time.</hi> But where are the Annals of that Monastery? Or of any other near that time? To what purpose are we told of the Monasteries that were at <hi>Scoon,</hi> and <hi>Paslay,</hi> and <hi>Pluscardin,</hi> and <hi>Lindesfern,</hi> and <hi>Abercorn,</hi> unless their Books be produced?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> It is by no means satisfactory to say <hi>they had two Books, their Register or Chartulary, and their Black Book wherein their Annals were kept,</hi> for we desire to see them of what colour soever they be, and to be convinced by Testimonies out of them, if they appear of sufficient authority. But if these cannot be produced, let them print <hi>the full Account of</hi> Irish <hi>Kings,</hi> which the Advocate in his <hi>Advertisement</hi> saith, <hi>he had lately seen in a very old MS. brought from</hi> Icolmkill, <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by</hi> Carbre Lifachair, <hi>who lived six Generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St.</hi> Patrick <hi>and so about our Saviour's time.</hi> St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> died about the end of the fifth Century, being above 100 years old, if the <hi>Irish</hi> Historians may be believed; but how <hi>six Generations will reach from his birth to about our Saviour's time,</hi> is not easie to understand. For although the ancients differ'd much in computing <hi>Generations;</hi> yet <hi>Censorinus</hi> saith they generally called 25 <hi>or</hi> 30 <hi>years by the Name of a Generation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Censor. de die Natal. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> 
               <hi>Herodotus</hi> indeed extends <hi>a Generation to</hi> 100 years, yet even that will over doe here. But who was this <hi>Carbre Lifachair,</hi> who wrote so long since? I find one of that Name among the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cambr. Evers. <hi>p.</hi> 71.</note> about <hi>A. D.</hi> 284. and therefore I am apt to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that some body not very well versed in the <hi>Irish</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,<note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 341.</note> finding this Name among the Kings, made him the Authour of the Book. And the <hi>Irish</hi> Antiquaries speak with some indignation against those <hi>Scotish</hi> Writers who pretend to debate these matters of Antiquity relating to the <hi>Irish Nation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 464.</note> without any skill in the <hi>Irish Language.</hi>
               <pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:62156:26"/>
For this Debate doth not concern the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as all the <hi>Lowlanders</hi> are still called by the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers)</hi> and many of the best Families of their Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity setled there in the time of <hi>Malcolm Canmoir,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Camd. Brit. <hi>p.</hi> 85.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had married the Sister to <hi>Edgar;</hi> but it relating wholly to those who came out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Irish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries</hi> think it reasonable it ought to be determined by the <hi>Irish Annals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But will not the same objections lie against the <hi>Irish Antiquities</hi> which have been hitherto urged against the <hi>Scotish?</hi> For why should we believe that the Original <hi>Irish</hi> were more punctual and exact in their <hi>Annals</hi> than those who went from thence into <hi>Scotland?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that a difference is to be made concerning the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Antiquities.</hi> For they either relate to what hapned among them before Christianity was received in <hi>Ireland</hi> or after. As to their remote Antiquities, they might have some general Traditions preserved among them, as that they were peopled from <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> and had Successions of <hi>Kings</hi> time out of mind; but as to their exact <hi>Chronology,</hi> I must beg leave as yet to suspend my Assent. For <hi>Bollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> affirms <hi>that the</hi> Irish <hi>had no use of Letters till Saint</hi> Patrick <hi>brought it among them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actae Sanct. Mart. 17. Vit. Patric. § 4.</note> at which their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Antiquary is much offended; and runs back to the <hi>Druids,</hi> as the learned Advocate doth. But neither of them have convinced me that the <hi>Druids</hi> ever wrote An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. All that <hi>Caesar</hi> saith is,<note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 30. <hi>p.</hi> 214.</note> that in <hi>Gaul</hi> they <hi>made use of the</hi> Greek <hi>Letters;</hi> which they might easily bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the <hi>Greek Colony</hi> at <hi>Marseilles;</hi> but how doth it appear that they used these Letters in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Or that they any where used them in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Learning; which seems contrary to the Institution of the <hi>Druids,</hi> who were all for Memory, as <hi>Caesar</hi> saith, <hi>and thought Books hurtfull to the use of it.</hi> So that nothing could be more repugnant to their <hi>Discipline,</hi> than the 150 <hi>Tracts of the</hi> Druids, <hi>which St.</hi> Patrick <hi>is said to have cast into the Fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 219.</note> But I do not deny that they might have <hi>Genealogies</hi> kept up among them by their <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Sanachies</hi> and <hi>Bards,</hi> who made it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; and so it was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as appears by the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> repeating the Genealogy of <hi>Alexander III.</hi> by heart. But the great Errour lay in fixing Times and Places, and
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:62156:27"/>
particular Actions according to the Names of those Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies. And this was the true Reason of the mistake as to the <hi>Scotish Antiquities.</hi> For the <hi>Genealogists</hi> carrying the Pedigree of <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Erk,</hi> so much farther back, some afterwards either imagined themselves or would have others think, that all those mentioned before him were Kings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <hi>Fergus</hi> was; which by degrees was improved into a formal Story of <hi>forty Kings.</hi> And I am very much confirmed in this conjecture, because I find in the Genealogy in <hi>Fordon,</hi> the descent of <hi>Fergus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Erk</hi> from <hi>Conar</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Monarch, as it is in the <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogies, and that by <hi>Rieda,</hi> called by them <hi>Carbre Riada,</hi> by the other <hi>Eochoid Ried,</hi> and several other Names are the very same we now find in the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy</hi> of the <hi>Irish</hi> Kings; as <hi>Eochoid,</hi> Father to <hi>Erc, Aengus, Fedlim, Conar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ederskeol,</hi> and so up to <hi>Fergus,</hi> called in the <hi>Irish</hi> Catalogue of Kings <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusius Fortamalius,</hi> (whom the Authour of the <hi>Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> makes contemporary with <hi>Ptolemy Philometor.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 114.</note>) From whence I conclude, that the original mistake lay in applying the <hi>Irish Genealogy</hi> to the Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we go beyond these <hi>Genealogies</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and come to examine the matters of Fact relating to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Antiquities,</hi> we shall find no more certainty there, than we have done in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And it is ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by <hi>Tigernacus</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ogyg. <hi>p.</hi> 258.</note>

Is not this wonderfull exactness at such a distance of time? And the late Antiquary confesses he doth not know, <hi>how they came to understand the day of the Week and the Month so well.</hi> How come they to

Which <hi>Poem</hi> begins with <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arn,</hi> and <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Erc</hi> as <hi>the first Kings of</hi> Scotland, but takes notice of Kings among the <hi>Picts</hi> before; without the least intimation of any among the <hi>Scots;</hi> which being join'd with the Testimony of their <hi>Genealogies</hi> and the Annals of <hi>Tigernacus,</hi> and of <hi>Jocelin</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> they conclude sufficient to prove that there was no Monarchy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till the time of this <hi>Fergus</hi> of the <hi>Dalredian</hi> Family. And it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Bede</hi> should understand this Colony under the Conduct of these Brethren, by his <hi>Duce Reuda;</hi> because they being equal, the Denomination was taken from the Head of the Stock; who was <hi>Rieda</hi> or <hi>Reuda;</hi> and <hi>Daal</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Antiquaries say, originally signifies a <hi>Stock</hi> and onely by consequence a <hi>Share</hi> or <hi>Portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Advocate still insists upon it, <hi>that in their chief Monasteries they had ancient Annals kept;</hi> which must be of greater Authority than these <hi>Irish Historical Poems.</hi> This is a matter of Fact, and there can be no Argument drawn from the bare probability that there were such <hi>Annals;</hi> but when they are produced and compared with the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals of <hi>Tigernacus</hi> the Annals of <hi>Ulster, Ynisfallin,
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:62156:28"/>
Dungall</hi> and others which the <hi>Irish</hi> Antiquaries quote so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, besides their <hi>Historical Poems,</hi> we shall then be able to judge better between them in point of <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility.</hi> At present it doth not seem so probable, that they have any such that are considerable, since they have not been alledged by so learned an Advocate for their <hi>Antiquities,</hi> who would not omit so material an evidence for his Cause. And there is a passage in the Conclusion of the Continuation of <hi>Fordon</hi> which makes it more than probable, they had no ancient <hi>authentick Annals</hi> in the <hi>Monasteries.</hi> For there it is said,<note place="margin">Scotich. <hi>l.</hi> 16. <hi>c.</hi> 39.</note> 
               <q>That in other Countries, and as he heard in <hi>England,</hi> in all their Monasteries of Royal Foundation, there was a certain Person appointed to write the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the present times, and after the King's death, at the next great Council all these Writers were to meet and to bring in their Papers, which were to be compared and examined by skilfull Men appointed for that purpose, and out of all one Authentick <hi>Chronicle</hi> was to be made, which was to be laid up in the <hi>Archives</hi> of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries as such, from whence the Truth might be known: The like he wishes were done in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q> From whence it follows, that there were no <hi>Authentick Annals</hi> in their Monasteries before that time to his knowledge. <hi>Buchanan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Buchan. <hi>p.</hi> 392.45.1.50.2.</note> I know, doth several times quote the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Paslay,</hi> but it had been far better to have printed the Book it self, since <hi>Dempster</hi> saith <hi>it was in the hands of the Earl of</hi> Dumferlin,<note place="margin">Dempst.

(or a year after, saith the <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Melros)</hi> now, the very foundation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery is here so late, that no great matter can be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to remote Antiquities.<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Buch. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 40.2.</note> and so we are not like to expect much light from thence. It is very strange that <hi>Buchanan</hi> onely should see <hi>the famous Book of</hi> Pluscardin: For Books do not easily grow <hi>famous</hi> by one Man's seeing them. But no great matter of Antiquity is to be expected from thence, since that Monastery at the soonest was founded by <hi>Alexander II.</hi> in the thirteenth Century;<note place="margin">Apparat. ad Hist.

was</hi> 200 <hi>years</hi> after. I never heard that <hi>Aidan, Finan</hi> and <hi>Colman</hi> left any Annals at <hi>Lindesfern;</hi> nor <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> or his Successours at <hi>Icolmkill.</hi> If any such be ever found, it will be a great favour to inquisitive Men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the World by publishing them, that if we are guilty of mistakes, we may rectifie them upon such great Authorities when they vouchsafe to let them see the light.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Melrosse,</hi> lately published at <hi>Oxford,</hi> we find no advantage at all to the Advocate's Cause by it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> But here is an odd kind of Reflexion either on the <hi>MS.</hi> or the worthy Publisher of it, <hi>as though it were very unfaithfull in the things relating to the</hi> Scotish <hi>Nation.</hi> Whereas I have frequently perused the Original <hi>MS.</hi> in the <hi>Cotton Library,</hi> which is a very fair and ancient one. And those Verses he speaks of, which are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, are not there in the <hi>same hand,</hi> but added in the Margin by another, and seem transcribed from some other Book; such Verses being frequent in <hi>Fordon,</hi> and it may be are the greatest Monuments of Antiquity they have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to the <hi>Irish Historical Poems.</hi> But seeing the first produced by the Advocate go no farther back than <hi>Alpin</hi> the Father of <hi>Kenneth</hi> who subdued the <hi>Picts,</hi> they can afford very little light in these matters. And it had been but a reasonable piece of justice in the Advocate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had charged such <hi>unfaithfulness upon the</hi> MS. <hi>Copy of</hi> Mailros, as it appears in <hi>the</hi> Oxford <hi>Edition,</hi> to have looked either on the <hi>Beginning</hi> or the <hi>End</hi> of the Book; and then he might have spared his Censure. For in the Preface an account is given of <hi>the Verses</hi> relating to the Succession of the <hi>Kings of</hi> Scotland: And in the end the very Verses themselves are printed, and more at large than he quotes them.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Annals</hi> of their <hi>Monasteries</hi> I proceed to their <hi>Historians;</hi> and the first mentioned by the Advocate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> is Veremundus <hi>a</hi> Spaniard, <hi>Archdeacon of St.</hi> Andrews, A. D. 1076. <hi>who dedicated his History to</hi> Malcolm Canmoir;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>and in his Epistle appeals to the</hi> Druids <hi>and Monks and the Monuments of Antiquity kept by them in the Isles of</hi> Man <hi>and</hi> Icolmkill. This is an Evidence to the purpose, and speaks home to the point. But the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> hath unhappily questioned, whether there ever were such a Writer; and I do not think
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:62156:29"/>
the Advocate hath cleared the point. There may be two things in dispute, with respect to this <hi>Veremundus;</hi> first, whether there ever were such a History appearing under the name of <hi>Veremundus</hi>: And then supposing there were, whether it were genuine, or made under his Name by <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Boethius,</hi> or rather by his Physician of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> who was so helpfull to him, saith <hi>Dempster, in texenda Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storia, i. e.</hi> in weaving the Materials for his History? I will not dispute so much the former, and the Testimony of Chambers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note> 
               <hi>a Lord of</hi> Session <hi>and learned Man,</hi> as the Advocate tells us, <hi>who wrote</hi> A. D. 1572. goes no farther, nor any other produced by him. But as to the second point I am very much unsatisfied, for these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is very well known that it was no unusual thing in that Age to publish Books under the Names of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, which cost the Criticks a great deal of Pains to discover the Imposture, as is apparent in the <hi>Berosus, Manetho, Metasthenes</hi> (or <hi>Megasthenes) Philo, Cato, Xenophon, Archilochus, Sempronius,</hi> published by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who lived in the fifteenth Century, and was buried during the Popedom of <hi>Alexander VI.</hi> And not onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, but other Monuments of Antiquity were then coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, as appears by many in <hi>Gruter</hi>'s Collection of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,</hi> by those of <hi>Annius</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and by the <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Inscriptions</hi> published by <hi>Inghiramius</hi> under the Name of <hi>Prosper Fesulanus;</hi> which were the Invention of <hi>Thomas Foedrus,</hi> who lived at the same time with <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Boethius.</hi> For, in that Age Men began to be inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into Matters of Antiquity; and therefore some who had more Learning and better Inventions than others set themselves to Work, to gratifie the Curiosity of such who longed to see something of the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of their own Countrey. And such things were so greedily swallowed by less judicious Persons, that it proved no easie matter to convince such of the imposture. For even <hi>Annius</hi> and <hi>Prosper Fesulanus,</hi> as well as <hi>Veremundus</hi> have had their <hi>Advocates</hi> to plead for them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We find as to the <hi>Scotish Antiquities</hi> many such Authours pretended to, who never wrote concerning them.

Is it then any wonder, that <hi>Veremundus</hi> should be reckon'd among the rest?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) No such Authour was known to <hi>Fordon,</hi> as far as appears by his History; and he is very punctual in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Authours he makes use of, and sometimes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes large passages out of them; as out of <hi>Baldredus,</hi> as he calls him, and <hi>Turgot</hi>'s Life of <hi>Malcolm, &amp;c.

I do not therefore deny that <hi>Fordon</hi> doth appeal to <hi>Chronicles</hi> before him; but I think the Argument so much stronger against <hi>Veremundus;</hi> when one who gathered all he could meet with never once takes notice of him, as far as I can find.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>William Elphinston,</hi> (Chancellour of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist.

<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:62156:30"/>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> as others had done before him; or rather, just as <hi>Fordon</hi> had set it down. For there is very little variation from him in all the first Book, onely the eighth Chapter in <hi>Fordon</hi> is very much contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the fifteenth about <hi>Gathelus</hi> his building the City <hi>Brigantia</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> is transposed, another Chapter being set before it. In the seventeenth he follows <hi>Fordon</hi> exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Posterity of <hi>Gathelus</hi> coming into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and whereas <hi>Fordon</hi> onely quotes <hi>Grossum Caput</hi> for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that</hi> Scotia <hi>had its Name from</hi> Scota, <hi>the most noble Person in that Colony;</hi> he saith <hi>it was in some</hi> Chronica; but what <hi>Chronica</hi> was ever written by <hi>Grost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scotichron. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> deserves to be enquired. For it is certain <hi>Fordon</hi> quotes him in other Places about <hi>Scota</hi> and the <hi>Scots.</hi> Which makes me wonder that <hi>Dempster</hi> doth not put him among his <hi>Scotish Writers;</hi> but as far as I can perceive, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read <hi>Fordon;</hi> nor saw <hi>Elphinston.</hi> In Chap. 20. where <hi>Fordon</hi> quotes an old Chronicle which affirms <hi>that</hi> Gaithelus <hi>gave the same Laws to his People which</hi> Phoroneus <hi>did to the</hi> Greeks; <hi>and that the</hi> Scots <hi>to this day glory that they have those Laws:</hi> this last Clause <hi>Elphinstoun</hi> left out; and he passes over Chap. 21. where <hi>the miserable condition of the Posterity of</hi> Gathelus <hi>in</hi> Spain <hi>for</hi> 240 <hi>years</hi> is set down. In some following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he confutes <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the very words of <hi>Fordon,</hi> and uses his very expressions about <hi>the first peopling of</hi> Scotland <hi>from</hi> Ireland, <hi>the coming of the</hi> Picts, <hi>and the hard usage of the</hi> Scots <hi>by them, and</hi> Fergus <hi>his going over out of</hi> Ireland; in all which not one Authority is cited which is not in <hi>Fordon,</hi> and not the least intimation of any such Authour as <hi>Veremundus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second Book he follows <hi>Fordon,</hi> not onely in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things before, but when he describes the <hi>Islands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and particularly <hi>Jona;</hi> onely he leaves out <hi>Fordon</hi>'s Hebrew Etymology, <hi>making</hi> Iona <hi>and</hi> Columba <hi>the same;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scotichron. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> and he saith not one word of any Library or Records kept there, or any old Histories and Annals to be there found, as <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> affirms; all that he saith
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:62156:30"/>
is, <hi>that there was a Sanctuary for Transgressours.</hi> About <hi>Fergus</hi> and <hi>Rether</hi> he varies not a tittle from <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and never mentions any other Kings of that Race; which he would never have omitted if he had known such an Authour as <hi>Veremundus.</hi> And he doth not suppose that <hi>Rether</hi> succeeded <hi>Fergus</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but that he came afresh from <hi>Ireland;</hi> and so makes this <hi>the second coming of the</hi> Scots <hi>out of</hi> Ireland: Which plainly overthrows the constant Succession of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy from <hi>Fergus</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And he names no one King of <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Rether</hi> to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of the third Book he gives an account after <hi>Fordon</hi> of <hi>Fergus</hi> the Son of <hi>Erk</hi> coming into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he reckons 45 <hi>Kings between the two</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusses, just as <hi>Fordon</hi> doth; and he desires to be excused, as he did, <hi>for not setting down distinctly the times of their several Reigns, because he could not then find any Writings about them;</hi> his words are <hi>ad praesens non in Scriptis reperimus.</hi> Now from this expression I thus argue against <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> his <hi>Veremundus</hi>: He saith, <hi>that</hi> Elphinstoun <hi>gave the first intimation of him, and that followed him in his History;</hi> either therefore <hi>Veremundus</hi> gave no account of this first Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, which <hi>Hector</hi> pretends to have from him; and so his Authority signifies nothing at all in this matter; or <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinston</hi> never saw him; for he saith, <hi>he never could find any History of this first Succession.</hi> And therefore if ever there were such a Book under the Name of <hi>Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> it was after <hi>Elphinston</hi>'s days. For having searched the whole Nation for ancient Writings, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Jona,</hi> as <hi>Hector</hi> testifies, and finding no History of the Succession from <hi>Fergus,</hi> as himself declares, it is a plain Evidence, that <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> hath given a false account of <hi>Elphinston</hi> in relation to <hi>Veremundus,</hi> and in all probability of <hi>Veremundus</hi> too. But this is not all, for <hi>Elphinston</hi> doth not onely say, <hi>that he could not find any Books relating to the Succession of the Kings from</hi> Fergus, but he refers his Readers to the <hi>old</hi> Irish <hi>Annals;</hi> his Words are, <hi>ad antiquos Hiberniae Libros referimus.</hi> So that according to <hi>Elphinston</hi>'s judgment the most certain account of their <hi>Antiquities</hi> is to be taken

            <p>The design of the Oratour, was to lessen the Reputation of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Victory in comparison of that of <hi>Constantius;</hi> and to that purpose it was very material to shew, that he fought with the <hi>Britains</hi> alone, who were themselves <hi>a rude People, and had no other Enemies but such as were as rude as themselves, the</hi> Picts <hi>and</hi> Irish. Now to what great purpose was it for him to say that the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> fought with <hi>the</hi> Irish <hi>of the</hi> British <hi>Soil?</hi> Were they so much better disciplined and so much more famous among the <hi>Romans</hi> for deeds of Arms than the <hi>original Irish,</hi> that such an <hi>Emphasis</hi> must be laid upon that? But the Advocate saith <hi>the comparison lies in this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 72.</note> that then they had been used onely to the</hi> Picts <hi>and</hi> Irish, <hi>but</hi> Constantius <hi>overcame them when they had been long trained up in War.</hi> But if he had been pleased to have read the next Paragraph he would have found the Oratour taking no notice of the <hi>Britains</hi> greater experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in War, but of <hi>a</hi> Roman <hi>Legion corrupted, foreign Souldiers and</hi> Gallican <hi>Merchants drawn out of the Provinces to strengthen</hi> Carausius <hi>and</hi> Allectus <hi>in their Rebellion;</hi> so that the Comparison lies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> between the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> alone in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s time, and the strength of a well disciplined <hi>Roman</hi> Army in the time of <hi>Constantius.</hi> And it is to be observed, that according to <hi>Eumenius</hi> his own manner of speaking, if he were to be, understood in
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:62156:33"/>
               <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s sense, it should have been <hi>Soli Britannici</hi> for <hi>the British Soil.</hi> For so he hath <hi>Victoria Britannica</hi> at the end of the same Oration; and in another <hi>Britannica Trophaea.</hi> So that neither Sense nor Grammar do favour <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Construction.<note place="margin">

I have searched the place and can find no such thing; but I am afraid he mistook his own Notes; for there <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks about the <hi>Scoto-Brigantes,</hi> and which is more, he saith, <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>were yet in</hi> Ireland.

In the old MSS. <hi>Glossaries</hi> in the Margin of <hi>Josselin</hi>'s <hi>Gildas, Curuca</hi> is rendred by <hi>Navis,</hi> and not <hi>a little shapeless Boat.</hi> And <hi>Solinus</hi> expresly saith (even in the place quoted by him) <hi>that it was common to pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> Britain <hi>with these Curroghs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Solin. <hi>c.</hi> 35.</note> And such kind of Vessels covered with <hi>Leather</hi> were not onely used by the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> but by the <hi>Aethiopians, Aegyptians, Sabeans, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> as might be shewed from the Testimonies of <hi>Agatharchides, Strabo, Virgil, Pliny</hi> and others. How comes it then to be almost impossible for the <hi>Irish</hi> to pass the Seas in such Vessels? And wherein lies the Absurdity and Incredibility of the Bishop's <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> when he makes them to cross but 13 Miles from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Britain</hi> in these <hi>Curroghs,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate allows the <hi>Friths</hi> over which they were to pass to be 40 <hi>Miles broad in some places?</hi> And how could they be secure they should not be driven into the <hi>broadest places</hi>? If these Vessels then could convey them safely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Friths,</hi> why not as well from <hi>Ireland</hi> to the nearest parts of <hi>Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have another Argument from <hi>Gildas</hi> that the Seas cannot be understood of the <hi>two Friths, viz.</hi> that <hi>Gildas</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Gild. Epist. <hi>p.</hi> 13.2.</note> 
               <hi>when the</hi> Roman <hi>Legion first defeated the</hi> Picts <hi>and the</hi> Scots, <hi>they commanded a Wall to be built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Seas to hinder their Incursion:</hi> which is confirmed by <hi>Bede,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bed. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> who saith <hi>this Wall began at</hi> Pennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun <hi>not far from</hi> Abercorny <hi>and ended at</hi> Alcluith, <hi>and was designed to keep out their Enemies.</hi> Now I desire to know to what purpose this Wall was built between the two Friths <hi>to keep out the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Picts, if their Custome was, as the Advocate supposes, to cross over the <hi>two Friths</hi> and to land on this side the Wall? Did the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> so little understand the Way of their Enemies coming, to put themselves to so much pains and trouble for no purpose at all? And <hi>Buchanan</hi> thinks <hi>the last Stone Wall made by the</hi> Romans <hi>for the Security of the</hi> Britains,<note place="margin">Buch. <hi>p.</hi> 40.2.</note> mentioned by <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gild. <hi>p.</hi> 15. Bed. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> was made in the same place where he thinks Severus <hi>his Wall stood
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:62156:35"/>
before.</hi> And it had been madness to erect a Stone Wall there to keep out the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> if they came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> over <hi>the two Friths</hi> and landed where the Wall could do the <hi>Britains</hi> no Service. But <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> say <hi>they attempted the Wall and forced themselves</hi> a passage over it; <hi>irrumpunt terminos</hi> saith <hi>Bede;</hi> and <hi>with their Iron hooks drew the</hi> Britains <hi>from the Wall,</hi> saith <hi>Gildas.</hi> What need all this if they came over the <hi>Friths,</hi> and so left the Wall between the <hi>two Friths</hi> behind them? But from hence it is very plain, that <hi>Gildas</hi> knew nothing of their passing the <hi>Friths</hi> and therefore must be understood of their crossing the Seas from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there joining with the <hi>Picts,</hi> and so marching towards the Wall between the <hi>two Friths</hi> in order to their passing into the <hi>Roman</hi> Province. And it is observable that <hi>Gildas</hi> saith after the making the second Wall, <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Picts <hi>upon the</hi> Romans <hi>withdrawing grew more confident and took possession of the Northern part of the Island as far as the Wall,</hi> pro indigenis, <hi>in the Place of the Natives;</hi> which shews that he looked on them as late comers, and then newly entred into possession there.</p>
            <p>The last thing I shall take notice of is concerning the early <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation to the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> And here I am particularly concerned to answer his Arguments,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 52, 53.</note> since in the following Book I have rejected the Tradition of <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>conversion under King</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald, and assert <hi>Palladius</hi> to have been sent to the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Scots <hi>in</hi> Ireland.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 112.</note> But the Advocate thinks it so clear <hi>that they were converted before</hi> A. D. 503. <hi>that from thence he concludes that they were settled in</hi> Scotland <hi>before that time.</hi> And it were a piece of very ill Nature to deny this <hi>Conclusion,</hi> if the <hi>Premisses</hi> be well proved.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As to the <hi>Conversion</hi> under King <hi>Donald;</hi> he shews,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is very probable the</hi> British <hi>Christians being persecuted by the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperours in the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts,</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 119.</note> is <hi>from St.</hi> Patrick's <hi>being sent so soon after into</hi> Ireland; <hi>which needed not have been if</hi> Palladius <hi>were sent before thither and not rather into</hi> Scotland, <hi>whither</hi> Bale <hi>saith he went and died not,</hi> A.

But the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> had proved from <hi>Prosper,</hi> that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>; because he distinguishes <hi>the two Islands,</hi> the one he calls <hi>Roman,</hi> i. e. <hi>Britain,</hi> the other <hi>barbarous</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> lived, to whom <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent; which could be no other than <hi>Ireland.</hi> To which the Advocate answers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 116.</note> 
               <hi>that the Northern part of</hi> Britain <hi>was by</hi> Tacitus <hi>and</hi> Bede <hi>said to be reduced into an Island by the</hi> Roman <hi>Wall from Sea to Sea; and</hi> Bede <hi>in other places calls the</hi> Scots <hi>Islanders. Tacitus</hi> indeed saith, that by <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Fortifications between the two <hi>Friths, the</hi> Britains <hi>were driven as into another Island</hi>; but this is a very different way of speaking from that of <hi>Prosper,</hi> who makes a distinction between <hi>two proper Islands.</hi> And <hi>Prosper</hi> could not be ignorant that <hi>Festus Avienus</hi> not long before, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of <hi>Theodosius</hi> had distinguished the <hi>two Islands,</hi> the one inhabited by the <hi>Hiberni,</hi> and the other he calls <hi>Insula Albionum,</hi> which takes in all that we now call <hi>Britain.</hi> But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old <hi>Geographers, Ireland</hi> was accounted one of the <hi>British Islands;</hi> as appears by the Testimonies of <hi>Pliny, Apuleius, Ptolemy, Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Marcianus Heracleota,</hi> which have been produced by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">Vsser.

Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was far from being of the Advocate's mind in this matter; and what he proposes as to some Rudiments of <hi>Christianity</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> before <hi>Palladius</hi> his coming thither, was onely from an uncertain Tradition, and for reconciling the seeming differences between <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper</hi>; or rather for reconciling <hi>Prosper</hi> to himself.</p>

            <p>Having thus gone through all the material parts of the <hi>Advocate</hi>'s Book, I shall conclude with a serious <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi> that no <hi>Pique</hi> or <hi>Animosity</hi> led me to this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, no <hi>ill Will to the</hi> Scotish <hi>Nation,</hi> much less to the <hi>Royal Line,</hi> (which I do believe hath the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in point of <hi>Antiquity</hi> above any other in <hi>Europe,</hi> and as far as we know, in the World.) But I thought it necessary for me to enquire more strictly into this <hi>Defence</hi> of such pretended <hi>Antiquities;</hi> both because I owed so much service to so worthy and excellent a Friend as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and because if the Advocate's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would hold good they would overthrow several things I had asserted in the following Book; and withall I was willing to let the learned Nobility and Gentry of that Nation see how much they have been imposed upon by <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> and his followers; and that the true Honour and Wisedom of their Nation is not concerned in defending such <hi>Antiquities,</hi> which are universally disesteemed among all judicious and inquisitive Men. And it would far better become Persons of so much Ingenuity and Sagacity, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Examples of other <hi>European Nations,</hi> in rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Romantick Fables of the Monkish times, and at last to settle their <hi>Antiquities</hi> on firm and solid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>As to the following Book, it comes forth as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of a greater Design (if <hi>God</hi> gives me Life and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) which is to clear the most important <hi>Difficulties</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical History.</hi> And because I look on a <hi>General Church-History,</hi> as too heavy a Burthen to be undergone by any Man, when he is fit for it by Age and Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="lxxiii" facs="tcp:62156:40"/>
I have therefore thought it the better way to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take such particular <hi>Parts</hi> of it which may be most usefull, and I have now begun with these <hi>Antiquities</hi> of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Churches;</hi> which may be followed by others as I see occasion. But I hope none will have just cause to complain that I have not used diligence or faithfulness enough in this present Work, or that I have set up Fancies and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera</hi>'s of my own instead of the true <hi>Antiquities</hi> of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Churches.</hi> I have neither neglected nor transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed those who have written before me; and if in some things I differ from them; it was not out of the Humour of opposing any great Names, but because I intended not to deliver other Mens judgements, but my own.</p>

               <p>IT is an Opinion generally received among our later Writers, as <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Animadvers. on the Church Hist. of</hi> Britain, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6.</note> one of them tells the World, <hi>That the Conversion of the</hi> British <hi>Nation, to the Christian Faith, was performed towards the latter end of the Reign of</hi> Tiberius Caesar, <hi>i. e.</hi> about thirty seven years after Christ's Nativity. But whosoever compares the Circumstances of those times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the small number of the years between our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Passion, and the death of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> will find very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Probability, of the founding a <hi>Christian</hi> Church so soon, in a place so remote as <hi>Britain.</hi>

               <p>But that which hath mis-led most of our Writers, hath been a passage in <hi>Gildas,</hi> which they have applyed to <hi>the particular Preaching of the Gospel in</hi> Britain, whereas it seems onely to be understood of the <hi>General Liberty of Preaching it throughout the World,</hi> as will best appear by considering, not barely the Words, but the Circumstances of them. <note n="(o)" place="margin">Gild. <hi>Epist. ed.</hi> Josselin. 1568.</note>

               <p>But to proceed clearly in this matter, there are three things I design, concerning the first planting a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To examine the <hi>Tradition,</hi> concerning <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and his Brethren coming hither to plant Christianity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To shew that there was a Christian Church plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here, in the <hi>Apostles times,</hi> and within that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass <hi>Gildas</hi> speaks of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To prove the great probability, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> first founded a Church here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>; I confess I look on it, as an <hi>Invention</hi> of the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Glassenbury</hi> to serve their Interests, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Reputation of their Monastery.

               <p>It seems to be a little Suspicious, at first view, that so considerable a part of the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of this Church should be wholly past by, by the most ancient and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive

               <p>This Church, according to the Inscription on the Brass Plate on the Pillar in <hi>Glassenbury</hi> Church, was in length 60 Foot, in breadth 26. But that Inscription, as the learned and judicious Antiquary <note n="*" place="margin">

And, for a Sign thereof, he thrust his Finger through the Bishop's hand.</q> Which it seems was to pass for the Token of a former Consecration.

               <p>So that upon the whole matter, we have not one Testimony which reaches to the point concerning <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> which is not originally taken from the <hi>Glassenbury Legends,</hi> where it seems there was great choice of them; For <note n="(o)" place="margin">Capgr. <hi>in vita</hi> Josephi.</note> 
                  <hi>Capgrave</hi> mentions several, one, out of which the Life of <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> there is extracted, is said to be taken out of a Book which the <hi>Emperour</hi> Theodosius <hi>found in the Palace of</hi> Pilate <hi>at</hi> Jerusalem; which is a very hopefull Introduction to a Legend; And there we find the History of <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> very distinctly set down, <q>How he was miraculously delivered out of Prison in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>and conveyed to <hi>Arimathea,</hi> whither the chief of the <hi>Jews</hi> sent a solemn Embassy to him of seven Persons, with an Epistle, wherein they beg Pardon for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, and desire his Company at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whither being come, upon their request, he gives an account of his Escape, the house being taken up by four Angels, and <hi>Christ</hi> appeared to him, and carried him to the place where he buried him, and shew'd him the Linen Cloth about his Head, after which he was baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> and was present with him at the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and fifteen years after he came to <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> who sent him over into <hi>Britain</hi> with twelve of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62156:51"/>
and his Son <hi>Josephes.</hi>
                  </q> But an other Tradition saith, <q>They were six hundred Men and Women who were to come over, having taken a Vow of Abstinence till they came to Land, which they did all break, but one hundred and fifty who passed the Sea upon the Shirt of <hi>Josephes,</hi> but the rest repenting, a Ship was sent to convey them over which was built by King <hi>Salomon,</hi> and with them came a Duke of the <hi>Medes</hi> called <hi>Nacianus,</hi> formerly baptized by <hi>Joseph</hi> in the City <hi>Saram,</hi> with the King of it called <hi>Mordraius,</hi> who valiantly killed a King of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> who kept <hi>Joseph</hi> a Prisoner; After which he and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions preached here in the time of <hi>Arviragus.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q>And then follows the common Tradition, of his giving the Island of <hi>Avalon</hi> to them, and the twelve Hydes of Land by the three Pagan Kings, <hi>Arviragus, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Coilus.</hi>
                  </q> This is followed by another Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the <hi>Acts</hi> of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Inquisition of <hi>Lancelot de Lac</hi>; all which is concluded with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Legend of <hi>Melkinus Avalonius</hi> already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. These are the choice Materials in <hi>Capgrave</hi>'s Collection to confirm this Tradition. And if he had found any better, he would no doubt have produced them. It must be confessed that Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> with some scorn, rejects that part of the Tradition taken out of the <hi>holy Graal</hi> about the six hundred Companions and the Prince of <hi>Media,</hi> &amp;c. But I can find no better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for one part than for the other; and for all that I can see, the <hi>holy Graal</hi> deserves as much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as the Book taken out of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Palace or <hi>Melki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Avalonius,</hi> especially since <note n="(p)" place="margin">Pits, <hi>de Script.

                  <hi>Monasticon.</hi> The large <hi>Charter</hi> of King <hi>Ina,</hi> seems to be most considerable, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the old Tradition, as it makes <hi>the Church at</hi> Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senbury <hi>dedicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin, to be the Fountain of all Religion, and the first in the Kingdom of</hi> Britain. But upon a strict enquiry into the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this <hi>Charter,</hi> I see great reason to call in question the Truth of it, and not merely from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude of <hi>Style,</hi> between this and other <hi>Charters</hi> of the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, which are allowed to be Authentick, such as those in <hi>Ingulphus, William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> the <hi>Additions</hi> to <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Selden</hi> hath produced some Instances to that purpose, as in that of King <hi>Edgar</hi> to the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Persore,</hi> which he saith had plain Signs of <hi>three-Labels</hi> by the places cut for their being hanged on; which is attested in a Letter from <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to <hi>Alex.</hi> III.

               </p>
               <p>And the same <hi>MS.

               <p>To that of the <hi>Leaden Bull appending to the Charter of St.</hi> Augustin, he makes a pitifull Answer, viz. <hi>That he,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62156:55"/>
being deputed hither by the Pope, might use the same Seal which he did at</hi> Rome. And so every <hi>Legate</hi> might grant <hi>Bulls</hi> with <hi>Leaden Seals,</hi> which would not be well taken at <hi>Rome.</hi> But it is much more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose which he adds, viz. <hi>That when in the time of</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>III. this Privilege was questioned by the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>because of this Leaden Bull, the Earl of</hi> Flanders <hi>produced such another, given him by a foreign Bishop, which he and his Predecessours had used</hi>; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion whereof he sets down, and the <hi>Bull</hi> it self was preserved as a <hi>Monument</hi> in St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s. But if this were then so common a Custome, especially at <hi>Rome,</hi> why had they no such <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, who sent <hi>Augustine?</hi> To that he gives a frivolous Answer, viz. <hi>That</hi> Gregory <hi>died the same year of the endowment of St.</hi> Augustine<hi>'s.</hi> But, did he leave no Successour? And, had it not been more to their purpose to have produced one <hi>Leaden Bull</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s at that time, than twenty of <hi>Augustine</hi>'s the <hi>Monk?</hi> But he gives no manner of answer to the <hi>Rasure</hi> of the <hi>first Charter,</hi> nor to the <hi>late Writing of the second:</hi> And although the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Leaden Bulls</hi> were not so soon appropriated to the <hi>Consistorial Grants</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Bishops might use them, as Sir <hi>H.

                  <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pebrochius</hi> seems most probable to me, that they were for the most part framed in the eleventh <hi>Century,</hi> when there was Ignorance enough to make them pass, and occasion enough given to the Monks to frame them for their own security, against the encroachments of others upon their Lands, and the Jurisdiction of Bishops over their Monasteries.

given such invidious Privileges to <hi>Battell Abbey,</hi> as may be seen in his <hi>Charter,</hi> the <hi>elder Monasteries</hi> thought much to be so far behind them, and therefore made themselves as great <hi>Privileges</hi> by the favour of <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. From hence in the next Age arose so many Contests about <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> between the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the several <hi>Monasteries,</hi> of which we reade not before, as we have already observed between the <hi>Abbey</hi> of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; between the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and the <hi>Abbey</hi> of St. <hi>Albans</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> And at that time those <hi>Abbies</hi> were charged with forging their <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And when they were so charged were not able to defend them, as was remarkable in the case of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>'s, as it is related by <note n="(m)" place="margin">Thorn. <hi>Chronic. c.</hi> 14. § 3.</note> 
                  <hi>William Thorn</hi> a <hi>Monk</hi> of that <hi>Abbey:</hi> He confesseth <hi>the Archbishop chargeth their Privileges with Forgery, and that the</hi> Monks <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to</hi> Rome, <hi>and that upon their Appeal several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions were granted to examine them</hi>; but by his own relation, they shamefully declined to produce them as long as they durst, and still continued their <hi>Appeal.</hi> But when they saw no remedy, they produced the <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> the Copies whereof the <hi>Delegates</hi> sent to <hi>Rome.</hi> But before they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope died; and the next Pope, <hi>Lucius,</hi> sent an Inhibition to the Archbishop, requiring him not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their Privileges till the question of <hi>Forgery</hi> were determined; and he writes to King <hi>Henry</hi> II. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Abbey.</hi> Things being at this pass, they fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a Composition with the Archbishop, <hi>viz.</hi> That he should withdraw his Accusation of Fraud, in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they would yield up to him the main Points contested as to <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi> The form of which Composition is at large extant in <hi>Thorn.</hi> And the Confirmation of it by <hi>Henry</hi> II. in the other <hi>MS. Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon</hi> of that <hi>Abbey.</hi> Which in effect amounted to the Monks giving up the Cause of their <hi>Charters.</hi> Such a Controversie about <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> there was between <hi>Joce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Glassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> about <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1215. as appears by the Book called <hi>Secretum Domini Abbatis</hi> lately in the <hi>Arundell Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,</hi> but now in a private hand.

a sufficient inducement for them to forge such large <hi>Immunities</hi> and <hi>Exemptions,</hi> with respect to the Bishop's <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> as this <hi>Charter</hi> contains; and that seems to be the main Point aimed at in it. But in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, some extraordinary matter was to be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in favour of this Place, and nothing served so much in that Age, as to amuse the People with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Stories of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it, Calling it <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Religion, and the Place of Visions and Revelations and Miracles, where St.</hi> Patrick <hi>and St.</hi> David <hi>dwelt in former times, before ever the</hi> Saxons <hi>came</hi> (but not a word yet of <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi>) which were very plausible Pretences for extraordinary Privileges, and so they are alledged in this <hi>Charter</hi> of King <hi>Ina, Ita &amp; ipsa supereminentem Privilegii obtineat dignitatem, nec ulli omnino hominum ancillare obsequium faciat in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>But it seems strange that such a <hi>Charter</hi> should ever pass for <hi>authentick</hi> with any who compare the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of it with the History of King <hi>Ina,</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Monkish Historians. For by them it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears what Wars he had with his neighbour Princes, and how far he was to the last from commanding <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Archbishops,</hi> whose Kingdom was confined to the West and South <hi>Saxons,</hi> and had but one Bishop in it till the eighteenth year of his Reign, when it was divided into two, <hi>Daniel</hi> having one share, and <hi>Aldelm</hi> the other.

But such a plain Story as this would never doe the Monks business, and therefore they must have a Legend of <hi>Egwin</hi>'s <hi>Chains,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> there, and large Immunities granted to the Place on these accounts, as they have fully done in the <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>Kenred</hi> and <hi>Offa,</hi> the Bull of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> and the Privilege of <hi>Egwin.</hi> But yet this unlucky charge of Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Brightwaldus,</hi> to <hi>summon a Council of the whole Nation, Princes and Bishops, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Charter,</hi> at a time when there were so many Kingdoms not onely divided, but most commonly in actual War with each other, makes this whole <hi>Charter</hi> appear to be an undoubted Forgery of the Monks to obtain great Privileges to themselves.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Glassenbury</hi>; I do not question that King <hi>Ina</hi> did found a <hi>Monastery</hi> there, where before had been an ancient Church in the <hi>British</hi> times.

               <p>But the <hi>Abbey</hi> being thus founded and well endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then, like a man that hath made his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, who pretends to be derived from some ancient Stock, so this Monastery growing rich betimes, saw it must be cast much behind in Place and Dignity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it could lay claim to some greater <hi>Antiquity.</hi> And for this, the <hi>old</hi> British <hi>Church</hi> was an admirable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

And if we compare the time spent by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his former Travels in the East, and allow him to use an equal diligence afterwards, there cannot appear any improbability that he should come into <hi>Britain,</hi> and establish a Christian Church here.

               <p>HAving shew'd the great probability of the planting a Christian Church here in the Apostles time, and that by St. <hi>Paul</hi>; I am now to consider, the <hi>Succession</hi> of this Church; of which we have undoubted Evidence from the unquestionable Testimonies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> who mention it as a thing so very well known, That they use it as an Argument against the <hi>Jews,</hi> to prove <hi>Christ</hi> to have been the promised <hi>Messias, because the uttermost parts of the Earth were given for his Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tertullian</hi> flourished, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> saith, under <hi>Severus and his Son</hi>; And in the time of <hi>Severus</hi> he wrote against the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <note n="(a)" place="margin">Baron. <hi>A.D.</hi> 210. <hi>n.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> proves from several Passages in that Book. In his time the Affairs of <hi>Britain</hi> were very well understood in other parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, especially by Men so learned and inquisitive as <hi>Tertullian.</hi> For <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> having set up for the Empire in <hi>Britain,</hi> and being beaten by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> near <hi>Lyons,</hi> he took care to secure this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by sending <hi>Virius Lupus,</hi> his Lieutenant, hither. But things growing troublesome here, <hi>Severus</hi> himself undertook an Expedition hither, and brought the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> to such Terms, That they were contented to live beyond the Wall which <hi>Severus</hi> built; where <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Wall had been before. The part of <hi>Britain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Wall was called <hi>Caledonia,</hi> as <note n="(b)" place="margin">Dio <hi>in</hi> Sever.</note> 
                  <hi>Dio</hi> saith. And it is apparent, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were at that time fully acquainted with the Condition of the <hi>Britains,</hi> both within the Province, and without; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tertullian</hi> cannot be supposed to speak at random about this matter; when <note n="(c)" place="margin">Tertull. <hi>con.</hi> Judaeos, <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> he mentions <hi>the Nations of</hi> Gaul <hi>and the</hi> Britains, with as much assurance as he doth his Countreymen, <hi>the</hi> Moors, <hi>for receiving Christianity</hi>; And saith, <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> Christ <hi>was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced among them, and that</hi> Christ <hi>was solemnly worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by them. Tertullian</hi> was a man of too much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to expose himself to the contempt of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62156:70"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> by mentioning this as a thing so well known at that time, if the <hi>Britains</hi> were then known to be no Christians; Or, if they had been such, and were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Barbarism, the Argument would have been stronger against him. When therefore such a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage doth not fall by chance from such a Writer, but the force of an Argument depends upon it, it is of so much greater weight. How ridiculous would it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for a man to prove that Popery is the Catholick Religion, by instancing not onely in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as the Nations where it is universally received; but in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden?</hi> No less was the absurdity then to prove <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>universal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> by enumerating <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where <hi>Christ</hi> was worshipped, if there were no Christian Churches at that time in being among them.</p>
               <p>But there are two Objections against this Passage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which must be removed. (1.) That he speaks of that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which was not under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and the Conversion of it is said to be later than to be here mention'd by <hi>Tertullian:</hi> For <note n="(d)" place="margin">Fordon. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 35.</note>

               <p>To which I answer, That it is true, <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth add the greater <hi>Emphasis</hi> to his Argument by saying, <hi>Et</hi> Britannorum <hi>inaccessa</hi> Romanis <hi>loca,</hi> Christo <hi>vero sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita,</hi> The Gospel had access to those parts of <hi>Britain</hi> whither the <hi>Romans</hi> had none. Which doth prove, that Christianity was then received beyond the Wall, but not by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were not yet settled in those parts; But by the <hi>old Britains,</hi> who were driven thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as appears by the Account given by <note n="(f)" place="margin">Xiphil. <hi>in</hi> Severo.</note>

                  <hi>Dempster,</hi> according to his custome, is very warm in this matter, and saith, <hi>all their Annals and Histories agree, that King</hi> Donald <hi>and the whole Kingdom of</hi> Scotland <hi>did then embrace Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> And is angry with <hi>Baronius</hi> for putting off their Conversion to the time of <hi>Palladius.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his boasting of <hi>the consent of Annals and Histories,</hi> the <hi>Scotichronicon</hi> is the onely Authority he hath to produce: And in his <hi>Preface</hi> he saith, <hi>That King</hi> Edward <hi>I. destroy'd all the Monuments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; and it is somewhat unreasonable to complain of <hi>the want,</hi> and to alledge <hi>the consent</hi> of them at the same time.

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> observes, <hi>It is strange, that so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Conversion should be ommitted not onely by</hi> Bede, <hi>but by</hi> Marianus Scotus, <hi>who mentions the Mission of</hi> Palladius.

               </p>
               <p>But it is urged by <hi>Dempster,</hi> not without shew of <hi>Authority,</hi> that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to those <hi>which were already Christians,</hi> and therefore Christianity must be

planted among the <hi>Scots</hi> before the <hi>Mission</hi> of <hi>Palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>; and for this he quotes <hi>Beda, Ado Viennensis, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus Contractus, Marianus Scotus,</hi> and others; and he blames <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Ciacconius</hi> who make him <hi>the Instrument of their Conversion,</hi> wherein he confesseth they follow <hi>Fabius Ethelwerd</hi> and <hi>Ingulphus</hi>; but he takes no notice, that <hi>Prosper</hi> himself, in his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> affirms the same thing, and the others have it from him. So that <hi>Prosper</hi> makes the <hi>Scots</hi> to be converted by <hi>Palladius,</hi> and to have been <hi>Christians</hi> before his time; which are inconsistent: But <note n="(l)" place="margin">Nenn. <hi>c.</hi> 55, 56.</note> 
                  <hi>Nennius</hi> seems to have hit upon the true account of this matter, <hi>viz. That</hi> Palladius <hi>was sent by</hi> Celestine <hi>to convert the</hi> Scots, <hi>but, finding no great success therein, he was driven on the Coasts of</hi> Britain, <hi>and there died: And after his death, St.</hi> Patrick <hi>was sent on the same Errand.</hi> And, if the Writers of his Life may be believed, <hi>Palladius</hi> did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little towards the Conversion of the <hi>Scots</hi>; And therefore what <hi>Prosper</hi> saith of <hi>Celestine</hi>'s <hi>making a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nation Christian,</hi> must be understood of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> and good Intention, and not of the <hi>Event,</hi> which came not to pass till some time after; and chiefly, by the means of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who went after the death of <hi>Palladius</hi>: Unless we understand the Words of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,</hi> of those who were made Christians <hi>at the time of his Writing</hi>; the Design whereof being laid by <hi>Palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is therefore attributed to him, when he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Cassian,</hi> sometime after the death of <hi>Celestine:</hi> But when he wrote his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> in the time of <hi>Leo, The</hi> Scots <hi>being then converted</hi>; he saith, <hi>That</hi> Palladius <hi>was appointed to be Bishop over the believing</hi> Scots. Not that they did then believe before <hi>Palladius</hi> his coming, but <hi>that they did now believe when he wrote his</hi> Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. For all the Testimonies of such as Preached there before <hi>Palladius</hi> are of very little Credit. But nothing of all this relates to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi>; but to the original <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were uncapable of a National Conversion in <hi>Britain,</hi> so long before they came to settle in it, as will appear afterwards: So that if there were any Conversion of <hi>Scots</hi> before the <hi>Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Palladius,</hi> it cannot at all respect this Place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who speaks onely of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and not of the <hi>Scots.</hi>

               <p>But I do not deny, that there was such a Person in this Island, or that he had Royal Authority in some part of it, or that he was converted to Christianity at that time, or that the Christian Church here flourished by his means. That there was such a Person, who was a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Christian,</hi> is proved, besides the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of so many Authours from <hi>Bede</hi>'s time, from the two Coins mention'd by <note n="(l)" place="margin">Usser. <hi>de Prim. p.</hi> 39, 40.</note> Archbishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> one Silver, and the other Gold, having an Image of a King on them, with a Cross, and the Letters of <hi>LVC,</hi> as far as they could be discerned. But if it be farther asked in what part of <hi>Britain</hi> this King <hi>Lucius</hi> lived, I shall onely propose my Conjecture, and leave it to the Judgment of others. It is well known that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were so well satisfied with the fidelity of <hi>Cogidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that they bestow'd <hi>some Cities upon him.</hi> And <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> saith, <hi>he continued firm to the</hi> Roman <hi>Interest to his time.</hi> And where Kings were faithfull to them, the <hi>Romans</hi> were kind to their Posterity, and kept them up in the same dignity as long as they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they expected from them. Of this we have a clear instance in <hi>Herod</hi>'s Posterity; For <hi>Archelaus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes Antipas</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> his Sons, succeeded into their shares of his Kingdom. Then <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child by <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> was made King by <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> whose Government was inlarged by <hi>Claudius,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Herod</hi> had the Kingdom of <hi>Chalcis</hi> given him:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62156:76"/>
Sometime after his Father's death, <hi>Claudius</hi> bestow'd first the Kingdom of <hi>Chalcis</hi> upon his Son <hi>Agrippa,</hi> then the <hi>Tetrarchy</hi> of <hi>Philip,</hi> which was inlarged after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Nero,</hi> and he continued till the War, and was the last King over the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now from hence we observe, That the <hi>Romans</hi> thought it no ill policy in some Cases to continue the same Royal dignity to the Children of those who deserved so well of them as <hi>Cogidunus</hi> had done. And it seems most probable to me, that where <hi>Ptolemy</hi> places the <hi>Regni,</hi> were the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> which <hi>Cogidunus</hi> had the rule over; not from the Name, but from the Circumstances of those places, which have fewer <hi>Roman Monuments</hi> or <hi>Towns</hi> than any other in <hi>Britain,</hi> and therefore were most likely still under their own Prince, who kept up the <hi>British cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.</hi> Whereever the <hi>Romans</hi> inhabited, they may be traced by their Ways, by their Buildings, by their Coins, by their Urns, by their Inscriptions: But scarce any thing of this nature could be found in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or <hi>Sussex</hi> by the most diligent Enquirers. <note n="(m)" place="margin">Leland. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiner. p.</hi> 398.</note>

The same account is in <hi>Capgrave,</hi> out of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius,</hi> and this seems to have been the <hi>original Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>British</hi> Church: Which <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> hath corrupted with his <hi>Flamins</hi> and <hi>Archiflamins</hi>; and others afterwards made an <hi>Epistle</hi> for <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> but could not avoid such Marks in the way of Writing as evidently discover the Imposture; and when the Monks hands were once in, they knew not how to give over.

and <hi>Diruvianus</hi> (as some call him) to <hi>Glassenbury</hi>; others make them Consecrate the Church at <hi>Winchester,</hi> to which they say King <hi>Lucius</hi> had a particular kindness, and gave all the Lands and Privileges which the <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> had, to the Bishop and Monks. (A Gift that would never make them the richer or the safer.) Others make King <hi>Lucius</hi> to found St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mister,</hi> the Church in <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s by <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> where the <hi>Metropolitan Church,</hi> they say, was placed by him, and <hi>Theanus</hi> made the first Bishop, who was succeeded by <hi>Eluanus,</hi> who went on the Embassey to <hi>Eleutherius</hi>; and, besides these, they make him to found and endow so many <hi>Churches,</hi> with such unlikely Circumstances, as hath made others question, whether there was ever such a Person in the World as King <hi>Lucius:</hi> That being the common effect of saying much more than is true, to make what is really true more doubtfull and suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>But there is one Difficulty yet to be cleared; For all this Story, in its best Circumstances, seems to imply, that there was no Christian Church here before.

                  </q> I am not ignorant what Objections have been made by learned Antiquaries against both these Passages, and how hard it is to reconcile them to the Language and History of that time; Nor that this Passage in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of <hi>Burton</hi> was put into the <hi>MS.

of learned Men in <hi>Cambridge</hi> to have instructed King <hi>Lucius</hi> in the Christian Faith; And that it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus</hi> might be of that number, especially considering that <hi>Camboritum,</hi> or, as many Copies have it, <hi>Camboricum,</hi> was a <hi>Roman Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,</hi> and mention'd in the best Copies among the 28 <hi>Cities of</hi> Britain, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies had their <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> wherein the several <hi>Professours</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> did instruct both the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Youth.</hi> Of which I may have occasion to discourse afterwards.</p>

                  <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath evidently made to appear: But in the next year, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Resignation of these two, <hi>Galerius Maximianus</hi> and <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi> were declared Emperours; and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62156:80"/>
it is generally said by the Ecclesiastical Writers, <hi>that</hi> Constantius <hi>stopt the Persecution in the Provinces under his Government.</hi> So that either the Persecution in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> must be before the other, or it could continue but a little time.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Alford</hi> saith, <hi>there is no other way, but to make this Persecution to have been in the third of</hi> Dioclesian <hi>and the first of</hi> Maximianus. At which time, <note n="(w)" place="margin">Baron. <hi>A.D.</hi> 286. <hi>n.</hi> 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, <hi>a very sharp Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was begun against the Christians at</hi> Rome. Which was about the time when <hi>Maximianus</hi> began his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Gaul</hi> against the <hi>Bagaudae,</hi> and in his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> suffer'd. The Circumstances of which Story are so agreeable in all respects, that I see no reason to call in question the truth of it, it being not onely preserved by <hi>Eucherius,</hi> but by <hi>Venantius Fortunatus, Helinandus, Beda, Vsuar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and <hi>Ado.</hi> But <hi>Maximianus</hi> made then no long stay in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and for several years after, both <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and he were so taken up in Warlike Expeditions, that they had no leisure for a sharp and long Persecution. And I can however see no ground for any Persecution in <hi>Britain</hi> about that time by <hi>Dioclesian</hi> or <hi>Maximian.</hi> For when he came against the <hi>Bagaudae, Carausius</hi> was employ'd to secure the Seas against the <hi>Franks</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi>; But, understanding <hi>Maximian</hi>'s design to take him off, he watched his opportunity, and with a good Fleet and considerable Army comes for <hi>Britain,</hi> and takes possession of the Government here, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximian</hi> had no Fleet left to pursue him hither. This Revolt of <hi>Carausius</hi> happen'd within few years after <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> were joint Emperours, <hi>viz. An. Dom.</hi> 286.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Alford</hi> saith, <hi>the old Writer of Saint</hi> Alban<hi>'s Life pitches upon</hi> Anno Dom. 286. <hi>for this Persecution. And a MS. Copy of</hi> Beda <hi>which he had met with agrees with that time.</hi> But he urges farther, <hi>that after the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Carausius, <hi>when</hi> Constantius <hi>was made</hi> Caesar, <hi>the Provinces beyond the</hi> Alpes <hi>were committed to him, and that was</hi> Anno Dom. 292. <hi>And if there were no Persecution under</hi> Constantius, <hi>this must be before he was</hi> Caesar. But, for any thing <hi>Alford</hi> saith, the Persecution might have been under <hi>Carausius,</hi> or <hi>Allectus,</hi> before <hi>Constantius</hi> came

               </p>
               <p>That which upon the whole matter appears most probable to me, is, That the Persecution was begun while <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus</hi> had the Empire in their hands; and although <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Galerius</hi> had the Titles of <hi>Caesars</hi>; yet the supreme Government was in the others hands, as appears by what <hi>Orosius</hi>

                  <hi>That these twenty eight Cities were not all furnished with Bishops in King</hi> Lucius <hi>his time, but that the honour of it belongs to him because he began it:</hi> But this is making a new Story, and in effect denying the truth of the old Tradition. However I deny not, but that it is as certain that <hi>King</hi> Lucius <hi>settled Bishops here,</hi> as that he was converted by <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus</hi>; For the same Authours deliver both. But how far his Power extended, and consequently how many <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> had Episcopal Government then settled in them, is now impossible to be known. As to the <hi>twenty eight Cities among the</hi> Britains, the Tradition doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Credit of <hi>Geffrey</hi> or <hi>Nennius</hi>; For <hi>Bede</hi> and before him <hi>Gildas</hi> say the same thing, viz. <hi>That there were so many Cities among the</hi> Britains, <hi>while the</hi> Romans <hi>had Power here,</hi> which I see no cause to doubt but they were <hi>Cities</hi> made by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or by the <hi>Britains</hi> in imitation of them, as I shall prove in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Discourse.

As far then as we suppose them to be reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and prudent, these things may justly be supposed

concerning them, so that setting aside the name of <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> and <hi>Archiflamins,</hi> for which there is no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all (as to either among the <hi>Druids,</hi> and not for the latter word among the <hi>Romans</hi>) yet the thing it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self hath no such absurdity or improbability in it.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62156:87"/>
this latter part was repealed, as <hi>Binius</hi> confesses, by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which referr'd this matter to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> There were <hi>Canons</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Bishops, Priests and Deacons. (1.) To <hi>Bishops,</hi> and those were four: (1.) <hi>That no Bishop should tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon another,</hi> Can. 17. which <hi>Albaspineus</hi> well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets of invading another's <hi>Diocese.</hi> (2.) <hi>As to travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Bishops, that they should be allow'd to perform Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Offices in the City they came unto,</hi> Can. 19. (3.) <hi>That no Bishop should consecrate another alone, but he ought to take seven with him, or at least three,</hi> Can. 20. Which shews the number of Bishops then in the Western <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> and so in <hi>Britain</hi> at that time. The <hi>Nicene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> C. 4. takes notice onely of <hi>three Bishops</hi> as necessary to be present, because many Eastern <hi>Provinces</hi> had not <hi>seven</hi>; as <hi>Christianus Lupus</hi> observes on that <hi>Canon.</hi> In an <hi>African</hi> Council in <hi>Cresconius</hi> we find, <hi>That because two had presumed to consecrate a Bishop, they desire that twelve may be present</hi>; But <hi>Aurelius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> refused it for this reason, <hi>Because in the Province of</hi> Tripolis <hi>there were but five Bishops.</hi> Therefore when the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> appoints <hi>seven,</hi> it doth suppose these <hi>Provinces</hi> to have a greater number of <hi>Bishops.</hi> (4.) <hi>That if any were proved to have been</hi> Traditores <hi>in the Time of Persecution,</hi> i. e. to have given up the Sacred Books or Vessels, <hi>or to have betrayed their Brethren, and this proved by Authentick Acts; Then they were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi> However <hi>their Ordinations are declared to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi> Can. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As to inferiour Clergy; (1.) <hi>Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is denounced against those that put out money to use,</hi> Can. 12. (2.) <hi>That they were not to forsake the Churches where they were ordained,</hi> Can. 2. And Deprivation is threatned on that account, <hi>Can.</hi> 21. (3.) <hi>The Deacons are forbidden to celebrate the Lord's Supper,</hi> there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Offering,</hi> Can. 15.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) As to <hi>Lay Communion:</hi> (1.) <hi>Those that refuse to continue in their Employment as Souldiers, now the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution was over, were to be suspended Communion,</hi> Can. 3.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62156:88"/>
The words are, <hi>de his qui Arma projiciunt in Pace.</hi> Of which some do hardly make tolerable sense. <hi>Binius</hi> saith it must be read <hi>in Bello.</hi> But nothing can be more contrary to <hi>Peace</hi> than <hi>War</hi>; How then should such a mistake happen? <hi>Albaspineus</hi> saith, <hi>It is against those who refuse to be Souldiers in time of Peace: Baronius</hi> saith, <hi>It is against them that apostatize in time of Peace</hi>; But if a Metaphorical Sense will be allow'd, that which seems most probable is, That many Christians, now the Persecution was over, neglected that Care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and that Strictness of Discipline which they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before; And therefore such are here threatned, if not to be thrown out, yet to be debarr'd Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till they had recover'd themselves. And much to this purpose <hi>Josephus Aegyptius</hi> and <hi>Joh. Antiochenus</hi> do understand the 12. <hi>Can.</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> But if a Metaphorical Sense be thought too hard; Then, I suppose, the meaning is, against those who renounced being Souldiers, as much now in time of the <hi>Churches Peace,</hi> as under <hi>Persecution,</hi> when they could not be Souldiers without committing <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as appear'd in the Persecution of <hi>Licinius</hi> and others. <hi>Constantine,</hi> as <note n="(t)" place="margin">Euseb. <hi>de vit.</hi> Const. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, <hi>gave them all leave to forsake their Employment that would.</hi> But the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> might well apprehend, That if all <hi>Christians</hi> renounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Souldiers,</hi> They must still have an Army of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, whatever the Emperours were; And therefore they had reason to make such a <hi>Canon</hi> as this, since the <hi>Christians</hi> ever thought it lawfull to serve in the <hi>Wars</hi>; Provided no <hi>Idolatrous Acts</hi> were imposed, which was frequently done on purpose by the <hi>Persecutours,</hi> as <hi>Maximianus, Licinius, Julian,</hi> &amp;c. And this I think the true meaning of this difficult <hi>Canon.</hi> (2.) <hi>For those who drove the Chariots in Races, and acted on Theatres, as long as they continued so to doe</hi>; There being so many Occasions of Idolatry in both of them, <hi>They were to be cast out of Communion,</hi> Can. 4, 5. (3.) <hi>That those who were Christians and made Governours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places should carry with them the communicatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their own Bishop, and not be debarr'd Communion, unless they acted against the Discipline of the Church.</hi> This I take to be the meaning of <hi>Can.</hi> 7. (4.) <hi>That those
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62156:88"/>
who were received into the Church in their weakness should have Imposition of hands afterwards,</hi> Can. 6. (5.) <hi>That those who brought Testimonials from Confessours should be bound to take communicatory Letters from their Bishop,</hi> Can. 9. (6.) <hi>That those who found their Wives in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, should be advised not to marry again while they did live,</hi> Can. 10. (7.) <hi>That those young Women who did marry Infidels should for a time be suspended Communion,</hi> Can. 11. (8.) <hi>That those who falsly accused their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should not be admitted to Communion as long as they lived,</hi> Can. 14. (9.) <hi>That none who were excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one place should be absolved in another,</hi> Can. 16. (10.) <hi>That no Apostate should be admitted to Communion in Sickness; But they ought to wait till they recover'd and shew'd amendment,</hi> Can. 22. (11.) <hi>That those who were baptized in the Faith of the Holy Trinity should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized,</hi> Can. 8. And this was the <hi>Canon</hi> which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> on all occasions pressed upon the <hi>Donatists,</hi> as <hi>Sirmondus</hi> and <hi>Launoy</hi> think; And therefore they suppose this Council to be called so often a <hi>Plenary</hi> and <hi>Vniversal Council,</hi> not from the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but from the <hi>Provinces</hi> out of which they came; And so it was the first <hi>General Council</hi> of the <hi>Western Church.</hi>

which are very imperfect and confused in the best Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, do not discover any of the <hi>British</hi> Bishops to have been there present, yet there are many Probabilities to induce us to believe that they were. For (1.) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> declares, that his Design was, to have as full an Appearance of Bishops there from all parts as he could well get together.

               <p>For the <hi>New Canons</hi> about <hi>Lay Communion,</hi> they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned the <hi>Lapsed</hi> in times of <hi>Persecution.</hi> As (1.) <hi>If they were onely Catechumens, that for three years they should remain in the lowest Form, not being admitted to join in any Prayers of the Church, but onely to hear the Lessons read, and the Instructions that were there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Can. 14.

(4.) <hi>If persons happen'd to be in danger of Death before they had passed through all the methods of the Churches Discipline, they were not to be denyed the Eucharist; But if they recover, they were to be reduced to the state of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents,</hi> Can. 13.

About <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Consecration of Bishops.</hi> The <hi>Canon</hi> is, <hi>That a Bishop ought chiefly to be constituted by all the Bishops in the Province; But if this be too difficult, either through urgent Occasions, or the length of the way, yet three must be present for that purpose, and have the Consent of the absent under their Hands, and so to make the Consecration. But the Confirmation of all things done in the Province must be reserved to the Metropolitane,</hi> Can. 4. By this <hi>Canon</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church came now to be settled under <hi>Constantine,</hi> and with his <hi>Approbation.</hi> And here we find, That every <hi>Province</hi> had a number of Bishops within it self, who were to take care of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government</hi> of it, but so as the consent of the <hi>Metropolitane</hi> were obtained: So that the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> as to the chief <hi>Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of every <hi>Province,</hi> are hereby secured; For the last Clause doth not merely refer to the <hi>Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi>; But takes in that, with other <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Province.</hi> The onely difficulty lies in the first Clause, What is meant by the Bishops of the Province, <hi>constituting a new Bishop</hi>; Whether the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> is hereby devolved to them, or whether it be onely the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Consecration</hi> upon the <hi>Election</hi> of the People? Which is therefore here fit to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, because the ancient Practice of the <hi>British</hi> Churches may from hence be gathered; which we may justly presume was agreeable to the <hi>Nicene Canon.</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62156:93"/>
And because the signification of the Greek word is ambiguous, we shall first see, what Sense the Greek Writers do put upon it. <hi>Balsamon</hi> interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is <hi>chusing by Suffrage</hi>; And he in plain terms saith, by this Canon, <hi>the right of Election was taken from the People, and given to the Bishops of the Province.</hi> And it is not <hi>Balsamon</hi> alone, as some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that was of that Opinion, but <hi>Zonaras, Aristenus, Matthaeus Blastares,</hi> as any one may find. But we are told, <hi>If they are all of that mind, they are greatly mistaken, because this Council, in their Synodical Epistle to those of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>declare their Iudgment,</hi> 
                  <note n="(x)" place="margin">Socrat. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That if any Bishops decease, others reconciled to the Church may be admitted in their room, if they be worthy, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do chuse them,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. One would think by this, That the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> had put this matter wholly into the <hi>Peoples hands,</hi> but if we look into that <hi>Synodical Epistle,</hi> we shall find it much otherwise. For the case was this. The Council declares their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards those that had been made Bishops and Priests in the <hi>Meletian Schism,</hi> allowing their <hi>Orders</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due Submission, but not to exercise any <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> to the prejudice of those in Possession; But if any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops died, those <hi>Meletian Bishops</hi> might succeed, but with these three Provisoes. (1.) <hi>That they be judged worthy</hi>; By whom? by the People? No certainly; For then there had been no need of the following Clause, but this Judgment belonged to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> according to this <hi>Canon.</hi> (2.) <hi>If the People chuse them?</hi> What People? The <hi>Meletian party?</hi> No; They are excluded, because of their being in <hi>Schism,</hi> from having any thing to doe in the Choice, although they were admitted to <hi>Communion.</hi> For they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to put up the names of the Persons to be chosen, or to hold up their hands</hi>; And so all <hi>right of Suffrage</hi> was taken from them on the account of their <hi>Schism</hi>; So that what right of choice was in the People, it was onely in the sound and untainted Party, and, after all, it was no more but a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> by the People; For the true <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> was still in the <hi>Bishops.</hi> For (3.) all this signified nothing without the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Bishop of Alexandria,</hi> which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62156:93"/>
immediately follows the other. And is it a fair thing to mention that <hi>Clause onely</hi> in the middle, and to leave out the two other, which reduce it to a bare <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> and the <hi>Meletian party</hi> excluded too? Would those who contend among us for <hi>popular Elections</hi> like them upon these terms? It is one thing for the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>propose</hi> or <hi>nominate</hi> Persons to be chosen; And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them to have the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Election:</hi> And it is one thing for a Person chosen to have the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the People,</hi> and another for them to have <hi>the Power to reject him,</hi> because he doth not please them: And again, it is one thing for the People to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enjoy <hi>some Privileges</hi> till the Inconveniences of them have made them be taken away by just Laws: And another for them to challenge such <hi>a right as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> in themselves, and without which there lies no obligation on them to submit. If these things were better understood, it would allay some mens heats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these matters; For granting that in the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the People had the liberty of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing names, or objecting against the Persons to be chosen; And although their consent were generally desired, yet all this doth not put the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> in them; For all that they could doe signified nothing without the Consent of the Bishops and <hi>Metropolitane</hi>; and none are properly said <hi>to chuse</hi> but those upon whose Judgment the Determination depends, the rest do but <hi>propose</hi> and <hi>offer Persons</hi> to be chosen. So that the utmost the <hi>People</hi> could have by this <hi>Canon</hi> was a <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Nomination</hi>; Which upon Seditions and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults was justly alter'd: And there can be no Plea for resuming it, unless it be proved to be a <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Right,</hi> which can never be done, nor is it so much as pretended by those who seem to court the Peoples favour, by pleading for <hi>popular Elections</hi> at this day from the <hi>Precedents</hi> of former times.</p>
               <p>But I will not deny the People then had a farther <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Exception</hi> against the <hi>Persons chosen,</hi> but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were considered as <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and not as <hi>Judges:</hi> If their <hi>Exceptions</hi> were just and well proved, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> as <hi>Judges</hi> were to proceed <hi>canonically</hi> against them, and then they went to a new <hi>Nomination,</hi> but still the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62156:94"/>
Judgment rested in the <hi>provincial Synod.</hi> So in the 16 <hi>Canon</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> it is provided, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the People chuse one actually a Bishop, yet if he takes Possession of his See without a perfect Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, the Metropolitane being present, he is to be cast out.</hi> This <hi>Canon</hi> doth more fully explain the fourth <hi>Canon</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; for here the Case is put of the <hi>Peoples choice,</hi> which is there onely implied: And here it is put concerning <hi>one actually a Bishop,</hi> and so nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no <hi>new Consecration,</hi> but being out of employment in his own See, by some extraordinary accident, is chosen into another by <hi>consent of the People.</hi> Now if the People had there the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred this <hi>Bishop,</hi> from being fully possessed of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick? And yet this <hi>Canon</hi> determines, <hi>that such a one was to be cast out, if he did not come in, by the full consent of the Metropolitane and a Provincial Synod</hi>; And to shew the force of this <hi>Canon,</hi> by virtue of it, <hi>Bassia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was rejected from being Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> by the general <note n="(y)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Act.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where 630 Bishops are said to have been present. The Case was this, <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus</hi> was consecrated Bishop of <hi>Euaza,</hi> by <hi>Memnon</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but it was against his Will, and he never went thither. <hi>Basilius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Memnon,</hi> sends another Bishop to that City in a Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, but leaves <hi>Bassianus</hi> the dignity of a Bishop; <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> being dead, <hi>Bassianus</hi> is chosen by the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and enthronized by <hi>Olympius</hi> without <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod.</hi> But after four years, <hi>Stephanus</hi> is put in his room, because he came not in <hi>canonically.</hi> The Case was heard at large by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and this <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> was alledged against him, and so he was thrown out by the Council. From whence I infer; (1.) That the choice of the People at that time was not allowed, but the main force of <hi>Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> lay in the <hi>Provincial Synod.</hi> And so <hi>Maximus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Antioch, Julianus Coensis, Diogenes Cyzicensis</hi> declared that it belonged to the Bishops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to appoint a new Bishop, as being most compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges, and this was the way to prevent disorder in the City. (2.) That the Bishops <hi>appointing</hi> was not mere <hi>ordaining</hi> or <hi>consecrating,</hi> as some say. For this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62156:94"/>
                  <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> speaks of a Bishop already consecrated, and so likewise the 12 <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; The same case being supposed which is mention'd in the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> And if he were unconsecrated before, the <hi>Laodicean Canon</hi> refers the whole matter, as far as I can discern, as to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and fitness of the Person, <hi>to the Provincial Synod.</hi> And if the following <hi>Canon</hi> 13. be understood of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> the Consequence will be, that the People will be wholly excluded from their Election, till it can be made appear, that at that time the generality of the People were shut out, and the Election restrained to the <hi>Common Council</hi>; which is contrary to the <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> brought for <hi>Popular Elections,</hi> as appears by the instance of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the choice of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> where the <hi>whole multitude</hi> is mention'd, and the <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages</hi> of the <hi>whole People,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Plebis Vulgíque Iudicium</hi> in St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> the <hi>Vota Civium</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> is as much spoken of as the <hi>Honoratorum Arbitrium</hi>; and by the same reason, any of the People may be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the rest may; or at least it shews, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no inherent and unalterable Right, without which all other Pretences signifie nothing, where Law and Customs have determined the contrary. And that the Customs even then differ'd appears from St. <hi>Jerom ad Rusticum,</hi> where he mentions either the People or the Bishop chusing.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Another <hi>Canon</hi> is, about <hi>the frequency of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods.</hi> For in the fifth <hi>Canon,</hi> it is Provided, <hi>That no person excommunicated by one Bishop, should be received into Communion by another</hi>; according to the Council of <hi>Arles;</hi> but then no Provision was made for the Case of <hi>Appeals</hi>; If any Person complain'd, that he was unjustly excommunicated, which it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for men to doe. For this purpose, the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council decrees, <hi>That Provincial Synods be held twice a year, in Lent and Autumn,</hi> which was confirmed by many other <note n="(z)" place="margin">

And although the case of <hi>Bishops</hi> be not here mention'd; Yet the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62156:95"/>
                  <hi>African Fathers</hi> with great reason said, it ought to be understood, <hi>Since Causes are to be heard within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> and no <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> is mention'd by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> beyond that of a <hi>Metropolitane,</hi> those onely excepted whose <hi>Rights</hi> are secured according to the <hi>Prescription</hi> then in use in the following <hi>Canon.</hi> For if any other superior Authority had then been known, that was the proper place to have inserted it, where the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Appeal</hi> is determin'd, that being the most plausible Pretence for removing Causes to a superiour Court. And it is impossible that the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> should have stopt at <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> if they had known or believed, that <hi>Christ</hi> had appointed a <hi>Vicar</hi> upon Earth, who was to be <hi>Supreme Iudge</hi> in all <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Matters</hi>; For it would have been as absurd as if our Judges should declare, that all Causes are to be determin'd in the <hi>Countrey Courts,</hi> when they know there are <hi>superior Courts of Iudicature</hi> appointed in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been thought a matter of some difficulty to state the difference between the <hi>Rights</hi> of a <hi>Patriarch</hi> and a <hi>Metropolitane.</hi> But there are two things chiefly, wherein the distinction lies, viz. <hi>a greater extent of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> founded on the Consecration of Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Bishops in several Provinces; and <hi>a Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Appeals,</hi> or, <hi>Judicium in majoribus causis,</hi> even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> have determined them. And since in matters of <hi>Appeal,</hi> there must be a stop somewhere, the onely question before us is, Where the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> fixed it. I say, <hi>in a Provincial Synod</hi> by this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>; for I am certain, it takes notice here of no <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Iudicatory</hi> beyond this. In <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> or upon extraordinary <hi>Occasions,</hi> by the Summons of an Emperour, or a general Concurrence of Christian Princes a <hi>general Council</hi> is the <hi>highest Court</hi>; But in the standing and ordinary Method of Proceeding, (where there have been no. <hi>ancient Privileges</hi> to the contrary, of which the following <hi>Canon</hi> is to be understood) <hi>a Provincial Synod</hi> is the last <hi>Court of Appeal,</hi> according to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> So that all foreign <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> is excluded by this <hi>Canon</hi>; And the <hi>British Churches</hi> had a full Power within themselves to end all Causes that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62156:95"/>
did arise within their own <hi>Provinces.</hi> And it was mere usurpation in any <hi>Foreign Bishop</hi> to interpose in any differences in the <hi>British Churches,</hi> Because the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> had circumscribed the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Provincial Synods.</hi> And this was it which made the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican Fathers</hi> so stout in defence of their <hi>just Rights,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the manifest incroachments of the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi>; and the <hi>British Churches</hi> had as great <hi>Privileges</hi> and as <hi>just Rights</hi> in these matters as the <hi>African Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>

In the former <hi>Canon,</hi> the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> fixed the general <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Appeals</hi>; And in this <hi>Canon</hi> they settle the particular Bounds of <hi>Patriarchal Jurisdiction,</hi> according to <hi>ancient Custome:</hi> So that none ought to violate the <hi>Privileges</hi> which Churches had hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd. The Words are, <q>Let ancient Customs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, for the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to have Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over <hi>Egypt, Libya</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi>; Because the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a like Custome; Likewise in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and other <hi>Provinces,</hi> let the <hi>Privileges</hi> of <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> be preserved; Let no man be made a Bishop without the consent of his <hi>Metropolitane.</hi> If Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences arise, let the Majority of Votes determine.</q> In this <hi>Canon</hi> there are three things principally design'd. (1.) To confirm the <hi>ancient Privileges</hi> of some of the greater <hi>Sees</hi>; as <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> (2.) To secure <hi>the Privileges</hi> of <hi>other Churches</hi> against their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon them. (3.) To provide for the quiet establishment of <hi>Metropolitane Churches,</hi> which last is so plain that it will need no farther discourse; But the other two are of great consequence to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. (1.) <hi>To confirm the ancient Privileges of some of the greater Sees</hi>; which had gotten the extent of more than a bare <hi>Metropolitane Power</hi> to themselves, as is plain in the case of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which seems to have been the occasion of this <hi>Canon.</hi> Not merely from the <hi>Schism</hi> of <hi>Meletius</hi> (as is commonly thought) which the Council took care of another way, in the <note n="(a)" place="margin">Theodor. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note>

so large a Jurisdiction as had been exercised by the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> seem'd repugnant to the foregoing <hi>Canon</hi> about <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi> It is true that <hi>Meletius</hi> after the <hi>Schism</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate Bishops in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in opposition to the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; But the question between them was, not concerning the Bounds of Jurisdiction, but about the Validity of <hi>Meletius</hi> his deposition by <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>; Which <hi>Meletius,</hi> not regarding, fell into a <hi>Schism,</hi> and, to maintain this <hi>Schism,</hi> he consecrated near <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bishops,</hi> as appear'd by the list he gave in to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> after the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> extant in <note n="(b)" place="margin">Athanas. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 789.</note>

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> takes in <hi>Libya, Pentapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Thebais, Ammoniaca</hi> and <hi>Mareotis:</hi> And saith plainly, <hi>That all the Provinces of</hi> Egypt <hi>were under the Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria. <hi>And this,</hi> he saith, <hi>was the Custome before the Council of</hi> Nice. For he speaks of the quarrel between <hi>Peter,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Meletius,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Thebais</hi>; of whom he saith, <hi>That he was next to the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>but in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, all Ecclesiastical matters being referred to him. For it is the Custome for the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>to have the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over all</hi> Egypt. By which it is plain, that the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had then a true <hi>Patriarchal power</hi> by <hi>ancient Custome, i. e.</hi> an Ecclesiastical Authority over the Bishops in <hi>several Provinces,</hi> answering to the Power which the <hi>Praefectus Augustalis</hi> had over them in the <hi>Civil Government.</hi> It is not at all material whether the name of <hi>Patriarch</hi> or <hi>Diocese</hi> (in that sense as it takes in the extent of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Jurisdiction</hi>) were then in use, for it is the <hi>thing</hi> we enquire after, and not the use of <hi>words:</hi> And if the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had at that time the Power of <hi>Consecration</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> of <hi>calling Councils,</hi> of <hi>receiving Appeals</hi> throughout <hi>all Egypt,</hi> no men of Sense can deny, that he had a <hi>true Patriarchal power.</hi> I grant <hi>he had no Metropolitanes then under him in the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi> But, what then? the manner of <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchal power</hi> might be different then, from following times; but the <hi>extent of the power</hi> is the thing in question. Either then the Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> had a barely <hi>Metropolitical power</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal.</hi> If barely <hi>Metropolitical,</hi> then it could not reach beyond <hi>one Province</hi>; If it extended to <hi>more Provinces,</hi> with <hi>full Jurisdiction,</hi> then it was <hi>Patriarchal.</hi> And it is a wonder to me, some learned men in their warm Debates about this Canon could not discern so plain a Truth. But it is often said, <hi>That there were no such things as Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs at this time in the Church, nor any Dioceses here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, as they imply an Vnion of several Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under a Patriarchal Jurisdiction.</hi> Suppose there were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62156:97"/>
not under those <hi>Names</hi>; but a <hi>Jurisdiction over several Provinces</hi> there was in the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> which is a true <hi>Patriarchal power</hi>; and <hi>Appeals</hi> were brought to him out of the several <hi>Provinces,</hi> as appears not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the plain Testimony of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the case of <hi>Meletius,</hi> but by the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> exercised by <hi>Dionysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> over <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> long before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> And <note n="(f)" place="margin">Athanas. <hi>de sent.</hi> Dionys. <hi>p.</hi> 552.</note> 
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith, <hi>the Care of those Churches then belong'd to the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria. If it be said, <hi>That there were then no Metropolitanes under the Bishop of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, <hi>but he was the sole Metropolitane, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was no Patriarchal, but a Metropolitane power.</hi> I answer, (1.) This doth not solve the difficulty, but rather makes it greater; because it doth more over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the <hi>Metropolitane</hi> Government of the <hi>Church</hi> here settled by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> For then there were several <hi>Provinces</hi> without <hi>Metropolitanes</hi>; How then could the <hi>Canons</hi> here made be ever observed in them, as to the Consecration of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi>? (2.) I do confess there was something peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in the case of the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For all the <hi>Provinces of Egypt</hi> were under his immediate care, which was <hi>Patriarchal</hi> as to <hi>Extent,</hi> but <hi>Metropolitical</hi> in the <hi>Administration.</hi> And so was the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> at the time, which is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of bringing the Custome of <hi>Rome</hi> to justifie that of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For as it is well observed by <note n="g" place="margin">Lup. <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.

                  <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Lupus, The Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>had then no Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes under him within the Provinces subject to his Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>; and so all <hi>Appeals</hi> lay immediately from the several Bishops to him. And therein lay the exact pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> So that, I do not question, but the first part of this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> was brought in as a <hi>Proviso</hi> to the former, which put the last resort into <hi>Provincial Synods.</hi> For <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> could not but think himself extremely concerned in this matter, and although he prevailed against <hi>Arius</hi> in matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> yet if he had gone home so much less than he came thither, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great part of his <hi>Authority</hi> taken from him by <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> this would have weakned his Cause so much in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that for his sake the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62156:97"/>
were willing to make an <hi>Exception</hi> as to the general Rule they had laid down before; Which proved of very ill consequence afterwards: For upon this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, others in following <hi>Councils</hi> obtained as large <hi>Privileges,</hi> though without pretence of <hi>Custome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though but named <hi>occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> here, to avoid envy. yet improved this to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most advantage; And the Agents of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had the impudence in the <note n="(h)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Joh. Morinus</hi> apprehending the force of this consequence, makes it his business to overthrow it by shewing <hi>that this was a particular and occasional thing, and therefore not to be made an Example to other Churches.</hi> A twofold <hi>occasion</hi> he assigns; First, <hi>the difficulty of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by Sea from</hi> Cyprus <hi>to</hi> Antioch, <hi>especially in Winter, when it was very possible a Metropolitane might die, and rather than live so long without one, they chose to set up one themselves; Another is the fourty years Schism in the Church of</hi> Antioch, <hi>between</hi> Euzoius, Meletius <hi>and</hi> Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus. But these are onely slight and frivolous Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the <hi>Cyprian Bishops</hi> never alledged the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie, nor did the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: No, not when <hi>Alexander</hi> was unanimously cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, as <hi>Morinus</hi> confesseth, and made his Complaint of the <hi>Cyprian Privilege</hi> to <hi>Innocentius</hi> I. as may be seen by his 18 <hi>Epistle</hi>; To whom the Pope gave an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Answer, as appears by <hi>Morinus</hi> himself: For he pretends <hi>that the</hi> Cyprian Bishops <hi>had broken the</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Canons, <hi>in consecrating their own Metropolitane, because,</hi> saith he, <hi>The Council of</hi> Nice <hi>had set the Church of</hi> Antioch, <hi>not over any Province, but over the Diocese</hi>; By which he must mean the <hi>Eastern Diocese,</hi> within which <hi>Cyprus</hi> was comprehended: But there is not one word of the <hi>Diocese</hi> in the <hi>Nicene Canons,</hi> and these things are refer'd to <hi>ancient Customs,</hi> as <hi>Morinus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth; And he saith, <hi>the Diocese of the Orient, as distinguished from</hi> Asiana <hi>and</hi> Pontica <hi>was not settled at the time of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council.</hi> And yet he brings the Testimony of <hi>Innocentius</hi> to disprove the allegation of the <hi>Cyprian Bishops</hi>; when he confesses, <hi>that he was so mistaken in the</hi> Nicene Canons, on which he grounds that <hi>Right</hi>; And the <hi>Cyprian Bishops</hi> had the <hi>Nicene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> to plead for themselves, as the general Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> thought, who understood them far better than <hi>Innocentius</hi> seems to have done. If what he saith had been true, it is not to be thought that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ephesus</hi> would have determin'd in favour of the <hi>Cyprian Bishops.</hi> But <hi>Morinus</hi> urges against them. (1.) <hi>That they named onely three Bishops,</hi> Troilus, Sabinus <hi>and</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius. But do they not ayer that it had been always
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62156:99"/>
so <hi>from the Apostles time?</hi> (2.) <hi>That no one pleaded for the Bishop of</hi> Antioch. What then? If they were satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the truth of their Allegation, the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> had already determin'd the case. (3.) <hi>They onely doe it conditionally, if it were so:</hi> But they enjoy'd their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege by virtue of it; which shews it could not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. (4.) <hi>The</hi> Cyprian Privilege <hi>was granted in</hi> Zeno's <hi>time, upon finding the Body of St.</hi> Barnabas. But it is evident they enjoy'd it before; by <hi>the Decree of the Council of</hi> Ephesus. And it was not properly a <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi>; For that implies a particular exemption; But it was a Confirmation of their <hi>just Rights:</hi> And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to them, but as to <hi>all Provincial Churches.</hi> So that this Decree is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>Metropolitane Churches,</hi> against any Incroachments upon their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> And so the <hi>Council</hi> thought it, when <hi>it appoints all Metropolitanes to take Copies of it, and voids all Acts that should be made against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is necessary now to enquire, whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had a <hi>Patriarchal power</hi> over the <hi>British Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> before the <hi>Council of Nice:</hi> And the onely way to doe that, is to examine the several <hi>Patriarchal rights</hi> which were allow'd in the Church. And if the Marks of none of them do appear; We have reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he had no <hi>Patriarchal power.</hi> For however some urge the Conversion of <hi>Britain</hi> by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority, yet, allowing it to be true, no man of understanding can pretend to derive a <hi>Patriarchal power</hi> from thence, unless there were a concurrence of <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> from that time. Neither were it of force, if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himself had preached the Gospel here; and settled the Bishops of these Churches. For, by the same reason, there could have been no <hi>Patriarchates</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (where he is supposed to have placed Saint <hi>Mark</hi>) but if notwithstanding, the Bishops of those Churches had a true <hi>Patriarchal power</hi>; Then so might the <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> of the <hi>British Churches</hi> have their proper Rights.

                  <hi>Morinus</hi> saith, <hi>The Patriarchal power consisted in these four things.</hi> (1.) <hi>In the Consecration of Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes, and the Confirmation of other Bishops.</hi> (2.) <hi>In

Yet I grant farther,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62156:101"/>
That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had all the <hi>Patriarchal Rights,</hi> within the <hi>Provinces,</hi> which were then under his <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and were therefore called the <hi>Suburbicary Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> But these were so far from taking in all the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern <hi>Churches,</hi> that they did not comprehend the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> properly so called: But he offers to prove out of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and from the Testimony of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>

                  <hi>That by reason of the length of the way, the Bishops of</hi> Milan <hi>and</hi> Aquileia <hi>did conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate each other.</hi> But is such Authority sufficient to prove that the Bishops of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Aquileia</hi> were of old subject to the <hi>Roman Patriarchate?</hi> We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove this, but the bare word of one who was too much concerned to be a competent Witness; and too much alone to be a sufficient Witness in this matter. The length and difficulty of the way was no hindrance afterwards for obtaining the Pope's consent for the <hi>Consecration</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> as appears by the instance of <hi>Gregory</hi> produced by him; Why then should that be alledged as the <hi>Reason</hi> before? For the Ways were not one jot shorter or easier to pass. But if we compare the <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Consecration</hi> of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> with that of <hi>Deus dedit</hi> in St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time; We shall see an apparent difference in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of them.

                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> relates it, who referr'd the choice to the Emperour; But he declining it, and the City falling into great heats about it, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was of a sudden chosen, being then <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> and so was Inthronized, by the Bishops there present. Not one word here of the consent of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or so much as mention'd; And yet Pope <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus</hi> was as ready to assert any thing that looked like a <hi>Right</hi> of his <hi>See,</hi> as <hi>Pelagius</hi> or <hi>Gregory.</hi> But at that time St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> had as great authority as <hi>Damasus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; And the <hi>Italick Diocese</hi> was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as the <hi>Roman.</hi> If <hi>the length and difficulty of the Way</hi> were the true Reason why St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> did not go to <hi>Rome</hi>; yet why no Messenger sent? Why no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent from the Pope to declare his consent? But then the Extent of the <hi>Roman Diocese</hi> was better understood,

(3.) That the Law of <hi>Theodosius</hi> was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally designed to restore the Canonical Discipline and the Authority of provincial Synods.

to the Bishops of <hi>Rome?</hi> If not, then they were not within the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate: If they did, we expect the proof of it by the <hi>practice.</hi> No, he confesseth, <hi>the practice was different; But still they had the patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Right.</hi> How so? <hi>Yes,</hi> saith he, <hi>That is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>was Patriarch of the West.</hi> This way of proving may be good against <hi>De Marca,</hi> who had granted the Pope to be the <hi>Western Patriarch</hi>; but it is ridiculous to those that deny it.</p>

                  <hi>Garnerius,</hi> that I shall say no more of it: Onely that from hence the ancient <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Metropolitane Churches</hi> do more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, because it was so long before this <hi>Badge</hi> of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> was received in these Western <hi>Churches</hi>; For the <hi>Synod</hi> which <hi>Boniface</hi> mentions, wherein the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes consented to receive Palls from</hi> Rome, was not till the middle of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century: And great Arts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were used in all the Western <hi>Churches,</hi> before they could be brought to yield to this real <hi>Badge</hi> of the Pope's <hi>patriarchal Power</hi> over them. Which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly true of the <hi>British Churches</hi> which preserved their <hi>Metropolitane Rights,</hi> as long as their Churches were in any tolerable condition; And that without suffering any diminution of them from the Pope's <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Power:</hi> As will farther appear in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

much short of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> As to the Instance of <hi>Marcianus</hi> of <hi>Arles,</hi> that hath been answered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; And as to the Deposition of Bishops in <hi>England</hi> by the Pope's authority in later times, it is of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, since we do not deny the matter of Fact, as to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Vsurpations</hi>; But we say, they can never justifie the exercise of a <hi>Patriarchal Power</hi> over these <hi>Churches</hi> by the <hi>Rules</hi> established in the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is said, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Arles, <hi>before that of</hi> Nice, <hi>attributes to the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>Majores Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, i. e.</hi> according to <hi>De Marca, all the Western Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; But in answer to this, I have already shew'd how far the <hi>Western Bishops</hi> at <hi>Arles</hi> were from owning the Pope's <hi>Patriarchal Power</hi> over them, because they do not so much as desire his <hi>Confirmation</hi> of what had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Council; But onely send the <hi>Canons</hi> to him to publish them. But our Authour and <hi>Christianus Lupus</hi> say, <hi>that such is the Patriarch's Authority, That all Acts of Bishops in Council are in themselves invalid without his Sentence, which onely gives Life and Vigour to them; As they prove by the Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria. But if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> were then owned to be <hi>Patriarch</hi> over seven or eight <hi>Dioceses</hi> of the West, according to <hi>De Marca</hi>'s exposition; how came they to sit and make <hi>Canons,</hi> without the least mention of his Authority? So that either they must deny him to be <hi>Patriarch,</hi> or they must say he was affronted in the highest manner by the <hi>Western Bishops</hi> there assembled. But as to the expression of <hi>Majores Dioceses,</hi> it is very questionable, whether in the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Arles,</hi> the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Empire by <hi>Constantine</hi> into <hi>Dioceses</hi> were then made, and it seems probable not to have been done in the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice, Dioceses</hi> not being mentioned there, but onely <hi>Provinces</hi>; And if so, this Place must be corrupt in that expression, as it is most certain it is in others; And it is hard to lay so great weight on a place that makes no entire sense. But allowing the expression genuine, it implies no more than that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had then more <hi>Extensive Dioceses</hi> than other <hi>Western Bishops</hi>; Which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, since even then he had several <hi>Provinces</hi> under

Is it reasonable to think, that the <hi>double Vnction,</hi> the <hi>Saturday Fast,</hi> the <hi>Eulogiae</hi> sent to the several <hi>Parishes</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>Apostolical Traditions</hi> which all the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches</hi> were bound to observe, because they were first planted by those who were sent from <hi>Rome?</hi> But the matter of Fact is far from being evident, for we have great reason to believe, there were Churches planted in the <hi>Western parts,</hi> neither by St. <hi>Peter</hi> nor by those who were sent by his Successours. Yet let that be granted; What connexion is there between receiving the Christian Doctrine at first by those who came from thence, and an Obligation to be subject to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in all their <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Traditions?</hi> The <hi>Patriarchal Government</hi> of the Church was not founded upon this, but upon the ancient Custome and Rules of the Church; as fully appears by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> And therefore the Churches of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> and <hi>Aquileia</hi> though in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> though probably the first Preachers came from <hi>Rome,</hi> never thought themselves bound to follow the <hi>Traditions</hi> or observe the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as is very well known both in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>'s times. But if the Pope's power be built on this ground, what then becomes of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricum?</hi> Was the Gospel brought thither from <hi>Rome?</hi> And, as to the <hi>British Churches,</hi> this very Plea of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> will be a farther evidence of their <hi>exemption</hi> from the <hi>Roman Patriarchate</hi>; since <hi>Britain</hi> cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within those <hi>Islands which lie between</hi> Italy, Gaul, Spain, Africa <hi>and</hi> Sicily, which can onely be understood of those <hi>Islands</hi> which are situate in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea.</hi>

               <p>And if no Instance can be produced of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Patriarchal Jurisdiction over the <hi>British Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> why should not we claim the same benefit of the <hi>Nicene Canons</hi> which <hi>Leo</hi> urges so vehemently in such a parallel Case? Neither can it be said, <hi>that afterwards, Subjection and Consent makes a just Patriarchal Power</hi>; for neither doth it hold as to the <hi>British Churches,</hi> whose Bishops utterly refused to submit to <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk; And if it doth, all the force of <hi>Leo</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments is taken away.

The occasion whereof was this; <hi>Athanasius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being deposed for some pretended misdemeanours by two Synods of Eastern Bishops, and finding no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress there, by the prevalency of the <hi>Arian Faction,</hi> makes Application to the Western Bishops, and to <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>chief</hi> of them, and earnestly desires that his Cause might be heard over again, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging great Evidence from the Bishops of <hi>Egypt</hi> and other places, that he never had a fair Hearing, but was run down by the Violence of the <hi>Eusebian party</hi> at <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> communicating this with the Western Bishops, as at large appears by <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Epistle in <hi>Athanasius,</hi> he, in their name as well as his own, sends to the Eastern Bishops, That this Cause might be heard before indifferent Judges: And to that end, that they would come into these Parts, and bring their Evidences with them. This they decline; Upon which, and a fuller Examination of the matter, they receive <hi>Athanasius, Marcellus</hi> and others into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them. This gives a mighty distaste to the Eastern Bishops; at last the two Brothers, <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Constans,</hi> agree, there should be a <hi>general Council</hi> called at <hi>Sardica,</hi> to hear and determine this matter.

so great suspicion of soul dealing</hi>; And the other, <hi>that the matters which concerned their Bishops, were not to be tried over again by others at a distance; And that this was the Way to overthrow the Discipline of the Church, as it had been settled by the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>and the ancient Canons of the Church.</hi> It is apparent by the Synodical Epistle of the <hi>Greek</hi> Bishops who withdrew to <hi>Philippopolis.</hi> That this was the main Point insisted on by them; <hi>That it was the bringing a new Law into the Church; For the Eastern Bishops to be judged by the Western; The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Custome and Rule of the Church being; That they should stand or fall by their own Bishops.</hi> The Western Bishops on the other side pleaded, <hi>That this was a Cause of common concernment to the whole Church; That there had been notorious partiality in the management of it; That</hi> Athanasius <hi>was condemned, not for any pretended miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages so much, as for his Zeal against</hi> Arianism; <hi>That the Cause was not heard in</hi> Egypt, <hi>where he was charged, but at a great distance, and therefore in common Justice, it ought to have a new hearing by the Eastern and Western Bishops together.</hi> But the Eastern Bishops finding that the Western would not forsake the Communion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> and the rest, they look'd on the Cause as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, and so went away. However the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the clearing the Bishops accused, which they did by a <hi>Synodical Epistle,</hi> and then made several <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> as <hi>against Translations from mean Bishopricks to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Can. 1. <hi>and using Arts to procure them,</hi> Can. 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst placing Bishops in such places where a single Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would serve, and the absence of Bishops at Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Can. 6. <hi>Against their unseasonable Applications to the Court,</hi> Can. 7, 8, 9, 20. <hi>Against being made Bishops</hi> per Saltum, <hi>Can.</hi> 10. <hi>Against their Non-residence,</hi> Can. 11, 12. <hi>Against receiving those who were excommunicated by others,</hi> Can. 13. <hi>About the Appeal of Presbyters,</hi> Can. 14. <hi>Against taking Presbyters out of anothers Diocese,</hi> Can. 15. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Non-residence,</hi> Can. 16. <hi>About the Reception of banished Bishops,</hi> Can. 17. <hi>About</hi> Eutychianus <hi>and</hi> Musaeus, <hi>and the persons ordained by them,</hi> Can. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>But the main <hi>Canons</hi> of this <hi>Council</hi> are the third, fourth and fifth, which concern the <hi>re-hearing</hi> of the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi>; And the interest the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62156:114"/>
to have therein. For the right understanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are to consider the several steps and methods of Proceeding therein established. (1.) <hi>That the Causes of Bishops in the first Instance were still to be heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the Bishops of the Province</hi>; That is plain by the first part of <hi>Can.</hi> 3. <hi>Which forbids any Bishop in case of difference with another, to call Bishops out of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Province to hear it.</hi> This was agreeable to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Can.</hi> 5. Herein it is supposed that they reflect on the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi>'s Proceedings against <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>; But the Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> did not proceed upon St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the first <hi>Instance,</hi> but upon this ground, viz. <hi>That being deposed in the Council of</hi> Tyre, <hi>he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returned to the Bishoprick of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first restored by a greater Synod.</hi> But this seems to have been very hard usage of so great a man; For they first made the <hi>Canons</hi> themselves, <hi>Can.</hi> 4, 12. and out of them they framed an <hi>Article,</hi> by virtue whereof they deprived <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And herein lay the Art of the <hi>Eusebian party,</hi> for if they had framed the <hi>Canon</hi> so as it is extant in <note n="(e)" place="margin">Pallad. <hi>vit.</hi> Chrysost. <hi>p.</hi>

               <p>Concerning which we are to observe, (1.)

               <p>THE Succession of the <hi>British Churches</hi> being thus deduced from their <hi>original</hi> to the times of the Christian Emperours, it will be necessary to give an account of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> which were then received by them.</p>
               <p>And it is so much the more necessary to enquire into the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>British Churches,</hi> because they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with two remarkable Heresies of those times, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>The Charge of <hi>Arianism</hi> is grounded upon <hi>the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal spreading of that Heresie over the World,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> expresses it, and therefore to shew how far the <hi>British Churches</hi> were concerned, we must search into the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of that Heresie, from the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> where the <hi>British</hi> Bishops were present.</p>

                  </gap> was with a design to overthrow the <hi>Nicene Faith</hi>; that the <hi>Eusebians</hi> great business was, if possible, to restore <hi>Arianism</hi>; then it will follow, that some Mens hatred of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> is beyond their skill and judgment in the History of the Church: and the making out of these things will clear the History of <hi>Arianism</hi> to the Council of <hi>Ariminum.</hi>

                  <hi>they put off all disguise, and declared for</hi> Arianism. Is it possible for the same person to say, that <hi>after the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, they never appeared in behalf of the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the Eastern and Western Churches; and yet, <hi>When they put off their disguise, they declared for Arianism?</hi> What is this but appearing openly and plainly for the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine? And if we believe so good an Authour as himself, their Contest after the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> was so far from being merely about the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he frequently saith, that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie did take in the whole Merits of the Cause, as will appear from his own words in several places. As when he speaks of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 358.</note> he saith, <q>The whole Controversie was reduced to the word <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi>; which the <hi>Eusebians</hi> at first refused to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as being no Scripture word, but without its admission, nothing else would satisfie the Council, and good reason they had for it, because to part with that word after the Controversie was once rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, would have been, to give up the Cause; for it was unavoidable, that if the Son were not of the same substance with the Father, he must have been made out of the same common and created sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with all other Creatures; and therefore when the Scriptures give him a greater Dignity of Nature than to any created Being, they thereby make him of the same uncreated Substance with the Father; so that they plainly assert his <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> though they use not the word. But when the Truth it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self was denied by the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks and the Son of God thrust down into the rank of created Beings, and defined to be a Creature made of nothing, it was time for the Church to stop this Heresie, by such a Test as would admit of no Prevarication; which was effectually done by this word; and, as cunning and shuffling as the <hi>Arians</hi> were, they were never able to swallow or chew it, and therefore it was but a weak part of the <hi>Eusebians</hi> to shew so much zeal against the word, when they professed to allow the thing; For if our Saviour were not a mere
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62156:119"/>
Creature, he must be of the same uncreated sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Father, because there is no middle between created and uncreated Substance; so that whoever denied the <hi>Consubstantiality</hi> could not avoid the Heresie of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> which yet the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> themselves professed to defie; for if he were a mere Creature, it is no matter how soon, or how late he was created.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is not be imagined that the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians</hi> should really believe the <hi>Consubstantiality</hi> of the Son, and yet so vehemently oppose the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>word.</hi> Would any Men of common sense, who did believe the Bread and Wine in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to be turned into the very Body and Bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> set themselves with all their force and interest to overthrow the term of <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi> So, if the <hi>Eusebians</hi> did believe the Son of the same <hi>Substance</hi> with the Father, to what purpose should they caball so much as they did all the Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> to lay aside the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; If it be said, <hi>It was by way of Comprehension, to take in dissenting Parties:</hi> then it is plain they were really dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Parties still, and consequently did not differ onely about the <hi>Vse</hi> of a <hi>word</hi>; but about the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And as those who do believe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> are for the <hi>Vse</hi> of the <hi>word</hi>; and those who believe it not, would not have the <hi>word</hi> imposed; so it was in all the Councils under <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> those who chiefly opposed the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> did it, because they liked not the <hi>Doctrine</hi>; and those who contended for it, did it, because they knew the Doctrine was aimed at under the Pretence of laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>an unscriptural word.</hi> 
                  <q>And the same Author tells us from St. <hi>Hilary,</hi>

                        <hi>p.</hi> 484.</note> the Consequence of shutting out the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was, that it must be decreed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Son was a Creature made out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or out of another substance uncreated and distinct from the Divine Nature.</q> And when he gives an account of the Council of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> held at the same time with that of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 520.</note> 
                  <hi>They brake into two Parties, of the</hi> Acacians, <hi>who defied the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>and all its Decrees, and the old</hi> Eusebians, <hi>who pretended to stick onely at the word</hi> Consubstantial: and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62156:120"/>
upon their Appeal to the Emperour, there are these two things remarkable. 1. That those who were for <hi>laying aside all discriminating words</hi> were <hi>Arians</hi> of the highest sort,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 522.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Aëtians, <hi>who held the Blasphemy of Dissimilitude.</hi> 2. That those who were for retaining the word <hi>Substance</hi> went on this Ground, <hi>That if God the Son exist neither from nothing nor from any other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, then he must be of the same substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 524.</note> 
                  <hi>Which was the very Argument,</hi> he saith, <hi>approved by the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>for settling the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This is a sufficient Argument to me, that those who from the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did chiefly oppose that word, did it with a Design to overthrow the Doctrine of the Son's being of the same substance with the Father. Which will more fully appear by a brief deduction of the <hi>Arian History</hi> from the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to that of <hi>Ariminum</hi>; not from modern Collections, but from the best Writers about that time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arian Faction</hi> finding themselves so much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vervoted in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that they despaired to carry any thing there by fair means; betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to fraudulent Arts, hoping thereby to hinder either the passing or the executing any Decree against them. At first, they endeavoured to blind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Council by seeming to profess the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Faith, but they made use of such ambiguous Forms of words as might serve their ends, by cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching an Heretical Sense under a fair appearance of joining in the same Faith with the rest. <note n="(e)" place="margin">Athanas. <hi>de Synod.

               <p>
                  <hi>And here, Athanasius</hi> saith, <hi>they began to open their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in favour of the</hi> Arian <hi>Heresie, which till then they had concealed.</hi> For they knew that Work was not to be done at once; but this was a good step towards the lessning the Authority of the <hi>Nicene Council</hi>; which being once removed, the <hi>Faction</hi> did not question they should be able to set up <hi>Arianism</hi> speedily. They were not so plain hearted to declare presently for what they aimed at; nor to put it to the Vote, whether the <hi>Nicene Faith</hi> should be destroyed or not. For that, having the great Advantage of so publick a Settlement, and such a general Consent of the Christian World, it was not to be overthrown at once, nor by open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but to be taken in pieces by degrees; and the generality were to be cheated into <hi>Arianism,</hi> under
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62156:121"/>
other pretences and insinuations. And the first thing was, to persuade the World, that the <hi>Arians</hi> had been hitherto misunderstood, and their Doctrine misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by such factious and busie Men as <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and a few others, therefore it was absolutely necessary to weaken the Authority of the Council, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by a small number of Men who overswayed the rest; Neither was it safe to begin with the Matter of Faith, for that would give too great an Alarm; but it was a much more plausible way to bring the <hi>Arians</hi> into Communion, as being much misrepresented and not owning the Doctrines which the <hi>Athanasian Party</hi> did charge them with, and being once joined in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together, it would be fit to lay aside all Terms of <hi>Discrimination,</hi> as tending to <hi>Faction</hi>; especially such as were lately set up, to put a distinction between the <hi>Arians</hi> and others. And when these things were done by other Councils, the Authority of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> would fall to the Gound, and, as they supposed, the <hi>Nicene Faith</hi> together with it.

of <hi>Arius</hi> in the first Heat of the Controversie were here rejected, viz. <hi>that there was a time before the Son was, or that he was a Creature like other Creatures</hi>; for they knew these expressions would not then be born; and therefore they were forced to refine <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> to the utmost degree, to make it pass down the better, till the prejudice against it by the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> were wholly removed.

                  <hi>that no other way of speaking doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently express the Difference between the Son of God and his Creatures; which are onely the effects of God's Will.</hi> From whence he concludes,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>that the opposition to these Terms,</hi> whatever was pretended, <hi>was from a dislike of the Doctrine established in the Council of</hi> Nice. <hi>For if it had been a mere doubt about the signification of the words,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> comes to the same with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There were two great Arguments, these used against the term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; The first was, <hi>that it implied a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Division of the Divine Substance, as a Son among Men is said to be of the same Substance with his Father, but so, as that there is a Division of the same common Nature in the several individuals.</hi> To this <hi>Athanasius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <q>That the Divine Generation must not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended like the humane; but our Conceptions of God must be agreeable to the Divine Nature; and therefore we must not imagine the Son of God to be of the Substance with the Father, after the same manner that the Son of Man is. For, as he is the Son, so he is the Word and Wisedom of the Father: and the internal Word or Conception in Man is no divisible part of himself; but lest the Notion of <hi>Word</hi> should seem to destroy his real Subsistence, therefore the Notion of <hi>Son</hi> is added in Scripture to that of <hi>Word</hi>; that we may know him to be a <hi>living Word</hi> and <hi>substantial Wisedom.</hi> So that when we say, the Son is consubstantial to the Father, we understand it not by way of Division, as among Bodies, but abstracting our Minds from all corporeal things, we attribute this to the Son of God, in a way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Divine Nature, and mean by it, that he is not produced by his <hi>Will</hi> as the Creatures are, nor merely his Son by <hi>Adoption</hi>; but that he is the <hi>true Eternal Son of God</hi>; by such an emanation as Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from Light, or Water from the Fountain. And therefore when they interpreted the term <hi>Son</hi> in a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62156:126"/>
way agreeable to the Divine Nature, he wonders they should stick so much at the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> which was capable of the same Interpretation.</q> The second Objection was, <hi>That those who condemned the</hi> Samosatenian <hi>Heresie, rejected the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 918.</note> 
                     <hi>Athanasius</hi> shews, that the word was so much used and allowed in the Christian Church before the <hi>Samosatenian</hi> Heresie was heard of, that when <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was accused to <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for rejecting it; the Council there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was so much concerned, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> wrote their sense to the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> about it, he returns an Answer, wherein he owns all the sense contained under it, as appears by his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in <hi>Athanasius</hi>; but for those who opposed <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> he saith, they took the Word in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal sense, as if it implied a distinct Substance from the Father; But, saith he, those who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Arians</hi> saw farther into this matter; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it ought not to be applied to the Divine Nature as it is to corporeal Substances; and the Son of God not being a Creature, but begotten of the Substance of the Father; therefore with great Reason they used the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as being most proper to express the Sense of the Christian Church against the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 920, 921.</note> as he shews there at large.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From these passages of <hi>Athanasius</hi> it appears that there was a <hi>third Party</hi> then in the Church distinct from the <hi>Nicenists</hi> and the <hi>Eusebians.</hi> The former would by no means yield to any relaxation of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; because they evidently saw that this Design was carried on by those who made it their business under that pretence to introduce <hi>Arianism,</hi> who were the <hi>Eusebians.</hi> But there were others extremely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Peace of the Church, and on that account were willing to let go the term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hoping the Doctrine might be secured by other expressions; and this facility of theirs gave the greatest advantage to the <hi>Eusebian Party</hi> in all their Councils, who continually almost overreached and outwitted them, under the pretence of <hi>Accommodation.</hi> For by this Artifice they gained their Votes, and when they had them, made
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62156:126"/>
use of them merely to serve their own Designs; as appears by the Account the Historians give of the management of the <hi>Arian</hi> Affairs under the Reign of <hi>Constantius.</hi>

Which was a plain Evidence that they concealed their sense under <hi>ambiguous words,</hi> or that they saw it necessary at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to seem orthodox, that so they might the better set aside the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; which being once effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it would be an easie matter to set up <hi>Arianism,</hi> which was the thing they designed.</p>
               <p>This Intrigue was not discovered fully till after the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> but was certainly carried on all along by the <hi>Eusebian Party,</hi> who without these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices could never have deceived the Eastern Bishops, who joined with them till they more openly declared themselves in the Council of <hi>Seleucia</hi>; and then the difference was not between the <hi>Acacians</hi> and <hi>Eusebians,</hi> as some have weakly conjectured, but between the <hi>old Eusebians,</hi> who now appear'd to be <hi>Arians</hi> under the Name of <hi>Acacius,</hi> and the Followers of <hi>Basilius</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra,</hi>

the People still continued sound in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith,</hi> till <hi>Eudoxius</hi> his Persecution began.</p>
               <p>This was the miserable Condition of the Eastern Churches under the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebian Party</hi>; but the Western Churches continued qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and very little disturbed with the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie while <hi>Constans</hi> lived; who was ready, not onely to maintain the true Faith in his own Dominions, but to give his Assistence for the Relief of those who suffer'd in the Eastern Parts. Which was the Reason of the calling of the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> by consent of both Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, although that happen'd onely to widen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Breach.

This Council of <hi>Milan</hi> was assembled on the occasion of several Bishops there meeting to wait on the Emperour <hi>Constans</hi> in order to a <hi>General Council,</hi> to put things in order in the Christian Church, which the <hi>Arian Faction</hi> had so much disturbed. While they were there the four Eastern Bishops arrived, with the long Confession made at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and desire the Western Bishops concurrence with them in it. These express their dislike of any New Confession of Faith, especially after the <hi>Nicene</hi>; but, since they were so free of their <hi>Anathema</hi>'s at the end of their Confession, they desired them to make short Work of it, <hi>to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize the</hi> Arian <hi>Heresie</hi>; which they utterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe, and so discover'd the Juggle of that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming orthodox Confession.

to doe it, they rose up in a Rage and left the Council.</hi> From hence the Western Bishops smelt their Design, however cover'd over with fair Pretences of Peace and Reconciliation.

               </p>
               <p>It is time now to consider, how far those Churches can be charged with <hi>Arianism,</hi> whose Bishops were there present and consented to the Decrees of this Council. It is a noted Saying of <note n="(z)" place="margin">Hier. <hi>c.</hi> Lucif.</note> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> on this Occasion, <hi>that the World then groaned and wondered at its being become</hi> Arian. Which a late Authour saith, <hi>is a passage quite worn out by our Innovatours.</hi> Whom doth he mean by these <hi>Innovatours?</hi> The <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who from time to time have made use of it? Not to prove <hi>an Apostasie of the Catholick Church from the true Faith</hi>; which no Man in his Wits ever dreamt of, but from hence to overthrow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> or such as have been so called. And notwithstanding the opprobrious Name of <hi>Innovatours</hi> (which, as we find in those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> often belongs to those who give it to others) it is very easie to prove, that this one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> doth overthrow not onely the Pretence to the Infallibility of General Councils, but the <hi>absolute</hi> binding <hi>Authority</hi> of any, till after due examination of the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi>

of their Proceedings. For it is apparent by the whole Series of the Story, as I have faithfully deduced it, that the whole Design of the <hi>Arian</hi> Party was to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Authority of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; which they were never able to compass by a <hi>General Council</hi> till this of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> agreeing as they declared with the Eastern Bishops. So that here was a Consent both of the Eastern and Western Churches, the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> being approved by <note n="(a)" place="margin">Soz. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note>

What is now to be said, when the Bishops assembled in Council both in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern and Western Churches did effectually, as far as their Decrees went, overthrow the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council? If it be said, <hi>that the Council of</hi> Ariminum <hi>decreed nothing positively against the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith</hi>; we are to consider, that the <hi>reversing the Decree</hi> of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was in effect overthrowing the Faith thereby stablished; And so St. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>Tunc</hi> Usiae <hi>Nomen abolitum est, tunc</hi> Nicenae <hi>Fidei damnatio conclamata est.</hi> And then these words follow, <hi>Ingemuit totus Orbis &amp;</hi> Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>se esse miratus est:</hi> and if <hi>nothing would ever be able to stop out the</hi> Arian <hi>Heresie but the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith,</hi> as is confessed; and this Council took away the <hi>Authority</hi> of that Council, then it at least made way for the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Heresie, and left all Men to be Hereticks that had a mind to be so. And so St. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> and <hi>Vrsacius</hi> after the Council boasted, <hi>that they never denied the Son to be a Creature, but to be like other Creatures:</hi> from whence <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ambros. <hi>Ep.</hi> 33. <hi>ad</hi> Valent.</note> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> takes it for granted, that <hi>Christ's being a Creature</hi> did pass for good Doctrine in the Council of <hi>Ariminum.</hi> But we are told, that <hi>St.</hi> Jerome <hi>onely complains of the World's being cheated and trepan'd into</hi> Arianism <hi>by the Bishops being so weakly overreached and outwitted by an handfull of</hi> Arians. Doth not St. <hi>Jerome</hi> plainly say, <hi>the Name of Substance was there laid aside, and the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi> And could this be a mere <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Trepan</hi> to those who were so much aware of it, as to declare at first, <hi>they would never give way to it, because they saw the Danger of it</hi>; and to renew their <hi>Protestations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, after the Emperour's severe Message to them about it? So that, whatever it was, it could be no
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62156:132"/>
                  <hi>Cheat</hi> or <hi>Trepan</hi> in those who made such <hi>Decrees</hi> at first, deposed the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops, sent such <hi>Messages</hi> to the Emperour as they did. Which is a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that they saw and knew what they did; and understood the Consequences of it. <hi>But they were frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this Consent at last.</hi> I grant they were so. But what then becomes of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> if mere <hi>Fear</hi> can make so many Bishops in <hi>Council</hi> act and declare against their <hi>Consciences?</hi> If in such Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the Persons were capable of being sway'd by any particular <hi>bias,</hi> from asserting the Truth, what Security can there be as to Mens <hi>Faith</hi> from their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, any farther than we can be secure they were not influenced by any Temporal Hopes or Fears? So that we are not barely to respect the <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> but to examine the <hi>Motives</hi> by which they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in passing those Decrees; and if it appear, they did act freely and sincerely, and deliver the general sense of the Christian Church, from the beginning, as it was in the Case of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> then a mighty regard ought to be shewed to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of it; but if Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Interest, Fear, or any other secular <hi>Motive</hi> be found to sway them in their Debates and Resolutions, then every particular Church is at liberty to refuse their <hi>Decrees,</hi> and to adhere to those of more free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Councils. And this was the Case here, as to the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> if the Church had been <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> tied up to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> however past, there had been an utter Impossibility of restoring the true <hi>Christian Faith</hi>; for there was no such <hi>Council</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to reverse the <hi>Decrees</hi> of it; but in every Church, the banished Bishops being returned, not long after, upon the death of <hi>Constantius,</hi> they took care to settle the true Faith in the Western Churches, by les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Assemblies of the several Bishops. A remarkable Instance whereof appears in <note n="(e)" place="margin">Hilar. <hi>Frag. p.</hi> 431.</note>

there is greater Reason to believe <hi>Constantius</hi> than <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper</hi> in this matter.

For every Province had its <hi>Metropolis</hi>; And the superiority of one <hi>Metropolis</hi> above another depended on the Residence of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Governour, the <hi>Vicarius Britanniarum.</hi> I grant that, in the time of the Wars with the Northern <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, York</hi> was the chief Seat of the Emperour when he was here, as in the times of <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Constantius</hi>; but that was for the conveniency of attending the Wars, and being near to give Directions and send Supplies. But the Preheminence of Places in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Account did depend more upon the <hi>Civil</hi> than the <hi>Military Officers</hi>; These being more uncertain than the other, and where the Supreme <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature</hi> was, that was the <hi>chief Metropolis,</hi> and that was where the Supreme Governour of those Provinces had his residence. Thus every Province had a President in the <hi>Metropolis</hi>; but where there was a Superiour Officer over these Presidents, as the <hi>Vicarius Britanniarum</hi> was over the five Provinces, the Place of his residence was the <hi>highest Metropolis,</hi> because the Presidents Courts were in Subordination to his, whether they were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular</hi> or <hi>presidial</hi>; and therefore the solemn <hi>Conventus</hi> out of the Provinces were appointed there.

its admirable situation for Trade and Commerce, and the opportunity of sending into, or receiving Dispatches from the foreign Provinces and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Court where ever it was.

               </p>
               <p>It hath been a great Question among some Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, whether there were any Persons who drew ill Consequences from Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and were therefore opposed by <hi>Faustus</hi> and others, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the <hi>mere Doctrine of</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> that was so opposed by them, and urged with those Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as following from it. I see no Reason to deny, that the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> did charge the Followers of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> with the same things which are made the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of those who are called the <hi>Predestinatian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> by <hi>Sigebert, Gennadius, Hincmarus,</hi> and others. But yet that there were certain Persons who did own such bad Consequences as the overthrowing <hi>the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man's Will</hi> and <hi>the Necessity of our Endeavours,</hi> will appear from these two Reasons. (1.) St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Doctrine was so misunderstood by some in his Life time, as appears by the Controversie amongst the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drumetine Monks.</hi> The Case was this, <hi>Florus,</hi> one of that Society, going to <hi>Vzala,</hi> a City near <hi>Vtica,</hi> between <hi>Hippo</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> where <hi>Euodius</hi> was then Bishop, a Friend of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s, there met with <note n="(h)" place="margin">Valent. <hi>ad</hi> Aug. <hi>Ep.</hi> 216.</note> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>'s large Epistle to <hi>Sixtus</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> which being sent home, and <hi>Florus</hi> himself going to <hi>Carthage,</hi> before his return they were fallen into great Heats upon the Occasion of that Epistle. <hi>Some of them,</hi> as <note n="(i)" place="margin">Aug. <hi>ad</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. <hi>Epist.</hi> 214.</note> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself saith, <hi>did so preach up the Grace of God, as to deny Free-will, and consequently to say, That God in the day of Iudgment would not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to men according to their Works</hi>; Others said, <hi>That our Free-will was assisted by the Grace of God, that we may know and doe the things that are right; That the Lord, when he comes to render to every Man according to their Works; may find our Works good, which he hath prepared that we may walk in them. And they,</hi> saith he, <hi>who judge thus do judge rightly.</hi> Therefore those who
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62156:145"/>
thought otherwise did mistake his Doctrine; For, as he saith, <hi>If there be no Grace, there can be no Salvation; If there be no Free-will, there can be no day of Iudgment.</hi> To what purpose is all this, if some of these did not so misunderstand his Doctrine as to overthrow all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Will in Mankind?

                  <hi>Noris</hi> himself confesseth <hi>he can never assent to it</hi>; And although it be looked on as part of the cunning of <hi>Faustus,</hi> That he designed to convey his Books so privately to his Countreymen the <hi>Britains,</hi> as appears by the Epistle of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> to him, yet it is utterly incredible that he should forge two Councils, and set down the Names of several Bishops as present in them, with whom <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> was particularly acquainted, and yet he not discover the Cheat and Imposture. But the <hi>Jansenists</hi> yield, that both those Councils were held about <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 475. But they say, <hi>that the Bishops were partly</hi> Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>partly deceived by</hi> Faustus <hi>who was so</hi>; And <hi>Noris</hi> doth not deny, <hi>that there were other Persons who were then charged with those Opinions which</hi> Lucidus <hi>held. But,</hi> he saith, <hi>they were not many nor considerable enough to make a Sect; And that they did not willingly yield those Consequences. But not knowing how to answer the</hi> Semipelagians, <hi>they were forced to assert them; Which their Adversaries therefore charged them with as their own Opinions.</hi> Which seems no improbable Account of those called <hi>Predestinatians.</hi> It cannot be denied, that <hi>Faustus</hi> his Books were severely censured after his death, not onely by the <hi>Scythian Monks</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom <hi>Joh. Maxentius</hi> was the chief; but by the <hi>African</hi> Bishops who were then Exiles in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> by whom <hi>Fulgentius</hi> was employ'd to write against them. But <hi>Possessor,</hi> one of the <hi>African</hi> exiled Bishops, being then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and finding great Heats about <hi>Faustus</hi> his Books, sends to Pope <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> to know
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62156:146"/>
his Judgment about them; Which he did at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Vitalianus</hi> and <hi>Justinianus</hi> two of the greatest Men in the Emperour's Court. He returns a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Answer as to <hi>Faustus</hi>; Which, by the way, shews how little Credit is to be given to the Decree of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius</hi> about <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> for therein <hi>Faustus</hi> his <hi>Books</hi> are condemned. But if this had been done by <hi>Gelasius,</hi> is it probable that <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> his Successour, would have stuck so much at it as <hi>Maxentius</hi> saith that he did? But he refers them for the sense of the Church to St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi>; And the <hi>Definitions</hi> of his <hi>Predecessours. Maxentius</hi> rails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Answer, as unsatisfactory and next to <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,</hi> and sets St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Sayings against those of <hi>Faustus.</hi> Afterwards, <hi>Caesarius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> not onely wrote against <hi>Faustus</hi> his Doctrine, but by his means chiefly it was condemned in the <hi>Second Council of Orange:</hi> Which asserted <hi>the Necessity of Preventing Grace</hi>; The denying whereof was the main <hi>Errour</hi> charg'd on <hi>Faustus,</hi> not so much as to <hi>good Works</hi> (for <note n="(t)" place="margin">Jansen. <hi>Hist.

                  <hi>Constantius</hi> saith in St. <hi>German</hi>'s Life, <hi>that he succeeded St.</hi> Amator <hi>in his See, and continued therein thirty years and twenty five days.</hi> But St. <hi>Amator</hi> died <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 418. as our Learned <note n="(h)" place="margin">Usser. <hi>de Prim. p.</hi> 382.</note> Primate hath proved, <hi>because the Calends of</hi> May <hi>on which he died were that year, as</hi> Constantius <hi>saith, the fourth day of the Week,</hi> which agrees to 418. If it be said, <hi>That this Passage of</hi> Asserius <hi>is meant of an Elder</hi> Gildas, <hi>called</hi> Gildas Albanius <hi>whose Life the same excellent Antiquary supposes to be written by</hi> Caradoc <hi>of</hi> Lancarvan; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that when he comes to fix the times in his <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Index,</hi> he doth overthrow his own Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For <hi>Caradoc,</hi> by his own confession, makes <hi>Gildas contemporary with King</hi> Arthur, and he is said by him to be born <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 493. And therefore <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s <hi>Gildas</hi> can be no elder than the <hi>Gildas Badonicus.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore the want of skill may make <hi>Caradoc</hi> set his <hi>Gildas</hi> elder than he ought to have done; yet whosoever will compare that Life published by <hi>Joh. à Bosco</hi> with the other by <hi>Caradoc,</hi> will find that they were designed for the same Person. And therefore <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with far more judgment, mentions but one <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>; but <hi>Bale</hi> and <hi>Pits</hi> make more; but it is their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to multiply Authours as well as Books. St. <hi>Kenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> was baptized assoon as he was born, by <hi>Seruanus,</hi> one of the Disciples of <hi>Palladius,</hi> whose Mission had
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62156:150"/>
the same date with the first coming of St. <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi>; And therefore it is not very probable that St. <hi>German</hi> should see the Orders of <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Kenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern,</hi> much less those of <hi>Melkin</hi> and <hi>Nennius,</hi> whose Ages fall so far short of the others.</p>
               <p>But although St. <hi>German</hi>'s being at <hi>Oxford</hi> cannot be proved by such obscure and incoherent Passages as this; yet I doubt not but by the Evidence already produced, he did take care to advance Learning and Piety in the <hi>British Churches</hi> wheresoever he came: Both which were falling very much to decay upon the irruption of the barbarous Nations. While the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire flourished there was care taken for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Learning, especially in greater Cities. At <hi>Rome</hi> by the Constitution of <hi>Valentinian</hi> we may see the Orders then made for Regulation of Students there; as for entring their Names who came thither out of the several Provinces by the <hi>Magister Census,</hi> with the <hi>Testimonials</hi> from the Governours of <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> of the Place of their Birth and Quality, who then were to declare what <hi>Studies</hi> they designed to follow, and an account was to be given of their Lodgings: And particular Officers were appointed called <hi>Censua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> to make an Inspection into their Lives, that they did avoid all Clubs called there <hi>Consociations,</hi> or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent appearing at the <hi>Sports,</hi> or affecting unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and publick Entertainments. If any were found faulty, they were to be chastised, and sent away home, but none were permitted to stay after twenty at <hi>Rome,</hi> and an account of these things was to be taken month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and given in to the <hi>Praefectus Vrbis,</hi> and return'd to the Emperour every year; as appears by the <note n="(i)" place="margin">C.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62156:153"/>
And that the Pope did not oblige him to follow the Example of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; chiefly, I suppose, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Queen, being a Christian before, and using the <hi>Gallican Liturgy</hi> in the <hi>Publick Service,</hi> and her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop being of the <hi>Gallican Church,</hi> it would have given great Offence to them to have had it taken away; as likewise to all the <hi>British Churches</hi> which had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to it. If the Books of <hi>Musaeus</hi> mention'd by <note n="(z)" place="margin">Gennad. <hi>de Scriptor. c.</hi> 79.</note> 
                  <hi>Gennadius</hi> were extant, we should easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand wherein the difference lay. For, he being a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of the Church of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and a Man Learned in the Scriptures, was desired by <hi>Venerius,</hi> the Bishop there, <hi>to draw up a Form of Publick Service, consisting of two Parts,</hi> viz. <hi>The Morning Service, and the Communion Service.</hi> The first he finished in the time of <hi>Venerius,</hi> and is highly commended by <hi>Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius for its Order, Vsefulness and Decency.</hi> The second, in the time of <hi>Eustathius</hi> his Successour, which he likewise commends for <hi>its great weight and exactness.</hi> And there was great Reason at that time, to bring the <hi>Church Service</hi> into <hi>Order,</hi> because <hi>Cassian</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers endeavour'd to introduce the <hi>Monastick Customs</hi> which he had observed in <hi>Egypt</hi> and elsewhere, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the design of his <hi>Monastick Institutions,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the second and third Books, which he dedicated to <hi>Castor,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Apta Iulia,</hi> at the same time that <hi>Venerius</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> where <hi>Cassian</hi> lived. This <hi>Musaeus</hi> was therefore employ'd to draw up the most convenient <hi>Order</hi> for the <hi>Publick Service,</hi> from whence we may be able to judge of the difference in both parts between the <hi>Gallican</hi> and <hi>Roman Offices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the <hi>first,</hi> viz. the <hi>Morning Service,</hi> which consisted of <hi>Lessons, Hymns</hi> and <hi>Psalms</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Lessons,</hi> and short <hi>Collects</hi> after them.</p>

The great Argument to me, is the small number of <hi>Collects</hi> in the Ancient <hi>Churches</hi>; For the Christians spent a great deal of time in the <hi>publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> on the Lord's-days, and the <hi>Stationary days</hi>; But all the other Offices could not take up that time, there being no long <hi>Extemporary Prayers,</hi> nor such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of tedious <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in all Parts, as the <hi>Roman Breviary</hi> and <hi>Missal</hi> introduced, and the <hi>Collects</hi> of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Antiquity, being very few and short, it seems most probable, that a competent part of the time was spent in private Devotions. A remainder whereof is still preserved in the Office of <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi> in our Church, whereby <hi>silence is commanded to be kept for a time, for the Peoples secret Prayers.</hi> And the same Custome was observed at the <hi>Bidding of Prayers,</hi> which was a direction for the People what to pray for in their <note n="(o)" place="margin">

               </argument>
               <p>BEing now to give an Account of the fatal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension of the <hi>British</hi> Churches, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to look back on the time when their Miseries first began. For which we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That the <hi>Romans</hi> having never made an entire Conquest of the whole <hi>Island</hi>; but contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the better part, and excluding the rest by a Wall; They still left a backdoor open for the poor <hi>Provincial Britains</hi> to be disturbed, as often as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Garrisons neglected their Duty or were overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Enemies. Who were now very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in those remoter parts of <hi>Britain</hi>; Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abandon'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> they became an easie Prey to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>; Who, from different parts, took Possession of those Coasts which lay nearest to the Place from whence they came. Thus, the <hi>Scots</hi> coming from <hi>Ireland,</hi> entred upon the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Parts, as the <hi>Picts</hi> from <hi>Scandinavia</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62156:165"/>
done on the <hi>Northern.</hi> Our Learned <note n="(a)" place="margin">Camd. <hi>Brit. p.</hi> 82.</note> Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was of Opinion, <hi>That the</hi> Picts <hi>were no other than the ancient</hi> Britains, partly settled in those Parts, before the <hi>Roman</hi> Invasion, and partly retiring thither out of Impatience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, who by degrees grew up into a considerable number of People. It is not to be question'd, that there was a Stock of <hi>Old Britains</hi> in those <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, as appears by the Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Galgacus,</hi> and the Actions against <hi>Vrbicus, Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi>; But their continual Wars with the <hi>Roman Legions,</hi> who were placed about the Wall, on purpose to take all Advantages against them, must needs exhaust them by degrees, and lessen them so much as to leave room enough for new Recruits to come in and take up part of their Countrey. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for their own Security, the Parts near the Wall might be well supplied on that side, yet when so much Bloud retired to the Heart as was necessary to support Life, a great deal must be called off from the extreme parts for a fresh supply of it, and those parts must needs be left destitute of natural heat, and Strength enough to maintain themselves. For during the War, which continued for several Ages, the very Life of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Nation,</hi> beyond the Wall, was in perpetual danger; And not onely the Duty and Service, but the many Diseases and Accidents of War, could not, in so long a tract of time, but very much impair the <hi>British</hi> Strength, and leave the remoter Parts, if not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void of Inhabitants, yet not in a Condition to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a foreign Invasion. I grant that <hi>Tacitus, Dio, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodian, Vopiscus,</hi> &amp;c. take no notice of any other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the <hi>Romans</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at that time in those Parts besides the <hi>Britains</hi>; But then, I think, the Argument may be thus turned upon <hi>Camden,</hi> What makes the latter Writers so expresly and distinctly mention the <hi>Picts,</hi> if they were no other than the <hi>Old Britains,</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten spoken of by <hi>Roman Historians?</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, why their continuing an <hi>old Custome</hi> should now give them <hi>a new Name?</hi> The <hi>Britains,</hi> however rude, were no more <hi>Picts</hi> then, than they were at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. What makes the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers so of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alter their Style, and leave off a Name so famous
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62156:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62156:166"/>
they always had, the <hi>Linea Valli</hi> relating to this <hi>Wall</hi> from <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s time; And although sometimes in a bravery the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers would march to <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his Wall, and drive the <hi>Britains</hi> before them, yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the <hi>Roman Province</hi> was bounded by <hi>Severus</hi> his <hi>Wall,</hi> and therefore <hi>Gallio Ravennas</hi> might at last chuse rather to make up and fortifie this for the <hi>Britains,</hi> when the <hi>Roman Souldiers</hi> left them to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <p>It is certain that in the time of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the Northern Parts of this Island were well inhabited, as appears by the following Account from him.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62156:167"/>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> his words may bear another meaning, viz. <hi>That although the</hi> Romans <hi>had made Excursions as far as the</hi> Taus, <hi>and set up some Forts there; Yet when</hi> Agricola <hi>went about to settle the Province, he reduced it within the compass of the two</hi> Friths; <hi>There being the most convenient Place for the Garrison to be fixed; There being so small a Neck of Land between the Armes of the two Seas, which was then very well fortified.</hi> But the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Ambition of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the fifth year of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi> carried them beyond these Limits; And then he subdued Nations before that time unknown; And furnished with Forces that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which lieth against <hi>Ireland</hi>: Not out of fear of any Invasion from thence; But rather in hopes of subduing that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by their means. Which shews that <hi>Ireland</hi> was then <hi>well peopled</hi>; and thought by <hi>Agricola</hi> very fit for the <hi>Roman Army</hi> to conquer; Because it lay so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for uniting the parts of the Empire together; And it would help much towards the total subduing of <hi>Britain,</hi> if there were no appearance of Liberty left within their view. And <hi>Tacitus</hi> insinuates that <hi>Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> had it in his Design, if he had been suffer'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer after his Victory over <hi>Galgacus:</hi> Which <hi>Domitian</hi>'s incurable Jealousie of Great Men would not permit. However, in order to it, <hi>Agricola</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an account of the Ports, and condition of the People, whom he found not unlike the <hi>Britains</hi>; And he kept with him till Occasion served, one of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of that Countrey, who was driven from thence by a domestick Sedition. But in the mean time, in his sixth year, he applied himself to the Conquest of the several Nations beyond <hi>Bodotria,</hi> among whom a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Insurrection was apprehended, and all Passages by Land were supposed to be beset; And therefore <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> set out a Fleet for discovery of the Countrey; the sight whereof struck great Terrour into the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> And then he saith, <hi>the</hi> Caledonians <hi>armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and set upon the</hi> Romans <hi>with all the Force they could make</hi>; and falling upon the <hi>ninth Legion</hi> unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, had like to have totally defeated them, if the rest of the Army had not come in to their timely rescue. By which good success, the <hi>Roman Army,</hi> being
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62156:167"/>
much incouraged, cried out to march into <hi>Caledonia</hi>; That they might at last come to the utmost Bounds of <hi>Britain.</hi> But the <hi>Britains</hi> attributed this not to the Valour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but to the ill Conduct of their <hi>General</hi>; And therefore resolved to fight it out, and to that end they disposed of their Wives and Children in Places of Safety, and by frequent Meetings and solemn Sacrifices they entred into a strict Confederacy, to stand it out to the utmost against the <hi>Romans.</hi> And in this Case of common danger, all the Cities were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, and raised an Army of 30000 Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Galgacus,</hi> who, in his brave O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, so much commended by <hi>Lipsius,</hi> tells his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>they were the last of the</hi> Britains, <hi>there being no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond them</hi>; And he calls them, <hi>the most noble of the</hi> Britains, <hi>who had never beheld the Slavery of others</hi>; Upon this the fatal Battel was fought at the Foot of <hi>Mons Grampius,</hi> where 10000 Britains <hi>were killed,</hi> and <hi>the rest dispersed</hi>; After which <hi>Agricola</hi> was recalled. This is the Substance of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Relation, wherein we may observe; (1.) That these <hi>Britains</hi> were not merely such as were driven thither by the stress of War, but such as had <hi>long inhabited there,</hi> and had so little Communication with the other <hi>Britains, that they had never seen the Condition of Slavery which the</hi> Romans <hi>had brought them to.</hi> (2.) That they were not inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for their Numbers or Valour, who were able to oppose the whole <hi>Roman Army,</hi> and make their <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> so doubtfull. (3.) That these had a distinct Name from the rest, being in general called the <hi>Caledonian Britains:</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> thinks they had a different <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> from the <hi>Silures,</hi> and other <hi>Britains.</hi> Those who adjoined to <hi>Gaul,</hi> he concludes came at first from thence, and had several <hi>Colonies</hi> follow'd them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as appears by their Names, Customes and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; the <hi>Silures</hi> he deduced from <hi>Spain,</hi> which he proves from their Complexion and Situation; And so probably enough, he thinks them a <hi>Colony of the old Iberi</hi>; some whereof went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and peopled some part of it: But, besides these two, he makes a third Race of Men in <hi>Britain,</hi> whom he fetches out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and these were the <hi>Caledonian Britains</hi>; But

                     <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 118.</note> Seventh Book, where he gives a more particular account of those Books which were brought to him from thence, he onely mentions some broken <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Latin Authours</hi>; But whose they were, where Written, whence they came, he knew not; And, as to their own <hi>Histories,</hi> he names indeed <hi>Veremundus</hi> and <hi>Elphinston,</hi> and no more. The latter he said before was <hi>imperfect,</hi> and lately done; So that the whole Credit of <hi>Hector</hi>'s <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities</hi> rests entirely upon <hi>Veremundus</hi>; For here he never takes notice of <hi>Campbell</hi> or <hi>Cornelius Hibernicus</hi>; But he saith, <hi>Edw.</hi> I. <hi>had destroy'd all their Antiquities, but such as were preserved in the Island</hi> Iona <hi>or</hi> Hy. And is this now a good Foundation to build a History up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

               <p>In his Third Book he gives an Account of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Bredius,</hi> a Kinsman of <hi>Gillus</hi>; Of <hi>Cassibellan</hi>'s Message to <hi>Ederus</hi> for Assistence against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar:</hi> And the Speech of <hi>Androgeus</hi> before the <hi>Council:</hi> and <hi>Ederus</hi> his Answer, and sending 10000 Men under the Command of <hi>Cadallanus,</hi> Son to <hi>Cadal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>; Who, with the <hi>British</hi> Forces, quite overthrew <hi>Caesar,</hi> by the help of <hi>Tenantius,</hi> Duke of the <hi>Cambri</hi> and <hi>Corinei</hi>; for which, as we may easily conceive, there was wonderfull rejoicing in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And great Friendship upon it, between the <hi>Britains,</hi> the <hi>Picts</hi> and the <hi>Scots.</hi> But next Summer they hear the sad News of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s coming again; And then the <hi>Britains</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Scots</hi> assistence (and it is easie to imagine what

But it seems <hi>Caesar</hi> had so much good Nature in him as to send a <hi>Second Message</hi> to the <hi>Scots,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd with great Eloquence, but it did not work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; For, saith <hi>Hector, had it not been for the Law of Nations, they had torn the Messengers to pieces.</hi> But it happen'd luckily, that while <hi>Caesar</hi> was making Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to enter <hi>Scotland,</hi> he received Letters from <hi>Labienus</hi> of the Revolt of the <hi>Gauls</hi>; upon which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> returns, having scarce so much as frighted the <hi>Picts</hi> and the <hi>Scots.</hi> And here again <hi>Hector</hi> vouches the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Veremundus</hi> and <hi>Campbell</hi>; But notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Buchanan</hi> very wisely leaves all this out, which <hi>Lesly,</hi> believing <hi>Veremundus,</hi> or rather <hi>Hector</hi> before <hi>Caesar,</hi> keeps in.

From hence it is plain that <hi>Veremun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> his <hi>Authority</hi> signified nothing with him; And yet he follows <hi>Hector</hi> where he professes to rely upon his Authority. For <hi>Buchanan</hi> evidently abridges <hi>Hector</hi> as to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs, leaving out what he found incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the <hi>Roman History.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hector</hi> begins his Fifth Book with the short Reign and dolefull End of <hi>Luctacus, Galdus</hi> his Son; who was succeeded by <hi>Mogallus,</hi> his Sisters Son; who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for some time a brave Prince, but at last degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, was killed by his Subjects. After him <hi>Conarus</hi> his Son, who was confined for ill management, and the Government committed to <hi>Argadus</hi>; Upon his death the Kingdom fell to <hi>Ethodius,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Mogallus,</hi> who was strangled in his Bed by an <hi>Irish Harper:</hi> And
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62156:174"/>
so was <hi>Satrael</hi> that succeeded him, by those of his Bed-chamber. These are sad Stories, if they were true, but the comfort is, there appears yet no better Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than that of <hi>Hector</hi> for them. For <hi>Fordon</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this; And <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Lesly</hi> take them upon <hi>Hector</hi>'s Credit. They served <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s purpose well enough, as appears by his Book <hi>De jure Regni a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud</hi> Scotos; And therefore he was willing to let them stand in History, being none of his Invention, and knowing what use was to be made of them. <hi>Donal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Ethodius,</hi> was chosen in his room, and here <hi>Hector</hi> falls in with <hi>Fordon</hi> about <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> one of the Royal <hi>British</hi> Race, who revolted from the <hi>Romans,</hi> which <hi>Fordon</hi> had from <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who calls him <hi>Fulgenius,</hi> and saith, he was driven with the <hi>Britains</hi> into <hi>Albany:</hi> But after, in a Fight with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> they were both killed. But in this <hi>Hector</hi> was ashamed to follow them; allowing <hi>Severus</hi> to die a natural death, and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> to survive him. As to <hi>Donald</hi>'s embracing Christianity, he follows <hi>Fordon,</hi> but never quotes him; And here he never mentions <hi>Veremundus</hi>; As though so considerable a Point of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story needed no Authority but his own. He concludes this Book with a brief Account of <hi>Ethodius,</hi> Son to the former, who for his ill Government was confined by his Nobles and killed by his Guards.</p>
               <p>In the Sixth Book he begins with a <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> for the choice of a new King. And they set up his Son <hi>Athirco,</hi> who gave great hopes at first, but falling into Debauchery, his Nobles combined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and finding no way to escape, he killed himself. <hi>Nathalacus,</hi> Head of the Conspiracy, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, who was for a time Popular, afterwards Cruel, to that degree, as raised a general hatred of him, which ended in a Design to destroy him; Wherein they were prevented by one of his greatest Confidents, who stabbed him. Then <hi>Findocus,</hi> eldest Son to <hi>Athirco,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Crown, who proved an excellent Prince, but was at last murthered by two Villains, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Carantius</hi> being privy to it: The Murtherers were executed, but <hi>Carantius</hi> fled, and was afterwards a great Souldier under <hi>Probus, Carus</hi> and <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> This
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62156:175"/>
                  <hi>Carantius</hi> is the same whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers call <hi>Carausius,</hi> as <hi>Hector</hi> afterwards confesses, who set up for himself in <hi>Britain</hi>; But, saith he, he purposely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised himself abroad. <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> makes him a <hi>Britain,</hi> and calls him <hi>Carassius.</hi>

                  <hi>Fordon</hi> tells the main of the Story of <hi>Carausius</hi> well enough; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlarging on the Leagues he made with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>; And <hi>Gothorius,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> who ruled over the Northern <hi>Britains.</hi> But whence had <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> this Information, That he was <hi>Carantius,</hi> Son to <hi>Athirco,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Findocus? Buchanan</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to relate the Story of <hi>Carantius</hi> as far as to his passing into the <hi>Roman Army,</hi> and there stops. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he speaks of <hi>Carausius</hi> his Actions in <hi>Britain,</hi> without any farther mention of <hi>Carantius</hi>; Which shews that <hi>Buchanan</hi> took, and left what he pleased out of <hi>Hector</hi>'s History without being obliged by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he produced to carry it on as he found it there.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Findocus,</hi> his Brother <hi>Donald</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, who was soon killed by <hi>Donald</hi> of the <hi>Isles,</hi> who usurped the Kingdom, and was at last killed by a Conspiracy whereof <hi>Crathlintus,</hi> Son to <hi>Findocus</hi> was the chief; Who immediately took possession of the Crown: After him succeeded <hi>Fincormachus</hi>; both these died peaceably. Then arose a mighty Contest about the <hi>Regency</hi> between the three Nephews of <hi>Crathlintus</hi>; At first <hi>Romachus</hi> prevailed, but Governing cruelly, he was taken off: Then follow'd <hi>Angusianus,</hi> who was killed in Battel by the <hi>Picts</hi>; After him <hi>Fethelmachus,</hi> killed in his Bed by his Harper; And last of all <hi>Eugenius,</hi> killed in Battel by the <hi>Romans:</hi> And soon after, by the Instigation of the <hi>Picts</hi> their mortal Enemies, the <hi>Scots</hi> were universally banished out of <hi>Britain</hi> by order of <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Roman General</hi>; whither they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not till about forty years after, under <hi>Fergus</hi> II. And in this, as to the main part of this last Tragedy, <hi>Fordon</hi> agrees with <hi>Hector, viz.</hi> That it was occasion'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> joining with the <hi>Picts</hi> against the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the time of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who were not onely beaten by them, but driven out of <hi>Britain</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and other Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:62156:175"/>This is the Substance of what these <hi>Scotish Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> deliver concerning their remotest <hi>Antiquities</hi> to the time of <hi>Fergus</hi> II.</p>
               <p>But several Arguments are of late produced to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it is delivered by <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> out of <hi>Veremundus</hi> and his other Authours; which must be briefly considered, before I proceed to the <hi>Irish Antiquities.</hi> And it is alledged, that the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Antiquities,</hi> as delivered by him (for it is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Hector's</hi> Authority which I dispute) <hi>have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great Applause for many hundreds of years, by all Historians, Antiquaries and Criticks of other Nations, who had any occasion to mention their Affairs.</hi> It will go a great way with me, if it be made appear, that there was any such account received among <hi>Learned Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in any part of the World before <hi>Hector</hi>'s time. But I cannot find any one Antiquary, no not in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before his time, who gives the same Account that <hi>Hector</hi> doth. <hi>The Tradition of the</hi> Scots <hi>peopling that part of the Island long before</hi> Fergus <hi>II.</hi> I grant was a much <hi>elder Tradition,</hi> and is embraced by <hi>Fordon,</hi> and probably by others before him. But <hi>Fordon</hi> doth not own the <hi>Succession</hi> of the same number of Kings, and in such a manner as <hi>Hector</hi> delivers them. From whence then came <hi>Hector</hi> to know so much more than <hi>Fordon</hi> in these matters? I yield <hi>that there were some ancient</hi> Chronica <hi>before</hi> Fordon, <hi>which he often quotes.</hi> But still the Argument is the stronger against <hi>Hector.</hi> For if <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had all those <hi>Helps,</hi> and yet knew nothing of those particulars, it is a vehement Presumption against <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> that he took too much Liberty in those many particulars, which <hi>Fordon</hi> passed over, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say about them. <hi>The more Copies they have of</hi> Fordon <hi>in their Monasteries,</hi> the more easily they may be convinced, how little <hi>Hector</hi> and he agree about the <hi>first Succession</hi> between the two <hi>Fergusses.</hi> And <hi>if</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>did agree with all their Annals,</hi> as is now pleaded, <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> could not, because they differ so much from each other; as will appear to any one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them. Why do we not reade in <hi>Fordon</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of <hi>Veremundus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Hibernicus,</hi> who were certainly before his time, if ever? For we are told,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62156:176"/>
                  <hi>that he was Archdeacon of St.</hi> Andrew<hi>'s. A. D.</hi> 1076. <hi>and dedicated his Book to</hi> Malcolm Canmore; which was long enough before <hi>Fordon</hi>'s time. But it is said, <hi>that he is cited in a particular part of</hi> Fordon<hi>'s Book; which could not be copied from</hi> Boethius. It had been a much clearer Evidence, if that Place had been produced; for then we might have consider'd whether it was a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Fordon,</hi> or of one of those several Writers who it seems wrote <hi>Additions</hi> and <hi>Continuations</hi> to him; such, as besides <hi>Maculloch, Arelat</hi> and <hi>Walter Bowma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> are said to have been, <hi>who continued the Histories to the Reign of</hi> James <hi>II.</hi> And yet I would be glad to see any Testimony of <hi>Veremundus</hi> of that Antiquity. As to the Testimony of <hi>Chambers,</hi> who saith, <hi>he had these principal Authours,</hi> Veremund, <hi>a Spaniard,</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gott, Swinton, Campbell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till some farther Proof be produced, I have reason to suppose, it was the same Case as to him with that of Sir <hi>R. Baker,</hi> which immediately follows; For we are told, <hi>that he likewise quotes this</hi> Veremund <hi>among the Authours out of whom he compiled his History, and likewise</hi> Campbell <hi>and</hi> Turgott. And if we have no more ground to believe that <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> had them, than Sir <hi>R. Baker,</hi> the matter must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in as much obscurity as before. For no one imagines that Sir <hi>R. Baker</hi> had all those Authours by him which he there mentions; but he sets down the Names of those whose Authorities he relied upon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he found them quoted by others. And he is not the onely person in the World who hath cited the Authority of Books which he never saw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The same is to be said of <hi>Hollinshed.</hi> But if such kind of Proofs must pass for <hi>evident Demonstrations, that the</hi> Scots <hi>had such Historians as</hi> Veremundus <hi>and the others before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi>; I wonder the same Learned Authour should shrink so much the <hi>Faith of History</hi> as to allow that despicable thing, called <hi>Moral Certainty, to be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Probation for it</hi>; For scarce any History can be mention'd, but may have such kind of <hi>evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations</hi> to prove it. Well, <hi>but</hi> Balaeus, <hi>a Learned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man, and</hi> Gesner, <hi>and other famous Strangers, quote</hi> Veremundus.

before the time of <hi>Hector Boethius.</hi> And those were Men who searched all our Libraries for the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books in them, and have digested them with great Care; and <hi>if</hi> Veremundus <hi>with other MSS. were brought into</hi> England <hi>by</hi> Edw. <hi>I.</hi> as is now suggested, it could hardly have escaped the diligence of those Men. But those who lived after <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> published his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, took his word for <hi>Veremundus,</hi> and entred him into their Catalogues; as <hi>Vossius</hi> hath done many whom he never saw. <hi>But</hi> Erasmus <hi>saith that</hi> Hector <hi>was a Person who could not lie.</hi> That was more than <hi>Erasmus</hi> could know, unless he had been by when he wrote his History and compared it with the Authours he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to follow. As to <hi>Paulus Iovius,</hi> he was a fit Second to <hi>Boethius</hi>; but I am sure <hi>Erasmus</hi> would not have said of him, <hi>that he could not lie.</hi> For <hi>Hector</hi>'s <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to have his Books from the Island</hi> Iona, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an Account of it already, and shew'd how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent his own relation thereof is. But all this while, <hi>Where is the great Applause of these</hi> Scotish <hi>Antiquities for many hundreds of years by all Historians, Antiquaries and Criticks of foreign Nations?</hi> When not so much as one is produced, who lived before <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> and, I think, that was not <hi>many hundred years</hi> since.</p>
               <p>But whatever becomes of <hi>Veremundus,</hi> we are told, <hi>That the Black-book of</hi> Scoon, <hi>containing the</hi> Scotish <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories from the beginning, was among President</hi> Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood<hi>'s Books, and given to</hi> Lambert, <hi>and by him to Collonel</hi> Fairfax. All this, I am afraid, is a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for a <hi>Black-book</hi> of <hi>Fordon</hi>'s, which was brought out of <hi>Scotland</hi> and presented to the late King by a Gentleman of that Name, as some yet living can attest. But no such thing as the <hi>Black-book of Scoon</hi> was ever heard of here; and if any such could be found, we should be so far from suppressing any thing that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Scotish Nation,</hi> that some here would be very glad to publish it, with all other ancient Annals which themselves would think fit to be printed; whether it be the <hi>Black-book</hi> of <hi>Paslay, Pluscardin,</hi> or any others. We do not deny that they had any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Annals or Registers in their Monasteries; but we desire to be better acquainted with them; and it is no
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62156:177"/>
good Argument, they can tell us where to find them, that they are so carefull to let us know how they came to lose them.</p>
               <p>But, after all this Fencing, it is positively said, <hi>that the surest foundation of all History is the common belief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Natives.</hi> But what if the Natives of several Countries differ from each other? It may be reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to believe neither, but it is not possible to believe both. What if they had for a long time no certain way of conveying their Histories from one Age to another? It is possible <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> may preserve some general strokes of the ancient History of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but it is hardly credible, that so many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as <hi>Boethius</hi> hath in the first Race of Kings could be kept so distinctly by the force of Tradition. <hi>The case of the old World</hi> is vastly different from any other People since the shortning of Mens Lives; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Nation wanted Records, could never make out the Credibility of their History to other People. We do not deny <hi>the Annals of the</hi> Jewish <hi>or</hi> Roman <hi>Priests</hi>; but we think <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> are two things; when <hi>Annals</hi> are produced, we must weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them, and compare the <hi>Annals</hi> of several Nations together, that we may better judge which are to be relied upon.</p>
               <p>And yet we are told again, <hi>that when Histories are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready formed out of ancient Records, there is no farther need to produce them; for Papers may be lost by accident, but the Histories taken out of them are to be believed, although the Records cannot be found; as it is in respect of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Greece, <hi>whose Authority remains, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Testimonies on which they relied are not extant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that at last <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> must be believed as to the <hi>British Antiquities,</hi> as well as <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> as to the <hi>Scotish.</hi> For <hi>Geffrey</hi> doth no more pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his History than <hi>Hector:</hi> and <hi>Hunibaldus</hi> is as good an Authour as either of them; and <hi>Keting</hi> as good as <hi>Hunibaldus.</hi> For they all equally pretend to derive their Histories from <hi>ancient Records</hi> and the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>Natives</hi>; and all these having formed their Histories out of these substantial Grounds, we are to search no farther; but to believe them all however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62156:177"/>
in themselves and contradictions to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>The case is very different as to the Learned <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Histories,</hi> from those of the modern bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations; which were plainly made in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, as will appear afterwards. And as to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> there is a considerable difference to be made between the <hi>Histories</hi> that related to the times before they had written Annals and after. Can any Man imagine that there is as great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the first Accounts of <hi>Greece</hi> as those that were written after the <hi>Peloponnesian War?</hi> Or, that the <hi>first beginnings</hi> of the <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> by <hi>Romulus</hi> are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with as much certainty as the <hi>Carthaginian War?</hi> The most judicious Writers among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did make allowance for the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of <hi>Ancient times,</hi> when many things were utterly lost, and others very imperfectly delivered: What Reproach then is it to any modern Nations to suppose their <hi>Histories</hi> to have had the same Fate the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had? Onely in this respect they are liable to greater Dispute, because they pretend to give an exact Account of those times before they had any <hi>Annals</hi> or written <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi>; and in this Case, the more exact and particular, the more suspicious. And we have more certain Rules of trying their ancient Histories, than the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had; because we have the Accounts of several <hi>Nations</hi> to compare together; and undoubted <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of other Writers to examine them by. And if they be not found faulty by some of these ways, we are contented to let them pass.</p>
               <p>But as to the <hi>Scotish Antiquities,</hi> we not onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Want of sufficient <hi>Antiquity</hi> in their written <hi>Records,</hi> but their Inconsistency with approved Writers, in the most ancient Account they give of the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the <hi>Scots</hi> so early in <hi>Britain.</hi> And which yet adds more to the suspicion, the <hi>Irish,</hi> from whom they descend, give a far more different Account of their first coming than themselves do; as will appear by what follows.</p>
               <p>For, The <hi>Irish Antiquaries</hi> will by no means allow the Account given by <hi>Hector Boethius</hi>; And say, <hi>He
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62156:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had not regard to Truth in the Writing of it</hi>; Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to <hi>Simon Brek</hi>'s coming out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>the fatal Chair</hi> with him, which they say are both false, and the main ground they insist upon is, That they are contrary to the Relation of the <note n="(q)" place="margin">Cambrensis <hi>eversus per</hi> Grat. Lucian. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 61.</note> 
                  <hi>Old Irish Antiquaries</hi> who deserve far more Credit.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore set down the Account they give, and consider the Credit they deserve.</p>
               <p>The best Account we have from <note n="(r)" place="margin">Prospect of <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>P.W. p.</hi> 6.</note> them is this;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>was first planted after the Floud, by one</hi> Ciocal, <hi>with a Fleet, wherein every Vessel had fifty Men and fifty Women; And this, Keting</hi> saith, <hi>happen'd about</hi> 100 <hi>years after the Deluge.</hi> But since such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Antiquities</hi> are very tender things, I shall not with a Besom sweep them all away at once, but gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take them in Pieces, and lay them open as I pass along. Now I desire to know what Foundation there is for our believing a thing so unlikely, as the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> in this manner, with such a Fleet, so soon after the Floud? It was a long time after this before the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had any skill in Shipping; to whom the <hi>Romans</hi> attributed the Invention of it. And certainly the Expedition of the <hi>Argonautae</hi> had not made such a noise among the <hi>Greeks</hi> so long after the <hi>Floud</hi> (but twenty years before the Destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> as <note n="(s)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, which happen'd in the time of the <hi>Judges</hi>) if the Skill in Shipping had been so great within 100 years after it? Yet, if that Expedition were such as <note n="(t)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Olaus Rudbeck</hi> describes it, it was far more considerable than is commonly thought. For he saith, They not onely entred the <hi>Euxine Sea,</hi> but he proves from <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> that they sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the <hi>Tanais,</hi> from whence <hi>Hornius</hi> in his Map saith, They went into the <hi>Mare Cronium,</hi> and so came round <hi>Egypt,</hi> passing between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and returning home by the Straits. But <hi>Rudbeck</hi> finds a Passage for them from the <hi>Tanais</hi> to the <hi>Volga,</hi> and so to the Lake of <hi>Fronoe,</hi> the Head of the <hi>Volga,</hi> and then by <hi>Rivers</hi> into the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> and so about the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Promontory to <hi>Ierne (Ireland</hi>) and <hi>Peucessa (Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>) and to <hi>Ausonia (Italy</hi>) and <hi>Trinacria (Sicily</hi>) and so home to <hi>Iolcos.</hi> If this were a mere Poetical Fancy,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62156:178"/>
yet it was extraordinary, since it agrees with the exact Description of the <hi>Northern Countries,</hi> saith <hi>Rudbeck</hi> far more than <hi>Ptolemy</hi> doth. I will suppose this <hi>Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who wrote the <hi>Argonauticks,</hi> to be neither the <hi>Old Orpheus,</hi> nor <hi>Onomacritus,</hi> but <hi>Orpheus</hi> of <hi>Crotona,</hi> to whom <hi>Suidas</hi> attributes the <hi>Argonauticks,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Pisistratus</hi>; yet it is very much for him then to describe these Parts of the World, as he doth; and to mention <hi>Ireland</hi> as a Countrey then known to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And <hi>Festus Avienus,</hi> describing the Voyage of <hi>Himilco</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> (spoken of by <note n="(u)" place="margin">

                     <l>Ast hinc, duobus, in sacram, sic Insulam</l>
                     <l>Dixere prisci solibus cursus rati est</l>

                  </q>
Nothing can be plainer, than that he here speaks of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> as then known by <hi>Himilco</hi>; For <hi>Festus Avienus</hi> saith, <hi>He took this Description from the</hi> Phoenician <hi>Annals, in which this Voyage was inserted.</hi> And it is very strange to me that <note n="(w)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Olaus Rudbeck</hi> should here change the <hi>Hiberni</hi> into <hi>Hyperborei,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he allows <hi>Albion</hi> to stand for <hi>Britain.</hi> But these are undoubted <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the ancient Peopling of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and of far greater Authority than those domestick Annals now so much extolled. But must we follow <hi>Keting,</hi> because he follows the old Annals in this Tradition of the first Peopling of <hi>Ireland?</hi> And why not then <hi>in the Story of</hi> Seth <hi>and three Daughters of</hi> Cain <hi>viewing</hi> Ireland?

But to this <hi>Giraldus</hi> gives a very substantial Answer out of the ancient <hi>Annals,</hi> viz. <hi>That onely one</hi> Ruanus <hi>escaped, who lived to St.</hi> Patrick<hi>'s days, and was baptized by him:</hi> (in a good old Age certainly, for he must be born within six hundred years after the Floud; And it was above four hundred and thirty years after <hi>Christ</hi> before St. <hi>Patrick</hi> was designed for <hi>Ireland.</hi>) This <hi>Ruanus,</hi> say the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Giraldus,</hi> was the true Relatour of the <hi>ancient History of</hi> Ireland <hi>to St.</hi> Patrick, and who can question the Testimony of such an authentick and truly ancient Witness?

But of that more afterwards. Now to go on to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account from the <hi>Irish</hi> Authours who say,</p>

allowed by all the Estates of the Kingdom.

For St. <hi>Patrick</hi> was one of the number, and it was done in the time of <hi>Laogirius,</hi> or <hi>Leogarius,</hi> King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who died, saith <note n="(o)" place="margin">Cambr. <hi>c. vers. p.</hi> 73.</note>

Form with the <hi>British</hi>; Onely <hi>Geffrey</hi> had not so lucky an Invention, as to have his <hi>History</hi> confirm'd by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> For, if he had but thought of it, he could have made as general an <hi>Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> at <hi>Lud</hi>'s <hi>Town,</hi> and as select a <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Nine,</hi> as ever was at <hi>Tarach.</hi> But all mens Inventions do not lie the same way; And in this, I confess, <hi>Keting</hi> or his Authours have very much exceeded <hi>Geffrey</hi> and his <hi>British MS.</hi> And upon the whole matter I cannot see that the <hi>Irish Chronologers</hi> and <hi>Historians</hi> have so much more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in their Story of <hi>Briotan</hi> than the <hi>British Writers</hi> had in the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Brute.</hi> For it is certain, it was not originally the Invention of <hi>Geffrey,</hi> onely he might use some art in setting it off, as he thought, with greater advantage than the <hi>Britains</hi> had done before him.</p>
               <p>But still we are referr'd <hi>to the Authority of the</hi> Irish <hi>Monuments in the</hi> Psalter <hi>of</hi> Cashel <hi>written</hi> 800 <hi>years since by the holy</hi> Cormach, <hi>both King and Bishop of</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.

                  <hi>This is the way to end the vexatious Questions about them, being taken out of the most authentick Records of</hi> Ireland, <hi>which are of such irrefragable Authority, That some are persuaded, had they been known to</hi> Camden, <hi>he would never have disputed the matter.</hi> And so I think too. But this irrefragable Authority is that of the <hi>Psalter of Cashel</hi>; From whence we are instructed in these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: (1.) <hi>That the</hi> Picts <hi>served in</hi> Thracia, <hi>under one</hi> Policornus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 491.</note> 
                  <hi>a King of that Countrey; where their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Gud <hi>took away the King's Life, to prevent an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on his Daughter.</hi> And did not <hi>Brutus</hi> serve King <hi>Pandrasus</hi> with his Army not far off in <hi>Greece?</hi> And methinks <hi>Pandrasus</hi> is as good a Name for a King of <hi>Greece</hi> as <hi>Polycornus</hi> for the King of <hi>Thrace.</hi> But where are either of them to be met with elsewhere? (2.) <hi>That upon this the General and his Army fled the Countrey, roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up and down at Sea till they came to</hi> Gaul, <hi>and there they founded the City of</hi> Pictavia. This is just <hi>Geffrey.</hi> For
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62156:182"/>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> came to <hi>Gaul</hi> too, and there fought with <hi>Grof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farius,</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> and founded the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> which had its Name from <hi>Turonus, Brutus</hi> his Nephew. (3.) <hi>That upon the same Occasion they were forced to leave</hi> Gaul, <hi>and to go for</hi> Ireland, (as <hi>Brutus</hi> did for <hi>Albion) where they were entertained, to fight with the</hi> Britains; Who it seems made very early Invasions upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> which still agrees with <hi>Geffrey</hi>'s History. (4.) The Story of the Advice of <hi>Trosdan, the</hi> Pictish <hi>Magician, for the</hi> Irish <hi>Army to bath in the Milk of</hi> 150 <hi>White, Crumple-horned Cows, as an effectual Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against the envenom'd Arrows of the</hi> Britains, and the strange Success upon it, is hardly to be matched in <hi>Geffrey.</hi> (5.) <hi>That the</hi> Picts, <hi>growing insolent, were forced by</hi> Herimon <hi>to retire to the Northern Parts of</hi> Britain, <hi>Onely with three</hi> Irish <hi>Women,</hi> whatever <hi>Bede</hi> saith of more; or, how differently soever he relates the whole Story of the <hi>Picts</hi>; For what is <hi>Bede</hi>'s, a poor <hi>Monk</hi>'s Authority, to King <hi>Cormach</hi>'s? (6.) <hi>That from</hi> Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luan, <hi>Son to</hi> Gud, <hi>there was a constant Succession of Kings of the</hi> Picts <hi>in that Countrey.</hi> But not more exact than the Succession of <hi>British</hi> Kings from King <hi>Brutus.</hi> And now I leave the Reader to judge whether <hi>Geffrey</hi> be not hardly dealt with, when such Authours are preferr'd so much before him.

               <p>First, They say, <note n="(x)" place="margin">Bede, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> Bede <hi>mentions them as ancient Inhabitants of this Island before the coming of the</hi> Romans; <hi>and describes the War's between the</hi> Picts, Scots <hi>and</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>before that of the</hi> Romans.

                  <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>was the true Countrey of the</hi> Scots, <hi>who coming hither made a third Nation in</hi> Britain, <hi>besides the</hi> Britains <hi>and</hi> Picts, <hi>and landed on the North part of the</hi> Frith, <hi>towards</hi> Ireland, <hi>and there settled themselves.</hi> But <hi>Bede</hi> saith nothing at all of the time when the <hi>Scots</hi> came first from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it is of no force, that he reckons them here before the War with the <hi>Romans</hi>; for, so he doth the <hi>English</hi> as well as the <hi>Scots:</hi> his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness being to give an Account of the <hi>present Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,</hi> and not merely of the <hi>Ancient, Haec in praesenti</hi> 5 <hi>Gentium linguis,</hi> &amp;c.

Why not the <hi>Picts</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> if then in <hi>Britain?</hi> The latter <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Writers never forbear calling them by their own Names, when they knew them to be here; as appears by <hi>Eumenius, Claudian</hi> and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus:</hi> but to say the <hi>Scots</hi> were called <hi>Maeatae,</hi> because they came from the <hi>Palus Maeotis,</hi> will hardly go down in this Age. However it is confidently affirmed, <hi>the</hi> Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii <hi>were the</hi> Scots. Let this one thing be well proved, and I will yield the <hi>Scots</hi> were in <hi>Britain</hi> long before <hi>Severus</hi> his time; for <hi>Tacitus</hi> mentions the <hi>Caledonians.</hi> But it is to no more purpose to quote modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who call the <hi>Caledonians Scots,</hi> than <hi>Lipsius</hi> his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Galgacus</hi> a <hi>Scotish</hi> King: for we are not bound to follow any modern Writers in their Improprieties. There is no Question the <hi>Caledonians</hi> were known to <hi>Flaccus</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> (who certainly lived not in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> his time, unless that Name be very improperly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by it self to <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Trajan.</hi>) But do any of these <hi>Roman</hi> Authours ever tell us the <hi>Caledonians</hi> were <hi>Scots</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If not, to what end are the <hi>Caledonians</hi> so much spoken of?

King should not be able to inform <hi>Agricola</hi> who these <hi>Caledonians</hi> were? Or, if <hi>Tacitus</hi> had known any such thing, would he have said, <hi>the</hi> Caledonians, <hi>by the habit of their bodies seemed to be of</hi> German <hi>Extraction,</hi> when he derives the <hi>Silures</hi> from <hi>Spain?</hi> Had it not been as easie for him to have derived the <hi>Caledonians</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi> through <hi>Ireland,</hi> if any such thing had been heard by him, as that the <hi>Caledonians</hi> were of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and came first out of <hi>Spain</hi> thither? But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more plain than that <hi>Tacitus</hi> took the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonians</hi> for <hi>Britains,</hi> and so doth <hi>Galgacus,</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Speech, wherein he calls them, <hi>the Noblest of the</hi> Britains, and excites them to recover <hi>the Liberty of the</hi> Britains; and tells them, <hi>they fought the same Cause with the other</hi> Britains; <hi>and now they were to shew what sort of Men</hi> Caledonia <hi>had reserved for their common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Was <hi>Tacitus</hi> so inconsiderate a Writer to put such words into <hi>Galgacus</hi> his mouth, if he knew or suspected the <hi>Caledonians</hi> to be no <hi>Britains,</hi> but a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nation</hi> come out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the time that <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> took <hi>Babylon?</hi> Had <hi>Tacitus</hi> known any thing of this, he would never have concealed it, when he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himself upon his Integrity, in relating what he could find about the Affairs of <hi>Britain.</hi> And therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> his <hi>Judgment</hi> in this matter is to be much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Criticism about the <hi>Scoto-bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes,</hi> or the <hi>Scoticae pruinae</hi> in <hi>Spartian</hi>'s Poet; or any such uncertain Conjectures. And yet the <hi>Scoto-bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes</hi> might be <hi>Irish</hi>; where both <hi>Scoti</hi> and <hi>Brigantes</hi> were, and so it proves nothing, as to <hi>Britain</hi>; for <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> conquer'd <hi>Ireland</hi> as much as <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>

because</hi> Gildas, <hi>after he had mention'd the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Picts, <hi>here names the</hi> Irish <hi>Robbers.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Gildas</hi> before doth mention <hi>the Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>; but in this Place he onely speaks of <hi>the Irish</hi> and <hi>the Picts,</hi> which is an Argument on the other side.

                  <hi>Gildas</hi> which seems to imply <hi>that it was their Custome to inhabit this Countrey,</hi> but <hi>Solito more</hi> being there used, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then supposed out of <hi>Britain,</hi> the word <hi>Inhabit</hi> can onely imply making <hi>a longer stay</hi> here, as they were wont to doe when they had Success.

               <p>From this time <hi>Gildas</hi> onely mentions <hi>the Vices</hi> and <hi>the Fears,</hi> and another great Plague among the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> before he comes to that <hi>pernicious Counsel,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>for sending for the</hi> Saxons <hi>by</hi> Vortigern.</p>
               <p>But before I speak of that, while we are upon this Head of the <hi>Britains</hi> being thus exposed to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it will be needfull to enquire what that <hi>Legionary Assistence</hi> was which is mention'd in the <hi>Notitia Imperii,</hi> and at what time that was made; For if the Common Opinion be true, that it was made after the time of <hi>Honorius,</hi> then <hi>Britain</hi> could not have been left so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of <hi>Roman Assistence</hi> as <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> say.

                  <hi>Adamus Bremensis</hi> gives another Reason for it, saying, <hi>That</hi> Jutland <hi>was the most uncultivated part of all</hi> Germany, <hi>and the least fit for humane habitation, being so barren and unfruitfull, and so obnoxious to Pirates from both Seas.</hi> But since the <hi>Saxons, Angles</hi> and <hi>Jutes,</hi> coming into <hi>Britain,</hi> took Possession of so great a part of it, as our <hi>Historians</hi> tell us, viz. <hi>The</hi> Jutes, Kent, <hi>the Isle of</hi> Wight <hi>and part of</hi> Hampshire; <hi>The</hi> Saxons, Sussex, Essex, Middlesex, <hi>the South part of</hi> Hartfordshire, Surrey, <hi>the other part of</hi> Hampshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Devonshire <hi>and part of</hi> Cornwall; <hi>The</hi> Angles, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, <hi>the Midland and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Counties</hi>; It deserves to be considered whether, since there were so few Inhabitants then in <hi>Jutland</hi> and so many <hi>Saxons</hi> left behind, there be not far greater
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:62156:202"/>
probability that these should come from all the <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Coasts</hi> from the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Jutland,</hi> than merely out of such an <hi>unpeopled Countrey</hi> as that was. I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the distinction of People that <hi>Bede</hi> mentions, nor their coming <hi>originally</hi> out of <hi>Jutland,</hi> or rather through <hi>Jutland:</hi> But, I think, all Circumstances considered, it is more probable that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> before that time, were come nearer to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and so had greater Conveniency of removing themselves over in such great Numbers into <hi>Britain,</hi> as they did upon <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi>'s Invitation, and the Discontents which soon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd between the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Britains.</hi>

               <p>And it is observable, That those who inlarge the Bounds of the <hi>Saxons</hi> do take notice of a difference in their Situation agreeable to what <hi>Bede</hi> saith; For <note n="(p)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Reinerus Reineccius,</hi> a Learned <hi>German</hi> Antiquary, saith, <hi>The</hi> Saxons <hi>were divided into three sorts,</hi> the <hi>Ostva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> or the <hi>Eastern Saxons,</hi> whom the <hi>Old</hi> Saxon <hi>Poet</hi> calls <hi>Osterlingi, whose Limits extended,</hi> he saith, <hi>as far as the</hi> Slavi, <hi>i. e.</hi> beyond <hi>the River</hi> Elb; the <hi>Westvali,</hi> whose Bounds, he saith, <hi>came very near the</hi> Rhine; And between these, he saith, were the <hi>Angarii,</hi> just as <hi>Bede</hi> puts his <hi>Angli,</hi> between the <hi>Jutes</hi> and the <hi>Saxons.</hi>

               <p>If this Division of the <hi>Saxons</hi> be allow'd, we have here scope enough for all those People to live in who came over into <hi>Britain,</hi> and number enough to come hither, and yet not to leave the Places desolate whence they came. And it is not improbable that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations thrusting one another forwards, for a greater Conveniency of living, those <hi>Saxons</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about <hi>Holstein</hi> might come into <hi>Westphaliae,</hi> and so be nearest to the <hi>Rhine</hi>; The <hi>Angli</hi> came into the Place where the <hi>Angrivarii</hi> are seated; And the most remote Inhabitants of the <hi>Chersonese,</hi> would then be the <hi>Oster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> or the <hi>Eastern Saxons.</hi> This, upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, seems to me the most probable way of reconciling what <hi>Bede</hi> saith with the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of those times, and with the <hi>Frisians</hi> coming in together with the

                  <hi>British History</hi> would clear the matter, if it deserved Credit, for there we reade, <hi>That</hi> Aurelius Ambrosius <hi>was one of the younger Sons of</hi> Constantine, <hi>King of</hi> Britain, <hi>who was forced to fly from</hi> Vortigern <hi>after the Murther of their Brother</hi> Constans <hi>by his contrivance.</hi> But we know that <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Constans</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> were killed abroad; and it is not probable the <hi>Romans</hi> would have permitted any one of his Sons to have remained here; or, if they did, this <hi>Ambrosius</hi> must have been of Ripe years for Government long before this time. For <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Life was taken away when <hi>Theodosius</hi> was IV. <hi>Consul,</hi> as <hi>Idatius</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus</hi> agree, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 411. So that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62156:204"/>
                  <hi>Ambrosius</hi> could not be very young when <hi>Vortigern</hi> took the Government, in whose fourth year, they say, <hi>The</hi> Saxons <hi>were called in.</hi> But there is another Passage in <hi>Gildas</hi> which helps to explain this: For he saith, <hi>That after they found themselves deserted by the</hi> Romans, <hi>they set up Kings of their own, and soon after put them down again, and made choice of worse in their room</hi>; This set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Kings he expresses by their <hi>being anointed</hi>; whether that Custome were then used or not, it is plain, that he supposes that the <hi>Britains,</hi> in that Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were in, took upon them, without regard to their Duty, to place and displace them. But that he takes <hi>anointing</hi> in a <hi>metaphorical</hi> Sense appears by what follows, <hi>That the Anointers were those who destroy'd them.</hi> Among these in all probability was the Father of <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> and the rather because, it is said, <hi>he was of</hi> Roman <hi>Descent:</hi> For the <hi>Britains</hi> thought none then able to defend them that had not a <hi>Roman Spirit</hi> in him. At this time the <hi>Britains</hi> were left to their full Liberty by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which, as <note n="(e)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Bede</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons, <hi>had the Dominion here for</hi> 470 <hi>years</hi>; And then there was no Line remaining to succeed in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor so much as to determine their choice, which made them so easily to make and unmake their Kings, who lost their Purple and their Lives together. This must needs breed infinite Confusions among them; and every one who came to be King lived in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fear of being served as others had been before him; And the natural consequence of this Jealousie of their own Subjects was, looking out for Assistence from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, which I doubt not was one great Reason of <hi>Vortigern</hi>'s sending for the <hi>Saxons,</hi> hoping to secure himself by their means against his own People: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it proved at last the Ruine both of himself and his People. But this Jealousie could not but increase upon them, while there was a Person descended from a former King, and of <hi>Roman Parentage</hi> in being; So that <hi>Nennius</hi> seems to have hit upon one of the main <hi>Reasons</hi> which sway'd <hi>Vortigern</hi> to send for the <hi>Saxons.</hi>

                  <hi>Bede, the</hi> Saxons <hi>having burnt so many Cities and Towns, and driven the Remainder of the Inhabitants into inaccessible Places, did go home for some time,</hi> 
                  <q>And in that Interval, the dispersed <hi>Britains</hi> gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after most earnest Supplications to God, that they might not be utterly destroyed, they made choice of <hi>Ambrosius Aurelianus,</hi> as their King; and, under his Conduct, God was pleased to give them Success: And, from that time, saith <hi>Gildas,</hi> now one Party prevailed, and then another (whereby God made a farther Tryal of the <hi>Britains,</hi> whether they would love him or not) to the Battel on <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Hill,</hi> wherein the <hi>Saxons</hi> suffer'd so great a Loss; Which was forty four years after their first coming hither, as appears more plainly by <hi>Bede.</hi>

to <hi>Leland,</hi> flourished in the time of <hi>H.</hi> I.

               <p>As to what he next adds, <hi>That after his Victory over the</hi> Saxons, Aurelius Ambrosius <hi>called the Princes and Great Men together at</hi> York, <hi>and gave order for repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Churches which the</hi> Saxons <hi>destroyed,</hi> there is far greater probability in it.

               <p>But what then is to be said to King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Vther,</hi> and succeeded him, whose mighty Feats are so amply related by the <hi>British</hi> History?

of others. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newburgh</hi> was the first who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and in plain terms charged it with <hi>falsity</hi> and <hi>inconsistency</hi>; but against some parts of it he makes <hi>trifling objections</hi>; as about the <hi>Three Archbishops,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that the <hi>Britains</hi> had any <hi>Archbishops,</hi> because the first <hi>Pall</hi> was given to <hi>Augustine</hi> the <hi>Monk.</hi> But this was a piece of Monkish ignorance in him, for there were <hi>Metropolitans</hi> before, and without <hi>Palls</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi>; and <hi>Archbishops</hi> or <hi>Metropolitans</hi> did assume the use of <hi>Palls</hi> to themselves, without asking the <hi>Pope</hi>'s leave; and when he saith <hi>Archbishops came so late into the Western Churches,</hi> it is true the use of the <hi>word</hi> did, but the <hi>jurisdiction</hi> over <hi>Provinces</hi> was long before, as I have already shew'd.</p>
               <p>Upon the reviving of Learning some were so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this <hi>ridiculous Legend,</hi> that they questioned whether ever there were such a Person as <hi>Arthur,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom <hi>Leland</hi> undertook the defence of King <hi>Arthur.</hi> But some of his <hi>Authours</hi> will not be allow'd to bear witness in this cause, being partial followers of <hi>Geffrey</hi>; such as <hi>Alfred</hi> of <hi>Beverly, Gray</hi> the Authour of <hi>Scalae-Chronicon, Joh. Burgensis, Joh. Ross, &amp;c.</hi> Others do not speak home to the point, such are the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Nennius, Malmsbury, Huntingdon,</hi> which make him onely <hi>General of the</hi> British <hi>Forces:</hi> others are too <hi>modern,</hi> as <hi>Trithemius, Volaterranus, Philippus Bergomas, Nauclerus, Hector Boethius, Pontius Virunni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;c.</hi> Others overthrow the main part of it, as to Arthur<hi>'s Sovereign Dominion in</hi> Britain, as the <hi>Chronica Divionensis,</hi> which saith, <hi>That after several Combats</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic <hi>had the possession of the West</hi> Saxon <hi>Kingdom by</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur<hi>'s consent:</hi> and as parts of this Kingdom he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons <hi>Seven whole Provinces from</hi> Surry <hi>to</hi> Cornwall. But the <hi>British History</hi> takes no notice of <hi>Cerdic,</hi> but supposes all under <hi>Arthur</hi>'s command, and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Mordred</hi>'s in his absence. If <hi>Cerdic</hi> had the <hi>West</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Saxon <hi>Kingdom,</hi> then how comes no notice of him in the Battel at <hi>Camblan?</hi> how came the fight within his Territories? Again, the <hi>Authour</hi> of the Life of <hi>Gildas</hi> cited by him, saith,<note place="margin">

and the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Letters; but the modesty of the <hi>Inscription</hi> is a better Argument to me, for if the <hi>Monks</hi> designed a Cheat in <hi>Heu.</hi> II. his time, and laid this <hi>Coffin</hi> there on purpose to deceive, they might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit such Letters, but they could never have held from speaking more glorious things of so great a <hi>Heroe.</hi> Then he produced the Testimonies of <hi>Nennius,</hi>

                  <hi>Olaus Rudbeck</hi> thinks the former more proper, not onely from <hi>Bede</hi>'s Authority, but because in the old <hi>Runick Fasti</hi> a <hi>Wheel</hi> was used to denote that <hi>Festival:</hi> And as he observes, <hi>this Festival continued twelve days from their first of the</hi> Juul.

                     <hi>p.</hi> 100.</note> from the <hi>Joy</hi> they had at the hopes of <hi>the return of the Sun</hi>; at which time they made <hi>Solemn Sacrifices</hi> to the <hi>Sun.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Christianity</hi> prevailed, all their <hi>Idolatrous Sacrifices</hi> were laid aside, and this time of <hi>Feasting</hi> was joined with the <hi>Religious Solemnities</hi> of that Season, which in other parts of the World were observed by <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Which is certainly a very different thing from the <hi>Roman Saturnalia,</hi> although <hi>Buchanan</hi> thought fit to parallel them.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with the Story of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> as it is in <hi>Buchanan,</hi> who takes his Materials from <hi>Hector,</hi> and puts them into a finer dress. <hi>Arthur,</hi> he saith, <hi>made a League with the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Picts, <hi>and</hi> Lothus <hi>brought his Sons to him: And then a resolution was taken to drive out the</hi> Saxons, <hi>and to restore Christianity; Then follow'd the Battel against</hi> Colgrin; of which before: And the rest of <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Battels: But upon the whole, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>that</hi> Geffrey<hi>'s Relations have no colour of Truth</hi>; and yet he makes use of no other, but where he follows <hi>Hector</hi>'s own inventions. The remainder of his Story is, <q>That things being quieted here, <hi>Arthur</hi> goes over into <hi>Lesser Britain,</hi> and leaves the <hi>Government</hi> to his Nephew <hi>Mordred</hi>; But while he was abroad, some had prevailed with him to declare <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Cador</hi> his Successour being born in <hi>Britain</hi>; which being done, <hi>Mordred</hi> set up for himself, and in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel about <hi>Humber,</hi> saith he, <hi>Mordred</hi> was killed, and <hi>Arthur</hi> mortally wounded.</q> Thus <hi>Buchanan</hi> having
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:62156:218"/>
picked what he thought fit out of <hi>Hector,</hi> concludes with a bitter <hi>Invective</hi> against the fabulous Relations about <hi>Arthur</hi>; But he gives him an extraordinary Character, saying, <hi>he was certainly a great Man, of mighty Courage and wonderfull kindness to his Countrey, preserving them from Slavery, and keeping up or restoring the true Religion.</hi>

His <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Education</hi> is said to have been under <hi>Pauleus</hi> or <hi>Paulinus</hi> a Disciple of St. <hi>German</hi>; with whom he continued <hi>ten years</hi>; in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> saith <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> but it seems more probable to have been <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>Caermardenshire</hi>; the School of <hi>Iltutus</hi> being not far off in <hi>Glamorganshire</hi> at <hi>Lantwitt, i. e.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62156:220"/>
it is not to be wondred, that in such a distracted time at home, they should go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 17.</note> Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> in his time mentions <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>going thither</hi>; especially such as were more inclined to <hi>Devotion</hi>; which humour spread so much, that <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> wrote against it, as a thing very much tending to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> if not arising from it. But it was most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable in such a troublesome time at home. Not long after his return, the famous Synod at <hi>Brevy</hi> was held at a place called <hi>Lhandewy-brevy,</hi> the <hi>Church of Saint</hi> David <hi>at</hi> Brevy. Here the <hi>Vtrecht MS.</hi> saith, <hi>was a Synod assembled of all the Bishops of</hi> Britain <hi>upon the account of the Pelagian Controversie then revived. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi> saith, <hi>It was a general Convention of Clergy and Laity.</hi> But the former MS. saith, <hi>there were present</hi> 118. <hi>Bishops, besides Abbats and others.</hi> One would think it hard to find so many <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> at that time: And <hi>Bollandus</hi> startles at it, but <hi>Colganus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to defend it; having premised that <hi>Giraldus</hi> and <hi>Capgrave</hi> leave it out; But he saith, <hi>there were more Bishops at that time than afterwards; and more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops than Bishopricks, Dioceses not being then so limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as afterwards; And every Monastery almost having a Bishop its Superiour; By which means he justifies Saint</hi> Patrick<hi>'s consecrating,</hi> as <hi>Jocelin</hi> saith, 350 <hi>Bishops with his own hands.</hi> But after all this, <hi>Giraldus</hi> did much better to omit such a number in such a time, unless there were better Testimony concerning it. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there was a considerable number there present, <hi>yet St.</hi> David <hi>was absent,</hi> and first <hi>Paulinus</hi> was sent to him, but he prevailed not, then <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Dubricius</hi> went, upon whose intreaty he came, and by his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> put an effectual stop to <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism:</hi> And before the end of the <hi>Synod</hi> it is said, <hi>That by general Consent he was chosen Archbishop of</hi> Caerleon, Dubricius <hi>desiring to retire on the account of his Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here we meet with a considerable difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Succession</hi> to <hi>Dubricius, viz.

                  </gap> Sermon to <hi>Calixtus</hi> 2. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1109. saith, <hi>That it appears by the hand writing of St.</hi> Teliaus, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Landaff <hi>was superiour in dignity to all other Churches in</hi> Wales. That which seems to me the most probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this matter is, That when <hi>Landaff</hi> was given to <hi>Dubricius</hi> then <hi>Archbishop,</hi> he fixed his <hi>See</hi> there, and so <hi>Landaff</hi> was the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Archbishop of <hi>Caerleon.</hi> But afterwards when St. <hi>David</hi> removed the Archiepiscopal <hi>See</hi> to <hi>Menevia,</hi> a remote, barren and inconvenient place, as <hi>Giraldus</hi> himself confesseth; The Bishops of <hi>Landaff</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the <hi>Archiepiscopal Power,</hi> which had been in that <hi>See,</hi> and would not submit to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of St. <hi>Davids.</hi> This is apparent from that passage of <hi>Oùdocëus</hi> (who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Theliaus</hi>) in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Landaff,</hi> that he would not receive <hi>Consecration</hi> from the Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> as his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> but had it from the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi> This is a very improbable thing at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the hatred the <hi>Britains</hi> did bear to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and their <hi>Bishops</hi> to <hi>Augustin</hi> the Monk: It is far more likely that they received it from the Archbishop of <hi>Dole</hi> in <hi>Britany</hi>; or from the Archbishop of <hi>London</hi> then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in those parts; who probably kept up their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for some time, as long as there were any hopes of returning to their own See, as is before observed.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Giraldus</hi> speaks of another <hi>great Council</hi>

held by St. <hi>David,</hi> which he calls <hi>Victoria</hi>; in which he saith <hi>all the Clergy of</hi> Wales <hi>were present; And the Decrees of the former Council were confirmed, and new Canons made for the Government of the</hi> British <hi>Churches</hi>; But this <hi>Second Synod</hi> is not mentioned in the old <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht MS.</hi> nor in <hi>Capgrave,</hi> but it is in <hi>Colganus,</hi> and by the <hi>Expressions</hi> it appears to have been taken out of <hi>Giraldus,</hi> who confesseth, <hi>that no Copies of those Canons were to be seen in his time, that Coast being so often visited by Pirats,</hi> (who no doubt came to steal MSS. and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Church-Canons.</hi>) I will not deny that the <hi>British</hi> Churches at that time, and in those parts might be said to be in a flourishing condition in comparison with other parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> and there might be more Christians there, because they had been driven out from other places; and their Brethrens afflictions might encrease their Devotion; But <hi>Gildas</hi> takes no more Notice of St. <hi>David</hi> than he doth of King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi> The <hi>Battel</hi> at <hi>Badon-hill</hi> according to Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Vsher,</hi> was the year after the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Brevy,</hi> and from that time <hi>the</hi> British <hi>Churches</hi> had some quiet from their Enemies: But then <note n="u" place="margin">Gild. § 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Gildas</hi> saith, <hi>The</hi> Britains <hi>quarrelled among themselves; but yet so as that some kind of Order and Government was then kept up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, by the Remembrance of their late Calamities.</hi> And at this time he speaks the best of the <hi>Britains,</hi> that he doth in his whole Book; for he saith, <hi>That Kings and Publick and Private Persons, Bishops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churchmen</hi> (for <hi>Sacerdotes</hi> in that Age often sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Gildas</hi> calls it <hi>Sacerdotalem Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus Sedem) did all keep to the Duty of their places.</hi> But then he adds, <hi>when the Sense of these Calamities was worn out, and a new Generation arose, they fell into such a degeneracy as to cast off all the Reins of Truth and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, that no remainder of it appear'd in any sort of Men, except a few, a very few, whose number was so small in comparison with the rest, that the Church could hardly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern its genuine Children when they lay in her Bosome.</hi>

               <p>But before I come to this last and saddest part of the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>British Churches</hi> it will be necessary now to give some Account of those <hi>Britains,</hi> who being wearied out here went for Refuge to that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which from them is called <hi>Bretagn.</hi>

                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:62156:221"/>It seems hard to determine when the first <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Britains</hi> was setled in the parts of <hi>Aremorica.</hi> For in the declining times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there was so frequent occasion of the <hi>British</hi> Souldiers removing into the <hi>Continent,</hi> and so little encouragement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hither, that it is not improbable, that after the Troubles of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> a <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> might settle themselves upon the <hi>Sea Coasts</hi> near to <hi>Britain,</hi> where they might be ready to receive or to go over to their Countrymen; as the Condition of affairs should happen. This I am very much indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe, not from the Authority of <hi>Nennius,</hi> or <hi>Geffrey,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> or <hi>Radulphus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c.</hi> but from these Arguments;</p>
               <p>First from <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi>; and there are two passages in him which tend to the clearing this matter, the first is concerning <hi>Aruandus</hi> accused at <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Treason,</hi> in the time of <hi>Anthemius,</hi> for persuading the <hi>King of the</hi> Goths to make War upon the <hi>Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, i. e. Anthemius,</hi> who came out of <hi>Greece,</hi> and upon <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>on the</hi> Loir, as <note n="w" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Sidonius Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> expresly affirms, who lived at that time, and pitied his case. This hapned about <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 467. before <hi>Anthemius</hi> was the second time Consul. From whence it appears, not onely that there were <hi>Britains</hi> then settled on the <hi>Loir,</hi> but that their <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Forces</hi> were considerable, which cannot be supposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of such miserable People as fled from hence for fear of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> And it is observable, that about this time <hi>Ambrosius</hi> had success against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and by <hi>Vortimer</hi>'s means, or his, the <hi>Britains</hi> were in great likelihood of driving them out of <hi>Britain</hi>; so that there is no probability that the Warlike <hi>Britains</hi> should at that time leave their Native Countrey. A second passage is concerning <hi>Riothamus,</hi> a King of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> in the time of <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> and to whom he wrote, who went with 12000 <hi>Britains</hi> to assist the <hi>Romans</hi> against <hi>Euricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> but were intercepted by him, as <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Rebus Get. c.</hi> 45.</note> 
                  <hi>Jornandes</hi> relates the Story, and <hi>Sigebert</hi> places it <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 470. Now what clearer Evidence can be desired than this, to prove that a considerable Number of <hi>Britains</hi> were there settled, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62156:222"/>
in a condition not onely to defend themselves, but to assist the <hi>Romans</hi>; which cannot be imagined of such as merely fled thither after the <hi>Saxons</hi> coming into <hi>Britain.</hi> Besides we find in <hi>Sirmondus</hi> his <hi>Gallican</hi> Councils, <hi>Mansuetus</hi> a Bishop of the <hi>Britains</hi> subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the first <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Tours,</hi> which was held <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 461. By which we see the <hi>Britains</hi> had so full a settlement then, as not onely to have <hi>Habitations,</hi> but a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> of their own; which was the great incouragement for other <hi>Britains</hi> to go over, when they found themselves so hard pressed by the <hi>Saxons</hi> at home. For a People frighted from hence, would hardly have ventured into a foreign Countrey, unless they had been secure before hand of a kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception there. If they must have fought for a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there, had they not far better have done it in their own Countrey? From whence I conclude, that there was a large <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>Aremorica</hi> before those Numbers went over upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> Cruelties; of which <note n="z" place="margin">

                  <hi>Eginhardus</hi> and other foreign <hi>Historians</hi> speak.

                  <hi>Florentius</hi> the Authour of the Life of <hi>Judo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> Son to a King of <hi>Bretagn</hi> saith, <hi>That his Name was</hi> Rioval, <hi>a Prince here in</hi> Britain, <hi>who gathered a good Army and Fleet together, and with that subdued the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who lived on the</hi> Aremorican <hi>Coasts, being then left destitute and unable to defend themselves.</hi> For that was the effect of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, which was kept up by the force of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in all parts of it, and so when these were broken, the <hi>Nations</hi> were so unaccustomed to War, that they lay open to all <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> So that the <hi>Aggressors</hi> did generally succeed in their attempts where the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn: and next to the wise Providence of God which ordereth all things, there was no one cause which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed so much to the miseries of those times, and the strange Revolutions which hapned in them, as the <hi>Natives</hi> being not trained up to <hi>Martial Discipline,</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:62156:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but depending wholly on the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions for their Defence and security; thence, whatever People had the Courage to invade, did usually take possession of the <hi>Countrey</hi> where the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions were at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or otherwise engaged against each other. Thus in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> the <hi>Franks,</hi> and the <hi>Britains</hi> took possession of the several parts they attempted; and the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> So <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> it self. So that it is not to be wondred, if the <hi>Saxons</hi> prevailed here at last; but with as much difficulty, and after as many <hi>Battels,</hi> as were fought by any People of that time without fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Assistence. But to return to the <hi>Aremorican Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> whether they came over under <hi>Rioval</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>distractions</hi> here, <hi>when the People were so Rebellious against their Princes,</hi> as <hi>Gildas</hi> relates, or whether they went over to assist <hi>Constantine</hi> and his <hi>Son,</hi> and so remained there, I shall not determin. But that the <hi>Britains</hi> were well settled there before <hi>Sampson</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> and his Company passed the Seas, appears by what <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Mat.

Paris</hi> there relates: Who states the Case very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully, laying the weight of it upon <hi>the Archbishop's bringing over his Pall from</hi> York, which the <hi>Pope</hi> had given him there. Suppose this were true (although the <hi>Popes</hi> gave no <hi>Palls</hi> then, nor a great while after) yet this were no reason to contest it in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> so long together.

was there why the Bishop of <hi>Dole</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Bretagn</hi> should yield subjection to the Bishop of <hi>Tours</hi> in a distinct <hi>Kingdom?</hi> and there was the fairer Colour for this when one actually an <hi>Archbishop</hi> before came to be settled there; and from hence they insisted on a <hi>Prescription</hi> of a very long time, wherein no <hi>Subjection</hi> had been made to the Bishop of <hi>Tours,</hi> as appears by the account given of this Cause by <note n="(c)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Paul</hi> made on the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Behold the goodness and severity of God; on them which fell severity, but towards thee goodness; if thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains onely, that we consider the <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Independency</hi> of the <hi>British Churches</hi>; of which we can have no greater Proof than from the <hi>Carriage</hi> of the <hi>British Bishops</hi> towards <hi>Augustin</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> when he came with <hi>full power</hi> from the <hi>Pope</hi> to require <hi>Subjection</hi> from them. And this material point relating to the <hi>British Churches</hi> I shall endeavour to clear from all the <hi>Objections</hi> which have been made against it. In order thereto, we are to understand, That <note n="(l)" place="margin">Bed. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> by virtue of the <hi>Pope's Authority,</hi> did challenge <hi>a Superiority over the Bishops of the</hi> British <hi>Churches,</hi> which appears not onely by <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Answer to his <hi>Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> but by the <hi>Scheme</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government</hi> here, which <hi>Gregory</hi> sent to him, after he had a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which was at the same time that he sent <hi>Mellitus, Justus, Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finianus,</hi> with the <hi>Archiepiscopal Pall</hi> to him. There he declares that there were to be two <hi>Archbishops Sees,</hi> one at <hi>London</hi> (which out of honour to <hi>Ethelbert</hi> or <hi>Augustin</hi> was fixed at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or rather by <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s own Authority) and the other at <hi>York,</hi> which had been a <hi>Metropolitan See</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> times, and both these <hi>Archbishops</hi> were to have twelve <hi>Suffragan Bishops</hi> under them. The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was to be consecrated by his <hi>own Synod,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Pall</hi> from the <hi>Pope</hi>; But <hi>Augustin</hi> was to appoint the first Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was to yield <hi>Subjection</hi> to him for his time, but afterwards <hi>the Sees</hi> were to be <hi>Independent</hi> on each other. But by all this, it should seem, <hi>that he had Authority given him onely over those
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62156:224"/>
Bishops who were consecrated by him, And the Archbishop of</hi> York; what then becomes of those Bishops in <hi>Britain</hi> who were <hi>Consecrated</hi> by neither, and such they knew there were? Concerning these <hi>Gregory</hi> gives a plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>That they were all to be subject to the Authority of</hi> Augustine; <hi>and to govern themselves in Life and Doctrine and Church Offices according to his Direction. Augustine</hi> being furnished with such <hi>full Powers,</hi> as he thought, desires a <hi>Meeting</hi> with the <hi>British Bishops,</hi> at a place called <hi>Augustinsac,</hi> as <note n="(m)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Bede</hi> saith, in the <hi>Confines</hi> of the <hi>Wiccii</hi> and the <hi>West Saxons.</hi> Where this place was is very uncertain, and not at all material; <hi>Camden</hi> could find nothing like it, and the <hi>Conjectures</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers since have no great probability, either as to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stric,</hi> or <hi>Haustake,</hi> or <hi>Ossuntree,</hi> but at this place, the <hi>British Bishops</hi> gave <hi>Augustine</hi> a Meeting; where the first thing proposed by him was, <hi>That they would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Vnity of the Catholick Church, and then join with them in Preaching to the Gentiles, for,</hi> saith he, <hi>they did many things repugnant to the Vnity of the Church</hi>; Which was in plain terms to charge them with <hi>Schism</hi>; and the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> offer'd, did imply <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by consequence to his <hi>Authority</hi> over them. But the utmost that could be obtained from them, was onely <hi>that they would take farther advice, and give another Meeting, with a greater Number.</hi> And then were present <hi>Seven Bishops of the</hi> Britains, <hi>and many Learned Men, chiefly of the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of</hi> Banchor, <hi>where</hi> Dinoth <hi>was then Abbat</hi>; And the <hi>Result</hi> of this <hi>Meeting</hi> was, <hi>That they utterly refused Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>or to</hi> Augustine <hi>as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop over them.</hi> And for the Account of this, we are beholding to <hi>Bede,</hi> whose Authority is liable to no exception in this matter.</p>
               <p>But against this plain Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> there have been three <hi>Objections</hi> made which must be removed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Augustine</hi> did not require <hi>Subjection</hi> from the <hi>British Bishops,</hi> but onely treated with them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other matters in difference between them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their refusing <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> depends upon the <hi>Credit</hi> of a <hi>Spurious</hi> British <hi>MS.</hi>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:62156:225"/>
lately invented and brought into light, as the Answer of <hi>Dinoth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That if they did refuse <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> it was <hi>Schismatical Obstinacy</hi> in them, and contrary to the former <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>British Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all these I shall give a clear and full Answer.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As to the matter of their <hi>Conference,</hi> it cannot be denied that other things were started; as about the <hi>Paschal Controversie</hi> and some <hi>Rites</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> &amp;c. but this was the main point; which <hi>Augustine</hi> did not in plain Terms insist upon, because it would look too invidiously to require <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> but he cunningly insinuates it under the Name of <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Vnity.</hi> For I dare appeal to any Man's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, whether upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>British Bishops</hi> complying in other things and rejecting the <hi>Pope's Authority</hi> would have been thought sufficient? If so, then <hi>Submission</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> is no necessary term of <hi>Communion</hi>; and Men may be in a very safe Condition without it. But if it were necessary, then <hi>Augustine</hi> must imply it within the terms of <hi>Catholick Peace</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Vnity.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ridiculous in <note n="(n)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Cressy,</hi> and such Writers to say, <hi>That</hi> Augustine <hi>did not insist upon it:</hi> For it is to charge him with <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Stupidity,</hi> that he should leave out so necessary an Article of <hi>Communion:</hi> And yet <hi>Gregory</hi> had so great an opinion of him, as to make him <hi>the Directour of the</hi> British <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> And therefore it cannot be supposed that he should offer terms of <hi>Communion</hi> without requiring <hi>Submission</hi> to the <hi>Pope's Authority</hi>; if those were in a state of <hi>Schism</hi> who denied it.</p>
               <p>But it is said, <hi>That in the Conclusion of the second Meeting,</hi> Augustine <hi>did not insist upon, nor so much as mention any subjection to him from the</hi> British <hi>Churches, but onely required Compliance in three Points,</hi> viz. <hi>the time of the Paschal Solemnity agreeable with the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>following the</hi> Roman <hi>Customes in Baptism; and joining with them in Preaching to the</hi> Saxons; <hi>and upon these they brake up the Meeting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:62156:225"/>To which I Answer.</p>
               <p>That these things were required by <hi>Augustin,</hi> not as <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Brotherly Communion,</hi> but as the <hi>Marks of Subjection</hi> to his <hi>Authority</hi>; which appears from <hi>Bede</hi>'s own Words, <hi>Si in tribus his mihi obtemperare vultis, &amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>Cressy</hi> very unfaithfully renders, <hi>If they would conform in three points onely:</hi> Whereas the meaning is, If they would own his <hi>Authority</hi> in those <hi>three things</hi>; and therefore the <hi>British Bishops</hi> answered very appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely, when they said, <hi>we will neither doe the things nor submit to you as Archbishop over us.</hi> Why should they deny <hi>Subjection</hi> if it had not been required of them? Which shews they very well understood his meaning, and gave Answer in short, to the main point. And upon this Account I suppose it was, that, the <hi>Anchoret</hi>'s advice was followed about observing <hi>Whether he rose up to the</hi> British <hi>Bishops at their entrance</hi>; Not that they were so offended for want of a <hi>Complement,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> suggests, but this was look'd on by them, as a <hi>Mark</hi> of that <hi>Superiority</hi> which he challenged over them; And therefore they had reason to take so great notice of it, and to infer harder usage from him, when they should be under his <hi>Authority.</hi> They could not be ignorant what <hi>Authority</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> had given <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> and that made them more <hi>Observant</hi> of his whole Behaviour, and finding it so agreeing to the <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of an <hi>Archbishop</hi> over <hi>the</hi> British <hi>Churches,</hi> They give him that Resolute Answer, <hi>That they would not own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authority he had as Archbishop over them.</hi> Which is a sufficient proof, that this was really the main point contested between them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As to the <hi>British MS.</hi> which contains <hi>Dinoth</hi>'s Answer more at large; I Answer;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Script.</hi> in <hi>Dinoth.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Leland</hi> observes, <hi>That the</hi> British <hi>Writers give a more ample account of this Matter than is extant in</hi> Bede; who is very sparing in what concerns the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Affairs. But from them he saith, <hi>That</hi> Dinoth <hi>did at large dispute with great Learning and Gravity against receiving the authority of the Pope, or of</hi> Augustin; <hi>and defended the Power of the Archbishop of St.</hi> Davids; <hi>and affirmed it not to be for the</hi> British <hi>Interest to own either the</hi> Roman <hi>Pride or the</hi> Saxon <hi>Tyranny.</hi> And he finds
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62156:226"/>
fault with <hi>Gregory, for not admonishing the</hi> Saxons <hi>of their gross Vsurpations, against their Solemn Oaths</hi>; And adds, <hi>that it was their duty, if they would be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to restore their unjust and Tyrannical Power to those from whom they had taken it. For</hi> Dinoth, <hi>out of his great Learning could not but know, that the Pope under a pretence of bringing in the true Faith could not confirm them in their unjust Vsurpation. For if that should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no Princes could be safe in their Dominions.</hi> And no doubt the <hi>British Bishops</hi> looked upon this attempt of <hi>Augustin</hi> upon them to be the adding one <hi>Vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to another: Which made them so adverse to any <hi>Communication</hi> with the Missionaries which otherwise had been inexcusable.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The certainty of the <hi>British Churches</hi> rejecting the <hi>Pope's Authority,</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi>'s jurisdiction doth not depend upon the <hi>Credit</hi> of this <hi>British MS.</hi> for this is sufficiently clear from <hi>Bede</hi>'s own Words, wherein they declare, <hi>they would not own</hi> Augustin <hi>as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop over them.</hi> But if they had owned the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Authority,</hi> they ought to have <hi>Submitted</hi> to him, who acted by virtue of his <hi>Commission:</hi> And it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them at such a distance from <hi>Rome,</hi> to express their disowning his <hi>Authority</hi> more effectually than by <hi>rejecting</hi> him, whom he had sent to be <hi>Archbishop</hi> over them. And <hi>Nich. Trivet</hi> in his <hi>MS. History</hi> cited by Sir <hi>H.</hi> 
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. p.</hi> 111.</note> 
                  <hi>Spelman,</hi> saith expresly, <hi>that</hi> Augustin <hi>did demand Subjection from the</hi> Britains <hi>to him, as the Pope's Legate, but they refused it.</hi> So that if this <hi>MS.</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been heard of, the Matter of Fact had been never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless fully attested.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Objections</hi> against this <hi>MS.</hi> are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to destroy the <hi>Authority</hi> of it. Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> who sets it down at large in <hi>Welsh, English</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> tells from whom he had it, and exactly transcribed it, and that it appeared to him to have been an <hi>Old MS.</hi> taken out of an <hi>Older,</hi> but without <hi>Date</hi> or <hi>Authour,</hi> and believes it to be still in the <hi>Cotton Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Here is all the appearance of <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> that can be expected; and he was a Person of too great Judgment and Sagacity to be easily impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon by a modern Invention, or a <hi>new found Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule,</hi>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:62156:226"/>
as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> Phrases it. The substance of it is, That the <hi>Abbat of</hi> Banchor, in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>British Churches</hi> declares, <hi>That they owe the Subjection of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Kindness, and Charity to the Church of God, and to the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to all Christians: but other obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than that, they did not know to be due to him whom they called Pope; And for their parts they were under the Jurisdiction of the Bishop of</hi> Caerleon <hi>upon</hi> Usk, <hi>who was under God their Spiritual Overseer and Directour.</hi> But, say the Objectors, <hi>There was then no Bishop of</hi> Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon <hi>upon</hi> Usk, <hi>and had not been since the time the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Jurisdiction was by St.</hi> David <hi>transferr'd to</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevia. I grant that from the time of <hi>Dubricius</hi> the <hi>See</hi> was transferr'd first to <hi>Landaff,</hi> and then to St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> but this latter <hi>Translation</hi> was not agreed to by all the <hi>British Bishops</hi>; And it appears by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse, That the Bishops of <hi>Landaff</hi> did at that time when <hi>Oudocëus</hi> lived, challenge the <hi>Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power of</hi> Caerleon to themselves, and therefore would not be consecrated by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Davids.</hi> And <hi>Caerleon</hi> having been the ancient <hi>Metropolitical See,</hi> it was no absurdity at all to mention that in a Dispute which depended upon <hi>ancient Right.</hi> For the <hi>Authority</hi> over the <hi>British Churches</hi> was not upon the account of St. <hi>Davids</hi> or <hi>Landaff,</hi> but the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Right</hi> which belonged to the <hi>See of</hi> Caerleon. As if in the <hi>British</hi> times the <hi>Metropolitan See</hi> had been removed from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> what incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had it been in a dispute of <hi>Superiority</hi> to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the <hi>British Churches</hi> of these parts were under the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of the <hi>Archbishop of</hi> London, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at that time the <hi>See</hi> were removed to another place? And if this be all to make it appear to be a <hi>Forgery,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> pretends, for all that I can see, it may be a very ancient and genuine <hi>MS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Alford</hi> goes deeper, for he disproves it, <hi>because it contradicts the Sense of the</hi> British <hi>Churches before, which professed subjection to the</hi> Roman <hi>See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed to the purpose if it be well proved, which in the last place comes to be considered.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) To this purpose he alledges, (1.) <hi>The Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of St.</hi> David<hi>'s Synod by the Pope's Authority.</hi> But
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62156:227"/>
from whence hath he this? From no other Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony than that of <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> cited by Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> who in the same place confesses, <hi>That there was no Monument of those Synods at all remaining, nor of the Pope's Confirmation of them</hi>; and the other <hi>MSS.</hi> and <hi>Legends</hi> of St. <hi>David</hi>'s Life say not a Word of this. How then came <hi>Giraldus</hi> to affirm it? We are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Giraldus</hi> had a Cause depending in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, and he knew well enough what <hi>Doctrine</hi> was pleasing there, and therefore the <hi>Testimony</hi> of such a one, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no concurrent Evidence to support it is of very little force in this matter. (2.) He mentions the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Kentigern</hi> shew'd to the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>going seven times thither, and having at last his uncanonical Ordination purged, or confirmed by the Pope</hi>; as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> of his Legend relates. But this seems to me a senseless and ridiculous <hi>Legend:</hi> For as <note n="(r)" place="margin">13. <hi>Jan. Vit.</hi> Kentigern.</note> 
                  <hi>Bollandus</hi> observes, if <hi>Kentigern</hi> went seven times to <hi>Rome</hi> how came he to put off the <hi>Errour</hi> of his <hi>Consecration</hi> to the last? If it were good before, why not then? If naught before, then all the <hi>Acts</hi> performed by him by virtue of his first <hi>Consecration</hi> were invalid. But there is no more Errour supposed in the Consecration of <hi>Kenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> by one <hi>Bishop,</hi> than there was in that of <hi>Seruanus</hi> by <hi>Palladius,</hi> which as <note n="(s)" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Gest. Scot. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh. Major</hi> saith, <hi>was good in case of necessity.</hi> But the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Legends,</hi> living long after the times of the Persons, framed their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to the <hi>Customs</hi> of their own times; and because such a <hi>Consecration</hi> was not then held good, therefore the Authour of his <hi>Legend</hi> takes care to have that defect supplied at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make amends he saith, <hi>That</hi> Kentigern <hi>at his death recommended to his Disciples the Decrees of the Fathers, and the Customs of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> But what is this to the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Roman See</hi> from the general sense of the <hi>British Churches?</hi> What if <hi>Kentigern</hi> having been often at <hi>Rome,</hi> were pleased more with the <hi>Customs</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> than of the <hi>Britains?</hi> Doth it hence follow, that those <hi>Britains</hi> who maintained <hi>Customs contrary to the</hi> Romans, did think it necessary to conform to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the plain <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> is to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62156:227"/>
the contrary; and which hath far more authority than such <hi>Legends</hi> as these? (3.) Ninianus <hi>is</hi>

                  <hi>Alford</hi> insists on this Passage in <hi>Gildas, That they were more ambitious of Degrees in the Church than of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; And after a bitter <hi>Invective</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>Symoniacal Contracts,</hi> he adds, <hi>that where they were opposed they ran beyond Sea to compass their ends.</hi> Now saith <hi>Alford, whither should this be but to</hi> Rome? For as <hi>Leland</hi> observes in the Case of <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis, sunt enim omnia Venalia</hi> Romae: all things are bought and sold there; and therefore whither should such <hi>notorious Symoniacal Persons go, but to</hi> Rome? This is a very surprising Argument, and is more wisely past over by Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> than insisted on by <hi>Alford,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a horrible Reflexion on the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in those days. But to say Truth, there is not one Word of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Gildas</hi>; but if they will apply it to <hi>Rome,</hi> how can we help it?</p>
