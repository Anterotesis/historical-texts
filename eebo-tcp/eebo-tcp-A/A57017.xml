            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60622:3"/>
of the Engliſh; were but heavy and dull
Impoſtors, He is ſuch a pleaſant Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger.
And thou reſembleſt him in this,
that although thou art not altogether
ſo good a Droll, yet every man when
he reads thee, has a kind of tentation to
laughter. And yet thou for thy part ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
ſo grave and ſerious that thou wilt
eaſily pardon the Tranſlator of this,
having thy ſelfe ſo uſefully rendred
his jeſt into good earneſt: and I know
not perfectly whether he were thy
Originall, or but an imperfect Type, or
faint repreſentation of thee, a greater
Prophet to come. Thou haſt all along
his Style, Figures, and Policy, and all
but the profeſſion of Drollery. Thou
knoweſt as well how to wrap thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
in a cloud of generalities, that they
may not lye open to diſcovery or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
Do but look upon thy Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides,
and thou canſt tell us very
gravely that ſome body or other ſhal dy
next month, and as plainly forſeeſt the
fall of ſome great man in Auguſt, as we
mortalls the dropping of a Pomwater
<pb facs="tcp:60622:3"/>
in Autumn. In fine, thy Prophecies are
as ſure as Death: for Thoſe, as This, are
in themſelves certaine, but the Time,
Place, Manner, and Perſons, and ſuch
petty circumſtances, altogether uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Thou canſt, like him, Propheſie
of things paſt or preſent: but it will be
thy wiſdome to be more ſparing in
future Contingencies which depend
on the will of Man; and though Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
look upon us with a thouſand
Eyes, yet it is thought not to be able to
peepe into mens private Cloſſets, and
leſſe into the Cabinet of their Hearts;
or to diſcover the little Thefts of a
ſilver Spoon or Tankard, but ſuch as
thou imploieſt thy Nimble Mercuries
to ſteal. 'Tis true, There may be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
gueſſe at theſe events, but 'tis a
Caſting winter or ſummer, Croſſe or
Pile, on which ſide to be miſtaken; a
meere Handy Dandy, Even or Odd,
which is the right. 'Tis to venture thy
diſcretion at Paſſage, or, Moſt in three
throwes, in hope thou mayeſt have the
good luck to ſpeak truth. Our noble

the reaſon theſe bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions

under ground, when their Cures live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

ſhrine of the Saint that preſerved the
Paſſengers from a ſtorm, are to be ſeen
in their Chappells, but they who were
wrackt in the ſea had no ſuch Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nor is the ſame truth more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomly
expreſt by the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Hiſtorian our Nation
hath brought forth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh.</note> That
Prognoſtications of this kind are as
ſeed ſcattered in the vaſt Field of
Time; 'tis extreme ill hap, if none of
them take. Sure I am, Thine are thick
ſown, how thin ſoever they come up. If
it were not ſo, what need our Princes
allow ſuch exceſſive Penſions to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
honorable Spyes, and receive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
from abroad, when thou an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
<pb facs="tcp:60622:4"/>
Agent, who lyeſt lieger for the
ſphears, and art confederate with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
canſt more cheaply preſerve intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
above: when every Beam of the
Sun is a letter, and each Mote in it a
Character for thee to uncypher and
read over all the diſpatches of Fate.
And hence I believe ariſes the angry
conteſt between thee, and the Ignorant
ſawcy Divines, who pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a Heaven above Thine. They take
a bare word, which ſome hold to be
but a weak ſecurity, and believe upon
Parole: but thou wilt have Gods hand
and deed ſealed, and delivered to thy
Faith in a legible and ſhining Text.
There are that take thee to be not only
a diſcoverer, but a cauſe of thoſe Effects
thou fortelleſt. As the young Noſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus
ſet the City of Pouſlin on fire
which he Propheſied ſhould be burnt.
And <hi>Cardan</hi> that beſpake the time of
his owne death, would dy a volunteer
at that time to keep his word. Yet ſome
Malicious perſons ſuſpect thee to deal
not ſo much in <hi>Galileus</hi> his Tubes, as
<pb facs="tcp:60622:5"/>
thy Magicall looking glaſſe (thy <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Trinitatis</hi> upon Earth) wherein to
take the height of a match between
two ſtarrs when they ſhall meet <hi>in Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi>
and enter into the ſigne of <hi>Scorpio.</hi>
Others take thee to be a right Courtier
of Heaven that ever keepeſt in with the
Lord Aſcendant. If <hi>Saturn</hi> be depoſed,
quit him for a leaden melancholy
Planet, and turn thee to <hi>Jupiter</hi> in his
ſtead. Truly it is not unbecomming,
that he who ſtudies the meaſure of
Time, ſhould ſerve it. As for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
it contends for thee as the ſeven
Cities for thy fellow Poet <hi>Homer.</hi> Eſſex
pretends to thee by reaſon the Sun, thy
Prince, riſes from thence. And Surrey,
becauſe though it be barren and dry (as
thy language) yet it is miſtreſſe of a
clear Ayre, ſuch as that of Aſſyria
where thy Brethren the Chaldeans firſt
practis'd. And in Middleſex, though
moſt of the Native Gentlemen have
ſomewhat of the incivility and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Clownes, and the eminent
Clownes ſomewhat of the riches and
<pb facs="tcp:60622:5"/>
pride of the Gentlemen; yet both are
content and humble themſelves, and
purchaſe thee at the dear expence of
a Teſton. Onely they complain thou art
too negligent of the ſerious affaires of
thy lovers, and would read thee often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then they carry their Bible to
Church, If thou wouldſt quit this buſy
trade of Policy, which they think not
ſo proper, &amp; deal a little more in their
beloved Husbandry. They look upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
page of the Month to find, Cloudy
Dark, ſomewhat Cold, Thunder-like,
Inclining to rain, or, what like an Oracle
never fails, Variable wether. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to heare from thee under what
Signe it is ſafeſt to cut their Cocks or
their Pigs, when to plough or ſow,
when to plant or graft Trees or inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
their Vines, with the likelieſt hope
of fruit. They itch to be inſtructed when
are the Quarterly or Monthly Tearms;
what is the wide difference betwixt
St. Lucies might, and St. Barnabyes,
and the effects of a ſhowry St. Swethins,
or a ſhiny Candlemas. When a deare
<pb facs="tcp:60622:6"/>
year is a comming, for Sordido to hoard
up his Corn. And the Epicure longs
to know from thee when Oyſters are
fulleſt and fatteſt; and the very minute
and ſecond, when Venſon or Lobſters
goe out of ſeaſon. If thou didſt but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them with theſe uſefull diſcourſes
they ſweare to do nothing without
thee. Not to eat or drink without thy
licence. Not to goe to ſtoole unleſſe
Mercury be Retrograde. Nor to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
but by ſtar light. Nor to Court
without enquiry, if Jupiter be ſtirring.
The goodwif would not ſow her Leeks
or Onyons but under an Egyptian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation:
Nor keep a milch Cow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy Heavenly Bull. Nor expect her
butter to come, unleſſe by thy charming.
Their Petitions ſeem to me very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable:
to which they add, It would
doe well if thou leave not out the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of the Man that is ſtabd through
all the twelve Signes, but place it in the
room of thy Picture, and ſuch whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
advices in rhyme, as, <hi>Flee Bathes
and Venery, Drink wine but ſparingly,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60622:6"/>
and the like, Theſe were atcheive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
fit for thy Learned adventures.
Theſe things they underſtand, and (I
am afraid) thy ſelf does No more. But
they are perſwaded, that to caſt the
Nativity-water of a Nation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the Phlebotomy of War, or purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Parlament, City, or Army is but
to be a Celeſtial Quack, a fortune-teller
at large, and a State-Mountebanck.
To conclude, I ſhould forget the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an Almanack, did I not a little
fringe it over with verſes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I preſume herewithall to ſend you

who, though he were as merry a
Madcap as the Doctor, and his verſes
appeare like that play at Crambo; and
that he run a poor rhyme out of breath
till it pant and expire, or hurry it on
with ſuch a ſtrong gale, til it touch
upon the Coaſt of Nonſenſe; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
between his fits of talking idly,
he hath ſome lucid Intervalls of

<pb facs="tcp:60622:11"/>
ſee every day in <hi>France,</hi> where the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that is held to people, newly arrived, is,
what newes? Do you know nothing that is
New? what is the talke? what do they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

they are, that they oftentimes are angry
which thoſe that come from other Countries,
and strange places, without bringing their
budget full of Newes, calling them Fools and
Idiots.</p>
            <p>So that, As they are ready to enquire
Newes, they do likewiſe eaſily believe what is
told them. Were it not a good deed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſome perſons (worthy of beliefe) and
place them at the Entrance of the Country,
onely to examine the Newes that is brought,
whether it be true or no? Yes, Certainly.
And thus did my Good Maſter <hi>Pantagruel</hi>
throughout the Countries of <hi>Vtopia</hi> and
<hi>Dipſodia.</hi> And ſo ſucceſſefull it hath been
to him, and his territories have ſo proſpered,
that they have more Wine then they know
how to drink; and they are faine to throw it
away, if good Drinkers and Merry boyes
come not from other places to help them.
Being deſirous then to ſatisfie the Curioſity of

You blades, that do not beleive in God

greater or leſſer light to the people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

not ſo much as touch with her this year
I aſſure you. Oh! to our purpoſe. You

'tis then Spring when the Snow falls
