         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What honeſt and ingenuous man could

every thing that was dedicated to
the honor and ſervice of God. The Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,

fall of much more ſorrowfull conſequence,
when all theſe were in a manner Types of

Thou wert the more ſacred Temple,

But (alas) Thy glories are periſht, and
thou become a very Wilderneſſe, wild and
deſolate, ſtript and naked, rob'd and
ſpoil'd of all thy riches and ſumptuous
Ornaments, which were once ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly

life, that they were above humane faith,
theſe (I ſay) are raviſh'd from thee, and
(more to augment our ſorrow) wee ſee

which no body undertakes to keep. Thou

or drunkenneſſe; or avarice what ſin ſoever

is nothing that defends the breach, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that guards thy unman'd ſoule: Yet

whilſt (like it) the purity of thy thoughts

pray, lament, and mourn continually, that
I may ſee thee return again, to thy former
integrity, and piety, which may perhaps
ſeem to humane apprehenſion impoſſible;
but all things are eaſie in the hands of
God. <hi>For he it is that lifteth the beggar

Pſ. 113. On this infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable
love of our God to us, build
thou thy hopes, and thou wilt find an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility,
a ſtrange incapacity within thy

Omnipotent God raiſe thee up again, reſtore
thee to thy former liberty and honor, and
and not onely ſet thee free from this baſe
captivity, but make thy happineſſe greater
then ever yet it was. Onely I beſeech thee
reſolutely to break all ſnares that ſhall be

leſt thoſe puniſhments light on
thee which are due onely to the deſperately
wicked. For neither the number nor the
greatneſſe of our ſins does abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
us to a condition irrecoverable. But
reſolv'd ſettledneſſe, and an intollerable
compoſedneſſe in impious waies, are the
ſure manifeſt ſignes of a ſoul ſo fall'n, that
it ſhall never riſe again. Wherefore <hi>Solomon</hi>
does not ſpeak generally of every man who
tranſgreſſeth: <hi>Pro.</hi> 18. but names that
wicked man, who when he comes into the
depth of evill, contemns his mercy. It is
onely a wicked purpoſe never to leave ſin
that plunges men into this dangerous Gulfe
of deſpair, and iniquity, from whence they
can never ſo much as look back, and much
more difficultly return. For the deceiving
weights of wickedneſſe lie like a heavy
Collar on the necke of the ſoul, and
forcing our eyes upon the Earth, forbids
them to look up to our Lord that made
them. Know then it is the part of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and truly daring Chriſtian ſpirit,
not to endure the Tyrants yoake; vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
to combate and deſtroy thoſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

over us. And with the Prophet, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

our obedience there onely, where it is
onely due; ſaying with him, <hi>As the eyes of

ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he have mercy upon us: have mercy on
us, Lord have mercy on us, for we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly

Theſe are divine exhortations, theſe are the
doctrines of the moſt heavenly Philoſophy,
we are fill'd with contempt, we are ſhaken
with infinite violent ſtormes of ſad events.
Yet ſhall not this debar us from looking
up to our God, and imploring his aſſiſtance:
Nay, till our Lord has granted our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we muſt put on the confidence of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
beggars, and not let our prayers
ceaſe til our requeſts are granted. This is the
true Character of a pious daring ſoul, not to
be baffled from his hopes by the violence of
ill ſucceſſe: not to ſtart out of the way or
goe back, becauſe as yet he has not found
the expected iſſue of his prayers, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

nothing more then to inveigle us in

us from our expectations in Heaven,

Lord finding us ſure link'd to it, has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd

the dangerous billowes of this preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable

this is the time hee ſo diligently watches

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170057:11"/>
not bid them rejoyce with me, but grieve

death of a ſoul fallen into perdition, dead
in ſin and pierc'd with ten thouſand arrows,
venom'd with Hells malitious poyſon, the
beauty, form, and grace of moſt eminent
Vertues, and devotions loſt, and extinct in
him. Theſe adminiſter matter juſtly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
lawfull and laſting tears. What flinty
heart? What rockie ſoul could in an agony
ſo moving forbear lamentings, or entertain
an apparition of any deluſion, ſhould forbid
him his juſt ſorrow. At the fall of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it is humane, though not altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
to weep. At the falling of a ſoul,
the extreameſt lamentation is the greateſt
evidence of the trueſt piety. He who had on
Earth poſſeſſion of Heaven, in ſo much as
hee contemn'd, abhor'd, and laught at the
vanity of the World, hee who beheld the
greateſt beauty but as a ſtatue of ſtone, or a
fair picture; That he who deſpis'd Gold as
dirt, pleaſures and vanity as mire; He it is
who moſt unexpectedly falling into a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
feaver of burning luſts, has loſt his
comlineſs, and his courage, is now turn'd a
ſlave to his own beſtiall appetites. Shall
not we then grieve for him? ſhall we ceaſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170057:12"/>
our lamentations till he return to himſelfe
again? it is no more then our duty, and tye
of Chriſtian charity, if we have any ſenſe of
pitty or humanity in us. What (alas) is
the deſtruction of the body, but an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
courſe in the order of nature? yet
ſuch a loſſe finds dayly mourners and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters.
What ought we then to doe for
his periſhing ſoul, which manifeſtly appears
reſolv'd on eternall damnation, if our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
bring him not to repentance, but that
he finiſh his courſe in obſtinate ſinning,
and obdurateneſſe of heart. <hi>For in death
there is no remembrance of thee; in the
grave who ſhall give thee thanks?</hi> Pſal. 6.
How great a ſin then is it againſt the rules
and Laws of charity, not to reſent with
the greateſt pitty a ſoul thus everlaſtingly
periſhing. Violent cries, and abundance of
tears cannot poſſibly recall the dead; But
frequent experience teaches us, that a ſoule
dying here in ſin is not wept for in vaine;
For the humble requeſts of brotherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
plead ſo effectually before the Throne
of mercy, that many hardned in obſtinate
impenitency, have melted into floods of
tears, and have ow'd thee thanks for their
contrition to the importunity of other
mens prayers. And by ſuch meanes, many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170057:13"/>
both in our daies and the daies of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
who have deſerted the paths of
righteouſneſſe, and run headlong aſtray out
of the waies of piety (which is a ſpirituall
dying) at length have riſen again with
ſuch heavenly alacrity, their fall ſo hid
and obſcur'd by the glory of their riſe, that
they have purchas'd the palme of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and crowned with the wreath of
victory, have triumph'd Conquerors on
earth, till they were ſummon'd to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with the bleſſed for all eternity. Yet
infinite ſuch examples prevail not with a
man who wilfully continues in the flames
and fires of his luſts; Such a wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe
withſtands his recovery, and
pleads an impoſſibility of mercy againſt
him. But if he chance to get a little way out
of the fire, and by degrees leave it ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
behind him, the dimneſſe which the
flames cauſed will be taken from his eyes,
&amp; then how plainly wil he diſcern the way
of ſalvation to be acceſſible and very plain,
ſmooth, and eaſie, having obtain'd grace
for his guide. And conquer'd thoſe Troops
the Devill laid in ambuſh for him. But hee
who wants the courage to undertake the
combat, in vain deſires the conqueſt. He may
that's willfull ſtay and burn in the fire, nay,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170057:13"/>
ſhut the doors againſt himſelf that are open
for him. And whatman who is thus ſotiſhly
his own enemy, can deſign any thing nobly
and virtuouſly? Wherfore this our common
enemy makes it his onely buſineſſe, leaves
nothing unattempted which may render
us diffident of grace and mercy. Nor
needs he much labour to compaſſe that his
end, if we lie proſtrate at his feet; and take
no counſell or reſolution, or order the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
againſt him, it is an eaſie conqueſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
us. But he who violently breaks
his fetters, and betakes himſelf to the uſe of
his ſtrength with courage; He (I ſay) who
in ſo deſperate a condition allows himſelfe
no ceſſation, but with a continuall violence
maintains the battell againſt him, though
hee have before loſt the day a thouſand
times, ſhall then recover his loſſes, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
triumph in his enemies overthrow.
When he who is dejected with deſpair, and
permits his ſpirits to fail and languiſh, can
never hope for conqueſt; how can he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
who makes no reſiſtance at all, but
fearing the encounter lays down his armes,

            <p>THE mercies of our Lord ſo infinitely
exceed our tranſgreſſions, that medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on them, they cannot but greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
our drooping ſpirits, and arme us
with courage againſt thoſe temptations we
ought ſtrongly to reſiſt, leſt they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our truſt and confidence in God. I
mean thoſe ſtupid apprehenſions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
immenſity of our own guilt, as
if God were not able to forgive us our ſins
being ſo great and ſo many, that to our
imaginations they exceed the ſaving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of his mercy. Oh let us take heed of
ſuch deſperate perſwaſions as theſe? oh let us
be careful that ſuch thoughts as theſe, do not
quaſh and annihilate our hopes, let not the
Devill delude us with an opinion that our
Lord is mercifull indeed; but extends that
goodneſſe onely to ſmall offenders, to thoſe
onely who have provok'd him but with a
few and thoſe ſmall faults. For ſuppoſe a
man juſtly branded with all the markes of
thoſe infamies and ſhames which are due
to the greateſt reprobates; One who had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170057:14"/>
committed all thoſe wicked acts, which
moſt certainly unrepented fail not to ſhut
the gates of Heaven againſt them who
tranſgreſſe ſo highly in them. And withall,
we muſt grant this perſon to be no ſtranger
to the truth, but to have been one of
Chriſts Church. Whatſoever was the cauſe
of his fall? Whatſoever the inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the Tempter had chang'd him to be,
either whoremaſter or adulterer, nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Sodomite: Were he theef, drunkard,
or common calumniator, one who had
hug'd all theſe ſinns with appetite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
nay, had made it his ſerious ſtudy
to contrive his ends and helliſh ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them? For my part I would not be
Author of deſpair to ſuch a wretch as this:
no though he had continued in them many
years. For it is impious blaſphemy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the anger of God, as if he were
therefore diſpleas'd that we might be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for then wee juſtly ſhould relinquiſh
our hopes, if we were aſſur'd the flames of
his wrath ſet on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e by ſo many ſinns, were
not to be extinguiſh'd with the tears of true
repentance. But wee muſt look with more
believing eyes on his mercy, and admire
the excellency of his juſtice and his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
who in his puniſhments is quite free
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170057:15"/>
from paſſions, and perturbations; And any
one, but willfully blind offenders, may
plainly ſee, that our Lord has no delight or
contentment in his revenge, but takes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
pleaſure in his love, and tenderneſs,
which is infinitely intent on our good. Be
thou therefore of good courage, confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and undauntedly rely upon the hopes of
thy reſtauration to grace and happineſſe,
in ſpite of all the machinations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
Let him not deceive thee and poſſeſſe
thee with ſo horrid an opinion; as that God
ſhould at all delight in the puniſhment of
ſinners; For he is a moſt indulgent Father,
carefully fond of us, and directing all his
actions towards us for our good, even in
the depth of our malice againſt him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiling
(is he) and loath to ſee the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of our perverſeneſſe. But of his owne
Fatherly compaſſion keeps us off from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
and deſpiſing his mercy. If any one
voluntarily of his own free motion forſakes
the light, who can accuſe the light for that
mans darkneſſe, does not he want the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of that light through his own folly,
and willfullneſſe? So he that diſdains
ſubmiſſively to adhere to the omnipotent
power of God, and to live in the light of
grace which illuminates all true believers,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170057:15"/>
ſuffers not by the goodneſſe of that power,
(which is the originall Fountain of all
bleſſings) but the unrulineſſe of of his own
raſhneſſe, and ſtupidity which ſo willfully
brought him into his own ruin and
deſtruction. Our mercifull God ſometimes
lets us ſee the rod to frighten us; but draws
it back and puts it up again, that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
may be ſenſible of his averſneſſe to
revenge, and of his infinite propenſity to
allure and attract them to himſelf. So a
diſcreet Phyſitian afflicts not or troubles
himſelf, at the raging diſtempers of a man
frantick, but is himſelf the patient when he
workes the cure. He treats him gently, he
courts him into his own health; and though
the mad man fly in his very face, hee uſes
meekneſſe with art and skill, and unmov'd
endeavours to palliate the violence of his
diſeaſe; though perhaps he be juſtly enough
incens'd to leave off the cure. And as the
diſtemper'd man recovers his ſenſes, the
Phyſitian encreaſes his joy, and proſecutes
his intended cure, having never return'd
peeviſhneſſe for fury, but laying aſide all
ſelf-reſpect, applyed himſelf wholly to the
good of the lunatick. So our Lord (when
we arrive at the extreameſt madneſſe, and
rage in ſinning) takes no revenge of us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170057:16"/>
in the height of that fury, but like our
carefull Phyſitian, moſt charitably applyes
his mercies, which are his medicines, to cure
our madneſſe, not any thing reflecting on
thoſe wild paſſions we provoke him with.
This is a truth to be juſtified by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of all right minded Chriſtians, who
daily find the effects of his clemency, and
the records of holy writ are full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

If before this illumination of grace
by miracles reconciling him to faith, hee
were unworthy his indulgence, though hee

was this wretched King, when he had ſeen

merited) puniſh the Apoſtate. No! hee
begins anew with him, and gives him ſtill
greater arguments of his Deity; indulgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and like a like a loving Father reducing
him from his ſtupid arrogance to a modeſt
knowledge of himſelfe, and an humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him. And what was more to be
admir'd, God never ſhow'd his omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and love more to him, then in this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
(for certainly the greater the miracle
was, the greater ought his faith to have
been) therefore our Lord did never more
exalt his convincing powers, then in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the children flung bound into that
fierie Furnace, which the Tyrant himſelfe
had kindled with moſt malitious and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
fury. The flames burnt to ſo great a
wonder, that they threatned quicker de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
then the beholders imagination
could fancy poſſible. Which God moſt
meekly ſuffered to encreaſe to the height of
miracle, that ſo manifeſting his greatneſſe
in his wonders, he might ſtrike him with
fear and terror, to reclaim him and ſtartle
his obdurate heart from that obſtinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall
of him, and what he had done for
him. The Tyrant ſtands inſulting ore the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170057:18"/>
innocent ſacrifices prepar'd for his rage, he
laugh's and rejoyces to ſee theſe unparalel'd
flames ſtill encreaſe, which without the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
permiſſion could not have burnt
or been a fire at all; But God contradicts
not his deſires, ſhewing his power modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his wiſdome, which renders the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of his Enemies againſt his ſervants
vain and ridiculous, when they are at the
greateſt height. And that the flames might
not be thought fictitious or fantaſtick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions;
he lets their power be ſeen in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
the men, commanded to caſt his
Servants into the Furnace. What power
can be compar'd to the command of the
Almighty God; to whom the nature and
eſſence of every thing that has being is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
and to him which made them out
of nothing return their nature, and become
what he would have them, as did this fire
whoſe flames devour'd the bodies of the
Officers which caſt them in; yet added
beauty and luſtre to the children who
walked in the very midſt of them, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
and untouch'd. Nay, they return'd
from out of the fire triumphant ore the
flame? and with ſuch Majeſty as Kings
out of their ſtately Palaces, march'd they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170057:19"/>
out of the Furnace? No man affords the
King one looke, every ones eyes are fix'd
upon this unparalel'd object. Neither his
crown, nor Royall robes with all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of his ſtupendious Pomp do move
the peoples admiration, as did the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
appearance of thoſe faithfull Children,
who ſeem'd rather to have ſuffer'd the
puniſhment of a dream then to have paſt
through ſubſtantiall and reall fire. Their
hair, the lighteſt catching part of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
(not ſo much as ſing'd) remain'd as
perfectly intire, as if every hair had been
harder then an Adamant, while the flame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring
heat conſum'd all about them:
Nor do thou conſider that alone, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
how inſenſible of any pain in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Furnace they continually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd,
whilſt the ſtanders by every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
expected their diſſolution; Yet are
not the ſpectators onely fill'd with this
wonder; but as far as letters could carry it,
the aſtoniſht world believ'd it with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whilſt the unconcern'd and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

this neglectedly by, and peruſes his old

impieties. Nor did our Lord for all this,
powre out the full Vialls of his wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the head of this deſperate wretch; but
proceeds in his purpoſe to reclaim, both by
dreams and the warnings of the Prophet.
And when nothing prevailes to reduce him,
then he brings his rod forth, though not
as a revenger for his paſt ſinns, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his future calamities, by taking away
the remaining rancor of his inclinations.
For God deſtroy'd him not utterly. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a few years diſcipline and correction,
reſtores him to his former honor. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
of our mercifull God make us no
loſers but exceeding gainers in the end,
and are to be reckon'd as his greateſt
bleſſings, when they bring us to a ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

            <head>CHAP. V. That ſincere repentance is alwaies accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, declar'd out of holy

            <p>HOw ſurpaſſingly great is the kindneſſe,
and love of God to us? who never (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the greateſt provocations) rejects our
ſincere repentance, though we ſin moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly
againſt him, if we moſt humbly
return to him; his ſweet embraces are ready
to receive us; Nay, though we ſhould be
unwilling, he often contends with our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe,
and forces our recovery; Nay,
helpes the defects of our falling inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with his preſerving grace which raiſes
us above our ſelves to pious deſires, which
he both gives, and prepares their reward.
What greater argument can there be of the
benignity of an incens'd God, then when
we have provok'd him to anger, to accept
of our ſorrow? and though our repentance
be not ſo long and ſo full as it ought,
though it want ſomething of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of form, and time, or other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170057:20"/>
our Lord helps us in our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſends his bleſſings on very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and frowardneſſe. As in the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> you may find it. <hi>He went on fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in the way of his heart. I have ſeen
his waies, and will heal him. I will lead
him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him,
and to his mourners.</hi> Iſaiah 57. 17, 18. Let
us remember the ſtory of that moſt wicked
King (who by a womans perſwaſion had
given himſelfe over to all abhomination)
when he once repented, and putting on ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
acknowledg'd his ſins; he ſo mov'd
the compaſſion of God, that he eſcap'd all
thoſe evills which then threatned him. For
God ſpake to <hi>Elias</hi> upon his ſubmiſſion,
ſaying, <hi>Seeſt thou how</hi> Ahab <hi>humbleth
himſelf before me, I will not bring this
evill in his daies.</hi> 2 Kings 21. 29. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him <hi>Manaſſes</hi> exceeds all the former
Kings in madneſſe, and Tyranny; he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the Law, ſhuts the Temple, ſets up
the worſhip of Idoll's to confront the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of God; outſtripping all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in wickedneſſe. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. He after
his repentance was receiv'd into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Gods elect friends. Had <hi>Manaſſes</hi>
when he ſaw the deformity of his impiety,
deſpair'd of his reſtauration to grace, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170057:21"/>
believ'd an impoſſibility of his change to a
new man; he had certainly never partaken
of thoſe bleſſings afterward befell him; but
when he weigh'd how little the exceſſe of
his ſins was, put in the ballance with Gods
immenſe, and infinite mercies; hee caſt the
the fetters off, wherewith the Devill had
made him faſt, became Conqueror, and
finiſh'd his good courſe. Nor has the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
furniſh'd us with theſe examples alone,
to preſerve us from ſplitting on the dange-Rockes
of our own harden'd hearts. But by
his commands, God calls us continually,
and forewarns us of our deſtruction. <hi>To day
if you will hear his voice, harden not your
hearts, as in the day of temptation in the
Wilderneſſe.</hi> Pſa. 95. 8. 9. This day to us
may be any day of our life from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
of our youth, to the extremity of
our age. Wee muſt imagine the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſpeaking to us, and calling us to
him, who proportions not his mercies to
the circumſtances of time, but the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our hearts. The <hi>Ninivites</hi> had not
many daies for repentance, and to pray
to God to forgive them their crying
ſins; yet could a little portion of one day
blot out all their iniquities: and in how
ſhort a time was Paradiſe aſſur'd the theefe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170057:21"/>
upon the Croſſe? In how ſmall a time did
his contrition purchaſe him Heaven, even
before Chriſts followers and Apoſtles? Many
have obtain'd the honor of Martyrdome,
and purchas'd Crownes of glory, in leſſe
then few years, in a few daies, nay, ſome
in leſſe then one day. Let us be alwaies and
in all conditions undejected, and cheerfull,
confident and aſſur'd in our ſoules of Gods
infinite mercies which will intice and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
us to prepare our confidences for ſuch a
tenderneſſe, as will dread and abhorre ſinne,
as will make us ſhake off our infirmities,
and violently ſuppreſſe the malice of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
Our own election will lead us into
better paths with Gods aſſiſting grace;
waies quite contrary and oppoſite to our
luſts, ſuch as God commands us to walke
in, ſuch as he rejoyces to ſee us tread in,
whoſe end is rewarded with eternity, to
which courſe the ſhortneſſe of time can be
no obſtacle, for many that were laſt have
got to be firſt in this ſpirituall race by the
eager feavour of their deſires. Our fallings
are not our miſeries, but this is our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when we are ſunk under the weight of
ſin, that we lie under the heavy burthen,
and never ſtrive to riſe again; that wee
ſleep under it, and thoſe litle intervalls we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170057:22"/>
awake, diſpute our ſoules into deſpair,
againſt ſuch as are thus ſottiſhly bewitch'd
to their own deſtruction; the Prophet cries
out in the heat and height of paſſion, <hi>Shall
they fall, and not ariſe? ſhall he turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and not return? Why then is the
People of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſlidden back by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
back-ſliding? They hold faſt deceipt,
they refuſe to return.</hi> Jer. 8. 4. Whoever
it is that wilfully refuſes, humbly and with
his whole heart to accept the grace of the
ſpirit offer'd him, after his wandring from
out of the waies of God, is concern'd in
this of the Prophet. For it cannot be ſaid
he fell who never ſtood; or that he went out
of it who never was in the way. Many things
to confirme this truth, are evident in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and other manifeſtations of holy writ.
<hi>That ſheep which was loſt from the ninty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,
and after found and brought back to
the reſt;</hi> Mat. 18. 12. what did it ſignifie
but the going aſtray, and the return of the
faithfull? For the ſheep belong'd not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Shepheard, it was of the ſame flock;
and under the ſame Shepheard: it wandred
through the Mountaines, and the deſerts,
it ſtray'd far from the fold; And what? did
the Shepherd neglect the wanderer? No,
he brought him back, nor did he angerly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170057:22"/>
drive and beate it before him, but laid it
on his owne ſhoulders, and ſo brought it
home. Obſerve the beſt Phyſicians how in
ſome fierce and dangerous diſeaſes, they
pleaſe, and humour their patients, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with the ſet rules of their art, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with theſe diſtempers; ſo God uſes not
the fierceneſſe of his wrath againſt the
greateſt ſinners; but his meekneſſe heales
them, hee applyes the gentle cure of his
compaſſion; like the good Shepheard hee
layes them on his own ſhoulders, like the
Phyſitian he heales them with forbearance;
leſt they wander for ever, leſt their
woundes prove incurable. Next followes the
parable of the prodigall to juſtifie this
truth: <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 12. Who when hee had
run into extraordinary exorbitancies wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and on purpoſe, by his own folly
wandred to purchaſing ſhame, and miſery,
(whilſt his brother ſtay'd at home ever
pleaſing his Father) he that was rich, free
and nobly borne, became more deſpis'd
then the worſt of his Fathers hirelings; Yet
at laſt was reſtor'd to his former honour,
and repoſſeſt of his Fathers favour. Had he
in that miſerable condition deſpair'd of
life, and thoſe enjoyments he afterwards
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170057:23"/>
found, he had nere known bleſſing, but had
periſh'd perhaps in the Wilderneſſe with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
of all deaths the moſt miſerable. But
becauſe that he repented (that he truſted to
the hopes at his return of his Fathers
forgiveneſſe) ſee the change of his baſe and
abject condition; he is thus reſtor'd to his
Fathers favour, cloath'd in a rich garment,
and better treated then his brother, who
had never tranſgreſt. For ſaies the brother:
<hi>So many years have I ſerv'd thee, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tranſgreſt thy commands, and yet thou
never gaveſt me a Kid, that I might make
merry with my friends; but now this thy
Son is returned, who has devour'd thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
thou haſt killed the fatted Calfe.</hi>
Out of this parable, and the precedent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
may be collected the great efficacie
of repentance.</p>

with ſuch ample aſſurances of his mercies

&amp;c. like that prodigall. For if we approach
our ſelves but one ſtep towards him, our
God will draw us nearer, ſo far is he from
refuſing us. But we are a generation that
willfully depart from the Lord, and on ſet

of the faith of Chriſts family, &amp; ſome believe
he was a Prieſt. What follow'd this fall of

that is ſuch a one, this rebuke ſufficeth that

wrote to them to comfort, encourage him,

after miracles wrought amongſt them; after

their belief in Chriſt Jeſus) at length
fell into infidelity; yet recover'd their fall.
<hi>He therefore that giveth you the ſpirit</hi>

Eze. 18. 12. Return then to our Lord (moſt

beſtow on us the glory of eternity, to give

was appointed for us from the beginning of

incapable of infinite honors, and felicities
by eternall providence and favour deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
us, and not make our ſelves ready
to enter the Bride-Chamber with the
Bridegroom. This preparation is onely
poſſible in this World, here it is that wee
muſt put on our wedding Garments, that
we muſt dreſſe our ſelves in the robes of
contrition and repentance, and though we
may be often diſordered in our atttire, and
contract again the filth, and deformity
of our ſinne, there is hope left, as
long as the waters of repentance may yet
cleanſe us; but if we neglect it to day, wee
know not how late it may be to morrow;
the end and terme of our life is forbid the
curioſity of our knowledge; and when wee
depart hence, it will be too late to expect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good, though wee repent with all the
paſſionate humility that can be imagin'd,
it will not profit us; though we gnaſh our
teeth, howle horridly, and fill that Hell we

are in with our complaints, till they reach
the Heaven we complain to, wee ſhall not
be the better ſo much water as would cool
our tongues. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 16. Remember <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
anſwer to the rich man, there is a
great Chaos betwixt you and us. Let us lay
hold on mercy while we may; Let us now
acknowledge our Lord humbly, faithfully,
and ſincerely as we ought. For while there
is life, there is hope by repentance; and the
benefits that never faile to accompany it,
are ready for us; it is a phyſick for the

though in this World the laſt and

power and ſubtlety to plant deſperate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
in our ſoules, ſeeing the mercies
of our Lord are free and open to the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance

theſe in my name, ſhall not loſe his reward,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170057:26"/>
ſaith Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 10. 42. &amp; the ſame Chriſt's
promiſe is, that he who repents him of the
ſins he has committed, though his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
be infinitely beneath the merit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
the mercies of our Lord will find
him out, for the leaſt good in us though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo ſmall, the benignity and compaſſion
of ſo mercifull a Father will not neglect.
He (who ſearches our ſins with that ſevere
curioſity, that our very words and thoughts
ſhall be arraign'd at the day of judgement)
much more carefully ſearch and look upon
the leaſt good we do. So infinitely his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and love to mankind exceeds his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
He is a God of ſo great mercy,
as he will remember his bounty to the leaſt
good in us, as well as his ſeverity to the
leaſt ill. Wherefore if thou findeſt thy
ſtrength ſo to flagge and faile thee, when
thou attempts an enterprize ſo difficile to
our naturall corruption, as is a reall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which is the totall change of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and deprav'd appetites: yet do
not faint in thy undertakings, and weakly
fall from truſting in the promiſes of a God
that will never forſake thee; but begin by
degrees to ſtoppe the ſuperfluous humors of
this diſeaſe, which ſo debilitates and infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
thee; then art thou ready for this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170057:27"/>
combate, the victory will ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
when thou haſt once valiantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
the fury of the aſſault. But if like a
coward thou dreadſt the firſt appearance of
the Enemy, it is no wonder if every thing

The Devill himſelfe was fearfull to loſe his

perſwaſions can give thee leave to think thy
ſelf ſo ſoon lifted up out of the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to the poſſeſſion of a Crown of
glory; it were too much preſently to believe,
as thy condition hath made thee, (though
to God nothing be impoſſible) Therefore
all that I deſire of thee, is, to ſtop here, and
adde no more to thy former tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that thou wouldſt turn thy eyes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and not let them reſt fixt on the
dotage of thy beaſtlineſſe, to let us ſee
that thou haſt gone in thoſe crooked
meanders, have quite tyred thee; and thou
beginſt to be refreſht, and recover thy
ſtrength in better paths: and art thou thy
own hindrance? Doeſt thou not know
that many have dyed in their drunkenneſſe,
their luſts, and other ſinfull delu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſions of
this age? Where are ſome now, who lately
trac'd the ſtreets in pride, who fed their
paraſites with dainties? and cloath'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the fineſt ſilkes? they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
the walkes they went in? what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of all this pomp and pride, is it not
vaniſh'd, is it not paſt over like a dreame?
Their coſtly feaſts, their jollities, their
compleaſing mirths, and laughings had
their period, and are now no more; their
vanities, their uncheckt thoughts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170057:28"/>
liberties, their delicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
luxuries are all fled. What are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of thoſe pamper'd bodies ſo ſtudiouſly
obſerv'd, and fed ſo luſciouſly: Pray look
into the grave: Contemplate on their duſt,
and aſhes, on the wormes devour'd them,
the deformity of their charnell houſes, then
ſigh, and bewaile that folly which took
ſo great a care, to preſerve ſo litle a nothing.
And would to God this deſtruction there
terminated where their aſhes are conſum'd.
But turn thy eyes from the grave, and
wormes there devouring them; and reflect
on that everlaſting fire that can never be
extinguiſh'd, on that gnaſhing of teeth, that
utter darkneſſe, on thoſe ſtreghts and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable
afflictions declar'd to us in the
Parable of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rich man (who
once was cloathed in purple, and the Lord
of unvalew'd treaſures, of riches that had
no end) and at laſt became ſo deſtitute of
all neceſſaries, that he could not purchaſe
one drop of water to cool his tongue when
he ſuffer'd in flames of fire, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to the bittereſt cruelties of all tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And how miſerable a ſoul then is
that, which thinkes pleaſures, and the vain
lights of this World to exceed the gain or
Prophet of a dream? ſuppoſe a man were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170057:28"/>
condemn'd to work in Mines of Metalls,
or doom'd to undergo ſome harder puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
&amp; then fancie this miſerable creature
ſunk under his labour, and fallen aſleep;
next in that ſleepe imagine him to have a
dream poſſeſſing him with the deluſion of
all pleaſures and content: which when hee
awakes are with his ſleep fled; how little
ows this poor ſoul to this mockery of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
And truly, that rich mans happineſſe
on Earth, was no more then ſuch a kind of
dream. If we conſider how little it laſted,
and how it concluded, in bitterneſſe, and
dreadfull puniſhments, in everlaſting fires.
There is no meditation ſo neceſſary to one
beſotted to his appetites, as it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
one fire with the other, the burning of
the luſts with the eternall flames which
are their decreed puniſhment; and hee is
worſe then mad that will not quench the
one to eſchew the other. For there is
ſuch nicety and dependance one on
the other, inſomuch that hee who
puts out the preſent fires of his concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,
is certain to avoid the eternity of the
future; but if the catching flames laſt till
they are joyn'd, they are never to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd:
and unrepenting ſouls departing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170057:29"/>
this life, preſently unite their ſinfull fires,
with the revengefull flames appointed them
in Hell for all eternity. Now then conſider
how long thou canſt poſſibly preſume on
the continuance of theſe felicities thou here
enjoyſt. When thou canſt not promiſe thy
ſelfe any length for thy life; fifty years
were a great ſpace to be aſſur'd of; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we ſo little know our ends, that wee
cannot tell but this evening may be our laſt;
how then can wee relie upon ſo many
years; Time is uncertain, nor can we aſſure
our ſelves any thing of the future. And were
it ſo that we were certain of a long life,
the pleaſures ſtill are uncertain wee might
expect in it, which ſometimes are with us &amp;
again in the twinkling of an eye. But were a
long life aſſur'd thee, and thy pleaſures to
laſt with it, that no chance or fortune had
power to interrupt the continued courſe
of thy contents, which ſhould be ſtill equal
to thy deſires; What a litle would this be
to everlaſting ages of bliſs, or eternity of
puniſhment? And hereafter we muſt expect
the like everlaſting durance of both joy and
ſorrow which ſoever be our lot: though
here delight and ſadneſſe have their viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
in the World to come neither ſhall

incomprehenſible.</p>

(or thy experience will teach thee too late)
what thoſe fires be, which are prepared in
Hell for the Devills and his Angells there,
and for thee (unleſſe thou ſincerely repent)
they are immortall unconſuming flames,
flames that ſhall never extinguiſh or dy. So
that in fine, the very damn'd may promiſe

perpetuity of endleſſe ſhame, pains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
While the bleſſed ſhall be cloath'd

thou art for ever forfeiting; a Crown of
immortall honor and what thou art aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Endleſſe miſeries, and plagues; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in fires can never poſſibly conſume,
which ſhall alwaies laſt, and ſtill ſupplyed,
ever encreaſe, and never diminiſh, or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate.
No mans tongue (be he never ſo elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent)
can teach us a way to comprehend
the true knowledge of ſuch unſpeakable
horror. Yet in this (as in other things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be certainly known) we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
our conjecture by the experience wee
make on things of leſſe moment. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
ſuppoſe thy ſelfe in an overheated
Bath; thy skin ſcalding, thy veines, and
ſinewes ſhrinking? Or burning in a violent
fevour, at the inſufferableneſſe of theſe
pains thou maiſt give ſome probable gueſſe,
and after think thou on Hell fire: Thou
wilt of neceſſity allow neither Bath or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

mercileſſe flames iſſuing from that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tribunall where the vengeance on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency

and gnaſhing of teeth, puniſhments
neither to be ſuffer'd nor redreſt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted;
for no body ſhall help them. So
vain and fruitleſſe will be thoſe lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which cannot avail the lamenters any
thing, when their complaints can profit
them nothing: Their torments ſtill encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with their deſperation, in a place
where their eyes can fix on nothing to
promiſe comfort, for what ſhall they ſee
there but the damned, their companions,
and a vaſt deſolation. Next to add to the
horror of eternall puniſhments, know
that theſe fires there, as they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dye, neither can they afford light; for
they are moſt peculiarly, and properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to be utter darkneſſe. Conſider
what it is thus to ſuffer in horrid and
lothſome darkneſſe, with terrors, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and tremblings in all thy members
this muſt needs cauſe; then the infinite
multitude of thy tortures (which will fall
on thee faſter then violent fleakes of ſnow

In ſo hideous and over-whelming a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170057:31"/>
that humane capacity can not well
comprehend how it is poſſible for the ſoule

and plaine to our underſtandings,
we may call to remembrance what fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
happens in this world we are now
in: How many men have fallen into violent
diſeaſes, and thoſe as laſting as violent,
but neither their time nor force had the
power to their ſoules diſſolution till the
decay and ruine of their materiall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
bodies: the ſubſtance of the ſoule
being proof againſt the keeneſt arrowes of
death; Even ſo ſhall it be at laſt with the
miſerable bodies of the damned, which
will be changed into a ſubſtance that
the fierceſt flames ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conſume; and though man be
compos'd of ſuch materialls as now cannot
reſiſt the violence, but yeeld to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of aſſaulting paines; when the curſed
immortality of the body ſhall be equall
to that of the ſoul, both together muſt
ſuffer to all eternity. Thou oughteſt (<hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi>)
rightly to conſider this undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth, and not to give way to any fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170057:31"/>
dream that would perſwade thee,
any end, or period can be propos'd to the
eternity of their ſufferings, who ſhall be
thus prepar'd for everlaſting fire. And what
are the pleaſures, the delights and vanities
thou puts't into the contrary ballance to
weigh againſt ſo heavy a doom? How
ſhort the time of their continuance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with eternity? Couldſt thou ſuppoſe
that Hells torments were to end in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or two hundred years, the fury of
them for ſuch a ſpace might prudentially
affright thee from that diſſolute and wild
life thou art ſo beſotted to; Then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the thought of their eternity muſt needs
deterre thee; and to preſſe this nearer to
thee, I begg of thee to lay thy hand to
thy heart, and anſwer me, whether thou
canſt or not exchange bleſſings and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
eternall, for as everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
or forfeit an ineſtimable weight of
glory for a dream? and all the reputed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of this life are no better? What
fool would bee content for one pleaſing
moment to lead all the reſt of his life in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie?
who is there ſo ſottiſh, as would will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
forfeit all his peace for a minutes
pleaſure? yet thou doeſt far exceed ſuch
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170057:32"/>
frantick beaſts in thy madneſſe. But alas
I dilate in vaine upon thy dotage till it
forſake thee, thou art deaf to perſwaſions
while thy eares are ſtopt with thy delights,
or wilt, if thou heareſt, think them lyars
that call the ſweets, ſo pleaſe thee,
what they really are, bitter and noyſome.
But when by the mercifull deliverance
of our Lord, thou art freed out of the
toyls, thou wilt with patience hear mee
treat of the malicious cunning that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
thee with thoſe ſnares: Wherefore
I deferr to tell thee the malignity of thy
diſeaſe, till I ſee thee recovering. Now let
us fancy pleaſures to be really the things
they ſeem, and that the delights of this
world have nothing of gall, or bitterneſſe;
But what then (I pray) ſhall we ſay of
the puniſhments attend them? how ſhall
wee avoid them? whither ſhall we flye
to eſcape the wrath that followes them?
They that now rejoyce and triumph in
the ſhades of ſeeming content, ſhall not
with their greateſt fortitude be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the leaſt puniſhments of thoſe many
prepar'd for their vengeance. And how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time well ſpent in prayer and unfaign'd
hearty penitence, might ſave them from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170057:32"/>
thoſe torments, and bring them to thoſe
joyes prepar'd for the bleſſed? Such is the
clemency and mercy of our God (who ſo
earneſtly loves mankind) that hee has not
appointed a long time of conflict with
Satan; the Warre laſt's no longer then the
ſhort ſpace of this fleeting life, which is
but the twinkling of an eye compar'd with
thoſe infinite ages to come, wherein wee
ſhall be crown'd with glory for ever. And
this will adde infinitely to thoſe things the
damn'd ſhall ſuffer, when they remember
their great neglect of that little time they
had to repent in, and at how eaſie a rate
and low a price they ſold and betray'd
themſelves into everlaſting thraldome.
Let us then awake, and rouze our ſelves out
of this lethargie of ſin, leſt this ſad doom
be ours. And let us haſt and do it whilſt
the time is yet, that wee may be receiv'd
into mercy and favour, while there is hope,
and that ſalvation may be had, before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
be too late; for they who idly and
ſloathfully wallow in the mire of their
iniquities, ſhall not onely endure theſe,
but far more intolerable torments. Since
it is not to be expreſt in the moſt artificiall
termes of eloquence, how great thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170057:33"/>
are which are prepared for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Hell. But if it were onely to loſe
the joy and bleſſings of Heaven: the
thought alone of ſo great a loſſe (though
we were after to periſh like other beaſts)
would be inſupportable, it would bring
with it ſo juſt cauſe of ſorrow, ſuch
affliction, and tribulation, that were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
puniſhment ordain'd for ſinners, that
it ſelfe ſhould bee ſufficient to reduce us
from our wicked waies, and might terrifie
us more then the apprehenſion of all thoſe
torments that threaten, and affright us, and
wee may moſt aſſuredly expect, unleſſe wee
truly repent.</p>

can be more happy then ſuch a life? There
you ſhall never fear povertie, or ſickneſſe.
There ſhall be neither oppreſſor, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt;
No troubſome tormentor, nor any
one tormented; No man angry or vext,
nor any repining at anothers diſpleaſure;
No proud man ſwelling in abundance,
nor any perſon dejected and mourning for
his neceſſities; No man contentious for
principality or power; nor any one lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

There all the tempeſtuous paſſions of our

All things ſhall be peace, joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
all things ſerenity, and tranquillity.
There ſhall be eternall day, brightneſſe
and light; Light as farre excelling the
ſplendor of the Sun, as that does the blaze

So ſhall all things created (as they ſhall

things lyable onely to the corruption of
the body, which nature in the body it ſelfe
ſhal be chang'd into incorruptible, and that
together with the ſoul become immortall,
the ſoul it ſelf poſſeſt of more beauty, and

and the ſoule quit her fear of a far more
terrible deſtruction. All apprehenſion of
ills that may befall us, ſhall for ever dye;
and it will be with our happy ſoules, as
with the heir to a King, who in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

and inheriting his Fathers dignities:
but growing in years, and encreaſing in

Prince, he is then let looſe to the guidance
of thoſe engraftments becoming his high
calling, and a full poſſeſſion of his liberty:
He is clad in purple, and his Temples cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled

no longer his terrors; but every thing ſerves
his magnificence, and complies with his

of bliſſe ſhall it be with the Saints
of God, whom as his beloved children
here he keeps under the rod of affliction,
to fit and prepare them for thoſe immortal
honors, and crownes they ſhall inherit in
the Kingdome of Heaven. No aſſimilation
indeed is ſufficient to give us a gueſſe at
thoſe tranſcending joyes, nor can the Arts
of eloquence expreſſe them: But let our
thoughts aſcend to that mount, where our
Lord was transfigur'd: and behold him
there ſhining as he then did with the eyes
of devout contemplation: and yet there we
ſhall not find one full entire figure of the
perfect glories of the world to come; that
appearance being ſuch as was fitted for the
diſcerning of our naturall opticks. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

there not appear'd not greater light then
was probably poſſible for them to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
without detriment to their ſight: yet
that they endur'd not: For they fell on

ſeat of Angels, Archangells, Thrones, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and Powers, and of what farre
excells them: For of the Kings of Heaven
and his glory, all tongues muſt be ſilent,
or not preſumptuouſly attempt ſo unequall
a task, ſo much does hee ſuperexcell all
expreſſions, ſo tranſcendent are his Luſtre,
Glory, Splendor, Majeſty, and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
And (tell me) how great madneſſe
it is to loſe, and forfeit ſo infinite bleſſings,
onely for the ſatisfaction of abuſing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time. What if we were to die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times in a day? to endure the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Hell it ſelfe for a ſeaſon? Would
it be too much for us; when the reward
would be ſee Chriſt comming in his
glory, and our ſelves receiv'd into the
number of the bleſſed for ever. Obſerve
what bleſſed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaies. <hi>Mat. 17. 4.
It is good for us to be here:</hi> if hee (who
ſaw but in a manner the ſhadow of the
glory to come) emptied his ſoule of all
other thoughts, to give up the poſſeſſion,
to the contentment and joyes of ſuch a
ſight; What ſhall we ſay, when not the
ſhadow, but the reall truth of that happy
viſion ſhall poſſeſſe our ſelves? When the
Chambers of Heaven ſhall be opened,
and wee behold the King of Glory him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170057:37"/>
not obſcurely as in a glaſſe, but
face to face, not barely with the eyes of
faith, but as he ſhall bee then manifeſted in
truth unto us. Their ſpirits are baſe and
abject, who rejoyce they have eſcap'd Hell,
out of the apprehenſion of the horrors of
it. It is to be accounted certainly a greater
torment then any is in Hell it ſelfe, to loſe
Heaven and the glory of it. So preſſing a
calamity it muſt needs be to the damn'd,
to thinke of the loſſe of Heaven, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it will puniſh them more then the
paines of Hell. Our eyes wander with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
after their happineſſe whom
we ſee great in Princes favours, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what poſſibly they can want, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the counſells of the mighty, and
ſhare with them in their honors; to them
we allow the fullneſſe of all happineſſe, and
adjudge our ſelves miſerable, if wee want
any thing our emulations can receive to
contribute to their happineſſe. Though
perhaps our condition may exceed theirs, if
we conſider the the lubricity and unſtable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of fortune. How ſlippery they ſtand
who are tottering on the top of pinacles:
how uncertain their honors be, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
whoſe duration cannot be ſecur'd
beyond the fate of battell, or the ruins of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170057:37"/>
domeſtick envy. Certain it is: All the
pompe of the Earth will have a period;
And it is vanity to fix our ſoules on any
imaginary happineſſe in this world. But
what wee look for from God our Lord,
whoſe raign ſhall be for ever, whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
has no bounds. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. Who
poſſeſſeth not a part, but the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of the Earth. Who hath meaſur'd
the waters in the hollow of his hand,
and meteth out Heaven with his ſpan;
who ſuſtains all things with his power; to
whom all Nations are nothing, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
as a drop of water. Hee it is whoſe
powr, and mercies can onely make us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
happy. Let the immenſity of the
joyes then, which are the determined por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the bleſſed, argue our ſoules into
a true apprehenſion of them, and let us
more dread the loſſe of future happineſſe,
then all the terrors of future paines;
and more abhorre to bee excluded out
of the doors, and not admitted into the
quire of the Angels, and the bleſſed Saints
of Heaven; then to be doom'd to eternall
flames.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of the day of judgement.</head>
            <p>THE terrible and mighty King of
Heaven and Earth ſhall not come to
judgement drawn by white mules, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the condemn'd in robes of peace, &amp;
crown'd with a diadem of mercy. But how
he then wil come the tongue of man cannot
expreſſe, you can have no ſurer evident
rule for you, then out of the Prophets
thundring forth the terrors of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
<hi>Pſal. 50. ver. 3. Our God ſhall
come and ſhall not keep ſilence, there ſhall
go before him a conſuming fire, and a
mighty tempeſt ſhall be ſtirred up round
about him. He ſhall call the Heavens from
above, and the Earth that he may judge his
people.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> dilates thus
on this dreadfull appearance. <hi>Iſaiah 13. 9.
Behold the day of the Lord commeth, cruel
both with anger and fierceneſs, to lay the
land deſolate, and to deſtroy the ſinners
out of it; for the ſtarrs of Heaven, Orion,
and the conſtellations there, ſhall not give
their light. The Sun ſhall be darkned in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170057:38"/>
his going forth, and the moon ſhall not
cauſe her light to ſhine. And I will puniſh
the whole Earth for their evils, and the
wicked for their iniquitie, and I will cauſe
the arrogancy of the proud to ceaſe, and
will lay low the haughtineſs of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
And thoſe that are left ſhall be more
precious then fine Gold; ſuch a man ſhall
be more eſteem'd then a precious ſtone of
Ophir, for the Heavens ſhall be ſhaken,
and the Earth ſhall be removed out of her
place, for the anger of the Lord of Sabbath
in the day when his wrath ſhall come.
And in another place the ſame Prophet,
<hi>The windowes of Heaven ſhall be opened,
and the foundations of the Earth ſhall be
ſhaken: the Earth ſhall be utterly broken
down, the Earth shall be cleane diſſolved,
the Earth shall be moved excedingly, it
shal reel to and fro like a drunkard, it shal
be removed like a Cottage, and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
thereof shall be heavy upon it, and
and it shall fall, and not riſe again:</hi> Iſa. 24.
18. For their iniquities have prevail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. To theſe adde the Prophet
<hi>Malachi; Behold</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>the Lord
Almighty cometh, but who shall abide the
day of his comming? and who shall ſtand
when he appeareth? for he is like a refiners
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170057:39"/>
fire, and like fullers ſope, and he ſhall ſit
as a refiner of ſilver and gold.</hi> Mal. 3. 2.
And again (ſaith he) <hi>the day of the
Lord commeth conſuming like a furnace,
and it ſhall burn them up.</hi> Mal. 4. 1. And
they who are proud, and all that do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ſhal be as ſtubble; &amp; the day commeth,
(ſaith the Lord Almighty) <hi>it ſhall leave
them neither root nor branch.</hi> And to the
ſame purpoſe does the viſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Daniel</hi> alarum us with the terrors of
that day. <hi>I beheld</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>till the
Thrones were placed, and the antient of
daies did ſit, whoſe garment was white as
ſnow, and the hair of his head like the pure
wooll: his Throne was a flame of fire, and
his wheeles burning fire: A fiery ſtreame
iſſued out before him: Thouſand thouſands
miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times
ten thouſand ſtood before him. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſet and the Bookes were opened.</hi>
Dan. 7. 9. And a little after, thus ſpeakes
the Prophet, <hi>ver. 13. I ſaw a viſion in the
night, and behold, one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of Heaven, and came
to the antient of daies, and they brought
him near before him: And there was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him Dominion and glory and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
that all People, Nations, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170057:39"/>
ſhould ſerve him: his Dominion is
an everlaſting Dominion which cannot
paſſe away, and his Kingdome a Kingdome
which cannot be deſtroyed.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>I</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
<hi>was grieved in my ſpirit, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of my head troubled me.</hi> Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe menaces of holy writ: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
our ſoules how in that day the glory
of Heaven ſhall be revealed, the clouds ſhal
ſeparate, the whole firmament open;
parting like a curtaine before a ſcreen,
and diſcovering to us the Majeſtick proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
within: which will fill all things
created with fear, amazement, and horror.
Then ſhall the Angells themſelves be full
of fear, with the Archangells, Thrones,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owers of Heaven, not for themſelves,
but becauſe their fellowſervants are
brought to judgement, and to give their
ſtrict accompt of their paſt life in this
world. For if they (under whoſe tutelage
we are) grieve at the judgement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt one ſole City under
their charge, what will be the generall
affrights and horrors, when the Son comes
againſt the whole world: for though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
they know, exempt from the
danger, they will have a ſence of them
brought before a Judge, whoſe alſeeing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170057:40"/>
eye needs no proof of witneſſe, or accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Who will force the guilty to accuſe
themſelves, and lay their own offences o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
when every delinquent to Heavens
juſtice ſhall produce his owne deeds, his
words, and thoughts to condemn himſelf?
Will not this mighty and juſt ſeverity of
our Lord aſtoniſh the very powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
themſelves. If it had not in it the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of an inundation of a river of fire, and
thoſe terrible affrighting Angells, miniſters
of his juſtice, which aſſiſt the fury and rage
of his revenge: How would it move men to
ſee the workmanſhip of the ſame creation,
call'd ſome to be highly preferr'd and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd;
Nay, had in great admiration
while others are blinded with diſgrace,
leſt they ſhould ſee the glory of God. Can
you imagine a more tormenting Hel then
this? When the thought of that Heaven we
have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt, will more ſenſibly cruciate our
ſoules from the torments of that Hell wee
ſuffer in. The infinite loſſe our wilfully
erring and ſelf-abuſing ſoules bring to
themſelves (in the forfeiting thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
great bleſſings ordain'd them) are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be apprehended by thought, or
in words comprehended. Sad will be the
experience of it to the impenitent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170057:40"/>
(I beſeech thee) ſet before thy eyes
the different ends of piety and impiety.
Behold the impious overwhelm'd with

even then when the truly pious children of
God ſhall be cloath'd with immortality,
and eternall glories: When the damn'd

our ſoules, the excellencies
Wherewith they are enricht with,
and the vile contempt wee have of
them, preferring our bodies their
ſlaves before them.</head>
            <p>THE joyes of Heaven are beyond our
dull perceptions, while wee are loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with earth; in vain it were to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
labour of their deſcription: Ineffable
are thoſe pleaſures, and delights, the great
profits unvaluable, which will then bee
ours in eternall poſſeſſion, when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the number of the Saints glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
for ever. When the immortall ſoule
ſhall be inveſted with her own glory; and
eas'd of all her yoakes in happy freedome,
enjoy the pleaſure to behold her Lord. It
cannot, it cannot (I ſay) be expreſt how
great the extaſies of her joyes muſt bee
when ſhe ſhall not onely be raviſh't with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170057:41"/>
contentments of her glorious condition
for the preſent, but reſt likewiſe ſecur'd
of their eternity, that without leſsning or
decay, but rather with encreaſe they ſhall
endure for ever. Nor is this happineſſe
alone above expreſſion: For no ſoarings of
the moſt elevated ſoules in contemplation
can reach the high perfections of thoſe
bliſſes. We may by the waies of weak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons
give obſcure gueſſes, and ſuch
demonſtrations the excellency of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
onely allowes our conjectures to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
on. Let us then ſeriouſly contemplate
their conditions we commonly allow hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in this world; let us make enquiry of
their felicities, who exceed in riches, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or honor, in ſo great overflowes, that
they ſcarce believe themſelves on Earth:
Then let us weigh the certainty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence
of what they hold themſelves
thus happy in, and wee ſhall find them
poſſeſt with nothing but vanities, which
will leave and quit them ſwifter then a
dream. Nay, imagine thoſe pleaſures laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as their lives (which is the moſt you
can allow them) and yielding the fulneſs
of that content they fancy who enjoy
them, when you find how ſhort that time
is of their being, you will confeſſe them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170057:42"/>
none. And yet how much are worldings
puffed up with theſe tranſitory delights?
Will it not then bee infinite content and
unſpeakable ſatisfaction, to ſoules arriv'd
at the Haven of bliſs, when (having choos'd
the ſtormy Seas of this troubled world)
they ſhall bee landed on the bankes of
peace, and tranquillity, and enter poſſeſſion
of a Kingdom abounding with all joyes,
and pleaſures, honors, glories, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
without end. For in the narrow
ſtreights of this world, hee that poſſeſſes
the largeſt inheritance, may be likened to an
infant within his mothers womb, ſo little is
his liberty, compar'd with the ſpatious
fields of that heavenly paradiſe prepar'd
for the bleſſed from all eternity. And as
thoſe are embrions in the womb, having
not yet the naturall benefit of light, till
their legitimate and full birth, when they
are brought into the world, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
even with their Parents (though in
their firſt clouts) the fulneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their Creation: So have not wee
the true effects and ends of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
till we ſee the day of our glory.
And as amongſt them abortives, ſuch will
be the condemned ſinners at the latter day
amongſt men: abortives, though thoſe never
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170057:42"/>
ſee the light of the Sun; never know day:
yet deliver'd from the cell of the wombe,
into the ſpacious world, have the doom of
a larger, yet to them a darker Priſon, if wee
conſider there is that light for them they
are incapable to enjoy. So, abortives, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents,
ſhall be delivered out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
into greater darkneſſe, out of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into greater afflictions. But the mature
offſpring bearing his marks and characters,
ſhall be preſented to the King of Heaven;
then ſhall the myſtery of ſalvation be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
to them, and they become fellowes
in glory with the Angels, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angells.
Wherefore (my beloved friend)
do not for ever blot out thoſe characters
thou art ſign'd with by Gods Holy ſpirit:
Bury them not in a loathſome abyſſe of
ſinns. Raiſe up thy ſoul by repentance,
which will refine and beautifie thoſe thy
excellent parts that are now beſmear'd and
ſpatter'd with the filth of a diſſolute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
then will the luſtre of thy vertues
dazle thoſe eyes to whom now thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'ſt
a cloud of vanity: The moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
beauty that is in man or woman, is no
beauty, if not in relation to our diſcerning
them; and what to dotage our enamour'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170057:43"/>
ſenſes, have admir'd them; we muſt at the laſt
confeſſe them, ſubject to decay and ruine:
But the beauty of the ſoules exempt from
that ſervitude to natures neceſſities, is of a
more excellent condition then that of the
body in it's greateſt pompe: yet are our
ſoules enjoyments more ours then are our
bodies. So earneſt and paſſionate a lover
of mankind is our Lord, whom hee has
ſo nobly honor'd, that things of leſſer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
(which carry little of greatneſſe in
them) he has decreed to the Laws and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of a naturall production; but has
made us our ſelves the workmen of better,
and more glorious effects. Had the forming
of our bodies beauty been left to us; Our
fantaſtick natures had taken too much care
about it, and we had utterly neglected the
greater buſineſſe of our ſoules. But Divine
providence having denyed us the power,
we may juſtly conclude our task appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to bee the care of our own ſoules.
Since all the curioſity to make our ſelves
finer creatures then we are (which finds ſo
many, ſo much employment for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
hours) is altogether fruitleſſe: The
nicer arts of colours and curles to adorne
us, lookt into have made up nothing but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170057:43"/>
a becomming handſome lie. When ſo
much time ſpent upon the ſoul, had really
enricht and adorn'd it with ſuch beauties
as will laſt for ever. And for all this how
little time ſhould we allow the better part, if
ſo be we had a ful power to accompliſh our
deſire on the more ignoble; ſcarce any time
would be ſpar'd upon our ſoules, could we
beautifie our bodies as we deſire, ſtill ſhould
we be decking and adorning the baſe &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ſlave, whilſt we neglected the ſoule her
Miſtreſſe and Lady with the lazieſt ſloath,
and meaneſt contempt. Therefore has God
taken the effect of this fruitleſſe labour
clean out of our power, if we truly conſider
the end of it: But has given us the uſe of
better, and more profitable labours, and
appointed their reward. For hee that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
truly better and beautifie his body,
may do it to his ſoul, though never ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with ſin, by true contrition and
repentance, making it not onely the object
of good mens affections, and bad mens
envie: But reduce it to the honour to bee
belov'd even of God our Lord, and King.
This is it the Pſalmiſt means, when hee
ſaies <hi>Pſal. 45. ver. 95. So ſhall the King
greatly deſire thy beauty; for he is the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170057:44"/>
Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> Nay, ſuch
is the great benignity of our Lord, that
the vildeſt and moſt diſſolute ſinners may
hope by repentance to regain his favour,
though they ſtand in the higheſt degrees
forfeited to his anger, and ſevere judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Which is very apparant through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Prophets: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> thus patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
aggravates her abhominations faln
into a new unheard of manner of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
contrary to the cuſtome of Harlots.
<hi>They give gifts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to all whores;
but thou giveſt gifts to all thy lovers, and
and hireſt them that come unto thee on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſide for thy whoredome, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is in thee from other women in thy
whoredom, whereas none followeth thee
to commit whoredomes, and in that
thou giveſt a reward, when as no reward
is given unto thee, therefore thou
art contrary.</hi> Yet the mercy and grace of
God calls her home, thus given over to the
abominations of her luſts. For he laid not
this captivity on her, having an eye to his
revenge, and puniſhment on her wickedneſs,
but to convert her, and bring her into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by his corrections. For would God
have puniſh'd her as ſhe deſerv'd, ſhee had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170057:44"/>
been ſwallowed in deſtruction. He had not
brought her captives home, nor prepar'd
for them a better City, or a more glorious
Temple then the old. <hi>Haggai 2. 9. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this latter houſe, ſhall be greater then
the former, ſaith the Lord of hoſts; &amp; in this
wil I give peace ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
See thus often defil'd with her abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Lord will not exclude this City
from repentance, nor ſhut the doors of his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lemency againſt her. No, he will not, nor
will he forſake thee for ever, (though thy
deſperate condition by the ſuggeſtions of
the Divell would perſwade thee to it) but
with infinite deſire and affection receive
thee into mercy if thou returneſt to him;
and he will lovingly embrace thy ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
though thus ſunk in the deeps of
wickedneſſe. For no man, no man (I ſay)
though paſſionate even to madneſs, can ſo
truly affect the greateſt beauty of the
world, as our Lord does the ſoul of man;
And if we look narrowly into the daily
expreſſions of his love to every particular
ſoul, this truth will ſhew it ſelf as clear to
us as the light of the day: And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
abound in teſtimonialls of this his
infinite love to us. Obſerve in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170057:45"/>
and throughout the Prophets, how the
Lord has been wearied, nay, contemn'd
and deſpiſed by his; yet has reſtor'd the
deſertors, and plac'd them again in his
high favours, this witneſſe he bears of
himſelf in the Goſpell; when he ſaies: <hi>Mat.
23. 37. O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that
killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that
are ſent unto thee; how often would I have
gathered thy children, even as a hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
her chickens under her wings, and
you would not.</hi> And Saint Paul. 2 <hi>Cor. 5.
19. God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the world unto himſelf, not imputing
their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to us the word of reconciliation:
Now when we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,
as though God did beſeech you by us; wee
pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be reconciled to
God.</hi> O let us lay theſe invitations to our
hearts, and the minute wee read them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the holy Ghoſt calling us. Nor let us
think it enough that wee believe aright;
for alas, infidelity is not the onely bane of
the ſoul; to believe well availes us nothing,
if we live ill; if wee purifie not our ſoules
from uncleanneſſe, and bid a farwell to
that lewdneſſe of life, which ſo incenſes
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170057:45"/>
the mighty anger of the Lord againſt us.
Becauſe that the fleſhly mind is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God; for it is not obedient to the
Law of God, neither can be. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.
The concupiſcence of the fleſh ſtands like a
ſeparating wall betwixt our ſoules and
mercy, which wee muſt utterly raze and
deſtroy, or never hope to have a free
paſſage to that happy reconciliation,
which will crown our ſoules with triumph
and honor; and make them lovely and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God himſelf. Thou art now
bewitcht, with thy Hermion's: face, and
thinkſt nothing in the world comparable to
ſuch an exceſſe of beauty; believ'ſt the
Earth bears nothing like it; thy ſelfe (if
thou pleaſeſt) maiſt be far more lovely
then ſhe, nay, excell her more then ſtarres
of Gold and ineſtimable workmanſhip doe
images of clay and dirt. If men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
amaz'd, and raviſht with the ſight of
ſome extraordinary beauties; how will
they be extraſied with the ſplendour of a
ſoule in glory. For indeed the ſubſtance
of the greateſt beauties (though in a greater

What is the inſide of her killing glittering

that former grace and beauty (whilſt

and thoſe ineffable honors ſhe ſhall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed

teacheth us, <hi>It is really eaſie to beare the

overcome the petulant paſſions of our luſts,
and the ſame reward is appointed for both
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170057:48"/>
the conqueſts. For when I would draw
thee from thy diſſolute courſes, I invite thee
not to dangers, nor the horrors of eminent
death, nor to perpetuall plagues and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
to no afflictions abroad, nor ſtrife at
hope; no priſons, or Irons, no hazard of
ſhipwrack, no violence of theeves; or thy
own familiarſnares; no hunger, cold, nor
nakedneſſe, neither to ſcorching fire. And
alas, wilt thou dread my exhortations? I
impoſe no bitter task on thee, but on the
contrary, earneſtly deſire thee to ſet thy
ſelf free from a moſt tyrannicall captivity.
And when thou art ranſom'd from this
bondage of thy ſinns, to the happy liberty
thou didſt once enjoy: thy eyes opened to
behold what true bliſs is: Thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
the merited paines of a diſſolute life,
the unquiet and tormenting afflictions of a
mind, given over to carnall luſts; and what
the happineſſe and content of ſuch a godly
life is, as thou didſt formerly leade. It
were no greater wonder that an Athieſt,
who believ'd no reſurrection from the
dead, ſhould lie lull'd in his lethargick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtialitie,
without any ſence of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But that believers, that Chriſtians (who
look after, expect and foreſee what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170057:48"/>
both to the good and bad) for them
to live thus miſerably unconcern'd in their

with the remembrance of their future
hopes or fears is moſt heavy, dul and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſtupidity. When with their lipps men
ſhall profeſſe themſelves believers, but look
into their waies, they are by many degrees
worſe then infidells, and commit greater

them, there are often eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of lives led morally, ſo well that
they are fit to be look'd upon for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
with what ſhame then ſhall we
cover our faces, when the actions of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and aliens to God may be precepts.
Merchants who have ſuffer'd great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and loſſes, fall not from their hopes,
but try the Seas again, though there be the
ſame danger of ſtormes, and ſhipwrack,
which they know their greateſt skill and
care cannot ſometimes avoid. And ſhall
we baſe unworthy cowards that ſuffer by
ſin and wickedneſs, not dare the recovery of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170057:49"/>
our loſt ſoules, nor attempt our future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
though wee fall into dangerous
lapſes, being wee know we are forbid to
deſpair in the greateſt extremities. When
indeed no evill has power over us unleſſe
we willingly our ſelves conſent unto it. And
why remain we then ſo inſenſibly ſtupid?
why uſe we not our hands in this combat,
but lie as if they were tyed behind us, or
what is worſe, (if they are employ'd) it
is againſt us our ſelves; what madneſſe is
this? that men entring the liſts to fight their
adverſaries, turne all their blowes upon
themſelves. The Divell lies in ambuſh for
us, diligently obſerving the advantages hee
has over humane weakneſſe to make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
our ſelves. Wee muſt have courage
then with undaunted ſpirits to meet the
cunning aſſaltant on every attempt againſt
us, or with our own negligence and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
fears he ruins us for ever. As thou art
fallen (<hi>Theodorus</hi>) ſo likewiſe fell bleſſed
<hi>David;</hi> he to adultery added the heynous

did he lie under the burthen of his

but overcome by Satan lay proſtrate to his

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170057:49"/>
againſt his enemy? and fought him with
ſo prevailing courage, that his children
after him were the trophies of his victory,
and receiv'd the benefits of his conqueſt.
For when <hi>Solomon</hi> his Sonn's heart was
turn'd after other Gods by means of his
wives, 1 <hi>Kings 11. When he went after</hi>
Aſhtoreth <hi>the Goddeſs of the</hi> Sidonians,
<hi>and</hi> Milcom <hi>the abomination of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Ammon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When he had with
all his abhominations provok'd the Lord,
it is recorded in holy writ, that for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
ſake, God rent not his Kingdome
from him. <hi>ver. 11. I will ſurely rend
thy Kingdome from thee, and will give it
to thy ſervant; Notwithſtanding, in thy daies
I will not do it, for</hi> David <hi>thy fathers ſake,
but I will rend it out of the hands of
thy Son. Howbeit I will not rend away all
thy Kingdome: but will give one tribe to
thy Son, for</hi> David <hi>my ſervants ſake.</hi> So
likewiſe in the daies of <hi>Hezekias,</hi> though

2 Kings 19. 34. I will defend this
City to ſave it, for mine own ſake, and for</hi>
David <hi>my ſervants ſake.</hi> Thus did the
Lord continue the remembrance of <hi>Davids</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:170057:50"/>
hearty penitence; to ſhew us how effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
true repentance finds acceſſe to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
of Heaven. This ſervant of the Loreds
diſputed not againſt his redemption; had
he had the deſperate opinion thou ſeemeſt
to be of now, that hee could not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
to God: He would have ſaid perhaps;
God has done me mighty honors; he has
choſen me into the number of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
has given me Empire and Dominion
over my brethren; and deliver'd me out of
mighty dangers; and how can I hope for
his mercy, whom after ſo manifold bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
I have thus infinitely offended. Had
the Prophet permitted ſuch deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to overcome him, he had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excluded himſelfe from Gods favour in
that his ſad condition at the preſent, but
had blotted out the remembrance of all his
former life. As the wounds of the body neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
grow altogether incurable, ſo thoſe
of the ſoul, if we ſeek not for their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
lapſe us into eternall perdition: yet
ſuch is our folly, that in the leaſt diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of our bodies, we refuſe no paines, no
troubles, but ſubmit to any tortures art can
preſcribe for our recovery, but obſtinately
werefuſe the medicins of our ſick ſouls: nay,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170057:50"/>
though wee are ſo ill, that we are beyond
all cure, with what a longing deſire we are
attentive to what the Phyſician ſpeakes, in
the laſt extreames willing to hear of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
But in the diſeaſe of our ſoules wee
deſpair, and languiſh before we ſee reaſon
for it, ſince the moſt dangerous wounds
there are not incurable. And where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſickneſſe is really deſperate: wee
continue our hopes; but miſerably deſpaire
where there is no need: And where we are
abſolutely forbid it, we are willfully diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
putting on the vanity of a confidence
when 'tis ridiculous and beyond all hopes:
but ſuch is our naturall fond inclination
to our bodies, that wee look on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
with horror and affrightment, and in
the hazards of our pretious ſoules, are ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly
inſenſible. Me thinks in ſuch a ſtate,
thoſe words of Chriſt may awake our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
dull ſpirits. <hi>Mat. 10. 28. Fear not them
which kill the body, but are not able to kill
ſoul: but rather fear him who can deſtroy
both ſoul and body in Hell.</hi> If theſe be not
prevalent with thee, to perſwade thee as
yet to return to thy integrity, I ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in anguiſh and affliction of ſoul for
thy deferring ſo long, ſo acceptable and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170057:51"/>
neceſſary a task as thy reforming thy life,
but I cannot utterly deſpair of thee,
though thou wilfully do ſo of thy ſelfe as
yet; for I ſhould be then guilty of thy own
folly and peeviſhneſſe by my diſtruſt. Which
is a ſin I will not commit: For (though
I ſee thee ſtrangely fallen) I will ſtill truſt
in Gods mercy and grace to thee, and
doubt not but to ſee thee in a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

how thoſe barbarous, rude, and mad people
apprehended their imminent deſtruction: &amp;
togther underſtood the poſſibility of their

they owe their maſters, and commit
foul faults againſt them, yet if they grow
ſorrowfull, and recant that diſobedience,
they are againe received into their
maſters good opinion, and ſometimes
with advantage of preferment: God our
gratious Lord and maſter, (whoſe thoughts
and waies exceed thoſe of men) will deale
as favourably; Nay, far more mercifully
with us. If the intent of his creating us,
had been to damn us, then thy deſpaire
were reaſonable and juſt, nor couldſt thou
do otherwiſe then doubt of ſalvation, when
none were prepar'd for thee; But God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made thee out of his goodneſſe, and
created thee to good ends no leſs then that
thou mightſt enjoy everlaſting happineſſe,
(and to that intent his great workes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

not to perceive it) what ſhould make thee
thus diffident, or in the leaſt to miſtruſt his

yielding to thoſe paſt which ſo miſerably
overcame us; ſo ſhall wee be able to give a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170057:53"/>
manifeſt teſtimony of our perfect change.
For nothing more provokes our Lord then
our obſtinacie and denyall to returne into
the right way. For to do ill is but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
weakneſſe, to perſevere Diabolicall
malice. Conſider how horrid a thing
it was, which wee read in the Prophet,
that <hi>Iudah</hi> call'd back in the race of her
vild whoredomes, would not return to the
Lord: <hi>Jer. 3. 7. And I ſaid, after ſhee had
done all theſe things, turn thou unto me;
but ſhe returned not.</hi> The Lord ſtrives with
us, to ſhow how mercifully he is inclin'd to
our ſalvation, many are his promiſes to
thoſe who return into the right way, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
the Meanders, and by-paths of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
When hee ſaw <hi>Iſraels</hi> promiſes of
repentance, that they began to prepare
their hearts to fear him, and to keep his
Commandements; his promiſe was, that
it ſhould bee well with them and their
Children for ever. Wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> joyns
the reward with the command, when hee
bids them <hi>to keep the Commands of the
Lord and his ſtatutes, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>
(ſaies he) <hi>for their good.</hi> Deut. 10.
13. And immediately before, he commands
us to fear him, to walk in his waies, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170057:53"/>
to love him. Which is moſt remarkable,
that the God of Heaven ſhould earneſtly
ſeek their loves, who ſo wretchedly offend
him. Wherefore ought wee to love him
who deſires to belov'd of us, who woes us,
and does us all things to win our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Nay, who ſpar'd not his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son for us, but gave him up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him to the ignominious death of
the Croſſe, that we might be reconcil'd to
him. And what think you, ſo loving a
Father will do for them, he has purchas'd
at ſo dear a rate. Nay, and what lies on
our duty, which is humiliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
even that he preſſes on us, if wee
were not inſenſible of our own miſeries
(the evill of our own miſeries) the evill of
our own condition would invite us to. As
he ſpeakes by the Prophet. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43. 26,
Tell thy ſinns firſt, declare thou that
thou maiſt be juſtified. Which the Lord
ſpeakes, deſiring to make our affections
vehement, that ſo with freeneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penneſs
of heart, we may deliver our ſelves
up to his mercifull kindneſſe. Infinite is
this love of our Lord while we anger and
provoke him, while we abuſe his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and his patience, all this ingratitude
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170057:54"/>
cannot extinguiſh his love, and when hee
laies open to us the injuries wee offer his
divine Majeſty, he does it but to dilate on
his love, and ſo to tye our affections nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to him; and demands of us nothing but
penitent acknowledgment. If then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
our ſinnes unto him bring with it
ſo much comfort, as the promiſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
how great will our joy be, when
our workes are rendred acceptable in the
ſight of God, and all the filth and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of them waſht quite away. And if
this way to him were not acceſſible, after
we err'd and leudly ſtrai'd from the paths
of righteouſneſſe, how few of many ſoules
now glorified in Heaven, had ever ſeen
their ſalvation. It is worthy all mens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
ſeriouſly to conſider the returne
of many deſperate ſinners, who after the
reconcilement of their enormous ſoules
to grace, have ſtrangely excell'd in piety,
and outſhin'd thoſe who were (in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of them) unſpotted and undefiled:
For the ſame heat and violence of theirs
which made them rage in ſinne, has after
their converſion turn'd into a zeale as
paſſionate in good and vertuous determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
out of a true ſence of their guilt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170057:54"/>
and the merited judgements on their

Magdalen</hi> when hee anſwer'd, <hi>Simon,
Luk. 7. 44. Doeſt thou ſee this woman?

my feet with tears, and wiped them
with the hairs of her head. Thou gaveſt
me no kiſſe, but this woman ſince I came
in, hath not ceaſed to kiſs my feet: My
head with oyle thou didſt not annoint; but
this woman hath annointed my feet with
oyntment. Wherefore I ſay unto thee, her
ſins which are many, are fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

loved much; but to whom little is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the ſame loveth little: and he ſaid
unto her, Thy ſins are forgiven.</hi> This is
the Devills reaſon, both for his vigilance
and fears, that hee has often known the
greateſt ſinners, prove the ſincereſt peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.
It is this makes him dread the
loſing of his prey, when hee perceives a
conſcience beginning to be ſtruck with
the ſenſe of ſin! O how he fears and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
at the very firſt ſtep a tranſgreſſor
makes out of his ſnares, how he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at our leaſt inclinations to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170057:55"/>
For they who have once begun this
happy courſe, can very difficulty bee
turn'd back from it; the zeale of true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
burnes like a flame within us, till
it conſumes our droſſe, and refines our
ſoules to a greater purity then that of
Gold tryed in the fire. Wee are driven
with the horrid memory of our paſt ſins,
as if it were with a violent wind into the
Haven of vertue. And this is the reaſon
that great ſinners often prove better then
they who ſeldome fell; becauſe their
undertakings is to be manag'd with
greater fervour, and alacrity; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the beginning onely deludes
us, it ſeems a precipice at firſt, too hard
for us to clime off the bottome of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the top of piety; while our feet
are nail'd in Hell, wee may deem it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to get looſe, and fly to Heaven;
Therefore wee muſt boldly enter into
this conflict, our reſolved penitence muſt
ſtorme the paſſe, though the enemy ſpit
fire in our faces; valiantly aſſault him,
and thou haſt already overcome the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
wretch; the vanquiſht Devill
flyes thee, and leaves thee maſter of the

let us aſcend into this Heavenly
City, let us ſtep up the firſt ſtepps, and
never look back; till wee arrive at it,
for there are wee appointed Citizens;

negligent obſtinacy become deſperate)
run upon vices unheard of, abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
never dream't of, imminent death
and damnation ſtoppe not the violence
of their courſes, but ſtill they winde
themſelves into wild Labyrinths, where
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170057:56"/>
they are loſt for ever. I therefore intreate
thee (<hi>Theodorus</hi>) before thou drownſt
thy ſelf any more in this thy drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
manly to contend to get out of it;
Awake, recover and cure thy ſoule of
this diabolick ſurfeit. If thou think'ſt it
too difficult preſently to reſolve, to leave
it quite off, do it by degrees. Though in
my opinion, ſuch excuſes are childiſh,
fond delaies; and too much ſhow thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
on thy beaſtlineſſe. For if thou
tryeſt, thou wilt find it a moſt eaſie
maſtery to caſt thoſe baſe ſuggeſtions, if a
true knowledge and diſdain of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
reaſons back thee in the conflict.
O let the bleſſed contemplation on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
prevaile with thee, to accompliſh
this bleſt converſion. I beſeech and pray
thee by thoſe vertues by which thou once
didſt ſo highly merit, by that former truſt,
and confidence in our Lord; to let us
ſee thee rais'd again to that top of vertue,
where thou wert once ſo eminent; and
from which thou felleſt ſo miſerably;
Let us ſee thee recover the loſt ſtrength
and vigour of thy ſoule. Pitty them that
are ſcandaliz'd and offended at thy fall;
Pitty thoſe who perhaps by thy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170057:56"/>
example run into the ſame dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
deſpairing of the waies of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
ſeeing thee forſake them. Conſider
how great the grief and ſorrow is, who
dearly love thee. And that this thy rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
ſtate can be joy or gladneſſe to
none but deſperate Atheiſts, and youths
ſacrific'd to their luſts and ſenſualities;
Return then to thy former goodneſſe, and
piety; we thy friends ſhall be over full of
joy to ſee that happy hour. When thou
haſt left them to contempt and infamie,
who are now Enemies to thy recovery;
malitiouſly wiſhing thou maiſt ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this diſſolute life; Then will wee
triumph 'ore them, who gloried to blaſt
thy honor: and once aſſur'd of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
triumphing, crown thee with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium's,
when thy detractors ſhall bluſh
and envie the truths our tongues ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of thee. Add to this the benefits
thy example may bring to other falling
ſoules; ſeldome it is, but ſuch recoveries
beget companions; and what a joy will
that be, when the ſplendour of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
ſhall give light to others to find
the way out of the ſame darkneſſe. Do
not (<hi>Theodorus</hi>) neglect ſo great a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170057:57"/>
good as may happen by thy return to
vertue. And for pitty deny not our ſoules
the joy we ſhall have for thee. Keep not
us in this depth of grieving for thee, but
turn our ſuffocating lamentations into
gentler melodious aires of joy and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
Which will be full in us when we
ſee thou haſt forſaken the troops of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and that thou art come over to the
army of Angells, and enroll'd in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
of Heaven. Conſider how infinitely
exemplary and eminent their glories be,
who eſcape the toiles and ſnares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
how much they acquire of praiſe and
reward, whoſe true repenrance brings
them home to the Lord, how indeed they
ſeem to excell thoſe who have appear'd
alwaies virtuous, as has been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
out of holy writ. So Harlots
and Publicans have gain'd the Kingdome
of Heaven for the lot of their inheritance,
and many who were laſt, have obtain'd
the preeminence to be the firſt.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Saint Chryſoſtome relates a ſtory of

Son of Zebedeus, and of Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,

fallen Theodorus.</head>
            <p>I Will now relate to thee (<hi>Theodorus</hi>)
a ſtory of mine own time, and of which
I my ſelfe am a witneſſe; I knew a young
<hi>Phoenix</hi> the Son of <hi>Urbanus;</hi> Who was
left a very young Orphan by his Parents,
with a very great fortune in Monies,
Land, and Servants. His education was
ſutable to his Eſtate, ſumptuous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
his ſtudies moſt in the liberall arts,
much addicted he was to muſick, and all
the moſt pleaſing attractives of ſo green
years. He on an inſtant forſakes his more
delightfull ſtudies, all his pomp of
youth, and gaiety of cloaths, and clad
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170057:58"/>
himſelfe with the courſeſt veſtments hee
could get, putting on the auſterity of
the moſt reſerv'd religions. Hee betakes
himſelf to the Mountaines, and moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
retirements, ſpending his time in
the higheſt and moſt profound contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations;
Hee was alwaies exerciſed in
matters unproportionable to the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of ſo young a Philoſopher; hee
ſoar'd to the higheſt and moſt ſublime
ſtudies, ſuch things as were the labours
of the greateſt proficients in Divinity,
were his onely imployment; till at length
he decrees and dedicates himſelf to holy
orders, for which he had the repute to be
very fit, and gave large teſtimonies of his
ſufficiency for his undertakings. Every
man began exceedingly to rejoyce and
wonder, that a young man ſo nicely
bred up in all plenty and delicacy, one
ſprung from ſo noble a ſtock, ſhould in
the prime of his youth forſake the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
and delights of his large fortune,
and all that bewitched happineſſe, which
deludes the fancy of moſt men, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
ſo ſtrict and ſevere a courſe of life;
moſt admirable it was, that not any
temptation (of thoſe many his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170057:58"/>
and fortune afforded him) could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his progreſſe to the very height and
greateſt perfection of a contemplative life.
At which eminence, when hee was arriv'd
and juſtly become all mens wonder, ſome
of his own family eſteeming this his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
beneath the dignity of his birth:
make themſelves the corruptors of his
inclinations. Their ſiren ſonges allure
him into the waves of his former vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
He forſakes all his pious reſolution;
quits his ſolitary, and contemplative life
on the Mountains, and his happy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and now begins to fill the ſtreets
with his train, and pompe; his multitude
of horſes, his ſuperfluous retinue, with
thouſands of other follies are every mans
diſcourſe; in fine, he grows ſo diſſolute,
that he lives neither temperately nor cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly;
But enflam'd with all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and ſhameleſſe luſts fell into moſt
abhominable courſes. Every good man
(who ſees his tribe of ſycophants, and
lewd villains ſtick ſocloſe to him) deſpairs
of him, who had no Parents living to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and curbe the enormities of his laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
youth, which had the ill advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a vaſt fortune to feed his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170057:59"/>
inclinations. Some there were who
calmly expoſtulate with him, and urge
him (though he forſook the ſeverities he
lately had undergone) he would yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelfe to his former more pleaſing,
and delightfull exerciſes; and bethinks
himſelf how convenient it were more
carefully to look to his Eſtate, and the
honor of his noble Family; theſe things
were often rung in his ears, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
not them the hearing, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the ſpeaking. The goodneſſe of his
nature, and an innate modeſty he had often
ſhow'd, encourag'd ſome holy religious
men to ſeeke all meanes to get into his
good opinion, that ſo they might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their duties to God in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to reclaim a perſon of whom they
conceiv'd ſo much hopes; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they diligently and conſtantly
watch and obſerve him: When they met
him abroad, their cuſtome was to ſalute
him with all reſpect, all love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which hee at firſt but ſlighted;
Yet theſe compaſſionate men, infinitly
ambitious to preſerve his periſhing youth,
would not be mov'd at his behaviour, or
put by the good of their intentions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170057:59"/>
ſtill their eyes fixt upon the mark
they ſo coveted to hit, they would not be
put off from the reſolution they had to
redeem this lambe from the wolfes
jawes by ſome meanes or other, which at
length, with much ſtudy and patience
they performed. For in the end hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſomething mov'd with their civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and a little to wonder at their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
to him, (being conſcious that
his waies were not at all agreeable to
their liking.) In ſo much, that if hee
ſpyed them a far off, hee would leap from
his horſe and reverently meet them with
his eyes fixt on the Earth, and with a
grave ſerious attention, and hearken to
what they ſaid, till in proceſſe of time,
his reſpect to them continually encreaſing,
he ever treats them with ſuch becomming
geſtures, as were due to their good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and Divine callings. By this
artifice of theirs, they reſtore this young
man to the grace and favour of God, and
breaking all thoſe nets entangled him,
reduc'd him to his own peace of ſoule,
and to the love of Heavenly wiſdome,
and true piety. In which he grew ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and farre excelled others; That no
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170057:60"/>
man could dream he ever had led ſo vain
a life, when they ſaw him ſo exceedingly
reform'd. For having now learn't by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
what the dangerous baits of
looſe and ungovern'd appetites were, hee
diſtributes all his riches amongſt the
poor, and needy. And thus he frees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from all worldly incumberances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
all lets and obſtacles that lay in
his way to that Haven whither hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
his courſe, and where at length hee
arriv'd, and became a rare and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
pattern of devotion, and true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
thus fell this noble youth, and thus
recover'd he the eternall happineſs of his
ſoul.</p>
            <p>Another after an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
patience,<note place="margin">The Hermet.</note> and many hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
in his Hermitage (who with one
ſingle companion, had liv'd in a Cell to
a very great age, and there led a moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
life) at laſt by the malice and
ſubtlety of the Devill, fell into idleneſſe
and ugly dreames, into ſluggiſh and
yauning deſires, and gives Satan the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſurprize him. Who fires
him with luſt after a woman, hee burnes
to have one, though hee had ſeen none of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170057:60"/>
the ſex for many years, that is, from the
firſt day he entred into his ſolitude. Firſt,
hee askes his companion for delitious
meats, wine, and Junkets, threatning him
(unleſſe he got them for him) hee would
himſelfe break the ties of his vows, and
go to the next Town, and fetch them.
Which hee did not out of a true longing
for wine, or thoſe delicates, but made
this pretence for his farther lewd purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
his companion attempts him with all
the perſwaſive cunning he could, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him willfull in his reſolutions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
him to get thoſe things he deſir'd
to ſatisfie his appetite, leſt it might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
him to run into greater ſins. Which
he perceiving, and ſeeing his intents
like to be fruſtrated; began to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him, and ſaies he muſt himſelfe
to the Town. His friend (who in vaine
ſtrove to hinder his ſtrange madneſſe)
yields his conſent to that too; but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him a far off, obſerves whither he
goes; And at length ſpies him enter into
a brothell; where he learnt out that hee
had got a woman into his embraces:
which when he knew, hee ſtaies abroad
in expectation of the Hermits returne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:170057:61"/>
The old man after his lewd converſation,
comes from the brothell. This compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
meets him and receives him into his
armes, and kiſſes him extream kindly,
never queſtions him what had paſt, but
deſires (if hee had ſatisfied his appetite)
that he would return to the Cell. This
great meekneſſe in his friend brings the
poor Hermit to a perfect ſence of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſin he had committed, and a great
ſhame for it; thus with paſſionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
and contrition of heart he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
his friend to the Mountaines, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
ſtill by the way his inconſiderate
licentious fall: Comes thither, he ſhuts
himſelfe into a little roome of the
Cell, locks the door, which after he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
opens but to his companion who
brought him his bread and water; hee
charg'd his friend likewiſe when any one
askt for him to deny him, and make an
excuſe as if he ſlept; He found his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
very willing to aſsent to this; hee
then ſhuts himſelfe up cloſe, and there
ſpends his whole time in faſting and
prayers, and devotion, cleanſing his
ſoul from the guilt and filth of his abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
tranſgreſſion. Not long after a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170057:61"/>
great drought invades the neighbouring
Country: When all the inhabitants had
in vain bewail'd this calamitie, one of
them was commanded in a dream to goe
to his recluſe, deſire him to pray for
them, and that then the drought ſhould
leave them. He went and took his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
with him, and comming they
found the Hermits old companion alone;
who told them the man they ſought was
dead. They return to their prayers again;
and again had the ſame anſwer by the
viſion in every thing like the former;
then more reſolutely they demand the
Hermit of his friend (who was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to confeſſe the truth) till they
conjur'd him to ſhew them the man,
affirming with vehement aſſeverations
that they knew he was not yet dead, but
that he lived. He heard them thus earneſt,
and gueſs'd that the ſecret compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and his friend was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd;
he conducts them to the place
where the man was, where they found
the doors lockt faſt againſt them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
they broke down the wall,
and ruſht in all upon him, where kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his feet, they declared the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170057:62"/>
of the command they had from the
viſion to him, requeſting his prayers
that they might be free'd from the
drought. He at firſt denies them, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his unworthineſſe to be far below
the confidence to believe he could obtaine
any ſuch bleſſing from God: For he had
yet the horror of his old fault before his
eyes as freſh as it had been then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
At laſt (when they declar'd all which
had happen'd unto them) overcome
with their importunities, he was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to pray for them; and as ſoon as hee
had pray'd the drought ceas'd.</p>
            <p>What alſo became of that
young man who was the
ſchollar of <hi>John</hi> the Son of
<hi>Zebedeus</hi> in his youth;<note place="margin">The ſchooler of John, In Euſebius Eccles. Hiſt. lib. 5. c. 2.</note> and
turn'd afterwards for a long
time a leader of theeves and
robbers: yet it ſo fell out, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at the laſt again by the holy hands
of the bleſſed old man; out of the Caves
and denns of Robbers, hee returnes into
the waies of religion and piety. This
thou art not ignorant, of his thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
as well as I: For I have heard thee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the meekneſſe, ſweetneſſe, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170057:62"/>
of the good old man; when the
ſtory has been related how he firſt kiſs'd his
bloody hands, and after that earneſtly
embrac'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by this ſoftneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
him to his loſt goodneſſe. So
bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> did not onely receive <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi>
that unprofitable vagabond, that
theefe converted to goodneſs, but thought
him fit to be honour'd with honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to his Maſters. <hi>Philemon 10. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee, ſaith he, for my Son</hi> Oneſimus,
<hi>whom I have begotten in my bonds: Who
in times paſt was to thee u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>profitable: but
now profitable both to thee and me. Whom
I have ſent again; Thou therefore receive
him who is my own bowells: whom I
would have retain'd with me, that in thy
stead he might have miniſtred with me
in the bonds of the Goſpell: But without
thy mind would I do nothing: that thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
ſhould not be as it were of neceſſity, but
willingly: For perhaps he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
for a ſeaſon, that thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him for ever. Not now as a ſervant,
but above a ſervant, a brother belov'd, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to me, but how much more unto
thee, both in the fleſh and in the Lord. If
thou count me therefore a partner, receive
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170057:63"/>
him, as my ſelf.</hi> In the contrary caſe, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> writeth thus to the <hi>Corinthians.
1 Cor. 12. 21. And leſt when I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
my God will bring me low amongſt
you, and that I ſhall bewaile many which
have ſinned amongſt you, and have not
repented.</hi> And again he tells them 2 <hi>Cor.
13. 2. As before I foretold you, I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
you, that if I come, I will not ſpare.</hi>
Doeſt thou not underſtand whoſe loſt
condition it is he ſo bewailes; 'tis their?
whom he will not ſpare; it is not thoſe
ſinners whom hee brought to repentance
by his holy precepts; but thoſe who
were obſtinate and would not lend their
eares to his divine dictates. And this as
I foretell, ſo I foretell you of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
was writ for all poſterity of Chriſtians.
For though the bleſſed Apoſtle be not
preſent with us as he had been with thoſe
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> nor writ immediately to
us: yet Chriſt is preſent with us, who
then ſpake by him. And wee are deeply
concern'd in this ſharpe menace; for if
we preſumptuouſly perſevere in ſin, hee
will not ſpare us, but will ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
us, both in this world and in the
world to come. Let us prevent his wrath,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170057:63"/>
and turn the face of his anger from us, in
confeſſion of our ſinns, and let us powre
out our hearts before him. <hi>Eccleſ. 21. 1.
My Son</hi> (ſaies the Son of <hi>Sirach) haſt thou
ſinned? do ſo no more, but ask pardon for
thy former ſins.</hi> Let us not ſtay for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,
but our ſelves accuſe our ſelves, and
ſo preventing him wee ſhall render our
Judge the more mercifull to us. Thou
wilt ſay, thou doeſt confeſſe thy ſinnes,
and that thou deemſt thy ſelf miſerable
above meaſure. I believe thee. But I muſt
entreat more of thee; that thy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
juſtifie thy ſincerity. For ſo long as
thy confeſſion is not from thy heart, that
thou doeſt not accuſe thy ſelf ſeverely
with a purpoſe to reform them; thy ſinns
will grow greater, and lie the heavier on
thee. For no man brings his undertakings
to a true perfection, who proſecutes them
not with alacrity and due obſervance.
Would any man that ſowes fling away
his ſeed but in expectation to receive the
fruit there of? Who ever propounded to
himſelf (if hee were wiſe) to labour in
vain? and get no reward for his paines
Can he likewiſe who ſows hypocriticall,
tears, prayers, and confeſſion of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170057:64"/>
(without a lively hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in Gods mercies) ever think to
refrain from his ſinns? no! he muſt needs
ſtill remain under the curſe of deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For as a husbandman who once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaires
of his croppe, neglects to prevent
the deſtruction of his Corn: So hee who
ſows a ſeeming repentance, though with
tears in his deluding eyes; yet expecting
no profit by it, will not at all take care
to baniſh thoſe malignant inclinations
from his ſoul which utterly deſtroy his
reconciliation to God. Alas, what is it to
repent, if we perſevere in our wickedneſſ?
<hi>Eccl. 34. For when one buildeth</hi> (ſaith
the Scripture) <hi>and another pulleth down,
what profit have they but labour? Hee
that waſheth himſelf after touching a dead
body, if he touch it again, what availeth
it him? So is it with a man that praies
and faſts for his ſinns, and goeth againe
and doth the ſame, who will hear his
prayer, or what doth his humbling
profit him?</hi> No! who ever diverts from
righteouſneſs to ſin, the Lord will pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare
for him a ſword. <hi>Proverbs 26. 11.
And as a dogge returning to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170057:64"/>
becomes odious: ſo does a fool, who by
his own wilfulneſſe renewes his ſinns.</hi>

            <p>IT is not ſufficient for a periſhing ſoule
barely to accuſe it ſelf of ſin: but the
ſubſtance as well as the forme muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
for the efficacie of repentance to
juſtification. Our contrition muſt beare
a manifeſt accompt of our ſhame, and
deteſtation of ſin with a ſolid reſolution
againſt all relapſes. Hypocriſy is a maske
ſo eaſily put on, that it is ordinary and
common throughout the whole world,
ſeemingly to condemn our ſelves of our
evill waies, infidells do it with much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
deteſtation of their iniquities.
Many men and women in the very ſcene
while they are acting their wickedneſſe,
will acknowledge their baſeneſſe, when
they conſider the following ſhame:
though they determine not to ſeeke after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170057:65"/>
gathering the fruit of true repentance,
or diving home to the perfections and
ends of confeſſion which are amendment,
and reſolution. Vain and of no effect are
thoſe acknowledgements, which proceed
neither from compunction of ſoul, nor
are accompanied with tears truely bitter,
and heart-breaking contrition which are
the onely evidences of a reſolv'd change.
And yet there is ſomething like this in
the world which is not it, there are ſome
demure Devills which ſpeak like Saints,
making their hearers believe by their
grace and elegant ſetting forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they are what they never intend to
be; While they ſeek onely the reputation,
and honor to be accounted good: Which
is the moſt eaſie deluſion poſſible; for who
can judge of that which is preſented to
him in contrary colours, for the crime
would not be the ſame if another man
knew the truth of it, and how to tell it:
as when the offender delivers it for
ſuch as he would have it believ'd. There
are another ſort of dull ſinners, who are
ſo ſenceleſſe grown with their deſpair,
and cloſed with the deadneſſe of their
condition, that they reſpect neither good
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170057:65"/>
opinion, nor bad, and will tell ſtories of
their own ſhame, with as much venome
as their detractors would: believing their
glory the greater the more wicked they
make themſelves. God forbid I ſhould
live to ſee thee like any of theſe; either a
demure Hypocrite diſſembling the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, whilſt thou art rotten within;
or ſo vile a wretch as would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to ſin, unleſſe he had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to boaſt of it.</p>
            <p>What thou art chiefly exhorted to by
my counſell (my belov'd <hi>Theodorus</hi>) is
to pluck up by the rootes from the very
bottome of thy heart all diffidence in
Gods mercy, and all deſpair. Now let
us inquire what is the root, and mother
of deſpair. It is a ſtupid faintneſſe
of mans heart; a deprivation of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in our ſpirits; which may moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be call'd not onely the root, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of deſperation, but the nurſe of it.
As putrifaction in a dead carkaſſe breeds
wormes, and thoſe wormes encreaſe in
that putrifaction; ſo mutually does his
faintneſſe of heart combine with that
deſpair it ſelf bred, and is the nurſing
cauſe of its encreaſe. So doe they alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170057:66"/>
adminiſter nutriment to all the
incurable plagues of our ſoule; It muſt
then be thy part to overcome this
dull ſtupidity atd faintneſſe in thee, and
thou wilt find that having reſum'd a
Chriſtian courage, and reſolv'd confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in God: Thy deſpair will quickly
vaniſh: For he that faints not, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
and he that abjures not his hopes
of ſalvation cannot faint; or cowardly
ſubmit to his own eternall deſtruction.
Thy reſolution muſt part with theſe aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
benumm'd faintneſſe, and dangerous
deſpair. For where theſe keep poſſeſſion,
the ſoul loſes her uniformity, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eſſence; becomes every thing, turnes
into every monſtrous ſhape that varietie
of ſins can put upon her. And who is hee
we may truly judge to be in this ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'
It is thus anſwered; it ſometimes
happens, that a man may repent and ſeem
to correct ſome of his known and groſſeſt
enormities; and in the meane time ſinns
again, goes on ſtill inſenſibly encreaſing
the weight and burthen of his former
tranſgreſſions, whoſe guilt is never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
taken away, till abſolutely amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and this in time proves the greateſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170057:66"/>
cauſe of deſperation; This is truly to builde
with the one, and pluck down with the
other hand: and on this he muſt alwaies
think ſeriouſly who by entire reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intends his ſouls good. For if we look
not to the ſcales, all our good deeds, our
prayers, and our tear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s will prove too
light, if ſuch a continuall weight of ſinne
through our negligence be crept into the
contrary ballance; and from hence will
follow our eternall damnation. But let us
ſtill be exercis'd in good deeds, and the
conſcience of diſcharging our duties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our power will be a coat of
male upon us, and bear off all the darts
and arrowes of Hell's malice, that they
ſhall not be able to harme us. For ſuch
is the favour of God to good deeds, that
they who have done ſome good on earth,
and yet eſcape not the ſeverity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
ſhall have their pains miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
and find ſome conſolation even in
the cruelty of torments. But he who never
did any good deed, and can give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accompt but of a wild reckoning of
a life ſtill continued, and ended in ſin,
what tongue can expreſſe the extremity
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170057:67"/>
of torments that forlorne ſoule is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demn'd
to. There will be at laſt a tryall
of good and bad deeds; if the former
weigh down the ſcales but a little, they
will very much ſecure the owner; nor will
he ſuffer puniſhments equall to the ills hee
has committed. But the weight of ſin
without any counterpoiſe of vertue ſinkes
us into the deepeſt abyſſe of Hell. Nor
does this diſcourſe alone aver this: For
the records of holy writ moſt amply teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the ſame. The Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
ſhewes it. <hi>Matth. 16. 27. He ſhall
render</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every man according
to his workes.</hi> Nor in Hell onely, but in
Heaven alſo ſhall there be difference of
reward. <hi>John 14. 2. In my Fathers houſe
are many manſions, ſaies our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
And again, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 41. There is
one glory of the Sun, another of the
the Moon, another of the Starrs, for one
Star differeth from another Star in glory,
ſo likewiſe in the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi>
Let him who conſiders this value the
expence of his labour, and be continually
employ'd in good deeds. If we attain not
the glory of the Sun or the Moon, wee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170057:67"/>
get to be little ſtarrs, if we diſcharge the
duty of good Chriſtians ſo far as to get
there at all. If we ſhine not in glory like
Diamonds, or like Gold, wee may like
Silver. But we muſt be carefull we are not
found of materialls fitter for the fire then
a place in his Heavenly manſions. And if
wee are not able to diſcharge the higheſt
actions of perfection, let us not neglect
the due obſervance of leſſer things which
we may perform. For it is moſt deſperate
madneſſe to do no good at all, becauſe
we are not in the ſtate of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
perfection. For as worldlings grow
rich by ſaving every little trifle, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their ſtore, ſo are ſpirituall riches at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by a circumſpect laying hold on
every occaſion wherein we may ſerve our
Lord. It is wonderfull and ſomething
ſtrange to humane ſence, that God has
appointed ſo great a reward as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven to him that ſhall but
give a cup of cold water in his name?
yet are men ſo fooliſh, that unleſſe they
can atchieve the greateſt, they neglect
leſſer matters which are likewiſe very
profitable. He that neglects not his duty
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170057:68"/>
in things but ſmall in their appearance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
will learn to be able to performe greater.
But he that is negligent in a little, will be
a weak diſcharger of greater duties. And
to prevent this humane inclination,
Chriſt has left us great propoſalls of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
reward for things to be compaſt with
very little trouble. What is more eaſie
then to pay the labourer his hire, which
is but a part of thy own gain, and yet
large are the promiſes of our Lord for
that. See then the way to lay hold on
Everlaſting ſalvation, &amp; enter into it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in our Lord, &amp; pray inceſſantly unto
him, again, ſubmit thy ſelf to his eaſie
yoak, take on thy ſhoulders the light
burthen thou bearſt in a more happy
condition: and let the end of it prove
worthy the beginning of thy life. Do not,
O do not deſpiſe ſuch infinite riches
which freely flow unto thee: And they
are all for ever loſt to thee, if thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevereſt
to exaſperate our Lord with thoſe
ill courſes thou art in. For if thou yet
ſtopſt the channells, and hinder'st this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
in time before it has made too great
a breach; thou maiſt repaire thy loſſes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170057:68"/>
to thy great advantage. When thou haſt
conſidered, and meditated ſeriouſly on
this, as thou oughteſt, fling away the
filth and mud, which hangs upon thy
ſoule; riſe from out of the mire, wherein
thou haſt wallowed. And ſee how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
thou wilt be to thy adverſarie,
who believ'd he had caſt thee down never
to riſe again, it will amaze him to ſee
thee again provoke him to the battaile,
ſurpriz'd with thy recovery, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
at ſuch an undaunted reſolution,
how fearfull will the coward the Devill
be to attempt again the enſnaring thee.
If other mens calamities be proper leſſons
for us; ſhall not all our owne inſtruct
us? I believe that I ſhall ſee this ſhortly
in thee, and that thou wilt appear in
the ſight of Heaven a perſon reſtor'd
to grace, a more excellent and clearer
ſoul then ever thou were, one that ſhall
give teſtimonies of ſuch perfection, and
integrity; that thou maiſt be ranckt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the beſt men, if not preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. Onely deſpair not, fall not
againe! This is my counſell; do thou
as my cuſtome is: When ever I hear any
thing from others may profit me: I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170057:69"/>
make no delay to embrace and follow
it, and if thou receiveſt with a good
purpoſe theſe my admonitions, thy
ſick and languiſhing ſoule
will need no other
Phyſick.</p>
