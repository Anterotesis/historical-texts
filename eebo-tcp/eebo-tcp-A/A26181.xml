            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF the preſent Controverſy in the City of <hi>London</hi> be unhappy, and ill-tim'd; the blame of continuing, if not of raiſing it, muſt fall upon that Side, which ſhall appear to have been in the wrong.</p>
            <p>But ſince ſuch a Conteſt is begun, in ſome Reſpects the preſent Time may be thought propitious, for bringing it to a fair Deciſion. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the leſs Danger in it, becauſe it happens chiefly among Men united in the ſame Cauſe and Common Intereſt; who have always ſtood up for the Rights of the City, and are likely to manage the Queſtion, who are principally entruſted with the Care of its Rights, without Animoſities; and quietly to ſubmit to Authority, or Conviction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Learning and Integrity of the <hi>preſent Judges,</hi> and the Independency of their Places, aſſure the right Side of Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it could be imagin'd, that they would be influenc'd by the Court: It is an happineſs that there is no colour to ſuſpect, that our preſent <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the Prejudice of either's Right.</p>
            <p>And as no Prince, who is not truly popular himſelf, can be pleas'd to have Power lodg'd in any great Body of his People; the <hi>Common Hall</hi> could not, in any Reign but this, ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, have expected to bring on their Cauſe without great Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>And certain it is, there never was ſo great a Body of Men, of more ſteady Loyalty to their Prince, than this <hi>Common Hall</hi> is to his <hi>preſent Majeſty</hi> King <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I cannot but hope, that this Controverſy may be ended, without recourſe to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or the laſt reſort to Parliament.</p>
            <p>For to me it ſeems, there wants nothing to the quieting the Controverſy, but the ſetting it in a true Light: Which I ſhall endeavour to do with that faithfulneſs and impartiality, which becomes a conſtant Servant to <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Old Engliſh Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt premiſe, that tho the Author of the pretended modeſt Eſſay, runs the Diſpute as high as if the <hi>Common-Council</hi> and <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> were like <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>; The ſole Point now in Queſtion is,</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Lord-Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Court of Aldermen,</hi> by themſelves,<note place="margin">The Queſtion,</note> or in conjunction with the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> as now compoſed or acting, have <hi>rightful Power</hi> to diſcharge any Perſon, whom the <hi>Citizens</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Common-Hall</hi> have choſen Sheriff; and to <hi>exempt</hi> him, or others, from the Service, for a Year, or Years to come?</p>
            <p>Bating what relates to the higher Controverſy, he uſes but three Topicks to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the <hi>defeating,</hi> or <hi>vacating</hi> the Election of the <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>

            </list>
            <p>Every one of which I ſhall ſhew to be fully againſt him: and that both ſuch By-Laws and Cuſtom, unleſs of another Nature than is or can be pretended, would be abſolutely void.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Reſolution of the Judges is no more in Subſtance than this;<note place="margin">Of the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Judges, <hi>40 &amp; 41 Eliz.</hi>
               </note> That tho the Choice of Officers in Cities and Towns incorporated by Charters, be granted to <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Commonalty,</hi> or the like; yet <hi>antient and uſual Elections,</hi> by a certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Number, are warrantable, by reaſon of <hi>By-Laws,</hi> made to avoid <hi>popular Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; by virtue of a Power of making <hi>By-Laws given by the Charters.</hi> And that tho ſuch <hi>By-Laws</hi> cannot be found, they ſhall be preſum'd: and that this was <hi>by common Aſſent, becauſe of ſuch eſpecial manner of antient and continual Election.</hi> And according to this Reſolution, the Elections are ſaid to have been in the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince the <hi>Common-Council</hi> do not pretend to chuſe the Sheriffs, otherwiſe than as part of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> which has long been in poſſeſſion of this Right; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Reſolution of the <hi>Judges</hi> is ſo far from proving the pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45191:3"/>
of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> to ſet aſide Elections made by the greater Body of the City; that it manifeſts the illegality of the Attempt: ſince, according to this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> is, to this Purpoſe at leaſt, not only the fulleſt, but the <hi>trueſt Repreſentative</hi> or the Body of Citizens;<note place="margin">Vid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. de jure belli &amp; pacis.</note> who, according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his Diſtinction, are the <hi>Common Subject</hi> of this Power, while their Repreſentatives aſſembled in <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> are the <hi>Proper Subject</hi> by which it is exerciſed.</p>
            <p>And if it were admitted, that an Authority to make this Power uſeleſs, or to weary them out of it, were by ſome <hi>By-Law</hi> given to the <hi>Common-Council</hi> as now compoſed; or that the Cuſtom has ſo long been on their Side, that ſuch a <hi>By-Law</hi> is now to be preſumed; yet it is very evident, that there is nothing to warrant it in that Reſolution. For beſides, that, as I have obſerved already, it only concerned Elections:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Caſe is only of ſuch Proviſions as have been made, or are preſumable to have been made, <hi>to avoid popular Confuſions:</hi> which the <hi>Common-Council</hi> may, if they pleaſe, urge, for the ſetting aſide the Uſage for Elections in <hi>Common-Hall:</hi> But then they muſt conſider, that an Arbitrary Court would be ſure to fight them with their own Weapon, and, with parity of Reaſon, to ſet them aſide. And I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to their calm Conſideration, whether the indefeazibleneſs of Elections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of thoſe who made them; or the defeating them at the Pleaſure of others, and from time to time requiring a new Choice, be the moſt likely to occaſion <hi>popular Confuſions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Caſe put is only of <hi>Corporations by Charter,</hi> and deriving their Power of making <hi>By-Laws</hi> from ſuch Charters; in moſt, if not all of which, that Power is by the Charters lodg'd in a ſelect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umber there appointed. When, as I ſhall ſhew, the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> were a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> with Power of making Laws for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the City; and had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity, by Preſcription, before they had any Charter: Which if they had, tho the Sheriffwick of <hi>Middleſex</hi> were annex'd to <hi>London</hi> by Charter; that would fall under the ſame Government, and be ſubject to an Authority independent on any Charter; eſpecially if ſuch Annexation has been <hi>before time of memory,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And further yet, if it will appear, that no Charter to the City of <hi>London</hi> about making <hi>By-Laws,</hi> appoints any ſelect Number for the exercice of this Power; it will if poſſible be more evident, that the Reſolution of the Judges has nothing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Authority claim'd by the preſent <hi>Common-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it muſt be remember'd, that the Reſolution ſays, <hi>Such eſpecial manner of antient and continual Election,</hi> could not begin <hi>without common Aſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore <hi>common Aſſent</hi> has plac'd the Election of Sheriffs in the <hi>Common-Hall</hi>; it will lie upon the other Side to ſhew at leaſt the Preſumption of <hi>common Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> to place the <hi>Diſcharge</hi> in the <hi>Common-Council.</hi> And they muſt not for this urge any Act of <hi>Common-Council</hi> as Authoritative in it ſelf.</p>

               <note place="margin">Of By-Laws, particularly that <hi>7 C. 1.</hi>
               </note>2. I do not find that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> pretends, that the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> for the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> by themſelves, or in conjunction with the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> to diſcharge a Perſon choſen Sheriff by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> is ſo antient, that a <hi>By-Law</hi> to warrant it, made by the <hi>Common-Council</hi> as now acting,<note place="margin">Vid.

But he inſiſts upon Poſitive <hi>By-Laws</hi> made in the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> for their excuſing any Perſons duly choſen, by admitting them to Fine for one Year. This he ſuppoſes to have been eſtabliſhed by ſeveral Acts of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> one of which he pretends to have tranſcribed.</p>
            <p>But certainly no Act ever began with [and] as his Tranſcript does: And it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that what he gives as the whole Act, 7 <hi>C.</hi> 1. is very lame and imperfect. Had he publiſh'd the beginning of it, the pretence of more Acts of <hi>Common-Council</hi> than that one, unleſs they be of very late and ſuſpected Date, muſt have vaniſh'd. For tho, as may appear by comparing it with former Acts, it makes in great meaſure the ſame Proviſions, and uſes almoſt the ſame words with ſome of them, only alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penalties, and Values of Eſtates requir'd for a Qualification, with ſome other neceſſary Circumſtances; yet it in expreſs Terms <hi>repeals all former Acts</hi> made upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of what he is pleas'd to communicate, is this; If any Freeman of the City, being duly choſen Sheriff, ſhall not perſonally appear before the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> at their next Court, unleſs he have ſuch reaſonable Excuce as the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>greater part of the Aldermen then preſent ſhall allow</hi>; and there enter into Bond to take the Office upon him in <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> on <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> Eve; or ſhall openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; he ſhall forfeit as is there provided; <hi>Unleſs he ſhall be duly diſcharged for want ☞or defect of Ability in Wealth</hi>; and ſhall nevertheleſs remain <hi>eligible yearly</hi> afterwards, <hi>as if he had never been choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45191:3"/>Upon thus much of the Order it is obſervable;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Excuce to be allowed by the <hi>Lord-Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> is not for not taking the Office upon him; but for not attending at the next Court-Day; and not entring into Bond before-hand, to oblige himſelf to take the Office upon him in <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is probable, that Men may have been out of Town, or detain'd by Sickneſs, or neceſſary Affairs, which hindred them from engaging at the next Court-Day to take the Office; and yet they might appear in <hi>Common-Hall</hi> time enough to enter upon it. And therefore the Court of <hi>Aldermen</hi> might be Judges of the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Excuce, for not engaging before-hand; or at leaſt not ſo ſoon as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſtrictneſs requires: and yet there would be no Conſequence from thence, That it is in their Power totally to excuſe from holding.</p>
            <p>Further yet it will appear, That this of entring into Bond, was an additional Proviſion made 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and repeated 7 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. beyond what was in any former Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Nor was there any Cuſtom in the City for entering into ſuch Bond. This therefore being a Creature of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> might be left to the Diſcretions of the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> without the leaſt Prejudice to the Right of the <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Excuce</hi> of which the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> are made Judges, is only ſuch as is <hi>reaſonable</hi>; ſo that their Diſcretion is a <hi>legal Diſcretion:</hi> And if the Excuce be for not holding the Office, it is evident that no Excuce for that is to be allowed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be want of ſufficient Eſtate; in which Caſe, only, the Party is diſchargable by the Words of that Order.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Paying a Penalty is not properly any Excuce.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is to be <hi>diſcharged duly</hi>; the Order does not mention by whom: But this, as it will appear, ought to be by the <hi>Common-Hall</hi>; either in expreſs Terms, or by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, in their proceeding to a new Choice.</p>
            <p>But for what Time the Diſcharge ſhall be, will, notwithſtanding that Order, be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely at the Diſcretion of the <hi>Common-Hall.</hi> Some would infer from the Words, [<hi>be ſhall be yearly eligible</hi>] that the Perſon who is excuſed by the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> on paying his Fine, ſhall <hi>not be eligible</hi> till another Year. Whereas,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be remembred, that the Excuce of which they are made the Judges, is not from holding; but tho he ſhould hold, he is ſubject to the Penalty, if he does not in due time oblige himſelf to hold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The [<hi>yearly Eligible</hi>] may be <hi>in</hi> every Year after that Order, when the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould happen to be incurred. Accordingly, the Order ſpeaks only of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Perſons to be <hi>choſen</hi>; and without ſuch an Interpretation as this of [year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly], could not be taken to extend to Perſons <hi>actually choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or elſe it may be <hi>for</hi> every Year following his Default: according to the uſual Entries, that ſuch a Man was choſen Sheriff <hi>for the Year enſuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, by the expreſs Words, the Party is <hi>Eligible, as if he had never been choſen:</hi> And therefore he muſt remain <hi>Eligible,</hi> as if he had never paid his Fine; which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Choice.</p>
            <p>This will be yet more evident, if we compare this with the Act of <hi>Common-Council,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. inf.</note> 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. repeated in Subſtance by that 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> with only neceſſary Alterations; and by this 7 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. For it will appear to have been the Intention of this, as well as of former Orders, as indeed it is of moſt Laws, to oblige Men to their Duty by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the Penalty: not to take the Penalty to excuſe from their Duty; much leſs thereby to exempt from Penalties, when the Offence ſhall be repeated.</p>
            <p>And it is obſervable, that the Order, 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. has not the word [Yearly],<note place="margin">Vid. inf.</note> which gives colour to a Diſpute; it declaring, That ſuch Perſon ſhall be <hi>Eligible,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his paying the Penalty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there had been any intention of <hi>exempting</hi> the Offender for a Year, upon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Penalty; it would certainly have been in the <hi>Negative,</hi> that he ſhould not be <hi>eligible</hi> till the next Year. Which, indeed, would have been no very wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and, as will appear, directly contrary to the Preamble, and declar'd Intention of that very Order.</p>
            <p>But for certain, whatever Power may have been entruſted with the <hi>Common-Council</hi>; they cannot, according to the known Rule of <hi>Law,</hi> ſet aſide the <hi>City's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law-Right</hi> of chuſing any Perſon capacitated for the Service, without a Clauſe in the Negative; that is to ſay, that they ſhall not chuſe a Perſon, diſcharg'd by the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> upon paying his Fine, <hi>till</hi> another Year.</p>
            <p>Tho, as it will appear, it ſignifies nothing to the Merits of the Cauſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of By-Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 7 C. 1.</note> what the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council</hi> have done, for drawing to themſelves Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Authority from a greater and higher <hi>Court</hi> in being, and full exercice of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and of which they make but a ſmall part; yet what is call'd <hi>Argumentum
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45191:4"/>
ad Hominem,</hi> is never to be neglected. For to prove, that thoſe very Arguments in which Men place their Strength, make directly againſt them, is to diſarm, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them.</p>
            <p>To this end it may be of Service to ſhew, what Proviſions had formerly been made in this Matter: and what has been omitted by the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> out of the Order 7 <hi>C.</hi> 1. agreeing with thoſe former Proviſions.</p>

            <p>It will further appear, that whatever <hi>Councils</hi> may, before the time of that old Act, have been ſummon'd to particular Purpoſes; no <hi>Common-Council</hi> ſeparate from them that uſed to aſſemble in the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> was ever ſettled as a ſtanding <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> of any conſiderable Authority, before that time.</p>

            <p>That Act repeals all former Acts of <hi>Common-Council:</hi>

            <p>Nor does the Act, 7 <hi>C.</hi> 1. repeal former Acts of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> as too ſeverely keeping Men to their Duty: but, [for that the ſame have not <q>taken ſo good Effect as might be wiſhed; by reaſon that the Penalties and Forfeitures therein contained, <hi>have been over-mil'd:</hi> and thereby <hi>his Majeſty</hi>'s Services have been in danger of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; and the good Citizens of this City, by reaſon of <hi>the often refuſals</hi> of the ſaid Office of Shrievalty, have been <hi>much troubled and diſquieted.</hi>
               </q> 
            </p>
            <p>The better to ſecure good <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> it appoints the Day of Election to be the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June.</hi> 
               <q>And that no Freeman of the ſaid City, ſo <hi>to be choſen or elected</hi> as aforeſaid, ſhall be <hi>exempted</hi> from the execution of the ſaid Office of Shrievalty, by ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or excuce of <hi>defect or inſufficiency of Wealth</hi>; [except] he will voluntarily take his Corporal Oath, before the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and greater part of the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> in open Court of <hi>Lord-Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> for the Time being; that he then is not of the Value of Ten thouſand Pounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now conſidering how the former Proviſions were, this is as much as if it ſaid,</p>
            <p>Whereas according to former <hi>By-Laws,</hi> no ſufficient <hi>Perſon</hi> is to be diſcharged or <hi>exempted</hi> from holding Sheriff; and what was Sufficiency then, is not ſo now; but the Penalties upon <hi>ſufficient Perſons</hi> were <hi>over-mil'd:</hi> therefore every <hi>ſufficient Perſon</hi> choſen ſhall ſerve, upoin pain of forfeiting the ſum of 600 Marks, if an Alderman, and 400 <hi>l.</hi> if a Commoner: unleſs he can ſwear, as is hereby required.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, according to the plain ſcope and meaning of this Order, and which, indeed, is expreſſed in that very Part which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> uſes, no Man is to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,</hi> or <hi>exempted,</hi> but for <hi>inſufficiency</hi> in Eſtate.</p>
            <p>But however that Order were; it is evident, that the Act of <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is far from being antiquated or repealed: and is of force as to the Obligation, which the Body of the City laid upon every individual Perſon of the City, and upon all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Courts or Councils: and if the Penalty be duly taken away, that will not weaken the Sanction of ſuch a declaratory Law.</p>
            <p>And ſurely no Man can ſay, that becauſe of this Alteration, the <hi>exempting</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging</hi> a <hi>ſufficient Perſon</hi> from being <hi>Sheriff,</hi> will not be to the Prejudice of leſs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Perſons, who ſhall be oblig'd to ſerve before their turn: or that it will not tend to the <hi>Deſolation</hi> of the City, and to the Hazard of its Franchiſes.</p>
            <p>As I take it, all the Citizens are precluded by this Act from ſaying otherwiſe, than themſelves did ſo long ſince by their Predeceſſors; and yet ſpeak in this their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In that Common Council the Ordinance above-mentioned 24 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was read, and agreed to be put in execution. <hi>Hynde</hi> not yet appearing; it was ſhewn to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by the Common Clerk, in the <hi>Recorder's</hi> Abſence, that inaſmuch as the City was deſtitute of a Sheriff; and alſo in conſideration, that the Day of preſenting the <hi>Sheriff</hi> at the Exchequer drew near, they ſhould immediately proceed to a new Election.</p>

            <p>The Commons being again commanded by the <hi>Mayor</hi> to proceed to a new Election; <q>the <hi>Mayor and Aldermen returned to the great Chamber</hi>; in whoſe Abſence the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons choſe Mr. <hi>William Lok</hi>:<note place="margin">

            <p>At this time it is evident, beyond Contradiction, that though the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> gave the Rule, as Chief in the Common-Hall; and he, with the Common-Council in the Council-Chamber, ſet the Penalty upon Abſenters; the Diſcharge of the Perſons choſen was in the Common-Hall, and the Act of the Common Hall.</p>

                  <hi>Whereupon it was ordered, decreed and determined, by the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, that the Perſons there named ſhould repair to the King in the Name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens,</hi> in their moſt humble manner to beſeech him, that the Liberties, Cuſtoms and Franchiſes of the City, by his most noble Progenitors granted to the ſame, and by his Highneſs ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, may ſtand, and be in their Strength and Virtue, concerning the ſaid <hi>Ralph Rowlet;</hi> that he may take upon him the ſaid room of Sheriffwick, according to the Effect of the ſame.</q>

            <p>Where they do not pretend actually to diſcharge him, but agree that he ſhall be diſcharged: Which ſhews, that the Diſcharge was to be in the Place where another was to be choſen: And they only adviſed this, or recommended it, to the <hi>Common-Hall.</hi> That this was only by way of Advice appears farther; not only by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared End for which they were ſummon'd; but by what follows the former part of the <hi>Journal</hi>; which, after mentioning what was done in <hi>Common-Council,</hi> has theſe words; <q>
                  <hi>And</hi> then immediately, <hi>the ſaid Letter was</hi> openly read in the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> aforeſaid, [to all the Commons in their Liveries, then and there aſſembled.] <hi>And</hi> in like manner were agreed, in manner and form as the ſaid Common-Council had agreed and granted. <hi>And</hi> thereupon, <hi>the ſaid</hi> Mayor, Aldermen, <hi>and</hi> Commons, by one Aſſent, and Conſent, proceeded to the Election of a new Sheriff, in the ſtead and place of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Rowlet.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>King</hi> did not think it in the Power of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> or any other Body of Men, without the <hi>Commons,</hi> to diſcharge the Perſon choſen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ſuppos'd the Choice of another Perſon, to amount to the Diſcharge of the firſt.</p>

               </note> In which, as I am informed, the Aſſerters of the Authority of the <hi>Common-Council</hi> much triumph: And yet it will prove to have been the Effect of a ſtrong Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; or of not attending to thoſe governing Paſſages and Expreſſions, which will fully explain what may ſeem doubtful in this, or other Entries of the like kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richmond</hi> having been choſen by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and his Election certified to the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> in the <hi>utter Chamber of</hi> Guild-Hall; the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> are there ſaid <hi>lovingly</hi> to have <hi>confirmed and allowed</hi> the ſame.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Lord-Mayor,</hi> and his <hi>Brethren the Aldermen, returning [into the Hall</hi>] <q>
                  <hi>Richmond</hi> came up unto the <hi>Lord-Mayor,</hi> and his Brethren the <hi>Aldermen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note,</hi> This was upon the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings in <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi>
                  </note> and [then] and [there] made right humble and hearty Suit, Petition, and Requeſt, both [unto them] and [<hi>unto the whole Commons there preſent</hi>]</q> That, foraſmuch as he had not ſufficient Eſtate, <q>It might pleaſe [them all] to be ſo good <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maiſters</hi> unto him, and to diſcharge him thereof again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding his Allegations and Reaſons for his <hi>Excuſe</hi> and <hi>Diſcharge,</hi> becauſe <q>it ſeemed [unto them] that he was a Man very meet and hable for the ſame, his ſaid <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Requeſt</hi> would not, nor <hi>was not granted unto him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He proffer'd his Oath, that he was not worth 1000 Marks: But the <hi>Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,</hi> and <hi>Council of the City</hi> anſwer'd, That ſuch Oath was not ſufficient without Six Vouchers, according to the late <hi>Act of Common-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45191:6"/>However, he ſwore to his Inſufficiency, before the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and [<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>;] <q>Whereupon, foraſmuch as his own Othe did not diſcharge him, according to the Laws and Uſages of the ſaid City, of and from the ſaid Office; but that he ſtood ſtill, and remained chargeable to the ſame, and expreſly refuſed, and denied there openly to take it upon him, and to meddle withal; he was <hi>ſent</hi> to Ward for his <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> and <hi>Obſtinacy, by the whole Court</hi> [and <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi>] there aſſembled.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this, he was ſeveral times brought in Cuſtody before the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,</hi> and as often remanded; till at laſt he agreed to pay 200 <hi>l.</hi> to the uſe of the City, for <hi>his Diſcharge</hi>; and gave Bond for the Money.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he was diſcharged from his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Then <q>the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council,</hi> and [other <hi>the Commoners aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for the <hi>Diſcharging</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Richmond</hi>] of and from the ſaid Office, and for the <hi>Election</hi> of another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereupon, great part of the Premiſes, and the Circumſtances of the ſame, by Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> firſt to the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> and afterwards [to the <hi>Commons</hi> aforeſaid] [then] and [there] being <hi>ſubſtantially, diſcreetly,</hi> and <hi>prudently,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and declared [at length] the ſame Mr. <hi>Richmond</hi> was [then] and [there] by the ſaid <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and [<hi>Common-Counſail there holden</hi>] clearly <hi>diſcharged</hi> for that time only, of and from the ſaid Office, <hi>for his ſaid Fine.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here they will take no notice of what was tranſacted in the firſt <hi>Common-Hall</hi>; where <hi>Richmond</hi> petition'd [the whole <hi>Commons</hi>] as well as the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> for a Diſcharge, which he could not then obtain; and further, the <hi>Commons</hi> agreed, That he ſhould be committed to Priſon: Wherein they, with the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> acted as a Court of Juſtice, and <hi>Common-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Council of the City, which urg'd an Act of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> were the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> it ſelf; then it is evident, that they acted there but as of Counſel or Advice to the <hi>Common-Hall</hi>; in which that Entry places the Authority of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they were the Cities Counſel <hi>at Law</hi> who mention'd this; then the Common-Council had no ſhare in any part of that Tranſaction, otherwiſe than as part of the Common-Council in Common-Hall aſſembled, who conſented to the committing <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still ſome will hang upon that part of the Entry concerning the Second Common-Hall, where <hi>Richmond</hi> is ſaid to be diſcharged by the ſaid Common-Counſail <hi>there holden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When it manifeſtly was the very ſame Body of Men, to whom he petitioned for a <hi>Diſcharge,</hi> which he could not then obtain; and by whoſe Conſent he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon for his Diſobedience and Obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>To give colour to their Senſe, they muſt have it, that tho' <hi>Richmond</hi> ſued to the Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council, and Common; who would not then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him; and tho', after he had fined all met to <hi>diſcharge</hi> him, and chuſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet the Commons met only to chuſe another; and the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council, to diſcharge him.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Diſcharge is plainly ſhewn to have been in Common-Hall, where the Common-Council cannot pretend to act as a Council, with Authority; and that [at length] after the Commons, as well as the Common-Council, had been applied to by the <hi>Recorder</hi>; yet they muſt fanſie, that the Common-Council with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew out of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and went up to the <hi>Council-Chamber,</hi> to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Order for his <hi>Diſcharge.</hi> Of which there is not the leaſt mention or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in relation to that Second <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as this is meer Imagination, not only without ground, but directly contrary to the careful and ſolemn entry of the Proceedings, from the beginning to the end; it is evident, That the Common-Council was but part of the Common-Counſail, there holden, conſiſting of Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Infra.</hi>
               </note>Farther yet, if it ſhould appear by other Evidences, as I make no doubt but it will, That the Commons of the City, with their Officers, and Council, aſſembled in their <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> or other <hi>Folk-mote,</hi> in their own Perſons, or by Repreſentation; have, from long before the <hi>reputed Conqueſt</hi> to this Day, been and continued the Common-Council of the City; and that the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> wherein <hi>Richmond</hi> was diſcharged from ſerving Sheriff, was a true Repreſentative of all the Commons; it will be certain that all together were properly called a <hi>Common-Counſail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> as now compos'd, be the ſame with that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd <hi>Richmond</hi>; it will alſo follow, That the Right of <hi>Diſcharging</hi> belongs to this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45191:6"/>
               <hi>Common-Hall:</hi> And that it is the true Common-Counſail, or rather Council, of the City.</p>
            <p>Take all the Precedents together, as they ſtrengthen and give Light to one another; and, I think, there can be no queſtion, but they will ſo explain and govern following Orders of Common-Council, that not one of them ſhall be taken as a Precedent to the Contrary: Unleſs it can be ſhewn, that the Perſon diſcharged by the Common-council, has been look'd upon in Law as duly diſcharged; before the Commons have allowed of the <hi>Diſcharge,</hi> by proceeding to a new Choice; and even tho' they abſolutely refus'd to chuſe again.</p>
            <p>However, leſt it ſhould be thought,<note place="margin">Of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in the Common-Hall, <hi>1 Eliz.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That in the Firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> was a Court which kept the <hi>Journals</hi> of its Proceedings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Matter of which the Mayor and Aldermen had taken Cognizance, was not within any <hi>By-Law:</hi> So that they could not pretend to any Authority to <hi>diſcharge.</hi> Nor is it ſaid that the Party was <hi>diſcharged,</hi> tho' they were ſatisfied that he was not able to hold. Wherefore this Matter repreſented to the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> could be no more than as the Opinion, and Advice, of the Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Accordingly, the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> takes the Matter into <hi>conſideration:</hi> For they, being aſſembled for the Election of another, did elect, in <hi>conſideration</hi> of the Matter repreſented to them in <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To put this Matter beyond Controverſie, it is obſervable, That no Common-Council was held upon this Occaſion; and there is no colour of Authority, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Uſage pretended, for the Mayor and Aldermen to <hi>diſcharge</hi> without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Common-Council. Therefore Mr. <hi>Jobſon</hi> muſt have been <hi>diſcharged</hi> by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> or otherwiſe he continued Sheriff; which, 'tis certain he did not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No other <hi>diſcharge</hi> of the Party is mentioned, or implied, than the <hi>Common-Hall's</hi> proceeding to a new Choice.</p>
            <p>And if in any following Inſtances they have proceeded to new Elections, upon ſuch Inducements as they had at the reſpective times, whether upon taking Fines, or otherwiſe, the Entries of Clerks can be no Prejudice to their Right ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt upon many Entries in the <hi>Common-Hall Journals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to what is ſaid in <hi>Slade</hi>'s <note n="*" place="margin">4. Rep. f. 93.</note> Caſe, The Returns of Sheriffs, or Entries of Clerks, without <hi>challenge of the Party,</hi> or <hi>conſideration of the Court,</hi> being contrary to <hi>common Law,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are not allowable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45191:7"/>And therefore, whatever may have been entred in the Books of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> it ſhall not be ſuppos'd that the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> ever admitted any Man to have been diſcharg'd, till they had actually conſented to it; or did it virtually, in chuſing another in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>And the ſame may be applied to <hi>Exemptions,</hi> of which I will admit there are ſome Inſtances to be found in the Books of the <hi>Common-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">That if the By-Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom were on the Side of the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council: Such By-Laws and Cuſtom would be void in Law.</note>4<hi>th.</hi> That no Man was ever duly <hi>diſcharged</hi> or <hi>exempted,</hi> till there was the Conſent of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> may ſufficiently appear by what I have ſhewn of the <hi>By-Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in this Matter.</p>
            <p>And yet if both favour'd the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> I ſhall make it evident, that they would be void in Law.</p>

            <p n="2">2. That it is contrary to their Charters, confirm'd by Parliaments.</p>

            <p>Since therefore the County of <hi>London</hi> is the <hi>City's Farm,</hi> and of ſuch a Nature,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.

            <p>But to evince that the <hi>diſcharging</hi> or <hi>amoving</hi> is <hi>incident</hi> to the Right of the Election, I muſt obſerve, that in other Counties, which are not of Fee, though the Choice of Sheriffs was at common Law in the <hi>Freeholders</hi> of the Counties, yet the Sheriffs had their Commiſſions and Authority from the King. And as they have their ſeveral <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lywicks</hi> under them, they were and are the <hi>King's Bailiffs</hi> of the whole County; which in many Records is ſtiled their <note n="†" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Selden</hi>'s <hi>Tit. of Honour,</hi> f. 587. 15 Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis omnes milites Ballivae tuae qui ſum moniti fuerunt ad nos, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>And though ordinarily the King conſtitutes them his Bailiffs for a Year, they at Common Law were <hi>amoveable</hi> at his Pleaſure. But as the County of <hi>London</hi> is the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's <hi>Farm,</hi> it is the <hi>Sheriff's Bailywick</hi> under the City, whoſe Election and Confirmation conſtitutes him Sheriff, without any Commiſſion from the King.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the City is anſwerable to the King, if the Sheriff be not able, (though not for his Crimes, which ſeveral Charters provide againſt) the Sheriffs uſed antiently to find <note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. C. f. 111. n. 32. E. 1.</note> Sureties to indempnify the City.</p>
            <p>The Sheriffs therefore being but Bailiffs to the <hi>Electors,</hi> in the Nature of the thing, are <hi>amoveable</hi> or <hi>diſchargeable</hi> by them; and conſequently by them only: unleſs we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two ſupreme Powers within the City; which, according to <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Infra.</note>And, if it will appear, that theſe were the Livery-men; here is a Judgment of that time, That, according to the <hi>Charters</hi> confirm'd by Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> and <hi>amoving,</hi> or <hi>diſcharging</hi> of Sheriffs, belongs to the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to none beſides.</p>
            <p>If the above-mentioned <hi>Charters</hi> and Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in affirmance, as I have ſhewn, of the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> are not enough to preſerve the Cities Right of <hi>amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> or <hi>diſcharging</hi> Sheriffs, as well as chuſing them; and if they may not chuſe Perſons <hi>exempted</hi> by Order of a Common-Council, as well as others; it is in vain to talk of ſuch a thing as Legal Rights: For none can be more firmly and plainly eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That the City has this, but not the Citizens which meet in <hi>Common-Hall:</hi> It may as well be ſaid, That they are not the <hi>Electors</hi> in any Caſe; for whoever are, by Law, the <hi>Electors,</hi> have Right to diſallow <hi>Exemptions</hi> by others, even by the King himſelf, as in <hi>Rowlet</hi>'s Caſe; and to <hi>amove,</hi> or <hi>diſcharge,</hi> in as full a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they have the <hi>chuſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther yet, Whatever is inconſiſtent with an undoubted Right, is abſolutely void; but for the <hi>Common-Council</hi> to diſcharge a Perſon whom the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> and they themſelves as Part did chuſe by an undoubted Right, is inconſiſtent, as it makes the Right uſeleſs; and therefore ſuch a Diſcharge muſt be void. And the ſame will hold againſt Exemptions; and indeed, if others may exempt, they cannot chuſe whom they will. In either Caſe they are defeated of what the <hi>Common-Law</hi> and <hi>Charters,</hi> confirmed in Parliament, veſted in 'em.</p>

            <p>To this Matter I may well apply what that great Man, the late Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> ſays of the Suppoſition, That our Anceſtors had abſolutely ſubmitted to the Will of a <hi>Conqueror.</hi>

               </q>

            <p>This is ſo plain, that it needs no Comment, only that it muſt not be objected, that this ſpeaks only of <hi>Elections,</hi> not the <hi>diſcharging</hi> of Perſons choſen, or any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
            <p>For if even in the Caſe of <hi>Elections,</hi> where there is a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to reſtrain the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Electors, to avoid Confuſion</hi>; this Reſtraint will not bind without a <hi>general Aſſent</hi>; much leſs can it be pretended, that where Elections can be, and are, duly made, it ſhall be in the Power of others to defeat or vacate the Election; and put
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45191:9"/>
the Electors in danger of wanting ſufficient Men to ſerve, or of Confuſion by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons often repeated: when the Power of doing this was never parted with in expreſs Terms, or ſo much as by Implication.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But that the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> have never parted with this; or if they had, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to it, may very eaſily appear, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Right of <hi>chuſing</hi> what qualified Perſons they pleaſe, or <hi>amoving</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging</hi> 'em at pleaſure, is not only veſted in 'em by <hi>common</hi> Law, confirmed by Charters, and Acts of Parliament; but has been exerciſed by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> not only before the ſuppoſed Settlement of the preſent <hi>Common-Council,</hi> and the <hi>Livery Common-Hall,</hi> but after; and that in Inſtances very remarkable, and fully expreſſive of their Authority.</p>
            <p>And if there had been any Diſcontinuance, their adhering to their Choice of Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Lethieulier,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Houblon,</hi> and obliging them to hold, after they had fined; according to a known Term in Law, would work a <hi>Remitter,</hi> by which they would be reſtor'd to their beſt Right, which is ſo favour'd in Law,<note place="margin">Vid. 1<hi>ſt</hi> Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 347. Lit. Sect. 695.</note> that if one who has been diſſeis'd of Land, enter under a Leaſe from the Diſſeiſor; he ſhall be adjudg'd to be in Poſſeſſion upon his former Right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That whereas the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will have a ſuppoſed Cuſtom for the <hi>Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> to <hi>diſcharge,</hi> or <hi>exempt,</hi> to have been confirmed by the late Act, reſtoring the City Charter; it reſtores to the <hi>Mayor, Commonalty,</hi>

            <p>Wherefore the <hi>lawful Cuſtom</hi> in this Matter, uſed by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> from the beginning, till within the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of which they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd at the making the Statute, 2 <hi>W.</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> is indiſputably reſtored and confirmed by that Statute.</p>
            <p>And if all this cannot fix a Right in the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> I muſt needs think the Rights of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> very precarious.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the higher Controverſy; where the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſuppoſes,<note place="margin">The higher Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy rais'd by the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>P. 1, 2, 3.</hi>
               </note> that if there has been no former <hi>By-Law</hi> or Practice, directly in this Point; yet the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> may exerciſe ſuch a Power, by a Right inherent in them, as the <hi>City's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators,</hi> who were not only prior in time to the <hi>Livery Common-Hall,</hi> but gave being to 'em in the Time of <hi>E.</hi> 4. and can controul their Acts.</p>
            <p>Not here to inſiſt upon the plain Conſequence of theſe Aſſertions, that if what the <hi>Vindicator</hi> holds be true, the <hi>Common-Council</hi> may not only place Elections of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs in themſelves, but of all other Officers, and even of <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council Men</hi>; and make themſelves a Body of perpetual Continuance, ſupplying Vacancies by the Choice of the Survivers; and ſo by one ſingle Act of a <hi>Common-Council</hi> overthrow all the Rights of the City; to leave this Reflection to be improv'd by others.</p>
            <p>I ſhall prove, that the preſent <hi>Common-Hall</hi> is by Law chiefly entruſted with exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Powers given by <hi>Common Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the Authority of the Common-Hall.</note> and Charters confirmed by divers Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the Body of <hi>Freemen:</hi> Where I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Rights</hi> and Liberties of the City reſted in the whole Body of the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> and the whole Body of them have regularly voted in making Laws, for the Benefit and Government of the City, before they had any Charters, and ſince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That whoever are legally poſſeſs'd of the publick <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> are intituled to all the Authority which the whole Body ever had: eſpecially in thoſe Matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the preſent Poſſeſſors exerciſe Authority: and that the <hi>Livery-men</hi> have this Right.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That a Repreſentation of the <hi>Commons,</hi> by the <hi>Myſteries,</hi> was ſettled in the Council-Chamber, with Authority to make By-Laws, before any <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the preſent Form had ſuch Authority. And, however, that the Authority of that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> was ſoon taken away by Act of <hi>Common-Hall</hi>; and lodg'd for ſome time in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation by the <hi>Mysteries.</hi>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45191:10"/>5. That there is no colour to believe, that the Common-Hall, as now compos'd, received its Being or Authority from ſuch <hi>Common-Council</hi> as now acts: or from any thing but the general Conſent of the <hi>Freemen,</hi> expreſs'd in ſome Act of <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> before the Time of <hi>E.</hi> 4. or imply'd in the long ſubmiſſion of the reſt of the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> before that Time, or ſince.</p>

Upon this the <hi>Aldermen</hi> and their Party complain to the King, that they were over-run by the Commonalty. The People follow'd them with great Noiſe, to the Diſturbance of the King, who lay upon his Death-bed; and cried, that they were the Commons, and to them belong'd the Election of a <hi>Mayor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The others ſaid, they were the <hi>Head,</hi> and the People but the Members: the <hi>King's Council</hi> put them off till next Day, and bid <hi>Hervey</hi> not to come to Court with more than ten in his Company: However he ſummoned all the <hi>Citizens,</hi> except thoſe who adhered to the <hi>Aldermen:</hi> And next Day a vaſt Number of Horſe and Foot came

to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Council</hi> finding they could not agree, threatned to amove <hi>Hervey,</hi> and put a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> over them. To avoid which they agreed, that five ſhould be choſen of each ſide to ſettle who ſhould be <hi>Mayor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, this being in Diminution of the Right of the Commons, took no effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H.</hi> 3. dying, the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Gloceſter,</hi> and others of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> came into the City, where they cauſed <hi>E.</hi> 1. to be proclaimed King; and then went into <hi>Guildhall,</hi> where a <hi>Common Hall</hi> was then aſſembled; and enquiring about the Buſineſs of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Aldermen</hi> told them, the Matter was left to Arbitration.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> not valuing this, bids them hold a <hi>Folkmote</hi> the next Day at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs; and he ſhould be the <hi>Mayor</hi> to whoſe Election the major Part of the City ſhould aſſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>great Men</hi> going into the Church with the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> perſwaded them to yield: upon which <hi>Hervey</hi> was declared <hi>Mayor before all the People.</hi> And thus were they in full Poſſeſſion of their Right, 1 <hi>E.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>That this People who had the Right to carry Elections and other Matters in <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> or their <hi>Folkmote</hi> in the open Air, were the <hi>Freemen,</hi> appears by the Words of ſome of their Charters declaratory of their antient Right. Many of which are granted to the Citizens, which the Charter paſs'd in Parliament 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. explains, of <hi>Freemen</hi> of the City; where it provides, that they ſhall not be impleaded or troubled at the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or elſewhere, by Bill, except it be by thoſe things which touch the King and his Heirs. And how careful the City has been to keep Foreigners from partaking in the Privileges of <hi>Freemen,</hi> appears from the Act of <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> return'd under the <hi>Common Seal</hi> into Parliament, <note n="*" place="margin">Rot.

            <p>As therefore the <hi>Gild</hi> was that Company, or the <hi>Hall</hi> where the Men of that Myſtery met; the Common <hi>Guildhall</hi> was where all the Myſteries or Companies met.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Huſtings</hi> I find to be the Court of theſe <hi>honest Men</hi>; there they joined with the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> in the Grants of City-Land; were Judges at Trials, and Parties in the making By-Laws.

            <p>Theſe Repreſentatives of the Myſteries, according to what I have before obſerved of the legal Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> are to be ſuppoſed to have been the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> and none others: but becauſe the Partiality of the Maſters and Wardens might occaſion the not ſummoning ſome of the Livery-men; therefore there is Liberty left for them who had Right, to come, though not ſummoned.</p>
            <p>That they and none others had this Right, will further appear when I come to prove, that no Act can be found, from whence their Right, excluſive of others, is or could be derived, or ſo much as occaſioned.</p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But upon this it is obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though according to the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> the <hi>Wardmote</hi> is of the Nature of an Hundred Court; that is, in relation to the Diſtricts or Diviſions of the City, and chiefly as to the Returns of Juries; but in Relation to the preſent Debate,<note place="margin">This, according to the Reference which I have to that time, is <hi>Lib.

               </note> it is more fully of the Nature of a <hi>Court Leet,</hi> where all <hi>Reſiants</hi> are obliged to attend, and upon the Account of Reſiancy are to bear Offices; and contribute in ſeveral things together with the Citizens, who in this Reſpect are as the <hi>Barons</hi> or Free-Tenents of a <hi>Mannor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore this Order does not reſtrain Foreigners from being <hi>Electors,</hi> or elected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is not ſaid to be appointed for the Common-Council of the City; but in truth the Common-Hall, as they were before, then continued the only Common-Council.</p>
            <p>Nor, taking the Original Entry of that Order to import more than [Affairs], does the treating of [the Affairs] concerning the Commonalty, in this Place imply more than ſuch Affairs as concern them, according to their Diviſions by <hi>Wards,</hi> in the Choice of Conſtables, or the like; or the aſſeſſing of Aids and Tallages: for which Purpoſe I find certain Numbers in every <hi>Ward,</hi> appointed very antiently, before there is the leaſt Pretence of the Settlement of any other Common-Council beſides the Common-Hall.</p>
            <p>But it is far from appearing, that the Men of the <hi>Wards</hi> appointed to treat of Affairs, 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3. were to treat of ſuch as concerned the Commonalty, as divided or acting by <hi>Myſteries:</hi> Or, however, if the treating of Affairs extends to all the Affairs of the City; it can here imply no more than treating of them by way of Advice, to that ſupreme Power in the City which made them what they were, and diveſted it ſelf of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45191:12"/>
no Authority: nor indeed could any form of Words have paſſed away the Authority of that, much leſs of ſucceeding <hi>Common-Halls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is certain, that antiently whatever Power the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> placed elſewhere, they never thought it abridg'd their own Power: of which I ſhall give a conſiderable Inſtance.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Proviſion agrees with what was 8 <hi>E.</hi> 2. affirm'd to have been the Cuſtom then: ſo that this was but in Affirmance of the Cuſtom.</p>

            <p n="3">3. They ſuppos'd Themſelves, and all Common-Councils for the future, according to the Proviſion then made, to have no farther Power, than to prepare Matters for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall, and propound them for their <hi>Fiat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They do not propound the Conſtitution of that <hi>Common-Council</hi> as an abſolute Form; but that it may continue as long as it <hi>proves convenient,</hi> and that it may be try'd for a time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therefore the Eſtabliſhment, according to the very Words, as well as the Nature of the thing, is of no farther force than as a probationary Order; to be obſerved only till the Common-Hall ſhould think fit to ſet it aſide.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As they who propound this Ordinance, in relation to that Body of which they were part, were Inferiours, and therefore <hi>Petitioners,</hi> to the Body aſſembled in <hi>Common-Hall</hi>; they ſet a good Example to all future <hi>Common-Councils.</hi>

               <note place="margin">5 <hi>Rep. f.</hi> 63.</note> in an Action brought by him for a Penalty raiſed by a <hi>By-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All ſuch Ordinances, Conſtitutions, or <hi>By-Laws,</hi> are allowed by the Law, as are made for the true and due Execution of the Laws or Statutes of the Realm; or for the <hi>good Government</hi> and Order of the Body-corporate: And all others which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or repugnant to the Laws or Statutes of the Realm, are void and of no effect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To apply this to the Caſe in Queſtion; for the <hi>Common-Council</hi> to vacate an Election made in <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> or to <hi>exempt</hi> any Perſon from being choſen, is not <hi>for the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order of the Body-corporate</hi>; and beſides, is directly <hi>contrary or repugnant</hi> to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, which have fixed the Election of any ſufficient Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in the <hi>Livery Common-Hall</hi>; and have provided it with Authority to oblige them to hold: And therefore any <hi>By-Law</hi> made in the <hi>Common-Council</hi> contrary to this Right, is void.</p>
            <p>Nay, and thus they themſelves have judg'd but lately in the like Caſe.</p>
            <p>In the Mayoralty or Sir <hi>John Fleet,</hi> he acquainted the Common-Council,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1693.</note> that 40 or 50 foreign Merchants would pay 400 <hi>l.</hi> a-piece to the uſe of the Orphans, if they might be admitted to the Freedom of the City, and have an Act of Common-Council to <hi>exempt</hi> 'em from bearing chargeable Offices.</p>
            <p>After ſeveral long Debates, this Project, though of apparent Advantage to the City, was laid aſide; the Common-Council declaring it was not in their Power, to reſtrain the Right of the Common-Hall to chuſe any <hi>ſufficient Citizen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Opinion of the Learned Judg <hi>Bracton,</hi> is very applicable to this Matter; where ſpeaking of the Engliſh Laws, he ſays;</p>
            <p>
               <q>Which ſince they were approved by the <hi>Conſent</hi> of thoſe who uſe them,<note place="margin">Bracton, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.

But they may be changed for the better; becauſe that is not deſtroyed which is made better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With ſuch a Limitation we may allow the Common-Council to act for the Eaſe of the Common Hall, in relation to Times, Places, and other Circumſtances; for the better Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Laws and Cuſtoms of the City.</p>
            <p>But that the Power of making <hi>By-Laws,</hi> exerciſed by the Common-Council, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable by the Common-Hall, will, beſides what I have already obſerved,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>By Inſpect.</hi> Rot.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Moreover, we have granted, that if any Cuſtoms in the City of <hi>London, [newly ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>] where a Remedy was not before ordain'd [<hi>want Amendment</hi>] the ſaid <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and their Heirs and Succeſſors [<hi>with the Aſſent of the Commonalty</hi> of the ſame City] remedy convenient, conſonant to good Faith and Manners, for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility</hi> of the Citizens of the ſaid City, and other our Liege People flocking to the ſame, may apply and <hi>ordain,</hi> as often, and when it ſhall ſeem expedient to 'em. <hi>Provided</hi>☜ nevertheleſs, That ſuch kind of Ordinance be of Utility to us, and our People, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to good Faith, and Reaſon as aboveſaid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>According to this Charter,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Power of making <hi>By-Laws</hi> relates to Amendments for the <hi>common</hi> Utility of the Citizens.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe Amendments cannot ſap, or weaken any antient Conſtitution or Cuſtom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are to be made with the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the Commonalty of the City.</p>
            <p>Neither of which can be pretended in the Matter in queſtion: And ſince,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>5</hi> Rep. ſup.</note> as is ſaid in the Chamberlain's Caſe, <q>Corporations cannot make Ordinances or Conſtitutions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cuſtom or the King's Charter, unleſs for things which concern the Publick Good, as Reparations of Churches, or High-ways, and the like;</q> but the Power now claimed, is neither of that Kind, nor is there Legal Cuſtom or Conſent or Charter for it: I need raiſe no Conſequence upon it.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Point; if this Common-Hall legally ſucceeds the Common-Hall which appointed this Committee; and the Committee may be ſet aſide at the Pleaſure of the Common-Hall; if ſince the raiſing this Committee, and that of late days, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45191:14"/>
               <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> have acted together as one Court: If farther, as in the Caſe of <hi>Rowlet,</hi> before-mentioned; they have acted with a Superior Authority in thoſe very things, wherein the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> have exerciſed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by themſelves; if moſt of theſe Premiſes hold, eſpecially if all do; there can be no Queſtion but <hi>By-Laws,</hi> and other Acts of the Common-Council, are controlable by the Common-Hall: and then it would be very ſtrange to imagine that it ſhould be in the Power of the Common-Council to take away, or abridg, any Right of its Superior, from whence it came, and in which it is contain'd.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſo much queſtion the Judgment or Memory of my Readers, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Proofs of every one of theſe Premiſes.</p>
            <p>But I would deſire 'em to remember the Inſtances of <hi>Disfranchiſements</hi> by <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> before any ſtanding Rule for 'em. This Power, I muſt confeſs, the <hi>Common-Council</hi> have pretended to; and as if they not only had it, but had it without delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have fanſied they could delegate it to others.</p>

               <note place="margin">Bagg<hi>'s Caſe,</hi> 11. <hi>Rep. f.</hi> 99.</note>But as it appears by the Reſolution in <hi>Baggs</hi>'s Caſe, the above-mention'd Act of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> is void in <hi>Law</hi>; no ſuch Power having been derived to them by the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words</hi> of any <hi>Charter,</hi> or <hi>Preſcription.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>I ſhall add but one Precedent, of many, where the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> acted together as one <hi>Court,</hi> and true <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the City; and that ſince the time that the preſent <hi>Common-Council,</hi> and <hi>Livery Common-Hall,</hi> are ſuppos'd to have been ſetled.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But any one, who remembers the Evidence that the Myſteries had Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their own, before the time of <hi>E.</hi> IV. and the Legal Preſumption, that thoſe <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> were the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> will be more fully ſatisfied, that they were ſo before the time of <hi>E.</hi> IV. when he obſerves the words of thoſe Orders, which are pretended to have given Being to the <hi>Livery Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Order is thus:</p>

               </note>
               <q>At a Common-Council holden on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> in the 7th Year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, it was agreed by <hi>John Young</hi> Mayor, <hi>John Norman,</hi> &amp;c. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45191:14"/>
and the Commonalty of the City of <hi>London, (inter alia)</hi> That the Election of the Mayor and Sheriffs, ſhall hereafter be made [only by the Common-Council:] The Maſter and Wardens of every <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the ſaid <hi>City</hi> coming in their <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>; and by other honeſt Men for that purpoſe <hi>ſpecially ſummoned.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be remember'd, That the Common-Council in <hi>Hen.</hi> the Sixth's time, was the Council of the <hi>Myſteries</hi>; and conſequently, unleſs an alteration can be ſhewn, muſt be thought to have continued ſo at the time of that Order, 7 <hi>E.</hi> IV.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Repreſentation of the Commons being ſo large as has appear'd above, their Act is call'd, <hi>The Act of the Commonalty of the City:</hi> And this we muſt ſuppoſe to have been made in <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. None beſides the Maſters and Wardens are by this Act oblig'd to come in <hi>Liveries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is no reſtriction of Elections to the <hi>Liveries</hi>; but to the Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: That is, as is there explained, the Maſters, and Wardens, and other honeſt Men of the <hi>Myſteries,</hi> ſpecially ſummoned.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>ſpecial Summons,</hi> as has been ſhewn before, the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> and no others, were entituled.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, this was no more than a repeating, or affirming, former Orders, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occaſioned upon the breaking in of other Free-men, to the diſturbance of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, before plac'd in the more <hi>diſcreet,</hi> which the Cuſtom has interpreted to be the <hi>Livery-men</hi>: Who, according to this Ordinance with which the preſent Common-Council triumph, were the only Common-Council at that time.</p>
            <p>And thus, as appears by the Entry before-cited, 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. they continued after this Ordinance, and after the next, 15 <hi>E.</hi> IV. which has theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then in the ſame Common-Council it is agreed, That the Maſter and Wardens of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> in their Halls, or other Places of the <hi>City,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 3. Lib.

And in their <hi>laſt Livery but one,</hi> to the Election of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that no others, beſides the <hi>honeſt Men</hi> of the Common-Council of the City, ſhall be preſent at the ſaid Elections.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All that this adds to the former Proviſion, 7 <hi>E.</hi> IV. is only the requiring all the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> for diſtinction's ſake, to go in their <hi>Liveries,</hi> to prevent the interpoſition of others. Which was no reſtraint upon Perſons; but a requiring the Perſons who came according to their former Right, to wear their proper Habit, to diſtinguiſh 'em from others. Some may ſuppoſe, that this ſpeaks of <hi>honeſt Men</hi> of the Common-Council, beſides the <hi>honeſt Men</hi> of the <hi>Myſteries:</hi> Whereas the Common-Council is plainly here mentioned as exegetical, or explanatory, of the <hi>honeſt Men</hi> of the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries :</hi> That is to ſay, ſuch <hi>honeſt Men</hi> of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> as are of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> and no others, ſhall be preſent at the Elections: Which, as has appear'd, were, long before that Ordinance, the <hi>Livery-men</hi> only. If this and the other be not taken in this Senſe, then they neither confine the Election to <hi>Livery-men</hi>; nor ſuppoſe the <hi>Livery-men</hi> only, to have right to come; but allow any <hi>Commoner,</hi> who is choſen to the <hi>Common Council,</hi> to Vote at the Elections, tho' no <hi>Livery-man:</hi> Whereas they who would derive the Authority of the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> from theſe Ordinances, ſuppoſe, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Elections to the <hi>Livery-men</hi> only.</p>
            <p>But, could it be imagin'd, that thoſe Ordinances, or either of them is, or are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in terms importing a reſtriction of Elections to the <hi>Livery-men</hi>; and that the Ordinances were made by a <hi>Common-Council</hi> choſen by the <hi>Wards,</hi> it appears by the Ordinance which laid the moveable Foundation, upon which following <hi>Common-Councils</hi> of the <hi>Wards</hi> have built up themſelves; beſides, other Evidences of the Superior Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority continuing in the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> (the true <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> or <hi>Crafts,</hi> as it is called 8 <hi>R.</hi> II.) That the force of ſuch reſtraint could not proceed from the Authority of the <hi>Common-Council</hi>; but that ſubſequent <hi>Common-Halls</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thought fit to alter this; and the generality of the <hi>Free-men</hi> having reſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their <hi>Livery-men</hi>; Such <hi>Sufferance</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> has made that become a legal Settlement, which at firſt could be no more than Matter of Advice.</p>
            <p>And, according to this, I find Writs from the Crown, and Acts of Common-Council, place the legality of ſuch Reſtrictions in the Cuſtom of the <hi>City.</hi> But I muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Conſideration, whether there is not better ground to believe, That the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-men</hi> were the <hi>ſtanding Repreſentatives</hi> of the reſt of the <hi>Free-men,</hi> before ever ſuch a <hi>Council</hi> as now acts had any ſetled Being; or, at leaſt, before the time of <hi>E.</hi> IV. than there is to think, that the Words of either of the Ordinances of his time, ſo much as recommend any other deſignation of <hi>Electors,</hi> than what Cuſtom, and conſequently the Conſent of the Free-men, had ſetled before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45191:15"/>In ſhort, it has appear'd, That the Reſolution of the Judges, cited on the other ſide, and more particularly, mother upon the like Occaſion us'd by me, are ſtrong for the <hi>Common-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That according to that very Act of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> 7 <hi>Car.</hi> I. on which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> relies, no Man choſen Sheriff is diſchargeable, unleſs for want of ſufficiency in Eſtate: Nor is there any ground for other <hi>Exemption:</hi> And whatever <hi>Diſcharge</hi> or <hi>Exemption</hi> may have been given by any beſides the <hi>Common Hall</hi>; the Party is nevertheleſs <hi>elegible,</hi> as if he had never been <hi>diſcharged,</hi> or <hi>exempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is made yet more evident, by comparing the Act of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> 7 <hi>Car.</hi> I. with former Acts: But chiefly, with the Act of <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> 24 <hi>E.</hi> III. which was reinforc'd, 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day ſtands in full Virtue, declaring the Senſe of the Body of <hi>Free-men,</hi> That for the <hi>Common-Council</hi> to <hi>vacate</hi> or <hi>defeat</hi> their <hi>Elections,</hi> is to the Prejudice of particular Perſons, who are oblig'd to ſerve, through Default of others; and of the whole City in general, who may want <hi>ſufficient Perſons</hi> to ſerve: Or, at leaſt, cannot find Men of the like Qualifications in every reſpect, with thoſe whom they firſt choſe.</p>
            <p>If we look into the Cuſtom, it is manifeſt, That the Authority of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and of none beſides, to <hi>Diſcharge,</hi> or <hi>Exempt,</hi> has been fully exerted; and own'd, not only by <hi>Common-Councils,</hi> but by the Crown; and that in Times neither too long ſince paſt, nor ſuch wherein Precedents on the ſide of the <hi>Commons</hi> could have obtain'd, if their Right had not been undoubted.</p>
            <p>And, as this Authority has been exerciſed by the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> before ever any <hi>Common Council</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Form or Nature, had a ſetled Being; ſo it has been after; and ſince the Time that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the <hi>Livery Common Hall</hi> to have been inſtituted.</p>
            <p>And the ſeeming Practice of later Days to the contrary, has been of ſuch kind, as has been far from proving any Authority to go along with Acts of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> for the <hi>diſcharging</hi> or <hi>exempting</hi> any one Perſon. The Diſcharge ariſing from the <hi>Common-Hall</hi>'s proceeding to a new Choice.</p>
            <p>Farther yet, if either <hi>By-Laws</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> or both, have crept in to the ſeeming Diminution of the Right of the <hi>Electors</hi>; as has appeared; they would have been void in Law, being contrary to their <hi>Common-Law</hi> Right declared by Charters, and confirmed by Acts of Parliament. And whatever Force, <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>By-Laws,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them clear, might have had againſt Rights ſo eſtabliſhed, the Act of Reſtitution, 2 <hi>W</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> being made while the <hi>Commons</hi> were in Poſſeſſion of their Power, to oblige the Perſon whom they had choſen to hold, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any pretended <hi>Diſcharge</hi>; certainly wrought a Remitter to their antient Right. And this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and reſtored to the <hi>Livery-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add, that by the expreſs Words of that Statute it is enacted, that the ſeveral <hi>Companies,</hi> that is, the <hi>Myſteries</hi> (ſo often named in the <hi>City-Journals</hi>) ſhall have all their <hi>lawful Liberties</hi>; and particularly every Perſon <hi>admitted into the Freedoms</hi> or <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Companies,</hi> ſhall enjoy <hi>the Rights and Privileges</hi> of a <hi>Freeman,</hi> and <hi>Livery-man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which confirms the <hi>Livery-men</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> with all the Rights and Incidents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>And whereas the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſuppoſes that the <hi>Common-Council</hi> can ſet aſide the <hi>Rights and Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-men,</hi> as they of the <hi>Common-Council</hi> are the City's <hi>Legiſlators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they were ſuch, the Reſtrution, 2 <hi>W.</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> ſettles the Livery men beyond being ſhaken by any Authority within the City, for the making By-Laws. And in truth the Authority of making <hi>By-Laws,</hi> both at <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and by Charter, originally reſted with the whole Body of <hi>Freemen</hi>; and has formerly been regularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the whole Body, in their Aſſemblies in <hi>Guildhall,</hi> or other <hi>Folkmote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Exer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice of this has by Cuſtom been confined to <hi>Guildhall</hi>; and is now become impracticable elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and the Authority of this Court, the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> with the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> were in full legal poſſeſſion, before ſuch a <hi>Common Council</hi> as now acts had any ſettled Being: nor has any Act of <hi>Common-Council</hi> ſo much as occaſioned the Privileges of the <hi>Livery-men,</hi> much leſs has it created them.</p>
            <p>But, according to the Preſumption of Law, they have had an uninterrupted Poſſeſſion from before 8 <hi>E.</hi> 2. nor does it appear that any Man can gave any Vote among them, otherwiſe than as a Livery-man,; the Right of Suffrages in the <hi>Common-Hall</hi> being ſettled in the <hi>Livery-men</hi>; who have been, and yet are the true <hi>Common-Council</hi> of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, that which now obtains the Name of the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> has been from its ſeveral Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet is, a mere Creature of the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and dependent upon its Pleaſure: at the moſt is but of the Nature of a <hi>Committee,</hi> and has no greater or higher Relation than of a Part to the whole: and whether it acts by it ſelf, or in Conjunction with the greater Body; muſt be concluded by the Majority.</p>
            <p>To cloſe this Argument, which may ſeem tedious to many; and, yet poſſibly, is no more labour'd than the ſtrength of Prepoſſeſſion requires; I may well ſay, with the <hi>Vindicator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. <hi>p. 8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>While ſome ſtrive to make Breaches, my buſineſs ſhall be to promote Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it muſt be conſider'd, That Men have very different Notions of <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our <hi>Governors,</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> valued themſelves upon the <hi>Peacefulneſs</hi> of former Reigns; many, who now would have the Commons of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> to ſacrifice their Right, to the quieting this Controverſie, were thought properly to have applied that old Sarcaſm; "<hi>They make Solitude, and call it Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, I always thought the aſſerting and adhering to the <hi>Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Great Community</hi> in the firſt place; and next of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which,<note place="margin">Caput legum &amp; Regni.</note> according to the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>'s Law, is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Great Body,</hi> to be the beſt means to ſecure ſuch a <hi>Peace,</hi> as <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> may rejoice to tranſmit to Poſterity. And I cannot but hope, That both Sides may receive this my ſincere Endeavour, as a ſeaſonable <hi>Peace-Offering.</hi>
