            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

appoſite Symbols are not toyes and inſignificant nothings, but Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of real, though tacite Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the conjunction of them here leſſons us to obſerve: firſt, the Order and Locality, ſecond, the Import and Nature of them both in the common and ſelect interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. As to the Order and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation the deſcription has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry regular, for <hi>Notitia</hi> is the firſt ſtep to honour, men muſt know before they can venerate, God ſets up light in the Soul as the inlet of Faith, Love, Adhaeſion, In which ſence the Scripture ſaith, <hi>They that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee,</hi> for Knowledge is the Centinel that examines all approaches to the Main guard of the affections, and it is ſeldom ſeen that a true eſteem is fixed in the heart when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not convinc'd of the Nobility of the Object.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:115979:44"/>
It is true, there is no demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reaſon to be given of Love and reſpect, that is, there is not alwayes ſuch a concurrence of praelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and worthineſs in the objects of Love, as juſtifies our love to be placed with judgement and choyce, approving it ſelf to the rationality of humane nature, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there, that men love and hate things that they have no experience of the good or evil of them; yet is there an <hi>ictus</hi> or impulſe occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by view, Narrative, Or ſome other accident, which hath cogency and force of Conqueſt on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, which by gaining that advantage, proceeds to prevail on the affections, and thence on the outward man, from which it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that which is called reſpect and honour; ſo that as in all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall operations, there is Cauſe and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115979:44"/>
effect, which in order of time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede each other, ſo in knowledge and honour is there an order to be obſerved. Since the honour we give to any thing or perſon, is but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the Knowledge we have of that thing or perſon, and iſſuant from it as the tribute we give to that excellency of worth we apprehend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Imports of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiae</hi> and Honour both in their common, and in their ſelect accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is notable. For there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that are <hi>Notitiae,</hi> as well as Arms, which yet are not of ſuch perſonal and familical honourable intendment as Arms are. In all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Nations, there are Notices of diſtinction, both for perſons and things. And ſome are allowed what others are not, becauſe they are of more conſpicuity then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115979:45"/>
are, and therefore ſacrated and ſeparate from vulgar familiarities. <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, of <hi>Severus, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam libertinos in Equeſtrem ordinem redigiſse ne Equeſtris Ordo commacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,</hi> The names of <hi>Heroes</hi> were not <note place="margin">Alex ab Alex. lib. 3 c. 20.</note> to be given to mean perſons.

will ariſe and plead his own cauſe, and from him as the onely <hi>Judex legitimus,</hi> there will be no appeal. And ſo the fifth part of the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption comes next, to hand the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to whom Arms are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed, <hi>Militibus</hi> to Souldiers. But of Souldiers, I have written ſomewhat in the preceding ſheets, that which remains, is onely two limitations. 1. Though Arms and Honour be the proper reward of Souldiers, yet not onely of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. 2. Though they be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Souldiers, yet not of all Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though of Souldiers, yet not of all Souldiers, For if as great deſigns of Conqueſt, and conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dominion, has been effected by Counſel, as by force, then are the remunerations Military to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Co-heires of merit, Courage &amp; Councel.</p>

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:115979:107"/>
The Souldiers (indeed) as the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to make firſt choyce of the divident, but the Gown man is to have his allowance as equal as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can apportion it. When <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> firſt forged his Engine of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by which he became as terrible to men, as the hunter is to the purſued beaſt, then was there no rival with, no counterpoyſe to power; but after when Councel made ſnares, and fixed harping I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons in <hi>Leviathans</hi> of rule, then was Councel owned, as a conſervator of the peace of Nations. Then Princes appeared in Robes and veſts of calmneſs, diſtributing their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours under repreſentations of peace, the Daughter of Counſel and Prudence, rather then in tokens of warre and ferocity, deriving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from the Lawes of learned Juſtice, and not from the form of

'Tis fit indeed, fortitude ſhould be encouraged, all ages and Nations have need of it, and are made happy by it, therefore ought to reward it, and ſo have done, and ſo (for example ſake) will do; but other vertues of equal merit, muſt not be exhaeredated, or become ſpurious, to advance its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation.

And when Soveraigns gave Donaries from their perſons, as Jewels, Swords, Speares, Sprigs, Helmets; Armours, uſually worn by them, and by them delivered as gifts to perſons, with indulgence of them to be born by their Iſſues, and did this before great appearances of men, and at the head of Armies: there needed no further teſtimonials of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers right.

But in as much as Arms and Honour do give digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and precedence which will not eaſily be aſſented to by thoſe who hold themſelves agrieved, and are loath to cooperate to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation.
