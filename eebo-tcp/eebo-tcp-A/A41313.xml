         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rovinces.</p>
            <p>And their <hi>Highneſſes <hi>are very ready,</hi>
               </hi> in caſe His Majeſty ſhall think fit to deſire it, to declare their willingneſs to concur in the ſettling and confirming this Liberty, and as far as it lies in them, they will protect and defend it, and according to the Language of Treaties, They wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l confirm it with their <hi>Guaranty,</hi> of which you made mention in yours.</p>
            <p>And if His Majeſty ſhall think fit <hi>further to deſire their concurrence in the repealing of the Penal Laws, <hi>they are ready</hi> to give it</hi>; provided alwayes that thoſe Laws remain ſtill in their full vigor, by which the R. Catholicks are ſhut out of both Houſes of Parliament, and out of all Publick Employments, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, Civil, and Military.</p>
            <p>You writ, That the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in theſe Provinces <hi>are not ſhut out from Employments and Places of Truſt</hi>; but in this you are much miſtaken, for our Laws are expreſs, excluding them by name from all ſhare in the Government, and from all Employments either of the Policy or Juſtice of our Countrey. It is true, I do not know of any expreſs Law, that ſhuts them out of <hi>Military Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that had indeed <hi>been hard,</hi> ſince in the firſt formation of our State, <hi>they joyned with us in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Publick Liberty, and did as eminent ſervice during the Wars</hi>; therefore they were not ſhut out from thoſe Military Employments; for the Publick Safety <hi>was no way endangered by this,</hi> both becauſe their numbers that ſerved in our Troops were not great, and becauſe the States could eaſily prevent any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency that might ariſe out of that; which could not have been done ſo eaſily, if the R Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks had been admitted to a ſhare in the Government, and in the Policy or Juſtice of our State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am</hi> very certain of this, of which I could give very good proof, that there is nothing that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> deſire ſo much, as <hi>That His Majeſty may Reign happily,</hi> and in an intire Confidence with his Subjects; and that his Subjects being perſwaded of His Majeſties fatherly affection to them, may be ready to make him all the <hi>Returns of Duty</hi> that are in their power.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have ever paid a moſt profound Duty to His Majeſty, <hi>which they will alwayes <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> to do; for they conſider themſelves <hi>bound</hi> to it, both by the Laws of God and of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not think it neceſſary to demonſtrate to you <hi>how much their Highneſſes</hi> are <hi>devoted <hi>to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi>
               </hi> of which they have given ſuch real Evidences as are beyond all verbal ones; and they are reſolved ſtill to <hi>continue in the ſame Duty and Affection: <hi>or rather to</hi> increaſe <hi>it,</hi>
