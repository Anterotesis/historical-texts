            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Author of the following Pieces must be excused for their being hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out so confusedly. They are Printed just as he finished them off, and some things there are which he design'd not ever to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but was fain to do it, to keep the Press at work, when it was once set a going. If it be their Fate to perish, and go the way of all mortal Rhimes, 'tis no great matter in what method they have been plac'd, no more than whether <hi>Ode, Elegy,</hi> or <hi>Satyr</hi> have the honor of Wiping first. But if they, and what he has formerly made Publick, be so happy as to live, and come forth in an Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all together; perhaps he may then think them worth the sorting in better Order. By that time belike he means to have ready a very Sparkish Dedication, if he can but get himself known to some Great Man, that
<pb facs="tcp:99185:3"/>
will give a good parcel of Guinnies for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handsomly flatter'd. Then likewise the Reader (for his farther comfort) may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to see him appear with all the Pomp and Trappings of an Author; his Head in the Front very finely cut, together with the Year of his Age, Commendatory Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in abundance, and all the Hands of the Poets of <hi>Quorum</hi> to confirm his Book, and pass it for Authentick. This at present is content to come abroad naked, Undedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Unprefac'd, without one kind Word to shelter it from Censure; and so let the Criticks take it amongst them.</p>

            <head>THE EIGHTH SATYR OF Monsieur BOILEAV, Imitated. Written in <hi>October,</hi> 1682.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The POET brings himself in, as discoursing with a Doctor of the Vniversity upon the Subject ensuing.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>OF all the Creatures in the world that be,</l>
            <l>Beast, Fish, or Fowl, that go, or swim, or fly</l>
            <l>Throughout the Globe from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Iapan,</hi>

               <hi>What</hi>? (strait I'm taken up) <hi>an Ant, a Fly,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A tiny Mite, which we can hardly see</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99185:5"/>Without a Perspective, a silly Ass,</l>
            <l>Or freakish Ape? Dare you affirm, that these</l>
            <l>Have greater sense than Man? <hi>Ay, questionless.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Doctor, I find you're shock'd at this discourse:</l>
            <l>Man is <hi>(you cry)</hi> Lord of the Vniverse;</l>
            <l>For him was this fair frame of Nature made,</l>
            <l>And all the Creatures for his use, and aid:</l>
            <l>To him alone of all the living kind,</l>
            <l>Has bounteous Heav'n the reas'ning gift assign'd.</l>
            <l>True Sir, that Reason ever was his lot,</l>
            <l>But thence I argue Man the greater Sot.</l>
            <l>This idle talk, <hi>(you say)</hi> and rambling stuff</l>
            <l>May pass in Satyr, and take well enough</l>
            <l>With Sceptick Fools, who are dispos'd to jeer</l>
            <l>At serious things: but you must make't appear</l>
            <l>
               <hi>By solid proof.</hi> Believe me, Sir, I'll do't:</l>
            <l>Take you the Desk, and let's dispute it out.</l>
            <l>Then by your favour, tell me first of all,</l>
            <l>What 'tis, which you grave Doctors Wisdom call?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99185:5"/>You answer: <hi>'Tis an evenness of Soul,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A steddy temper, which no cares controul,</l>

            <head>THE THIRTEENTH SATYR OF IVVENAL, Imitated. Written in <hi>April,</hi> 1682.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>The POET comforts a Friend, that is overmuch concerned for the loss of a considerable Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of which he has lately been cheated by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to whom he intrusted the same. This he does by shewing, that nothing comes to pass in the world without Divine Providence, and that wicked Men (however they seem to escape its Punishment here)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99185:17"/>
yet suffer abundantly in the torments of an evil Conscience. And by the way takes occasion to lash the Degeneracy, and Villany of the present Times.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>THere is not one base Act, which Men commit,</l>
            <l>But carries this ill sting along with it,</l>
            <l>That to the Author it creates regret:</l>
            <l>And this is some Revenge at least, that he</l>
            <l>Can ne'r acquit himself of Villany,</l>
            <l>Tho a Brib'd Judg and Jury set him free.</l>
            <l>All people, Sir, abhor (as 'tis but just)</l>
            <l>Your faithless Friend, who lately broke his Trust,</l>
            <l>And curse the treacherous Deed: But, thanks to Fate,</l>
            <l>That has not bless'd you with so small Estate,</l>
            <l>But that with patience you may bear the Cross,</l>
            <l>And need not sink under so mean a Loss.</l>
            <l>Besides your Case for less concern does call,</l>
            <l>Because 'tis what does usually befal:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:99185:17"/>Ten Thousand such might be alledg'd with ease,</l>
            <l>Out of the common crowd of Instances.</l>
            <l>Then cease for shame, immoderate regret,</l>
            <l>And don't your Manhood, and your Sense forget:</l>
            <l>'Tis womanish, and silly to lay forth</l>
            <l>More cost in Grief than a Misfortune's worth.</l>
            <l>You scarce can bear a puny trifling ill,</l>
            <l>It goes so deep, pray Heav'n! it does not kill:</l>
            <l>And all this trouble, and this vain ado,</l>
            <l>Because a Friend (forsooth) has prov'd untrue.</l>
            <l>Shame o' your Beard! can this so much amaze?</l>
            <l>Were you not born in good King <hi>Iemmy</hi>'s days?</l>
            <l>And are not you at length yet wiser grown,</l>
            <l>When threescore Winters on your head have snown?</l>

            <l>May learn from meer experience how to bear</l>
            <l>(Without vain strugling) Fortune's yoke, and how</l>
            <l>They ought her rudest shocks to undergo.</l>

            <l>E're since great <hi>Hobbes</hi> the world has undeceiv'd?</l>
            <l>This might have past with the plain simple Race</l>
            <l>Of our Forefathers in King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s days:</l>
            <l>E're, mingling with corrupted forein Seed,</l>

            <l>E're yet bless'd <hi>Albion,</hi> high in ancient Fame,</l>
            <l>With her first Innocence resign'd her Name.</l>
            <l>Fair dealing then, and downright Honesty,</l>
            <l>And plighted Faith were good Security:</l>

            <l>To bind a Trust there lack'd no formal ties</l>
            <l>Of Paper, Wax, and Seals, and Witnesses,</l>
            <l>Nor ready Coin, but sterling Promises:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99185:19"/>Each took the other's word, and that would go</l>
            <l>For currant then, and more than Oaths do now:</l>
            <l>None had recourse to <hi>Chanc'ry</hi> for defence,</l>

            <l>Nor traps were yet set up for Perjurers,</l>
            <l>That catch men by the Heads, and whip off Ears.</l>
            <l>Then Knave, and Villain, things unheard of were,</l>

               <l>And with your Fingers Dialogues were made:</l>
               <l>I understood the Language out of hand,</l>
               <l>(For what's too hard for Love to understand?)</l>

               <l>I saw you then with wanton Kisses greet,</l>
               <l>Your Tongues (I saw) did in your Kisses meet:</l>

               <l>Did in the height of their Embraces joyn.</l>
               <l>Patience, ye Gods! (cried I) what is't I see?</l>
               <l>Vnfaithful! why this Treachery to me?</l>
               <l>How dare you let another in my sight</l>

               <l>He must not, shall not do't: by Love I swear</l>
               <l>I'll seize the bold usurping Ravisher:</l>
               <l>You are my Free-hold, and the Fates design,</l>

               <l>When Light's first blushes paint the bashful Morn:</l>
               <l>So on the Bush the flaming Rose does glow,</l>

               <l>This, or some other Colour much like these,</l>
               <l>The semblance then of her Complexion was:</l>
               <l>And while her Looks that sweet Disorder wore</l>
               <l>Chance added Beauties undisclos'd before:</l>
               <l>Upon the ground she cast her jetty Eyes,</l>
               <l>Her Eyes shot fiercer Darts in that Disguise:</l>
               <l>Her Face a sad and mournful Air express'd,</l>
               <l>Her Face more lovely seem'd in sadness dress'd:</l>
               <l>Urg'd by Revenge, I hardly could forbear,</l>
               <l>Her braided Locks, and tender Cheeks to tear:</l>
               <l>Yet I no sooner had her Face survey'd,</l>
               <l>But strait the tempest of my Rage was laid:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:99185:58"/>A look of her did my Resentments charm,</l>
               <l>A look of her did all their Force disarm:</l>

               <l>Grow calm as Infants, when in sleep they smile:</l>
               <l>And now a Kiss am humbly fain to crave,</l>
               <l>And beg no worse than she my Rival gave:</l>
               <l>She smil'd, and strait a throng of Kisses prest,</l>
               <l>The worst of which, should <hi>Iove</hi> himself but taste,</l>
               <l>The brandish'd Thunder from his Hand would wrest:</l>
               <l>Well-pleas'd I was, and yet tormented too,</l>
               <l>For fear my envied Rival felt them so:</l>
               <l>Better they seem'd by far than I e're taught,</l>
               <l>And she in them shew'd something new methought:</l>
               <l>Fond jealous I my self the Pleasure grutch,</l>
               <l>And they displeas'd, because they pleas'd too much:</l>
               <l>When in my mouth I felt her darting Tongue,</l>
               <l>My wounded Thoughts it with suspicion stung:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99185:58"/>Nor is it this alone afflicts my mind,</l>
               <l>More reason for complaint remains behind:</l>
               <l>I grieve not only that she Kisses gave,</l>
               <l>Tho that affords me cause enough to grieve:</l>
               <l>Such never could be taught her but in Bed,</l>

            <l>Let mine be so, and give me light,</l>
            <l>That I may drink, and revel by't:</l>
            <l>Yet draw no shapes of Armour there,</l>
            <l>No Cask, nor Shield, nor Sword, nor Spear,</l>
            <l>Nor Wars of <hi>Thebes,</hi> nor Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi>

            <l>Who mind not such rough Exercise,</l>
            <l>But gentler Sieges, softer Wars,</l>
            <l>Fights, that cause no Wounds, or Scars?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:99185:63"/>I'll have no Battles on my Plate,</l>

            <l>For what are Stars to my Design,</l>
            <l>Stars, which I, when drunk, out-shine,</l>
            <l>Out-shone by every drop of Wine?</l>
            <l>I lack no Pole Star on the Brink,</l>
            <l>To guide in the wide Sea of Drink,</l>
            <l>But would for ever there be tost;</l>

            <l>Yet, gentle Artist, if thou'lt try</l>
            <l>Thy Skill, then draw me (let me see)</l>
            <l>Draw me first a spreading Vine,</l>
            <l>Make its Arms the Bowl entwine,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:99185:63"/>With kind embraces, such as I</l>
            <l>Twist about my loving she.</l>
            <l>Let its Boughs o're-spread above</l>
            <l>Scenes of Drinking, Scenes of Love:</l>
            <l>Draw next the Patron of that Tree,</l>
            <l>Draw <hi>Bacchus</hi> and soft <hi>Cupid</hi> by;</l>
            <l>Draw them both in toping Shapes,</l>
            <l>Their Temples crown'd with cluster'd Grapes:</l>
            <l>Make them lean against the Cup,</l>
            <l>As 'twere to keep their Figures up:</l>
            <l>And when their reeling Forms I view,</l>
            <l>I'll think them drunk, and be so too:</l>
            <l>The Gods shall my examples be,</l>
            <l>The Gods, thus drunk in Effigy.</l>

            <head>THE DREAM. Written, <hi>March</hi> 10. 1677.</head>
            <l>LAte as I on my Bed reposing lay,</l>
            <l>And in soft sleep forgot the Toils of Day,</l>
            <l>My self, my Cares, and Love, all charm'd to Rest,</l>
            <l>And all the Tumults of my waking Breast,</l>
            <l>Quiet and calm, as was the silent Night,</l>
            <l>Whose stillness did to that bless'd sleep invite;</l>
            <l>I dreamt, and strait this visionary Scene</l>
            <l>Did with Delight my Fancy entertain.</l>
            <l>I saw, methought, a lonely Privacy,</l>
            <l>Remote alike from man's, and Heavens Eye,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:99185:65"/>Girt with the covert of a shady Grove,</l>
            <l>Dark as my thoughts, and secret as my Love:</l>
            <l>Hard by a Stream did with that softness creep,</l>
            <l>As 'twere by its own murmurs husht asleep;</l>
            <l>On its green Bank under a spreading Tree,</l>
            <l>At once a pleasant, and a shelt'ring Canopy,</l>
            <l>There I, and there my dear <hi>Cosmelia</hi> sate,</l>
            <l>Nor envied Monarchs in our safe Retreat:</l>
            <l>So heretofore were the first Lovers laid</l>
            <l>On the same Turf of which themselves were made.</l>
            <l>A while I did her charming Glories view,</l>
            <l>Which to their former Conquests added new;</l>
            <l>A while my wanton hand was pleas'd to rove</l>
            <l>Thro all the hidden Labyrinths of Love;</l>
            <l>Ten thousand Kisses on her Lips I fix'd,</l>
            <l>Which she with interfering Kisses mix'd,</l>
            <l>Eager as those of Lovers are in Death,</l>
            <l>When they give up their Souls too with the Breath</l>
            <l>Love by these Freedoms first became more bold,</l>
            <l>At length unruly, and too fierce to hold:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:99185:66"/>
               <hi>See then</hi> (said I) <hi>and pity, charming Fair,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yield quickly, yield; I can no longer bear</l>
            <l>Th' impatient Sallies of a Bliss so near:</l>
            <l>You must, and you alone these storms appease,</l>
            <l>And lay those Spirits which your Charms could raise;</l>
            <l>Come, and in equal Flouds let's quench our Flame,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Come let's</hi>—and unawares I went to name</l>
            <l>The Thing, but stopt and blusht methought in Dream.</l>
            <l>At first she did the rude Address disown,</l>
            <l>And check'd my Boldness with an angry Frown,</l>
            <l>But yielding Glances, and consenting Eyes</l>
            <l>Prov'd the soft Traitors to her forc'd Disguise;</l>
            <l>And soon her looks with anger rough e're while,</l>
            <l>Sunk in the dimples of a calmer smile:</l>
            <l>Then with a sigh into these words she broke,</l>
            <l>And printed melting Kisses as she spoke:</l>
            <l>Too strong, <hi>Philander,</hi> is thy pow'rful Art</l>
            <l>To take a feeble Maids ill-guarded Heart:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:99185:66"/>Too long I've struggled with my Bliss in vain,</l>
            <l>Too long oppos'd what I oft wish'd to gain,</l>
            <l>Loath to consent, yet loather to deny,</l>
            <l>At once I court, and shun Felicity:</l>
            <l>I cannot, will not yield;—and yet I must,</l>
            <l>Lest to my own Desires I prove unjust:</l>
            <l>Sweet Ravisher! what Love commands thee, do;</l>
            <l>Tho I'm displeas'd, I shall forgive thee too,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Too well thou know'st</hi>;—and there my hand she press'd,</l>
            <l>And said no more, but blush'd and smil'd the rest.</l>
            <l>Ravish'd at the new grant, fierce eager I</l>
            <l>Leap'd furious on, and seiz'd my trembling Prey;</l>
            <l>With guarding Arms she first my Force repell'd,</l>
            <l>Shrunk, and drew back, and would not seem to yield;</l>
            <l>Unwilling to o'recome, she faintly strove,</l>
            <l>One hand pull'd to, what t'other did remove:</l>
            <l>So feeble are the struglings, and so weak</l>
            <l>In sleep we seem, and only sleep to make:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:99185:67"/>
               <hi>Forbear!</hi> (she said) <hi>ah, gentle Youth, forbear</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(And still she hug'd, and clasp'd me still more near)</l>
            <l>Ah! will you? will you force my Ruin so?</l>
            <l>Ah! do not, do not, do not;—let me go.</l>
            <l>What follow'd was above the pow'r of Verse,</l>
            <l>Above the reach of Fancy to rehearse:</l>
            <l>Not dying Saints enjoy such Extasies,</l>
            <l>When they in Vision antedate their Bliss;</l>
            <l>Not Dreams of a young Ptophet are so bless'd,</l>
            <l>When holy Trances first inspire his Breast,</l>
            <l>And the God enters there to be a Guest.</l>
            <l>Let duller Mortals other Pleasures prize,</l>
            <l>Pleasures which enter at the waking Eyes,</l>
            <l>Might I each Night such sweet Enjoyments find,</l>
            <l>I'd wink for ever, be for ever blind.</l>

            <l>Thence the vast Herd of Earls, and Barons came,</l>
            <l>For Virtue each brought nothing but a Name:</l>
            <l>Soon after Man, fruitful in Vanities,</l>
            <l>Did Blazoning and Armory devise,</l>
            <l>Founded a College for the Herald's Art,</l>
            <l>And made a Language of their Terms apart,</l>
            <l>Compos'd of frightful words, of <hi>Chief,</hi> and <hi>Base,</hi>

            <l>Then farther the wild Folly to pursue,</l>
            <l>Plain down-right Honor out of fashion grew:</l>

            <l>Than a <hi>Lord Mayor's</hi> Waiter e're could boast.</l>
            <l>Then, Sir, 'tis hardly credible to tell,</l>
            <l>How I'm respected, and belov'd by all:</l>
            <l>I'm the Delight of the whole Family,</l>

            <l>There on fresh Bed of Straw, with Canopy</l>
            <l>Of Hutch above, like Dog of State I lie.</l>
            <l>Besides, when with high Fare, and Nature fir'd,</l>
            <l>To generous Sports of Youth I am inspir'd,</l>
            <l>All the proud shees are soft to my Embrace</l>
            <l>From Bitch of Quality down to Turn-spit Race:</l>
            <l>Each day I try new Mistrisses and Loves,</l>
            <l>Nor envy Sovereign Dogs in their Alcoves.</l>
            <l>

            </l>
            <l>But, think you, Sir, it would be feasible,</l>
            <l>And that my Application might prevail?</l>
            <l>Do but endeavour, Sir, you need not doubt;</l>
            <l>I make no question but to bring't about:</l>
            <l>Only rely on me, and rest secure,</l>
            <l>I'll serve you to the utmost of my Pow'r;</l>

            <l>For Fawning, and for Suppleness with me.</l>

            <l>The Dog, who Breeding well did understand,</l>
            <l>In walking gives his Ghest the upper hand:</l>
            <l>And as they walk along, they all the while</l>
            <l>With Mirth, and pleasant Raillery beguile</l>
            <l>The tedious Time, and Way, till Day drew near,</l>
            <l>And Light came on; by which did soon appear</l>
            <l>The Mastiff's Neck to view all worn and bare.</l>
            <l>This when his Camrade spi'd, <hi>What means</hi> (said he)</l>
            <l>This Circle bare, which round your Neck I see?</l>
            <l>If I may be so bold;—Sir, you must know,</l>
            <l>That I at first was rough, and fierce, like you,</l>
            <l>Of Nature curs'd, and often apt to bite</l>
            <l>Strangers, and else, who ever came in sight:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:99185:78"/>For this I was tied up, and underwent</l>
            <l>The Whip sometimes, and such light Chastisement:</l>
            <l>Till I at length by Discipline grew tame,</l>
            <l>Gentle, and tractable, as now I am:</l>
            <l>'Twas by this short, and slight severity</l>
            <l>I gain'd these Marks and Badges, which you see:</l>
            <l>But what are they? <hi>Allons Monsieur!</hi> let's go.</l>
            <l>Not one step farther: Sir, excuse me now.</l>
            <l>Much joy t'ye of your envied, bless'd Estate:</l>
            <l>I will not buy Preferment at that rate:</l>
            <l>A Gods name, take your golden Chains for me:</l>
            <l>Faith, I'd not be a King, not to be free:</l>

            <l>GO, humble Gift, go to that matchless Saint,</l>
            <l>Of whom thou only wast a Copy meant:</l>
            <l>And all, that's read in thee, more richly find</l>
            <l>Compriz'd in the fair Volume of her mind;</l>
            <l>That living System, where are fully writ</l>
            <l>All those high Morals, which in Books we meet:</l>
            <l>Easie, as in soft Air, there writ they are,</l>
            <l>Yet firm, as if in Brass they graven were.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:99185:79"/>Nor is her Talent lazily to know</l>
            <l>As dull Divines, and holy Canters do;</l>
            <l>She acts what they only in Pulpits prate,</l>
            <l>And Theory to Practice does translate:</l>
            <l>Not her own Actions more obey her Will,</l>
            <l>Than that obeys strict Virtues dictates still:</l>
            <l>Yet does not Virtue from her Duty flow,</l>
            <l>But she is good, because she will be so:</l>
            <l>Her Virtue scorns at a low pitch to flie,</l>
            <l>'Tis all free Choice, nought of Necessity:</l>
            <l>By such soft Rules are Saints above confin'd,</l>
            <l>Such is the Tie, which them to Good does bind.</l>
            <l>The scatter'd Glories of her happy Sex</l>
            <l>In her bright Soul as in their Center mix:</l>
            <l>And all, that they possess but by Retail,</l>
            <l>She hers by just Monopoly can call;</l>
            <l>Whose sole Example does more Virtues shew,</l>
            <l>Than Schoolmen ever taught, or ever knew.</l>
            <l>No Act did e're within her Practice fall,</l>
            <l>Which for th' atonement of a Bush could call:</l>

            <l>Scarcely her Thoughts have ever sullied been</l>
            <l>With the least print, or stain of native Sin:</l>
            <l>Devout she is, as holy Hermits are,</l>
            <l>Who share their time 'twixt Extasie, and Prayer:</l>
            <l>Modest, as infant Roses in their Bloom,</l>
            <l>Who in a Blush their fragrant Lives consume:</l>
            <l>So chast, the Dead themselves are only more,</l>
            <l>Who lie divorc'd from Objects, and from Power:</l>
            <l>So pure, could Virtue in a Shape appear,</l>
            <l>'Twould chuse to have no other Form, but Her:</l>
            <l>So much a Saint, I scarce dare call her so,</l>
            <l>For fear to wrong her with a name too low:</l>
            <l>Such the Seraphick Brightness of her mind,</l>
            <l>I hardly can believe her Womankind:</l>
            <l>But think some nobler Being does appear,</l>
            <l>Which to instruct the World, has left the Sphere,</l>
            <l>And condescends to wear a Body here.</l>

            <l>Which he might only see, but never tread:</l>

            <l>Than I from you, and all my Joys did part.</l>
            <l>As some young Merchant, whom his Sire unkind</l>

            <l>If the kind Mistriss of his Vows appear,</l>

            <l>Long he looks back to see what he adores,</l>
            <l>And, while he may, views the beloved Shores.</l>
            <l>Such just concerns I at your Parting had,</l>

            <head>A SATYR. The Person of <hi>Spencer</hi> is brought in, Dissuading the Author from the Study of <hi>POETRY,</hi> and shewing how little it is esteem'd and encourag'd in this present Age.</head>
            <l>ONE night, as I was pondering of late</l>
            <l>On all the mis'ries of my hapless Fate,</l>
            <l>Cursing my rhiming Stars, raving in vain</l>
            <l>At all the Pow'rs, which over Poets reign:</l>
            <l>In came a ghastly Shape, all pale, and thin,</l>
            <l>As some poor Sinner, who by Priest had been</l>
            <l>Under a long Lent's Penance, starv'd, and whip'd,</l>
            <l>Or par-boil'd Lecher, late from Hot-house crept:</l>
            <l>

            <l>A Wreath of Lawrel on his Head he wore,</l>
            <l>A Book, inscrib'd the <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> he bore.</l>
            <l>By this I knew him, rose, and bow'd, and said,</l>
            <l>Hail reverend Ghost! all hail most sacred Shade!</l>
            <l>Why this great Visit? why vouchsaf'd to me,</l>
            <l>The meanest of thy British Progeny?</l>
            <l>Com'st thou in my uncall'd, unhallow'd Musae,</l>
            <l>Some of thy mighty Spirit to infuse?</l>
            <l>If so; lay on thy Hands, ordain me fit</l>
            <l>For the high Cure, and Ministry of Wit:</l>

               <l>We'll starve his Army, all their Quarters drain,</l>
