            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>4. Thirdly the Name only of a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

can be conceyued nor borne without a

it leaue to sucke the mothers breasts will

euen our wisest Aduersaries are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
For both <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> doe: confesse
this,<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 1. &amp; Beza. cap. 5. sua conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we cannot hope for the remission of our
sinnes, nor euerlasting saluation: and that
the goyng out of the true Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies-hatefull.
And hence it commeth
to passe, that in the <hi>Creed of the Apostles,</hi> first
we beliue the holy Catholike Church,
and then the remission of sinnes, and lyfe
euerlasting, because indeed without this
Church none can obtaine eyther remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <head type="sub">That the Church of Christ is to continue

            <p>THE second error of our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
is, that many of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that the Church of Christ
hath not continually endured,
but that it sometymes fayled. This error
may also be easily refuted by the foresayd
propertyes &amp; offices of the Church. For
first the Church is the spouse of Christ, of
which he speaketh by the Prophet, <hi>I will
betroth thee vnto me for euer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Osee 2. v. 19.</note> Christ therfore
did not betroth his Church vnto him
for a few yeares only.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly the Church is the Body of
Christ,<note place="margin">Ad Rom. 12. v. 5.</note> but Christ cannot be without his
body, and truly it were a monstrous thing
to see a liuing head without a body.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly the Church is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, but the Scriptures doe
teach in many places, that this Kingdome
of Christ shall continue for euer, as <hi>Micheae
4. v.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Psalm. 88. vel 89. v. 36.</note>

&amp; 21. Luc. 1. 22. &amp;</hi> 33. Lastly <hi>Christ</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in <hi>his Holy One,</hi> that is to say, by his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18738:7"/>
               <hi>Holines,</hi> that the Kingdome of Christ shall
last <hi>for euer.</hi> Wherefore they endeauour to
make Christ himself periured, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that the Kingdome of Christ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
perished.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly the Church is the <hi>house</hi>
of Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 17. v. 18.</note> the which he built vpon a
rocke, against which <hi>the gates of hell shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            </p>
            <p>5. Fifthly this same is proued by the
offices of the Church,<note place="margin">1. ad Cor. 11. v. 26.</note> 
               <hi>The Church shall shew
the death of our Lord vntil he come.</hi> God also

Christ also sent his Disciples to teach all

he added this promise, <hi>Behould I am with

matter,<note place="margin">Calu. lib 4. Instit. c. 1. sect. 17. in fine.</note> do acknowledge, that the holy

            <p>THE third error of our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
is, that they deny the Church
of Christ to haue byn alwayes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
For seing that they cannot

refuted by the soresaid properties, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the true Church.</p>
            <p>2. For first the Church is the body
of Christ:<note place="margin">1. ad Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Apostle spake vnto visible
men when he sayd, <hi>you are the body of Christ.</hi>
Moreouer we are made the <hi>body of Christ</hi> by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18738:8"/>
               <hi>baptisme</hi> and the receyuing of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,<note place="margin">1. ad Cor. 10. v 17. &amp; 1. Cor. 12. v. 13. Ad Ephes. 4. v. 11. 12.</note>
as witnesseth the Apostle. But these
Sacraments are visible. Also in this body
of Christ, there are <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Pastors vntill
the consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saynts,</hi> vntil we meet with
Christ, but such persons are visible.
The <hi>building</hi> also of the <hi>Church is visible, this
consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of Saints is visible, that uorke of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
is visible,</hi> which the Apostle sayth
shall continue vntill the comming of
Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Secondly the Church is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, but euery Kingdome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
in it a visible company of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who all acknowledge one King. Hence
it is that God describing by the Prophet
<hi>Ieremy.</hi> this Kingdome of Christ, speaketh
in this sorte of the multitude of men
which shalbe in the Kingdome of Christ.
<hi>Euen as</hi> (saith our Lord) <hi>the starres of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

so will I multiply the seed of my seruant

and so great a multitude of men cannot
be inuisible.</p>
            <p>4. In like manner the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi>

and the couenant of God with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus
writeth.<note place="margin">Isaiae 61. v. 8. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I will make a perpetuall league with

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18738:9"/>
and their ofspring in the middest of the
people; all that shall see them shall know
them, because this is the seede that God
hath blessed: where it is manifestly sayd
that all Nations, euen the Infidels, assoone
as they shall behould and see the Church
they shall easily know her by the benefits
of God bestowed vpon her. <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe
acknowledgeth this to be spoken of the
Church,<note place="margin">Calu. in haec verba Isayae.</note> and he, addeth that this hath not
only once been fullfilled, but is dayly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly if this Kingdome of Christ
were sometymes inuisible, God himselfe
(which God forbidde we should say)
were periured, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sweareth that the
<hi>throne</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 88. vel 89.</note> that is to say, his Kingdome

and that <hi>for euer:</hi> but the sunne, and the
perfect, or full moone are very visible pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
easily to be seene of all men, and not
inuisible.</p>
            <p>6. Thirdly the Church of God is that
<hi>Citty</hi> which is situated vpon a most <hi>high
Mountayne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isayae. 2. v. 2. Micheae 4. v. 1. Psal. 47. vel 48. v. 9.</note> yea vpon a <hi>Mountayne</hi> which is

               <note place="margin">S. Aug. Tom. 9. in 1. Epist. S. Ioan. Tract. 2.</note> Christ therefore hath made his

<hi>S. Augustine. VVhat more</hi> (sayth he)

            </p>
            <p>7. Fourthly the same is proued by
the foresaid offices of the Church, for that
Church must necessarily be visible, which

That Church also is visible which

            <p>8. Fifthly, if the visible Church should
once perish, that article of the Greed were
false, I belieue in the Catholik Church, the
communion of Saints. For that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church
which is Catholike or vniuersall, cannot
be inuisible;<note place="margin">Psalm. 88. v. 38.</note> that Church which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

that the holy Scripture doth declare this
by many Parables. Yt may therfore be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18738:11"/>
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our Aduersaries, that there is
not only an inuisible, but also a visible
Church, to wit, wherein the good are
mixed with the bad, which shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
continue till the end of the world.</p>
            <p>10. Seauenthly, it is all one to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the Church to be inuisible and to
affirme that it hath wholy perished, and
that there is no Church at all,<note place="margin">Supra cap. 3.</note> the which
as we haue declared before is most absurd.
For this inuisible Church of our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
can affoard no help to any, seeing
that she is not knowne to any but only
vnto God: according to that saying of
the Apostle, God knoweth who are his.<note place="margin">

For our Aduersaries will haue the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
only to belong vnto this their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible
Church, as we haue now declared,
who are only knowne vnto God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
vnto all others.</p>
            <p>11. Hither also it belongeth, that those
could not be Saints &amp; predestinated who
haue byn for these many ages past in that
inuisible Church of our Aduersaries. For
these (if peraduenture there were any)
neyther durst publikely professe Christ,
nor preach openly the Ghospell, but ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with humane feare, haue done all
thinges by dissimulation and hypocrisy,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>east they might be bewrayed and made

But Christ saith, that he, <hi>that shall be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>

            <p>12. Lastly our Aduersaries being
vrged with so many and inuincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
see well inough, especially the wiser
sort of them, how absurd the doctrine
of their inuisible Church is. And therfore
many of them now adayes acknowledge
the Church of Christ to haue byn alwaies
visible: and moreouer that this visible
Church remayned still in the Popedome,
as they speake. For they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not assigne any

only heere briefly examine the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
arguments, and now a dayes more
vsed by our Aduersaries.</p>
            <p>2. The first argument is taken out
of those words of the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>I am left
alone, and they seeke my lyfe.</hi> I answere that
this argument is of no moment, albeit our
Aduersaries <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> do often vse
it. For <hi>Elias</hi> doth not speake of the whole
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18738:12"/>
Church, but only of the Kingdome of
<hi>Israell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Reg. 19. v. 18.</note> wherein the wicked King <hi>Achab</hi>
then reigned, albeit in it also there were
seauen thousand men who did not adore
<hi>Baal,</hi> and who made a visible Church.
Moreouer at that very time <hi>Iosaphat</hi> a very
pious and goodly King reigned, &amp; there
was also the <hi>temple</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and Priests, and
Sacrifices, as also publike, solemne, and
daily seruice of God: yea out of the second
book of <hi>Paralippomeno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> we gather that King
<hi>Iosaphat</hi> laboured very much to conserue
and increase the honour and worship of
God:<note place="margin">2 Paral. 19. v. 4. &amp; seq.</note> neyther was the number of them
litle, who professed publikely the true
<hi>Religion.</hi> For in the same booke are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
and numbred more then eleauen
hundred thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d strong souldiars, besides
women and others lesse fit for warr;<note place="margin">2. Paral. 17. v. 14. &amp; seq.</note> by
which it appeareth that the Church of
God was not inuisible in <hi>Iosaphats</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but rather very visible and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But <hi>Elias</hi> only complayned of the
Kingdome of <hi>Israel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Reg. 19. v. 10. &amp; 14</note> 
               <hi>they,</hi> to wit, <hi>the children
of Israel,</hi> and not the children of Iuda, <hi>haue
forsaken thy Couenant.</hi> Neyther do we deny
but that in some one or other Kingdome
there might sometymes peraduenture
haue by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> few or no Christians, whils in
farre more places the Church of God was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18738:13"/>
very manyfest and visible. But that the
Church of <hi>Christ</hi> was no where to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
in the whole world, is most absurd and
expresly against the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>3. The second argument is taken
out of many places of <hi>Isay</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieremy,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those Prophets complayne, that all the
Iewes did transgresse the Couenant made
with God. Moreouer they obiect the
small number of those who were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
in the ancient Church before <hi>Christs</hi>
tyme, or euen in <hi>Christs</hi> tyme before the
Gospell was promulgated, and heere they
make many disgressions to <hi>Noë</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi>
himselfe. The very same argument the
<hi>Donatists</hi> also vsed, as the words of Bishop
<hi>Petilian</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>S. Augustine</hi> answereth very well to those
generall complaints of the Prophets, that
the holy Scripture hath a peculiar phrase

all such: and this <hi>S. Augustine</hi> proueth in
the same chapter out of diuers places of
the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>4. Our Aduersaries also who would

but for that which commonly is
wont to be done; as also, <hi>non prosingulis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum,
sedpro generibus singulorum,</hi> the which
not only the <hi>Hebrew Lexicons</hi> written by

that a generall particle is almost in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
leafe of holy Scripture vsed indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.
It is therfore most true which S.
<hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, that this word <hi>(all)</hi> in these

that which was common euery where,

5. The other places which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
alleadge,<note place="margin">S. August. Tom. 2. Epist 48. ad Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> do proue that there are
at sometymes but a few in the Church,
but, they do not proue that the sayd
Church was inuisible. Yea (as <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
disputing against the <hi>Donatists</hi> well
obserueth) when the Church of God is
most vexed with the persecutions of the
wicked, and seemeth to be almost oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <head type="sub">Other arguments of our Aduersaries
against the visible Church are
confuted.</head>
            <p>THE third argument of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
wherby they impugne
the visible Church, is this: the
holy Scripture compareth the
Church to the moone, but the moone
doth often tymes not appeare, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in the new moone, and in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips.
I answere that we must not seeke
for a similitude or likenesse in all thinge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
betwixt the Church and the moone, for
otherwise the Church of Christ should
neyther see, nor vnderstand, nor belieue,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18738:16"/>
and it should be altogeather without life
as the moone is. But in this matter that
similitude or liknesse betwixt the Church
and the moone, is only to be sought out,
in which the Scripture compareth the
Church to the moone; but the Scripture
doth not compare the Church to the
moone as she is a mutable planet, but as
she is beautifull in her selfe.<note place="margin">Cant. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Beautifull</hi> (saith

               <hi>A foole</hi> (saith the
Wisemen) <hi>is changed as the moone.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Church of Christ is not compared
to euery moone,<note place="margin">Isaiae 60. v. 20.</note> but only to the moone,
when she is in her fulnesse &amp; perfection,
yea to the moone which is neuer dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
nor fayleth: he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are those words
of the Prophet <hi>Isar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calu. in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem verba.</note> which <hi>Caluin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
are to be vnderstood of the
Church, <hi>Thy sunne shall neuer more be set, and
thy moone shall not be diminished</hi> (or as <hi>Caluin</hi>

<hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>that the moone is vnder the feete of
the Church,</hi> that therby we may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
that the Church of Christ by the vertue
of the sunne (to wit Christ himselfe,
where withall she is wholy inuested and

matters of faith.<note place="margin">Apoe. 12. v. 1.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:18738:16"/>
2. The fourth argument. Those
thinges which we belieue by faith are
inuisible, but by faith we belieue there is
a Catholike Church, as appeareth by the
Apostles Creed, therefore the Catholike
Church is inuisible and not visible. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
that this is a weake argument,<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Inst. c. 1. sect. 2. in principio.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<hi>Caluin</hi> also vseth it. For if it were not
it would proue that the holy Scripture
were also inuisible, because we belieue
also the holy Scripture by faith, yea it
would also proue euen our Aduersaries
Church to be as yet inuisible, for they as
yet belieue their Church by faith, and
yet they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that their Church is now
visible. And truely if their Church had
remayned still inuisible, they had neuer
caused so many tumults in the Christian
Common-wealth. But certainly euen as
in the holy Scriptures we see one thinge
and belieue another, we see the letters &amp;
characters, the which the <hi>Infidels</hi> also see,
but we belieue that the Scripture is most
true in all thinges, the which they do not
belieue: so we se that the Church of Christ
is extant, the which also the Infidels do
see; for <hi>Turkes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iewes</hi> do very well know
that there is a <hi>Pope,</hi> and that there are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Princes, and Christian Nations,
but we belieue that this Church which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18738:17"/>
we see is an holy Church, is gouerned &amp;
directed by the holy Ghost, and that she
cannot erre in matters of faith, all which
the Infidels do not belieue.</p>
            <p>3. The fifth argument. None is in
the Church but by faith, but faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible,
therfore the Church also inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
I answere that this is a very weake
consequence, for otherwise we might
reason thus; None is a man but by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soule, but the soule of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the vse of reason, is inuisible,
therfore the whole man also is inuisible.
Also, no Scripture is to be accounted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but by the authority of God, but this
authority is inuisible, therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
also is inuisible. For it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
that a thing may be called visible
that the chiefe part or reason thereof be
visible but it sufficeth if any part therof
be visible, as manifestly appeareth in all
visible, substances, for their chiefe partes,
to wit, their substantiall matter and
forme are thinges inuisible.</p>
            <p>4. Secondly I answere that the faith
wherby a man is made a member of the
visible Church is not only an interiour
faith which is not to be seene, but that
which is euidently seene and declared by
exteriour signes; as for example by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18738:17"/>
publikely the said faith, by recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the Sacraments, and such other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
acts. The which is so true, that
this exteriour profession of our faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without the interiour faith, sufficeth
that a man become a member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 3. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seing that otherwise none could be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of his Prelate or Pastour, because
none can see the faith or mind of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other.</p>
            <p>5. Hence also it is, that not only the
predestinate and iust men are members of
the visible Church, but also such as be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

and wicked men who professe

are not predestinate, and those which
do not bring forth any fruit, that is to
say, bad Christians, are in him, that is
to say, in his visible body which is the
Church, the which also almost all our
Aduersaries confesse, as we haue said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth more at large.</p>
            <p>6. The sixt argument our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
deduce out of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 12. v. 6. &amp; 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> wherein
it is said, that a woman inuested with the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18738:18"/>
sunne which signifieth the true Church,
fled into the desert, and remayned there
for the space of 1260. dayes, that is to
say, as our Aduersaries interpret it, a
thousand two hundred and sixty yeares.
Out of which they infer, that the Church
remayned inuisible as it were in the desert
these thousand two hundred and sixty
yeares last past. I answere, that this is a
vitious argument for many reasons. For
first, it is very absurd, to thinke that the
Church of Christ did ly hidden and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible
these thousand two hundred sixty
yeares past. For therupon it would ensue
that the Church of Christ was inuisible
then when it most florished, &amp; was spread
abroad ouer the whole world: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the tymes of <hi>S. Augustine, Ambrose,
Hilary, Athanasius, Hierome, Chrysostome, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril
&amp;c.</hi> Yea in the tyme also of all the
auncient Councels,<note place="margin">Confess. Rupellana Art. 6.</note> the which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
themselues do admit in their
confession of faith. For all these Fathers
and ancient Councells, haue byn within
the space of the forsaid thousand two
hundred and sixty yeares, the which our
Aduersaries do account from Pope <hi>Siluester</hi>
till <hi>Luthers</hi> tyme, wherfore this place of
the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is not to be vnderstood of
yeares, but literally of daies only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18738:18"/>
7. Moreouer it is not certain that by this

place, or such as is depriued of all the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
or comfort of men.<note place="margin">Primasius in cap. 12. Apocal.</note> For <hi>Primasius S.

lyfe. Some others will haue the foresayd
word <hi>(desert)</hi> to signify a departure or
forsaking of all sinnes and vices, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleasures of this world, according to
that saying of the Prophet <hi>Osee. I will carry
and lead her into the desert,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>8. Lastly albeit we should graunt
that this desert were some wyld or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
place, yet neuerthelesse it could not
be gathered thereby, that the Church of
<hi>Christ</hi> eyther was, or euer shalbe inuisible.
For neyther this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which fled into
the wildernesse, signifyeth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whole
Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> but some one famous
Church the which <hi>Antichrist</hi> shal persecute
most of all, because it will strongly oppose
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18738:19"/>
it selfe against his impiety and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And in the end of the forsaid vision
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> playnly affirmeth,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. v. 17.</note> that the <hi>Dragon</hi>
after the deliuery of that woman shall
make warre against the rest of her seede
who keep the commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, and
haue the testimony of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> therfore
besides that woman there willbe some
out of the desert who will publikely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the true faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> against whom
for that cause the Dragon will fight.</p>
            <p>9. But that we may now conclude
this controuersy of the visible Church,
seing that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord came into this
world that he might make open and
knowen the way to eternall sauation not
to one Nation or age only, but inded to
the whole world and all posterity, it is
a very absurd thing to thinke that this
one only way to eternall saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
is the true Church of Christ, remayned
hidden and vnknowen to all Nations for
so many ages past.</p>

that it cannot be denyed, but that the true

by their owne confession, Wherefore to
the end they may still haue some corner
or hole to slip out at, they affirme, that the

&amp; still doth erre in points of faith. Then
the which nothig certainly is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
especially seing that they affirme
that it hath erred not in things of small
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18738:20"/>
moment, but in the principall and chiefest
poynts of fayth, which are playnly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to eternall saluation; yea also that it
hath fallen into manifest <hi>Idolatry.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
that it hath not only fayled &amp; stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
in fayth, &amp; hath publikely taught
many errors against fayth, but hath also
compelled and forced by threats and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
all to Idolatry. And lastly that
it hath donne thus, not only for the
space of one yeare, but for a thousand or
at least 900. yeares. All which how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
they are, we will now declare.</p>
            <p>2. But to the end that all which we
are to say hereafter of this matter may be
the better vnderstood, we must note heere
that when we affirme that the Church
cannot erre in fayth, that by this word
<hi>(fayth)</hi> we vnderstand not only that inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
fayth which is in our mind, but also
visible, that is to say, the publike doctrine
of the whole Church, which is proposed
or set downe to be belieued of all. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we affirme, that the Church
cannot erre in matters of fayth, we affirme
also, that the doctrine or points of fayth,
the which the Church of God setteth
downe as the most certayne and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
word of God, cannot be false, but the
very word of God it selfe, which I will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18738:20"/>
clearly declare by these arguments.</p>
            <p>3. The first argument is deduced out

               </gap> before

            <p>4. The second argument is deduced
out of most cleare testimonyes of holy
Scripture, which teach, that the Church
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre in faith. For first Christ himself
affirmeth,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. v. 18.</note> that <hi>the gates of hell shall not preuaile
against the Church.</hi> But if the Church could
erre in faith, the gates of hell for so many
ages past had preuailed against her.</p>
            <p>5. Moreouer God speaketh thus by
his Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> of the Couenant of the<note place="margin">Isaiae 59. v. vlt.</note>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:18738:21"/>
new Testament. <hi>This is my league with them
saith our Lord, my spirit which is in thee, and my
words which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of thy mouth, &amp; out of the mouth of thy seed,
&amp; out of the mouth of the seeds seed, saith our Lord,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence forth euen to the worlds end.</hi> But in our
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

hath put into the mouth of the Church,
had departed many ages out of her mouth.<note place="margin">1. ad Tim. 3. v. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. Lastly the Apostle affirmeth, that
the Church is the <hi>Pillar and stability of truth.</hi>
But if the Church could erre in faith, and
teach publikely against the word of God,
it should be the <hi>Pillar</hi> rather of falshood
then of truth. Some of our Aduersaries
do a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere vnto this place, that the Church
is called indeed the Pillar of truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it doth not erre when it followeth,
and is agreable vnto the word of God,
yet neuerthelesse it erreth when it disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
from the word of God. But this
is a very friuolous answere. For according
vnto this interpretation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery Church of
<hi>Heretickes,</hi> of <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> yea of the <hi>Diuels</hi>
themselues should be the Pillar of truth.
For none of these erreth, when it is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the word of God. But a Pillar is
that which necessarily and alwaies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
that which it strenghtneth, and
whose pillar it is: wherfore the Church
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18738:21"/>
should not be the Pillar of truth, vnlesse
it alwaies sticke and be ioyned with the
truth and vphould it.<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Inst. c. 2. sect. 1. in fine.</note> 
               <hi>Caluin</hi> therfore
conuinced by the euidency of the truth
writeth, <hi>that if true Church be the Pillar of truth,
it is most certaine that the Kingdome where lyes &amp;
falshood reygneth, cannot be the true Church.</hi>
Thus <hi>Caluin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The third argument is deduced
out of diuers Absurdities which ensue
out of the doctrine of our Aduersaries.
The first adsurdity is, that the Apostles
Creed were false wherin we belieue the
holy Catholike Church. For that Church
cannot be holy which wanteth the true
faith, which teacheth falsities and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
which forceth all men to <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. The second absurdity is, that Christ
himselfe and the holy Ghost should erre
and teach thinges both false and wicked.
For the doctrine of the Church is not so
much the doctrine of the Church as it is
of Christ &amp; of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Luc. 10. v. 16.</note> 
               <hi>VVho heareth,
you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>heareth me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan 14. v. 26.</note> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place;<note place="margin">Act. 15. v. 28.</note> 
               <hi>The Paraclete the holy Ghost whome
my Father will send you in my name, he will teach
you all thinges.</hi> And the Apostles said, <hi>It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good to the holy Ghost, and to vs.</hi> Lastly
God himself by his Prophet speaking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church affirmeth, <hi>that his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18738:22"/>
is in the Church, and that he hath put his words
into the mouth of the Church, which shall neuer
be taken out of her mouth, from henceforth till the
end of the world.</hi> Wherefore if the Church
could erre in the doctrine of faith, Christ
also, the holy Ghost, and God himselfe
should erre.</p>
            <p>9. The third absurdity is, that a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist &amp; stand without a fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
For the sayth of Christ is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Church, if yet, sayth the
Apostle,<note place="margin">ad Collos. 1. v. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> you continue in the sayth groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and stable. And in another place he
teacheth, that the Church is grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the doctrine of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:<note place="margin">ad Ephes. 2. v. 20.</note>
but the foundation being taken
away, the building must needs fall. This
absurdity is so manyfest, that it forced <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi>
to confesse this very truth which now
we teach to be euidently conuinced out
of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> words.<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Instit. c 2. sect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>If,</hi> sayth he, <hi>the doctrine
of the Apostles and Prophets be the foundation of the
Church, take away that doctrine, and how can the
building stand?</hi> Thus <hi>Caluin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. The fourth absurditie is, that
the true Church should consist and be
without her prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and essentiall forme,
no otherwise then if one should say, that
a true and liuing man might consist and
be without his soule. For the true fayth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18738:22"/>
and the true preaching thereof, are as it
were the essentiall formes of the Church.<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 2. sect 11.</note>
               <hi>Caluin</hi> also acknowledgeth this absurdity
when he writeth, that the fayth of the
Church being taken away, there must
needes follow the vtter ouerthrow of
religion, euen as the life of man is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
and taken away, if he be stabbed
with a dagger, or deadly wounded at the
hart.</p>
            <p>11. The fourth argument is deduced
out of the manifest contradictions which
follow of the contrary doctrine. For they
who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the true church of Christ
doth erre in fayth, do not indeed know
what they say: for that is the only true
Church of <hi>Christ</hi> which retayneth and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
still the name, &amp; the sincere fayth of
<hi>Christ;</hi> but that is the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Church of <hi>Christ</hi>
which only professeth the name of <hi>Christ</hi>
but erreth in fayth. Wherefore to say that
the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> erreth in fayth, is all
one, as to say, that the true Church is not
the true Church, but the false, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
a contradiction.</p>
            <p>12. The fift argument is deduced
out of those things which our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
do graunt vnto vs.<note place="margin">Infra. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 18. huius Controu.</note> For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
doctrine of our Aduersaries is, as we
will shew hereafter, that the sincere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18738:23"/>
of the word of God, and lawfull
administration of Sacraments, are the
markes and signes of the true Church,
without which it cannot consist: therfore
it necessarily followeth, that they must
also admit that the true Church cannot
erre in fayth, and in the true preaching of
the word of God. For that Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
sincerely preach the word of God who

true preaching therof.<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Inst. cap. 2. sect. 1. &amp; cap. 8. sect. 12. &amp; 13.</note> 
               <hi>Caluin</hi> also out of
diuers places of Scripture doth proue that
it is a false Church and not a true which

            <p>13. Our Aduersaries heape togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a great many of arguments, but they
are such as may easily be answered. For
wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide it. Many of them when they
manifestly see, that it is impossible that
the true Church can consist or be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith, they craftily feygne that the
Controuersy betwixt vs is not of this
matter,<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Inst. cap. 2. sect. 1.</note> but of some other far different,
that is to say, of that vvhereof none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doubteth: so dealeth <hi>Caluin</hi> with vs.
For when he had confessed that to be the
false Church and not the true which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in principall poynts of fayth, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that the true Church cannot
erre herein, as out of his owne words we
haue already declared, at the last he feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that the controuersy in this matter
is not whether the Church can erre or no,
but whether she may erre, if she take not
for her companion the word of God;<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 8. sect. 13. &amp; 15.</note>
and that we affirme, that whatsoeuer she
shall decree eyther without or besids the
word of God, that the same is to be
accounted as a most certayne oracle of
God. But that he and his affirme, that
therefore the Church cannot erre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it permitteth it selfe to be directed
and gouerned by the sayd word of God,
and because it teacheth nothing but out
of the word of God. But this is a meere

the controuersy betwixt vs and our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
that they acknowledg only the

the true word of God: but we not only
acknowledge the written word,<note place="margin">Supra Controu. 1. c. 25. &amp; sequent.</note> but also

vnto vs by Christ and his Apostles:

and to obscure and darken most cleare
&amp; perspicuous matters: wheras notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in very truth they can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

that such a Church may erre. But as this
is a false &amp; not the true Church of Christ;
so of it, is not this present Controuersy,
but only of the true and pure Church of

            <p>15. Others distinguish the Church
into visible and inuisible, and they say,
that the inuisible Church cannot erre, but
the visible may erre.<note place="margin">Supra h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>19. But they labour in vayne. For
if these kinds of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were good they
would also proue that the Church it selfe
also wholy perished; and was not to be
found in any place, as in tymes past the
<hi>Donatists</hi> contended, the which euen our
Aduersaries themselues acknowledge to
by very absurd, and against the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
as hath beene declared before. For
if all haue lost their fayth, then indeed the
true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church could no longer be, which
without fayth cannot consist: and thus
the whole Church had perished.</p>
            <p>20. But that which they affirme of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
and <hi>Eue,</hi> to wit, that they lost their fayth
by sinning, is of no moment at all. For
to omit that they do not so much proue

then that after their sinne there remayned
neyther any fayth, nor Church in the

this belongeth nothing to this disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">That there is no lawfull calling of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
or Pastours of the Church, but
by the visible Church.</head>
            <p>ONE of the offices of the true
Church is to appoint lawfull
preachers of the Ghospell and
true administers of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But because there is no small
Controuersy now a dayes concerning
this office, we will briefely dispatch
it. But to the end that which is in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy
may the better be vnderstood,
heere are three thinges to be determined.
First, that the calling of God is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
required, to the end one may become
a lawfull preacher, or administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.<note place="margin">Ad Rom. 10. v. 15. Ad Hebr. 3. v. 4. &amp; 5.</note>
For those words of the Apostle
are very cleare and manifest. <hi>How shall they
preach, vnlesse they be sent?</hi> And againe. <hi>Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth any man take the honour to himselfe, but
he that is called of God, as</hi> Aaron. <hi>So Christ also
did not glorify himselfe, that he might be made a
high Priest but he that spake to him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 2. v. 7.</note> 
               <hi>My sonne art
thou</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore he who without this
lawfull calling and mission dareth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18738:28"/>
to intrude himself to meddle with
these diuine offices, preferreth himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ our Lord. For Christ came not
to these offices, but called and sent by his
eternall Father. Lastly if in humane and
wordly matters none dare meddle with
the affaires or busynes of a Prince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his licence and consent, much lesse
must any deale with these supernaturall
and diuine offices, vnlesse he be called
and sent for that purpose by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>2. The second is, that there are two
kinds of callings by God, the one extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
the other ordinary. The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
calling is when God immediatly
by himselfe calleth any, &amp; in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner
God called <hi>Moyses,</hi> &amp; the other Prophets, &amp;
Christ called his Apostles. This is called
<hi>extraordinary,</hi> because it seldome hapneth.
It is tearmed also an immediate vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
because it is done immediatly by God
himselfe. The ordinary vocation is that
which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth alwaies in the Church
and is done immediatly by the Pastors of
the Church, and of God only by their
meanes. Hereupon also this is called a
mediate vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit in respect of God.
This diuision is taken out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
writeth himselfe to be an Apostle, <hi>not of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18738:28"/>
men, neyther by man, but by Iesus Christ, and God
the Father.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ad Gal. 1. v. 1.</note> For by these wordes he sheweth
that some which are in the Church are
called to the diuine offices by me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and
some by God himselfe.</p>
            <p>3. The third is, that those who are
taken to Ecclesiasticall offices by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vocation they receyue their calling
and authority from the Church. For this
ordinary vocation is not done but by the
ministers of the Church. But the whole
Controuersy is of the extraordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
For those who in this age haue
brought in new opinions, seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
destitute of the ordinary vocation,
they fly vnto the extraordinary, the
which, say they, must not be subiect to
the censure, and approbation of the
Church, wherof they know themselues
to be destitute. But we of the other side
affirme, that the extraordinary vocation
also must necessarily be confirmed and
approued by such as haue ordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Church of God. And we
know very well, that our Aduersaries
haue not truly this extraordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as afterward we will declare more
at large. But suppose we graunt them to
haue this extraordinary calling, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
by these ensuing arguments we will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18738:29"/>
manifestly proue, that it must needs be
confirmed and approued by those who
haue their ordinary vocation in the
Church of God.</p>
            <p>4. The first argument.<note place="margin">Ad Galat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. v. 1.</note> 
               <hi>S. Paul</hi> was
immediatly and extraordinarily called by
God, as he writeth himselfe, and yet he
was sent to <hi>Anainas</hi> who had the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vocation,<note place="margin">Act. 9. v. 7.</note> that by him he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and baptized. And afterwards
together with <hi>S. Barnabas</hi> he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the imposition of hands by those
who were the ordinary Pastors of the
Church.<note place="margin">Act. 13. v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Lastly he writeth, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the reuelation which he had,<note place="margin">v. 1. &amp; 2.</note> he
went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>conferred the Gospell
which he preached,</hi> with the visible Church
and ordinary Pastors of the same, least he
might seeme <hi>to haue runne, or laboured in vaine:</hi>
they therefore who refuse the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the visible Church, albeit they
be neuer so extraordinarily called ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
they doe but labour in vayne.</p>
            <p>5. The second argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st
not easily beleeue euery one who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
himselfe to be extraordinarily sent
by God,<note place="margin">v. Ioan. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 1.</note> according to that admonition
of <hi>S. Iohn. Belieue not euery spirit, but proue the
spirits whether they be of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because many false
Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> But this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18738:29"/>
proofe or triall cannot be better done
then by Christs Church, which, is as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. ad Tim. 3. v. 15.</note> the <hi>pillar, and ground of truth.</hi>
The which also S. <hi>Iohn</hi> clearly sheweth
by the words following, when he sayth,
<hi>he that knoweth God heareth vs, he that is not of
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioan. 4. v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>heareth vs not: in this we know the spirit of
truth, and the spirit of error.</hi> It is therefore a
most certayne rule whereby this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
vocation is examined, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
whether it will submit it selfe
to the approbation of the visible Church,
and will heare her or no? For he who
heareth the Church, hath the spirit of
truth, and the true extraordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but he who will not heare the
Church, hath the spirit of error and the
false extraordinary vocation.</p>
            <p>6. The third argument. The holy
Ghost neuer contradicteth himselfe, for
otherwise (which God forbid) he should
not be the spirit of truth, but of falshood
for truth is neuer repugnant to truth but
to falshood: seeing that therfore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that the ordinary vocation is from
the holy Ghost, that extraordinary can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be opposit vnto it which is truly
from the holy Ghost. For otherwise God
should be opposit vnto himselfe, which
were impiety to thinke; wherfore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18738:30"/>
followeth, that the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vocation must agree with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and be subiect vnto it, as also
it must establish and confirme, but not
impugne it.<note place="margin">1. ad Cor. 14. v. 32.</note> Hereupon sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>the spirits of the Prophets are subiect to the
Prophets:</hi> if they be subiect to the Prophets,
much more to the whole Church of
Christ.</p>
            <p>7. The fourth argument. There
would arise a greate confusion in the
Church of God, if euery one were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to preach and administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
that should affirme himselfe
to be extraordinarily called without any
other examine or approbation of the
Church. For so euery phantasticall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
might freely bragge and affirme
himselfe to be extraordinarily called by
God. And vnder that pretence and title
might preach, administer the Sacraments
and exercise all other Ecclesiasticall
offices.<note place="margin">Calu. l. 4. Inst. cap. 3. sect. 14. Beza c. 5. suae confess.</note>
            </p>
            <p>8. By these arguments some more
learned amongst our Aduersaries being
conuinced, do acknowledge, that all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
vocation should be examined
and approued by the ordinary Pastors of
<hi>Christs</hi> Church.<note place="margin">Artic. 28. Bulling. decad. 5. Serm. 4.</note> But they adde moreouer
that this is true when the Church it selfe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18738:30"/>
followeth the word of God, and as long
as the ordinary vocation remaineth in
her. But in vayne do they adde these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,<note place="margin">Supra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c. prcedent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Ephes. 4. v. 12. &amp; 13.</note>
because we haue already proued
that the true Church alwayes followeth
the word of God, nor can departe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
in any sort from it. For otherwise
she were not the true Church of God, but
the Sinagogue of Satan. And the Apostle
also expresly saith, that the ordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Pastors &amp; their continuall successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shall remayne alwayes in the Church of
God vntill we meete all with Christ in
the end of the world.<note place="margin">Calu. &amp; Beza in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of the Apostle <hi>Caluin</hi> also and <hi>Beza</hi> being
conuinced do confesse, that there must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
be Pastors and Doctors in the
Church of God, and that the said Church
cannot consist without them. The same
also their confession made at <hi>Rochell</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
in the 25. article.</p>
            <p>9. Some of our Aduersaries doe
heere obiect vnto vs the example of Christ
and his Apostles, for, say they, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was neuer approued by the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Church of the Iewes, whereas notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it was extraordinary. But this
is a very friuolous and odious compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Christ and his Apostles with their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
For it was expressely foretould

by the Prophets that Christ was to abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was to ordayne another more excellent
and spirituall, the which he effected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Wherefore seing that now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
had another farre more excellent

no reason they should aske any vocation
from <hi>Moyses.</hi> But we read no where that
the vocation ordayned by Christ was
to be abrogated by any other whosoeuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they will bring in, and establish another
