         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which Letter the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58863:3"/>
hath taken occasion to vent and vomit
forth more <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>bitter prejudice</hi> against
the despised witnesses of the Lord (called
<hi>Quakers)</hi> then ever the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>
did against our Lord Jesus Christ, when he
was among them, in his bodily appearance,
I have judged fit to desire all sober People,
that professe the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> and
have any knowledge of us, or our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that they would seriously consider, if
we or our principles deserve such characters,
as this man hath put upon us; seing we are
known to many to be an innocent, harmlesse
and blamelesse people in all our behaviour
and conversation, makeing conscience of our
duty towards God in purity of worship and
tenderness of owning the same, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any threats, punishments, fines
or imprisonments for our faithfulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and our real endeavours to obey all
his holy commands, in which we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
decline to be tryed by the testimony of
the holy and precious Scripturs of Truth.
Nor are we less known to all neighbours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and acquaintances, to be just and
<pb facs="tcp:58863:3"/>
righteous in our dealings towards men.</p>
            <p>Next as to our <hi>principles,</hi> they are so often
and upon so many different occasions holden
forth to the world in all places, where we
live; that none can pretend ignorance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
unless it be wilfull. Wherefore I shall not
enter upon this here, being unsutable to a
<hi>Preface,</hi> and that so many of our Friends,
both in our own Nation and in <hi>England,</hi> have
performed this task<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in clearing them
from all the malicious and grosse mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations,
which opposers have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to asperse them with, so that none
needs remaine ignorant of them, but such as
love to continue so, through wilfull preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
or lazyness at least.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when I perceive from what a
height of malice and spleen this <hi>Author</hi> has
vented himself against us, by which any
may see that the <hi>Iewes, Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi>
had never more against Christians, nor the
<hi>malice</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> of the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Popish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> was ever greater
against dissenters from them, whom they
judged <hi>Hereticks;</hi> I cannot in the least
<pb facs="tcp:58863:4"/>
doubt, but, if this man had power to influence
the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> to exercise his power
against us, he would not onely parallel
the cruelty of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> but equal,
if not exceed, the <hi>inquisition</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> yea
those <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>bloody persecuters</hi> in <hi>New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
who cutt off the ears, scourged and
tormented severall of our Friends, till their
flesh was like a Gelly, banished divers, and
hanged three men, and a woman, 1659,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>660. for no other cause, but this very thing,
that they owned the Testimony of that
<hi>Truth</hi> which we profess, and for which we
are sufferers this day: which may serve ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undantly
to scare any sober people, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to owne the meek and lowly Spirit of
Jesus, yea to cause them to abhorre to keep
company, or converse with men of such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
And if any have not yet seen the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to all Civil Interests, that flowes from
<hi>persecution</hi> for <hi>Conscience,</hi> I shall referr them
to the severall books, that have been publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
thereanent in this age.</p>
            <p>But when I consider the great rage, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in this man, and many of his brethren
<pb facs="tcp:58863:4"/>
against us, I can not impute it to any thing
like zeal for the interest of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as
they would willingly have people believe,
it being to me most cleare, that their chief
quarrel is, becaus, we, of all the people that
ever appeared, are they that have most disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their pride, ambition, greedynesse and
cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ousness, malice and the rest of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
we asserting, and they denying <hi>Immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Revelation,</hi> or that God <hi>by his Spirit hath any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
converse with the Souls and hearts of his
people,</hi> by which he doth most clearely make
known his will to them, and gives the
most effectuall call to the <hi>Ministry,</hi> which
they have put mostly into the hands of men,
and made to depend upon an <hi>humane ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Yea some of them derive a <hi>succession</hi> from
the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> and hence practically
claime a power to be <hi>Lords</hi> over the faith of
Gods people, imposing their glosses on the
<hi>Scripture</hi> to be no lesse believed then the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it self, and so all that are not of their
perswasion, must be <hi>hereticall</hi> and <hi>heterodoxe,</hi>
though they lay no claime to be led by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58863:5"/>
Again: The Lord hath brought us to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
the <hi>spirituality of worship,</hi> in preaching,
praying and praising, knowing that God will
accept of none but what flowes immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Life of his own <hi>Spirit, moving in
the heart:</hi> whereas this man and his brethren
are for performing all those dutys, whether
they have this <hi>immediate assistance of Gods holy
Spirit,</hi> or not. For they have learned by art to
supply that defect with their natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
parts, else many times they would
sit silent in their pulpits; whereas now they
have layd and do lay a necessity upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their followers to goe about those
dutys at their appoynted times, whatever
be their temper or condition at the present.
And according to our principle, other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
them, may performe these dutys in
publick, as they find themselves moved and
<hi>furnished by the Lord,</hi> whereby their trade and
traffick in the matters of the Worship of
God, would readily be quite spoyled, and
they be necessitated to betake themselves to
other callings to gaine a livelyhood to
themselves and familys, seing there would
<pb facs="tcp:58863:5"/>
be no use for studyed sermons and their rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall
conn'd discourses, by which they
have laboured to tickle the ears and please
the fancys of their hearers, and have done
all, their art or eloquence could, to reach
the natural affections of people. But
now the <hi>Lords chosen people</hi> that are taught by
the true Shepherd Jesus Christ, have learned
to know his voyce, from the voyce of a
stranger, and to feel more of the true Life
of Jesus Christ, raised up in their hearts, by a
few words spoken from that Life, though it
be but in a homely way, by a Trades-man,
or a poor handmaid, then ever they sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
felt by the most eloquent and meer
<hi>artificial Preachers,</hi> that are strangers to this
Life: and therefore it is but little wonder,
though these men stretch forth, and employ
the most of their Rhetorick and parts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
against us both in pulpit and print. For
they homologate that word, which <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smus</hi>
spake concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> that <hi>it was a
hardtask he had taken in hand, seing the Popes

it is with the Lords Witnesses in this day,
<pb facs="tcp:58863:6"/>
their work would be easier in promoting
the true Reformation of Gods worship and
people, if the pride &amp; greedyness of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> their esteeme with, &amp; power over the
people, their <hi>stipends</hi> &amp; <hi>set rents</hi> were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
for they walk no further by <hi>Scripture
rule</hi> (though they call it their <hi>onely rule)</hi> then
the Scripturs do stand with their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests.
Hence though there be no warrand to
admitt of any to be members of the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> but true Believers, that know upon
what ground they owne the Christian Faith,
yet they will have all the Subjects of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(whether they have any evidence of
Faith, or not) to be members of their
<hi>Church,</hi> that their power may be of as large
extent, as that of the <hi>Civil Magistrate:</hi> yea
without any Scripture warrant, they take <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to be members, by sprinkling them:</hi> &amp; though
they have no better warrand, for joyning
men and women in <hi>marriage</hi> together, then
a <hi>Popish Canon;</hi> yet such is their love to have
a hand <hi>in all the concernments of the people,</hi> that
they must needs be the instruments, against
which, with many more of this nature, we
<pb facs="tcp:58863:6"/>
beare our <hi>Testimony,</hi> and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they rage so much against us.</p>
            <p>Now there being <hi>no formall charge</hi> in all the
said <hi>bitter postscript,</hi> set down <hi>against us;</hi> but that
false one, that we <hi>put a false Christ in stead of the
true Iesus, deny Christ to be the second Person of the
Trinity, &amp; Iesus the son of Mary to be the true Christ
alone,</hi> &amp;c. as he goes on in that pag 553. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proof, it shall here suffice to say (those
things being so fully answered in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Treatise,</hi> and also in other books of our
Friends) <hi>The Lord knoweth we are shamelesly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
&amp; slaundered in this matter, as in most of
other things charged upon us, by our adversarys,</hi>
and it can not be but strange to me, that any
who pretend to be <hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
should be so <hi>impudent,</hi> or otherwise so
<hi>grossely ignorant</hi> (if not <hi>malicious)</hi> in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnys,
seing it hath so often been published
both by word and writ, and in print that <hi>we
owne no other Saviour, but Iesus Christ borne of the
Virgin Mary and crucifyed at Ierusalem, and that
the Lords People never had, have or ever shall
have remission of sins, but through the meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s and
vertue of that precious blood and sufferings, which
<pb facs="tcp:58863:7"/>
our Lord Iesus</hi> the <hi>Onely begotten Son of God</hi> did
undergoe and shed at Jerusalem, that <hi>He is
true God and Man,</hi> yea what ever the holy
Scripturs of Truth do witness concerning
him that we dearely owne with our souls
and hearts, avouching with a firme faith,
that the same Christ hath given a measure of
<hi>Light to every man,</hi> Joh. 1: 9. Tit. 2: 11. which
is of a Divine, Supernatural, Substantial
being; <hi>a beame and ray of his Blessed Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
the <hi>world of sin and duty, sufficient to bring
all men to Salvation, being joyned unto, and</hi> rightly
<hi>improven,</hi> according to the testimony of many
places of holy Scripture, which call him <hi>the
Light of the world,</hi> and <hi>a Light to inlighten the
Gentiles, the true Light</hi> that enlightens <hi>every
man that cometh into the world;</hi> and that the
<hi>Grace of God that brings Salvation hath appeared
unto all men, teaching us that denying ungodlynesse
and worldly lusts,</hi> &amp;c. This is the free Gift
which Christ hath purchased, <hi>Rom. 5: 18.</hi>
and therefore ought to be taken heed to, and
believed in, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 12: 36. For Christ is
given to be a <hi>Leader</hi> to his people, and hath
promised to be with them to the end of the
<pb facs="tcp:58863:7"/>
world, and this is by <hi>his spirituall and inward
appearance in the Hearts of men.</hi> And, becaus
we beare our Testimony to this appearance
of Christ <hi>in us,</hi> shall we be therefore thus
<hi>malitiously traduced</hi> by such <hi>prejudicated men?</hi> I
shall wish no worse to him, or them, but <hi>the
Lord forgive them, and open their eyes;</hi> seing I
know some that have been little inferiour to
them in prejudice, in a day, to whom God
<hi>hath shewed mercy,</hi> and therefore my bowels
are moved for such.</p>
            <p>This man also <hi>chargeth us,</hi> that we <hi>are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
enemys to none, then to the faithfull Ministers
and eminent labourers in the Gospel,</hi> as he doth
expatiate at large in the beginning of that
page 556 in the <hi>Postscript.</hi> To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
(passing by his <hi>ungodly and unchristian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and Epithetes)</hi> that <hi>we have ever had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
esteeme of all faithfull ministers, that in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and sincerity of Heart have endeavoured to
preach the Gospel;</hi> though in many things short
of these blessed discoverys God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to us, and we do remember them,
that were such, with that due respect, that
becomes, as having been faithfull according
<pb facs="tcp:58863:8"/>
to their measure in their day, and were
blessed to be instruments in Gods hand to
the good of many, that in singlness and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of heart, did heare them. But it is
not the duty of any Christian to stand still,
and shut out any further discovery then they
attained unto: for as all the degrees of the
<hi>Apostasy</hi> came not at once, nor with the first
or second <hi>trumpet,</hi> Rev. 8. so neither is the
<hi>Reformation</hi> to be compleated by the first or
second <hi>vial,</hi> Rev. 16. And therefore though
they <hi>studyed Sermons,</hi> yet many of them at
times spake, as the Lord gave it them: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> who told the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
when she was threatning him (as
<hi>Alexander Petry,</hi> in his <hi>History of the Kirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
sheweth, Pag. 236.) that <hi>in the preaching place
he was not master of his own tongue, but</hi> behoved
<hi>to speak as God commmanded him,</hi> &amp;c. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good men, after the <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
could be instanced, who have born te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against <hi>studyed sermons,</hi> and <hi>leaning
to their Notes,</hi> and <hi>limiting the Holy Spirit.</hi> I
shall for this give but one clear instance,
amongst the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> for all. <hi>Franciscus

their whole sermon, and when they are in their
pulpits, pray that the Lord would order or direct
their tongues, but in the mean time shutting up the
way to the Holy Spirit, determine to say nothing
but that which they have written. O unhappy
kind of Preachers! yea really accursed, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

not upon the Spirit of God. Thou false prophet, why
prayest thou to the Lord, that he would give thee his

and yet in the mean time rejectest the Spirit,
why preferrest thou thy meditation, or study to the

But seing God has promised a compleat
deliverance from <hi>Babylon</hi> and all Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
idolatry and superstition, it is sad,
that they, who profess to pray for it,
and expect it, should oppose it, because
it comes not in that way and manner, as
they desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it. Thus that in <hi>Isay</hi> 53: 1,
2, 3. which was spoken of Christs coming
in the flesh outwardly, is fulfilled at this
time in his inward appearance, for it is
said, <hi>He shall grow up before him as a tender
Plant and Root out of a dry ground, having no
forme nor comeliness, when we shall see him,
there is no beauty that we should desire him. He
is despised and rejected of men,</hi> &amp;c. Because
the discoverys of the Truths of God, which
he hath revealed to these <hi>despised people,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Quakers,</hi> are not come out with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which a General Assembly, &amp;c.
had, and they are a ridiculous people in
the carnal eye, therefore they are all stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized
by the wisdom of this world, as
blasphemys and heresys, and so can not be
received by many, who have been educated
and brought up other wayes, even as Christ
<pb facs="tcp:58863:10"/>
said, <hi>Luk</hi> 5: 39. <hi>No man having drunk old wine
straightway desireth new, for he saith the old is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
And as upon this account many rejected
Christ and his doctrine, that were educated
under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> ceremonys; so many now
adays reject us and our testimony, because
we are not a people in power and authority
in this world, and bring new things, as to the
worlds observation, which agree not with
their education: and it is upon this account
and the like, that we have been misrepresent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by many, as the most odious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
people, that ever appeared. But God
will vindicat his own truth in his own good
time, and wipe away our reproach, and get
us praise and fame in every land, where we
have been shamefully used, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3: 19. and
in the living hope and expectation of the
Lords glorious and gracious appearance for
us, we are content to suffer, and beare the
most ignominious and disgracefull epithets
and characters, this Author with many of
his brethren hath put upon us, such as his

the first sight of this <hi>Postscript,</hi> which was

if <hi>G. K.</hi> in this following Answer hath
dealth more plainly then will be pleasing to
the Author of this Postscript, for which
he may blame himself (for the Truth of

these, that are not byassed with prejudice

with prejudice, what their tohughts
will be, I shall leave them to the Lord, for, as
one saith, <hi>Periit judicium, ubires transiit in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi>
where the affection is forestalled, the
judgment will never be just. but I wish all
may be so charitable to their own Souls, as to
make an impartial and diligent search after
Truth, and not relie upon the testimony of
man, especially of that kind of men that any
have in most of their controversys against
us, been found such gross and palpable
slaunderers and calumniators, that it may
seeme strange, that ever such impostors
should be any more hearkened unto, when
they have been so often discovered in their
bold and impudent lyes, even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of many, that are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all that comes from them as Truth.
But the cause is the Lords, and in his good
time he will vindicat his people, and his
own Truth, no less now, then in former
ages. Blessed are they that are not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

their sincerity, and <hi>tenderness</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> in
making that separation, such as it was, did reward
them with a further discovery and sight of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
truths formerly hid from them, which though
this <hi>Author</hi> calls <hi>strong delusions,</hi> we know are <hi>no

from <hi>Presbytery,</hi> so called, how is it that so few of
that separation, I mean of them called <hi>Independents,</hi>
have joyned with the way of Quakerism in <hi>England,</hi>
but have been so great persecuters of it, that in new
<hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Independents</hi> [being gone from their

it that so many in this <hi>Nation,</hi> are become <hi>Quakers</hi>

out of the Presbyterian way, came to be Quakers?
and some, who were once of the <hi>Episcopall</hi> way left
it, and became <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and afterward <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?</hi>

                  </gap>eparation from Episcopacy to Presbytery was
such a hainous sin, that it provoked the Lord at last to
give them up to the strong delusions of the Quakers?
I am sure the Episcopall men have as good reason to
make such a conclusion against the Presbyterians on
this bare account of <hi>separation:</hi> yea and the Papists
against Protestants, for some, who are now Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
were once Papists, and afterwards became
presbyterians, befor they became Quakers. Have
the Papists therfor just ground to conclude, that
the separation of those persons from Popery to
Presbytery, was the sin that provoked God to give
them up to the strong delusions of Quakerism? I

of Prophecy, in the same sense, as any of the
Prophets, who were Pen-men of the holy Scripturs,
for what higher elogies could be given to any of the
most eminent Prophets, then these here and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
given by him to this Author? And here I
shall set down some other expressions parallel to
these in the <hi>Postscript,</hi> or rather surmounting them,
to be found in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> whether
one man hath writ that <hi>Epist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is <hi>not materiall</hi> to inquire, seing doubtless
they are both of one profession, if differing persons,
and he that writes the Postscript, ownes the Epistle
to the Reader. In the beginning of that Epistle, he
tells us, <hi>Considering how little need Master Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
[as he calls him] <hi>his Letters have of any mans
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58863:15"/>
Epistle commendatory, his great Master, whom he
served with his Spirit in the Gospell of his Son, having
given them one, written by his own hand on the hearts of
every one, who is become his Epistle,</hi> &amp;c. This is the
very same commendation, that the Spirit of God
giveth to <hi>Paul,</hi> who was <hi>not behind the chiefest of the
Apostles,</hi> as you may read, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3: 1, 2 verses.
And indeed this is the greatest ground why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripturs to be divinely inspired, becaus the
inward Testimony of the Spirit of God, which is the
Epistle commendatory written by Gods own hand,
upon the hearts of believers, is the Seal of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto the <hi>Scripturs,</hi> as being divinely inspired
And seing GOD doth give the same Seal, as this
writer plainly affirmeth, to <hi>S. R.</hi> his Epistles, that he
doth to the Epistles of <hi>Paul:</hi> will it not prove that <hi>S.
R.</hi> his Epistles are as really divinely inspired, as <hi>Paul's</hi>
Epistles were, and then why may not <hi>S. R.</hi> his Epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
be put into the <hi>Bible,</hi> with Paul's Epistles?
This question is the more pertinently put to this
man, and these of his profession, becaus they do so
argue against us, the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that if
any of our words or writings be divinley inspired, then
we equal our writings to the Scripturs. For this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fall upon their heads, as upon ours, and if they do still

of this book, thus, <hi>as being a piece</hi> (the holy
Scripturs being set aside) <hi>equall to any the world hath
yet seen, or this day can shew, in respect of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alness
of it.</hi> A friendly testimony indeed! I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Presbyterians had wont to commend <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's

to the Scripturs, according to these Latine verses,

he had met with, next to the Scripturs and <hi>Augustin,</hi>
and teaching more sound Divinity, then all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
in <hi>Germany</hi> or any where else in that time, and
he wrot an Epistle commendatory of it, which is
prefixed to it in some Editions, a printed coppy
whereof is by me, but of all this mans commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
this is the most high and admirable, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in his Epistle aforesaid, where he saith, <hi>So
that in respect of us, this Angel of the Church speaks,
as one standing already in the quire of Angels, or as an
Angel come down from heaven among men, to give us
some account of what they are doing above.</hi> These
words import not onely <hi>immediat new revelations,</hi>
(I do not say, <hi>of new Evangelicall Truths, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Scripturs,</hi> for I acknowledg none such)
but also great abundance of them. And yet if we
will believe the Presbyterian <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi>
published by the <hi>assembly at Westminster,</hi> where
<hi>S. R.</hi> himself was a Member, <q>
                     <hi>Those former
wayes of Gods revealing his will unto his people
are now ceased,</hi>
                  </q> see <hi>Chap. 1. sect.</hi> 1. And sect. 6.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58863:17"/>
                  <hi>They exclude all new revelations of the Spirit,</hi> and
they tell us, <hi>the whole counsell of God concerning all
things necessary for his own glory, mans salvation,
faith and life, are set down in Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And amongst other Scripture Testimonyes they
abuse, to favour this corrupt doctrin, they cite Heb.
1. 1, 2. <hi>God who at sundry times and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
spake in times past unto the Fathers by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son,
&amp;c.</hi> And their scope in this place, is to prove from
these words, <hi>that there are no prophets,</hi> that is to say,
<hi>no men divinely inspired or immediatly taught of God
in our days,</hi> but I have shewed in my book of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
Revelation,</hi> that this Scriptur doth not prove
that <hi>prophecy or prophets</hi> (that is to say, <hi>men divinely
inspired, who preach and teach by divine inspiration,
and as they are moved of the holy Ghost) are ceased in
our days, more then in the days of the Apostles.</hi> For
if it could prove such a dispensation to be ceased
now, it would prove it to be ceased then, even in the
days of the Apostles, and that the Epistle to the
Hebrews was not divinely inspired, which is absurd,
yea this Scripture rather proveth mor clear revelation
then formerly under the <hi>Law,</hi> God <hi>now speaking to

that this place doth prove that <hi>Prophets are ceased,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58863:17"/>

that the truths of the Gospell have been immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

we need to have the same truths of the Gospell,

            <argument>
               <p>1. Presbyterian Teachers assume the title of <hi>Master,</hi>
and yet give it not to the <hi>Apostles. 2. S. R.</hi> his
alledged prophecy against those in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> who
seperat from the Nationall Presbyterian Church,
of no Weight. 3. Divers remarkable <hi>instances</hi> of
<hi>S. R.</hi> his declining from that good condition, he
was once in, and also from his own principles.
4. <hi>S. R.</hi> His Prophecy inconsistent with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
doctrin of <hi>once in grace and ever in grace.</hi>
5. As also with his own judgment that some <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi>
were <hi>gracious men.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>But whereas this Writer threatens us with a
prophecy of this great <hi>Seer</hi> (whom he cals
master <hi>Rutherford,</hi>) [but why should he call
him <hi>Master Rutherford,</hi> seing that I can not
find that he, or his Brethren gave this title of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
to any of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or <hi>Apostles?</hi> I wonder
wherefore they are so angry at the title of <hi>Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
and yet so allow the title of <hi>Mr.</hi> unto their
own teachers, seing Christ did as expressly forbid
the one, as the other.] 2. Let us examin what Weight
is in that alledged prophecy, he told them who
had gone from the Presbyterian way towards the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
they would not stand or remain there, and
this, saith this Post-scribe, is fullfilled, for they are</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58863:22"/>
now to joyne with the people called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
But if this be any <hi>prophecy,</hi> it may be such an
one, as to this particular, as was that of <hi>Cajaphas the
high priest,</hi> who said, it was <hi>expedient that one should
dye for the people:</hi> but he understood not his own
prophecy, so nor hath <hi>S. R.</hi> for he meant, that they
would goe into more errors, whereas the truth is,
they onely were advanced further into more clear
discoveryes of <hi>Truth,</hi> supposed by him and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to be <hi>errors;</hi> and that <hi>S. R.</hi> as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
was as blind and dark as <hi>Cajaphas</hi> was, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ, I have not the least question, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if we will consider the particular time wherein
<hi>S. R.</hi> wrot this <hi>Epistle</hi> to these well meaning people
in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> it will much help to clear it unto the
impartial, how much he was then in the dark him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Know therefor Reader, that when <hi>S. R.</hi> wrot this
Epistle to them in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> it was not in the time
that he had these fresh and lively enjoyments of
Gods presence, and power, which he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his more pure times, wherein he both expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
and declared of <hi>Immediat Revelation</hi>
and the <hi>Spirits immediat teachings,</hi> as his Epistles
abundantly witnesse, and as I intend to show in its
proper place, but it was after he had in a manner
altogether lost those blessed injoyments, and was
become exceeding dark, and barren, which thing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay plainly appear by the straine of his Epistles,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58863:23"/>
writt in his later years, which to him, that hath the <hi>true
Spirituall discerning,</hi> and can savour words, as the
mouth savours meat, do as farr come short and faill
(as in respect of life) of his Epistles he wrote in his best
times, as a dark night falls short of a bright day,
or as a cold Winter of a warm and fruitfull
Summer.</p>
            <p>But let us hear himself, giving an account, of his
inward condition, in his later times, in the 2. part
of his Epistles, Ep. 49. he saith, <hi>but I am at a low
ebbe, as to any sensible communion with Christ, yea
as low as any soule can be, and do scarce know, where
I am, and do now make it a question, if any can
goe to him, who dwelleth in Light inaccessible, through
nothing, but darknesse.</hi> And a little after, <hi>but what
shall I say, either this is the Lord making grace a
new creation, where there is pure nothing, and sinfull
nothing to work upon, or I am gone, I should count
my soule ingaged to your self, and others there, with
you, if yee would but carry to Christ for me a letter of
cyphers, and non-sense (for I know not how to make
language of my condition) onely showing that I have
need of his love.</hi> Againe in the 3. part Ep. 56. <hi>he saith
but for me, I neither know what he is, nor his Sons
name, nor where he dwells.</hi> I <hi>hear a report of Christ
great enough, and that is all. O what is nearness
to him?</hi> And in this Epistle he not onely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<hi>his own great deadness and dryness,</hi> but that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58863:23"/>
it is a <hi>generall thing over professors. O</hi> (saith he)
<hi>where are the some times quickening breathings and
influences from heaven, that have refreshed his hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ones? The causes of his withdrawings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us.</hi> Yet afterwards he pointeth, truly at
the causes, saying, <hi>no doubt we have marred his
influences, and have not seconded nor smiled upon his
actings upon us.</hi> But let none mistake me, as if I
judged that none of the faithfull servants of the Lord
did, or could, feell at times, withdrawings of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
refreshment, or could not be under great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyness
at times, yea and sense of deadness, for that I
most readily acknowledge: but then such times,
are not of long continuance, where faithfullness
is kept unto, but the Lord quickly returneth unto
them, and visiteth them againe with rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
visitations of his love and life, so that they can
give frequent testimonies, of his living, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
appearance in their soules, raising them up fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
over all heavyness, and though they have
sometimes more and some times lesse of life, yet
they have always some, are always in some sense
of life, unless unfaithfulnes cause the removall of it
from them: whereas it is manifest that the generall

               </gap>raine of <hi>S. R.</hi> his Epistles in his later years holds forth

condition, from better to worse, and that
not onely, for an hour, or a day, or some days,
but throughout.</p>
            <p>All which do plainly speak forth to me, that this
sad and lamentable <hi>withdrawing of the Lord's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
from him, and this so dark a cloud, that he
was brought under, happened unto him, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his unfaithfulness to the Lord, and as a reall
judgment, or chastisement upon him, becaus of his
not <hi>following on to know the Lord</hi> more fully, but
sitting down by the way, and opposing further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveryes,
and breakings forth of <hi>Light</hi> in others,
yea turning back again, and declining from what he
once witnessed, of this I shall give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ome manifest
<hi>Instances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>First:</hi> Notwithstanding so many clear and
evident testimonys, to be found in his former epistles,
to God his <hi>immediat revelations and teaching<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
in <hi>himself,</hi> yet after all this, he joyned with the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>
of them, called <hi>Divines</hi> (though they may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be called <hi>Dry-vines,</hi> and <hi>blind Diviners) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Westminster,</hi> to oppose all <hi>immediat revelation,</hi> and
to cry down the former ways of Gods revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his people, as wholly ceased, since the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
dayes, affirming that <hi>the whole counsell of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
was <hi>committed to writing.</hi> Whereas in his forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Epistles, he plainly declareth, that he had the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
and mind of God, in some things, not to be found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58863:24"/>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Although in his former years, as his
Epistles declare, <hi>he</hi> was exceeding <hi>zealous</hi> for <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
meetings,</hi> see Ep. 2. part 2. Yet afterwards, he
complyed with the members of the <hi>Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> 1640 to make an act, against all
privat meetings, which did exceedingly gratify the
<hi>profane,</hi> and sadned the hearts of the <hi>sober,</hi> and,
as I heard, <hi>S. R.</hi> himself was displeased with the <hi>act,</hi>
yet did cowardly comply to gratify the humor of
his Brethren, without giving any publick protest to
the contrary, to which I may add:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly:</hi> His so fervent and hot <hi>opposing</hi> of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>discoverys of God</hi> in both them called <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi>
and others, whom they invidiously brande
with the name of <hi>Sectaryes,</hi> as also upon the other
hand:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly:</hi> Although he complaineth sadly of the
<hi>Prelats</hi> their persecuting him, for his <hi>Conscience,</hi>
yet after, when <hi>Presbytery</hi> got up, he joyned very
keenly, with those, who persecuted the <hi>Prelats,</hi>
and banished them out of the Nation, whereas he
was onely confined, for some time at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi>
where he was very kindly received by divers, and
this was the greatest <hi>persecution</hi> he did undergoe by
the Prelats, of whom he complained sadly. And in
his Ep. 24: part 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he regreteth his persecution,
thus, <hi>Our learned Prelat</hi> (said he) <hi>becaus we can not
see with his eyes, so farr in a milstone, as his Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:58863:25"/>
doth, will not follow his Master meek Iesus, who
waited upon the wearied, and short-breathed in the
way to heaven, and where all see not alike, and some
are weaker, he carryeth the Lambs in his bosome,
and leadeth gently those that are with young. But we
must either see all the evil of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eremonys, to be but as
indifferent straws, or suffer no less then to be cast out
of the Lords inheritance.</hi> Who seeth not, that
what strength is in this reasoning (as indeed it is
strong) was as fit against the Prelats being persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>S. R.</hi> as it was against his being persecuted by
them? If the <hi>Prelats could not see with the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
<hi>eyes, so farr in a milstone, as their light doth,</hi>
(to apply <hi>S. R.</hi> his words against himself) should he
therefore persecut them, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> up persecution
against them, as he did, and wrote most bitterly
against <hi>toleration for Conscience sake?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Lastly;</hi> addunto all this, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the time, when <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were low, and
under sufferings, he wrote thus, to a great man, Ep.
17 part 1. <hi>I am not of that mind, that Tumults or
Armes is the way to put Christ on his throne:</hi> yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
how much both he and his Brethren came
to be of that mind, and to preach up <hi>fighting</hi> and
<hi>armes as the way to reforme,</hi> many thousands yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
do wel know yea that they carryed on their <hi>league</hi>
and <hi>covenant by force of armes,</hi> rather then by that
meek way, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d down by Christ. Again
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58863:25"/>
it followeth in that Epistle, <hi>Or that Christ will be
served and Truth vindicated onely with the arme of
flesh and blood: nay, Christ doth his turne with less
dinn, then with garments rolled in blood.</hi> But how the
word <hi>[onely]</hi> cometh into the former sentence, I do
not understand, for it marreth the sense of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
altogether. I never heard of any professing
Christ, that <hi>Truth was to be vindicated</hi> onely <hi>with
the arme of flesh and blood,</hi> nay, the grosse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t sort of
<hi>Papists</hi> will not say so, for they will acknowledg,
that <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> are <hi>ways</hi> also, whereby
<hi>Truth</hi> is to be <hi>vindicated:</hi> if this be not an errour in
the printing, it seemeth to be fraudulently put in,
by the Publisher, to excuse the <hi>Presbyterians so
much using the arme of flesh and blood,</hi> to carry on
that, which they judged a <hi>reformation.</hi> And how
much garments were <hi>rolled in blood,</hi> by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Presbyterian Teachers,</hi> the whole Nation
was a witness; so that many thousands were made
widows, and fatherless, by that warr, they stirred
up the people unto, expressly <hi>contrary</hi> to the nature
of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> These <hi>Instances</hi> show that <hi>S. R.</hi> his
testimony, especially against any further discoverys
of Truth, has no wieght, <hi>he</hi> being so <hi>dark</hi> himself,
and having so palpably contradicted himself, in divers
things of great weight: nor should any think it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trange, that <hi>S. R.</hi> should misjudge them at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>
to whom he wrot that Epistle: he never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58863:26"/>
on himself, as infallible, nor do I think that his
Brethren judg all his sayings <hi>infallible</hi> truths, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>oracles,</hi> otherwise they may be bound up with
<hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles.</p>
            <p>But let us hear himself, Ep. 52. 2: part; <hi>The
Saints are not Christ, there is no misjudging in him,
there is much in us, and a doubt it is, if we shall have
fully one heart, till we have one heaven: our star-light
hideth us from our selves, and hideth us one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and</hi> Christ <hi>from us all, but he will not be hidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
from us..</hi> It is no wonder to me, that <hi>S. R.</hi> found
it so dark a time, to him, when he wrot this, for he
was then at <hi>London,</hi> carrying on that dark work,

Light, and in him is no darkness at all:</hi> and that
<hi>Christ is the true Light, that enlighteneth every man,
that cometh into the world.</hi> It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eemeth verily, the
<hi>true Light</hi> had small place in their hearts, that they
did so altogether forget it. However it is wel, that
<hi>S. R.</hi> confesseth, there is <hi>much misjudging in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
and his <hi>Bretbren.</hi> It is possible then, that <hi>he
misjudged</hi> these <hi>sober people</hi> at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> as they
wel know he did, for whereas he threatned, that if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58863:26"/>
they did forsake the National <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church,
Christ would forsake them, (but <hi>S. R.</hi> is not <hi>Christ,</hi>
nor are all his sayings Christ's) these people have
found more of Christ, since that time, then before,
and they may on good ground, better believe their
own experience, then his rash uncharitable judgings.</p>
            <p>I write not these things in the least out of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to <hi>S. R.</hi> his memory, or as if I did conclude,
that he has not found mercy with the Lord, God
forbid I should harbour any such uncharitable
thought, onely becaus the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Postscript</hi>
brings in his testimony, against those people at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>
and layeth such weight upon it, I found my
self more concerned in the love and zeal of God,
to take some pains, to remove this stumbling block,
out of the way of the <hi>simple,</hi> as becaus such a good
man as <hi>S. R.</hi> judged so, of such a people, and of
such a way, therefor it is bad; which yet will have
no more weight with those, that are truely judicious,
then when the <hi>Papists</hi> tell us, of their eminent
<hi>Saints,</hi> who had such holy lives, and witnessed so
much of <hi>spirituall communion with God,</hi> and yet
opposed the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> as great <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and cried
up the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the onely true Church,
will have weight with us, either to believe the one,
or the other. And I do not question it, but <hi>Bernard,</hi>
who lived in the darkest times of <hi>Popery,</hi> was as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man, and had as much, or rather more spirituall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58863:27"/>
experience, as <hi>S. R.</hi> as his writings do declare to any,
who have the true <hi>spirituall discerning,</hi> and shall
compare <hi>Bernard's</hi> with those of <hi>S. R.</hi> and yet the
same <hi>Bernard</hi> was a most vehement opposer of the
<hi>Waldenses,</hi> who were a good people, and bore a
true and faithfull testimony in their day, according
to the discovery, given them of God, against the
<hi>idolatry</hi> and <hi>superstition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But before I leave this <hi>particular,</hi> I shall take
notice of another thing, that will serve not a little to
discover, how weak <hi>S. R.</hi> his authority is, as to his
peremptory conclusion, he made, concerning those
few <hi>sober people</hi> at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> which was no less,
then this, that <hi>if they did forsake the Nationall
Church, Christ would forsake them:</hi> which <hi>threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the Author of the <hi>Postscript</hi> looketh upon, to be
<hi>a divine prediction,</hi> confirmed by their since turning
to <hi>Quakeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in,</hi> which he calls the <hi>abyss of all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</hi>
But I ask this Author of the <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
Can any divine prediction contradict an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith?</hi> If he say, <hi>nay,</hi> then I query again, <hi>Is it
not</hi> an article of the Presbyterian faith, that <hi>none
truely gracious in the least measure, can totally fall
away from grace,</hi> or be <hi>totally forsaken of God?</hi>
This is their express doctrine; whereupon it will
follow, that <hi>none truely gracious can fall into Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism,</hi>
which he calls the <hi>abyss of all abominations,
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58863:27"/>
seing <hi>their falling into Independency,</hi> was the <hi>sinn,</hi>
that provoked God (as this Author would have it)
to suffer them to fall thus, it is clear, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>S. R. none truely gracious can turn Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
seing <hi>to turn Independent,</hi> is to be <hi>forsaken of
Christ,</hi> as he doth positively threaten in his Letter,
and yet in the same <hi>Letter,</hi> he telleth them of their
<hi>work of faith,</hi> and <hi>labour of love and patience of hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in our Lord Iesus,</hi> as also he tells them, of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>sealed unto the day of redemption,</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>the Spirit by the hearing of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which plainly import their being in a <hi>state of
Grace,</hi> and if either he, or the Author of the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
think that after all this, they could <hi>fall away,</hi>
so as to be <hi>forsaken of Christ,</hi> they contradict their
own principle. If he reply, that <hi>S. R.</hi> judged them
to be Saints, onely in a <hi>judgment of charity:</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
by inquiring, <hi>whether this his judgment of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
was <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>false? from his own spirit,</hi> or
<hi>from the Spirit of God?</hi> for there is no midst. If he
say, <hi>it was false,</hi> and <hi>from his own spirit,</hi> and <hi>not
fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Spirit of God,</hi> then surely these People,
whom he so threatned, had no cause to fear, or
look upon him, as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>divinely inspired,</hi>
in the writing of this <hi>Letter,</hi> seing he begins with
a <hi>false judgment,</hi> that is confessed to be from <hi>his own
spirit,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> from <hi>the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> And
seing the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Postscript</hi> will allow him to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58863:28"/>
have been greatly mistaken, in his judging them to
be Saints, we may with as much ground, in all
reason, judg him to be mistaken, when he did so
threaten them, that <hi>Christ would forsake them:</hi> but
if they never had Christ, how could he <hi>forsake them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. We need not feare such <hi>predictions,</hi> as carry
in their bosome flat contradictions, but <hi>S. R.</hi> did
not think <hi>Independency</hi> inconsistent with the <hi>Grace
of God,</hi> for <hi>Ep:</hi> 53: part 3. he giveth an express
testimony of some <hi>Independents,</hi> particularly <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Godwyn Ieremiah Burroughs,</hi> that they were
gracious men, so he telleth that he conceived of
them: which abundantly proves, he thought <hi>men
might be truly gracious, and yet Independents, and
mighty opposits to Presbyteriall government,</hi> as his
words in that Epistle shew.</p>

               <p>1. That this is not an <hi>humble boast through
Grace,</hi> as the Author would have it, but a <hi>proud
boast through flesh,</hi> I hope by the Grace of God, to

That the reformation of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>

               <p>3. Let us then hear, what <hi>S. R.</hi> saith, of the

this in the year 1640. When Presbytery was up most
over the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> were all
excommunicated, and fled. <hi>It is true</hi> (saith he,
in his Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to <hi>Iohn Fennick) in a great part, what
ye write of this Kirk, that the letter of Religion onely
is reformed, and scarce that; I do not believe our Lord
will build his</hi> Zion <hi>in this</hi> Land, <hi>upon this skin of
reformation, so long as our scumm remaineth, and
our heart-idols are kept, this work must be at a
stand. And therefor our Lord must yet sift this</hi> Land,
<hi>and search us with candles,</hi> &amp;c. This is a notable
<hi>testimony,</hi> and it appears plainly unto me, that this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58863:29"/>
                  <hi>Iohn Fennick,</hi> to whom he wrot, had a true
sight of the defectivness of the Presbyterian refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
of which he wrot in a letter to <hi>S. R.</hi> and
which <hi>S. R.</hi> did as freely acknowledg. In which
Testimony note these <hi>particulars.</hi> 1. That he
saith, <hi>it is true in great part, that the Letter in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
onely <hi>is reformed</hi> where take notice of the
word <hi>[onely.]</hi> 2. That even <hi>scarcely the Letter is
reformed,</hi> so that the Presbyterian reformation,
was but as the skin of a mans body, wanting flesh,
bones, and sinews. 3. That the Presbyterian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church was not come to the <hi>true fundation</hi> of
a <hi>Gospell Church;</hi> which his words clearly hold forth.
<hi>I do not believe</hi> (said he) our <hi>Lord will build his</hi> Zion
<hi>upon this skin of reformation:</hi> therefor, not the
skin, but some better foundation, not yet discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Presbyterians, must be that on which God
will build his Church, according to <hi>S. R.</hi> And indeed
this abundantly proveth, that the Presbyterians
began too hastily to build their Church, and did not
follow Gods method, so that the Presbyterian
Church could not say unto the Lord, as <hi>Iob</hi> said,
chap. 10: vers 10. <hi>Hast thou not poured me out as
milk, and curdled me like cheese, thou hast cloathed
me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones
and sinews; thou hast granted me life and favour,
and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</hi> But the
National Presbyterian Church being onely <hi>letter</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58863:30"/>
and <hi>skin,</hi> having neither flesh nor bones, not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,
how can it be a true Church of Christ? how
can it have life and spirit? And surely that's a great
defect, for as the bare skin of a man, can not be
called a <hi>man,</hi> so nor can the bare skin of a Church
be called a <hi>Church.</hi> But 4. he telleth them of the
remaining of their <hi>scum,</hi> and heart-idols, this
sheweth they were no true spouse of Christ, for he
will marry himself to none, who keep idols in their
hearts. And 5. he tells, that the <hi>Land</hi> must be
<hi>sifted,</hi> and <hi>searched</hi> with candles; and surely that
was very needfull, for the <hi>Presbyterian reformation</hi>
was but as a wide riddle, that did let through much

and strawy Professors, to be members of the Church.</p>
               <p>3. Many thousands of them really not deserving to
be members of a wel ordered <hi>humane society,</hi> becaus
of the grossness and scandalousness of their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
farr less of such a <hi>Divine fellowship,</hi> &amp; common
wealth, as the true Church of Christ is. I do not in
the least doubt of it, but the Lord had in that day,
as I believe he now hath, many, that were precious
untohim, among them, called <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and
did, and do belong to the Catholick and universall
Church, even as I believe, God hath many such, not
onely among them, called <hi>Independents,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists,</hi>
but also among <hi>Lutherans, Episcopalians,</hi>
and <hi>Papists.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58863:30"/>4. Moreover that about 40 years ago and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
there was a very precious life appearing, and
breaking forth among them called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in
some corners in this Nation, especially in some
places in the West, I do not question, yea it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
sealed in my heart, that it was truely so: and
happy had they been, if they had kept faithfull
unto that; for a precious tenderness there was, and
a <hi>precious sense of life, and feeling of Gods blessed
power among them;</hi> especially at their <hi>privat meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
And also, this <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> did in a blessed
measure attend some Preachers, in those days, in so
much as divers particulars were wonderfully reached
&amp; changed in some parts, &amp; a good simplicity was in
divers, so that I am fully perswaded it was a time of
love, wherein the Lord allured them, and led them
into the wilderness, and spake comfortably unto
them, or <hi>spake unto their hearts,</hi> as the words of the
<hi>Scriptur</hi> are. <hi>(Hosea,</hi> 2.) And God remembred
their simplicity and tenderness, and this first love
and kindness of their youth was very dear unto him,
although even in that day, there were many errors
and weaknesses among them yet the Lord winked
at these things, pittying them, for his <hi>Seeds</hi> sake,
and with a regard to that honest simplicity and love
that was among them; who had they continued faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to that <hi>manifestation,</hi> which was as the <hi>dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the morning,</hi> no doubt the day of the Lord
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58863:31"/>
would have arisen among them and the <hi>true Light</hi>
would have shined in that brightness, as to have
discovered unto them, those errors they should
have forsaken, and these Truths they should have
embraced.</p>
               <p>5. But alas! this glory of God did not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to appear among that handfull, who in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
saw it, and tasted of the sweetness of it, but they
not following the Lord, in his further requirings,

going back again (as I have shewed in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,

and next, when <hi>Popery</hi> prevailed, and <hi>Popish Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
and <hi>Kings</hi> made compulsive Laws, and decrees,
that <hi>all should joyn to the Popish Churches every

<hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles;</hi> for all the <hi>primitive Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
were <hi>Congregational,</hi> and not <hi>National,</hi> upwards
of the first three hundred years. Yea I see no <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

and though <hi>Constantin</hi> gave great encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all, to become <hi>Christians,</hi> yet I find not,
that he forced any, to take on the profession of
<hi>Christianity.</hi> But these, that will have a <hi>National
Church,</hi> they will have all others to bow to them,
and joyn with them, and this giveth a natural and
most necessary rise to <hi>persecution:</hi> so that all those,
whom she can not perswade to take on her <hi>yoak,</hi> and

from them, and therefore generally fled out of the
Nation, before they had opportunity to lay hands on
them. But some of their party, that they got hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of, they made them feel the dint, as namely, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Wishart,</hi> who then was not a <hi>Bishop,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their party, this man they imprisoned, in the
Tolbooth of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and used so hardly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly,
that he could hardly get any, to minister to
his outward necessitys, but had <hi>almost perished</hi> with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58863:33"/>
want of necessary things for his body. And the
<hi>Lord Cremond,</hi> (who was no <hi>Clergy man,</hi> but onely
a favourer of <hi>Bishops,</hi> being then an <hi>Advocat)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
he would not bow to their wills, was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to flee the Nation. Not to mention the <hi>fineings,</hi>
and other <hi>oppressions,</hi> that many endured on that
account, and the <hi>Papists</hi> also, some of whom had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
their all swept away, and many fled. Besides
some few scattered ones, whom they called <hi>Sectarys,</hi>
they grievously persecuted, and threatned, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Iohn Garden</hi> of <hi>Tillifroskie</hi> a <hi>Baptist,</hi> whom they
imprisoned in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for a long time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to so great outward necessitys, that no body
durst wel minister to him, what he wanted. But
was the Presbyterian National Church any more
favourable <hi>to their lawfull Prince?</hi> Did they not
also extend their power to the utmost <hi>against him,
to compell him?</hi> And what the <hi>sad effects</hi> were,
which this produced, I am loath to mention; so
that none were spared, but all, <hi>Great and small,
must fall down, and worship this beast,</hi> as it was in
the darkest times of <hi>Popery:</hi> otherwise they knew
what they were to expect. And it would saden a
mans heart, to think, to what <hi>perplexity</hi> many <hi>simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
men</hi> were brought, while things were carryed
thus: on the one hand <hi>the Kirk issued forth her acts,</hi>
that people should do so and so; and on the other
hand the Lawfull Magistrat issued forth acts to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58863:34"/>
                  <hi>contrary;</hi> and so the body of the Nation was divided,
some following the <hi>one,</hi> some the <hi>other,</hi> untill they
ceased not to make the <hi>three Nations a field of blood.</hi>
And all this happened by <hi>that persecuting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
spirit in the Presbyterian Church,</hi> that <hi>is the
very life of such a Church,</hi> without which it can not
subsist, as such.</p>
               <p>Next, as to <hi>her Hypocrisy,</hi> we need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then <hi>the various changes of the farr greatest
number of her Church-members,</hi> and especiaily <hi>her
Teachers,</hi> one while <hi>Episcopal;</hi> again <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
and to wheel round again, <hi>Episcopal:</hi> and these
changes all falling within a short time, even upon
the self same persons, they who were zealous for
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and cryed it up yesterday, the next day
zealous against it, crying it as much down, and
then up again: one while preaching against <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivall
days, and set forms of Worship,</hi> then for <hi>them,</hi>
then against <hi>them,</hi> then lastly for <hi>them</hi> again. All this
bewrayes <hi>horrible</hi> and <hi>detestable Hypoorisy,</hi> especially
in the <hi>Teachers,</hi> who pretend to preach the Word
of GOD, and the Truth of Christ. Whereas the
<hi>Word of the Lord is One forever, and the Truth is
the same always,</hi> and is not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay.</hi> And it is a
thing, as manifest, as the <hi>light of the day,</hi> that the
<hi>Teachers,</hi> even of the <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi> have
been generally and for the most part, <hi>Self-seeking,
worldly minded and covetous men, who loved pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures

prevail with them, was to <hi>bribe them, with augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and benefices,</hi> as they did in the year 1649,
and at divers other times, as they saw occasion.
And in the time of <hi>great burdens</hi> upon the Land <hi>of
Cesses and Taxations,</hi> that many honest familys were
redacted to great straits, by reason of these publick
burdens, yet the <hi>Presbyterian Preachers table was
as full as ever, his cup did overflow with outward
abundance, he must bear no part of the publick burden,</hi>
but the burdens of the people must be augmented
<hi>to give him augmentations.</hi> But alas! This Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian

which some have so much sense of shame

yet they fume and rage, and the <hi>honest, harmeless

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. But if the Author of the <hi>Posts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ript</hi> think to
get a fame to the Presbyterian Church,
becaus of some noted men for piety, that
have been among them; It is easily <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi>
that they did not ow this piety to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbyterian
Church, but to the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> which
<hi>is Vniversall, For the Grace of God, that bringeth
Salvation, hath shined in All</hi> (so <hi>Beza</hi> translates it)
<hi>Tit:</hi> 2: 10, 11. and this <hi>Grace teacheth to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlyness,
and worldly lusts, and to live righteously,
and soberly, and godlily in this present world.</hi> And
whoever in any age or place of the world joyned
their hearts unto this <hi>Grace,</hi> and did believe and
obey its teachings, <hi>it made them good and pious men,</hi>
so that they did excell others, in many good things;
although by reason of the darkness and corruption
of the ages and places, where they lived, the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of <hi>education</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> prevailed so farr, that
they also were dark and ignorant in many things.
Yet the Lord regarding their sincerity, <hi>winked at
their ignorance</hi> in those things. And thus the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of some among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils</hi>
in the time of <hi>Heathenism,</hi> who <hi>were a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselvs, and did by Natur</hi> (to wit, <hi>the Divine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58863:36"/>
Nature</hi> of the <hi>Word ingrafted</hi> in <hi>them, Iames</hi> 1. or
by their <hi>own nature, restored</hi> and <hi>repaired by the
Grace of God</hi> (as <hi>Augustin</hi> expounded that place)
<hi>the things contained in the Law,</hi> &amp; such was <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
among the <hi>Gracians,</hi> whom <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in one
of his <hi>Apologys,</hi> did expressly call a <hi>Christian,</hi> and
classeth him with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. Also all along the <hi>dark times</hi> of <hi>popery,</hi> the
Lord raised up some even in the very heart of the
popish Church, that excelled others in vertue and
piety, and were as <hi>Lights shining in a dark place,</hi> and
witnesses to the truth, some in some things and
some in others; and yet even these men lived still in
the Popish Church, and in too many things were
carryed away, and tinctured with divers <hi>corruptions,</hi>
and <hi>superstitions.</hi> Of this <hi>Illyricus</hi> in his <hi>Catologus

and <hi>Robertus Gallus;</hi> this <hi>Robertus Gallus</hi> was a
<hi>Franciscan Frier,</hi> and had propheticall visions,
which were interpreted to him, by the Spirit of God,
there is a Treatise under his name, printed together
with the Prophecyes of <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> a Woman
prophetesse in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of both whose
Prophecyes, <hi>Fox</hi> takes speciall notice, in his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology.
And in the fifteenth Century <hi>Vincentius</hi>
a <hi>Venetian,</hi> who also prophecyed against the Clergy,
and <hi>Theodorick Vrias:</hi> There was also another
<hi>Theodorick</hi> Bishop of <hi>Croatia,</hi> that prophecyed in

brought to nought,</hi> and that <hi>Iustice which hath been
shut up in darkness, shall come into Light,</hi> and <hi>the true
Church shall flourish in Godlyness, more then she hath
done.</hi> In this age also lived <hi>Iohn Huss,</hi> a pious and
vertuous man, whom the <hi>Papists</hi> burnt, as an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,

            <p>Now in the sixteenth <hi>century,</hi> the reformation

of God, to <hi>many soules,</hi> in that day, to
whom the Lord gave signall Testimonys of his love
and of his admitting them at times, unto near
communion with him: among whom were chiefly,
<hi>Iohn Welsh, Robert Bruce, Davidson</hi> and <hi>Patrick
Simpson,</hi> and divers others, concerning whom, the
<hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the fullfilling of the Scripturs,</hi> gives an
account. And I do verily believe, they were pious
men, and had precious feelings of the life, and
power of God, which did at times accompany them,
in their ministry, whereby many soules were reached,
and converted unto God. And as touching some
things, related by the <hi>Author,</hi> concerning these
men, I may afterwards in its due place, take notice,
which will not a little make for the present testimony
of the people, called <hi>Quakers.</hi> But all this will
not in the least prove, that the <hi>Presbyterian Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

then it will prove, that the Popish Church was the
true Church of Christ, which (as I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
had pious and vertuous men, and some of
them indued with the Propheticall Spirit. Also the
Episcopall English Church, in the dayes of <hi>Q. Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

a Popish Monck, is really to me, <hi>a more usefull
book, for spirituall doctrin,</hi> then all the <hi>Presbyterian

for good reasons, it is judged not to be his, but a

            <p>This little book of <hi>Thomas a Kempis</hi> hath had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great reception among <hi>Protestants</hi> of all

that of their most spirituall Preachers. It
is a most unreasonable thing, to cry up a faction,
or party, or particular Church, becaus of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
men, that have been among them, and
perhaps zealous for that way.</p>
            <p>3. For indeed few Professions, or Sects in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,

and were put to death, <hi>by Papists.</hi> And both <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi>
and <hi>Baptists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> had some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

the Suprem Magistrat,</hi> in order to reestablish the
Presbyterian Government, a way flat <hi>contradictory</hi>
to the nature of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to the <hi>express commands
of Christ,</hi> and also to the <hi>practice</hi> of the primitive
Christians, to make any <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>military resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi>
so much as in their own defence, which last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for hundreds of years, so that it is but of later
times, that any professing the Name of Christianity,
did offer to defend themselvs by carnal weapons,
against their Lawfull Magistrats. During the <hi>ten
persecutions,</hi> not so much as a shaddow of any such
thing, is to be found in Church history. And yet,
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives an account, who lived in the
heart of those persecutions, it was not for want of
number, or strength, that they did not oppose
themselves in their own defence, but onely becaus
they were Christians.</p>
            <p>7. And although <hi>suffering</hi> be a thing greatly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,</hi>
and also <hi>commanded</hi> under the Gospell,
and is as <hi>S. R.</hi> calles it, in one of his Epistles, <hi>a
great part of the Ministry,</hi> yet I know not if the
Presbyterians can instance one single person of
them all, since the late revolution, that have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
or do at present suffer, for <hi>Conscience</hi> sake, in
a pure and cleanly way: I mean for matters purely
Evangelical, and out of pure Conscience; for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58863:41"/>
such of them, who did suffer, had not keept their
hands clean, from <hi>too much incroaching upon affairs
of the Stat, and power of the Magistrat,</hi> so that they
had little cause to glory in those sufferings.</p>
            <p>8. And if the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> think, they have had
any Martyrs for Presbyterian government, yet
this will <hi>not commend their Church above the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
which hath had its <hi>Sufferers</hi> also, who have
<hi>suffered unto death;</hi> and whose <hi>Sufferings</hi> were as
much <hi>matters of Conscience</hi> unto them, as the
Presbyterians was unto them. Yea the Episcopal
Church gloryeth, that she had one of the <hi>most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Kings,</hi> that either then was, or had been in
the world for many ages, a Martyr for her, whose
life was worth many thousands of others.</p>
            <p>9. And in very truth, the Presbyterian Church
will never be able to purge her self of the <hi>iniquity of
the killing of many thousands,</hi> in the three Nations,
by the occasion of <hi>a most bloody warr, raised up</hi>
through the instigation of the <hi>Presbyterian Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
I am fully perswaded of it, that <hi>the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

that I know of in the world, next unto the <hi>bloody
Church of Rome.</hi> And as she hath drunk the blood
of many, so blood hath been given her to drink,
and it is to be feared, that more will be given to her,
as a just judgment from the hand of God, except

            <p>15. And whatever faith <hi>S. R.</hi> had of the Lord

faith was <hi>very wavering</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> touching the
<hi>Covenant</hi> its being made an instrument of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for thus he writs, Ep. 70. part 2. <hi>I believe he
comes quickly, who will remove our darkness, and
will shine gloriously in the Isle of</hi> Britan, <hi>as a crowned
King, either in a formally sworn Covenant, or in his
own: glorious way; which I leave to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his infinit Wisdom and Goodness.</hi> It seemeth
he had some other way in his view, as possible, if
not probable, which God would take to reforme
the Church, then the <hi>Covenant, (that instrument
of so much blood)</hi> Hower this is certain, his faith was
very uncertain about the matter now in his dyeing
days: and he speaks not at all as any true Prophet
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58863:43"/>
of the Lord, in this matter. Albeit the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
generally are <hi>still so blind, and darke,</hi> that they po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
judg, that the covenant will be a main thing,
that God will make use of, to reforme the Land, and
that both Covenant and Presbytery will up again,
where as <hi>S. R.</hi> is unclear in the matter.</p>
            <p>16. And I could tell them of one of themselves,
whom they judge no lesse then a martyr for the
cause, that published his mind in print, before his
death, some years, that <hi>God had forsaken their
Nationall Church, and was not like to return to her
again:</hi> and he answereth all the common reasons
from <hi>Sciptur,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that seemed to prove,
that the Lord would return unto them, and plainly
sheweth the weakness and invalidity of them. The
book is in the hands of many which I have read, and
I had it from the mouth of an honest faithfull man,
that he heard <hi>Iohn Livingston,</hi> say, in prayer, <hi>Lord
since Dumbar, thou hast spit in our face, and since that
never looked over thy shoulder to us again.</hi> This is he,
whom the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Postscript,</hi> calls that <hi>great
man of God,</hi> and this prayer he had in a certain family
in <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> And this is that Church, that was such
an <hi>apostat,</hi> and whom the Lord had so forsaken
by the confession of their chief <hi>Seers,</hi> and who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was never a true Gospell Church, that we the
people called <hi>Quakers</hi> have forsaken, and we are
resolved by Gods grace never to return unto her,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58863:44"/>
for the Lord hath said unto us, let them come unto
you, but goe not ye unto them, the Lord hath
added divers, who were among them, and under
that profession unto us, and will add many more,
yea thousands in due time, for the <hi>Lord hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
seed</hi> to gather out from among them. And
there are many among them, I know, who have
true breathings after the Lord, and these in due

even in, and among the people, called in Scorne

they say, with an implicit faith, as formerly they
too much had.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. ANd as to what I have said in generall
against the <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi> as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,</hi>
and as being so <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and blood, I understand it, not of
all that goe under that name, for I doe believe many
among them are altogether free of having a hand
in such things, and are of a more sober Spirit, and
of more sober principles: but I understand it of a
<hi>great faction</hi> and <hi>party</hi> of them, that did most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
and <hi>carryed away</hi> many <hi>simple wel-meaning
people</hi> along with them, what <hi>by deceitfull perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and what by fears: And I know many that
were so carryed away, are now come to see the evil
of these practices, and are resolved never to concurre
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58863:45"/>
in, or countenance the like of them again. But
especially the <hi>Presbyterian Clergy</hi> and <hi>priesthood</hi> had
the <hi>main hand</hi> and <hi>stroak</hi> in these <hi>disorders,</hi> and all
to uphold their kingdom, and gratify their lust, and
ambition.</p>
            <p>2. And that I have so frequently used the word
<hi>[Presbyterian]</hi> or may afterwards use it, is onely
for distinction's sake, becaus I know not how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to designe them, yet I am farr from judging
them to be true <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or that their Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
judicatorys were true Presbyterys, such as were
in the primitive times.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Presbytery</hi> is too good a name to
give them, unless with this addition <hi>Pseudo-Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Presbytery falsly so called,</hi> seing they
have so positively denyed that which gives <hi>the very
life,</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> either to any true Church, or
Presbytery, viz, the <hi>immediat Revelation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

teachings and leadings of the Spirit of Christ
in every member;</hi> so that as of old, there were, who
called themselvs, <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> and were
not, so these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> call themselves <hi>true Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>erys,</hi>
but are no more so, then a dead image of
a man is a true man. And indeed who ever hath a
true knowledge of either the Gospell, or a true
Gospell Church, will see, that with good reason,
and good ground, we have forsaken the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
and <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> and that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58863:45"/>
of <hi>her bad practices,</hi> but also for <hi>her bad, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Christian</hi>

men in those days.</p>
            <p>4. And although she falsly accuse us, as deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true Christ, yet I hope to make it apparent,
that she, and not we, are the denyers of him, who
would exclud him out of the very Saints, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
confine him to some particular place: but
this I intend to reserve till afterwards.</p>
            <p>5. Also she discovereth her self to be a very

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer:</hi> The Author of the Postscript
hath been giving some perswasions, why People
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58863:49"/>
should deny all converse with the People, called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> from the exampls of the Apostles, <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and lastly from the example of <hi>Master
Iohn Livingston,</hi> as he calls him. (behold the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbyterians
pride, that will honour one another
with the title of <hi>Master,</hi> whereas when they speake
of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> they give them no such titles, but
bare <hi>Iohn, Paul, Peter.</hi> But to say <hi>Iohn Livingston,</hi>
and <hi>Samuel Rutherford,</hi> withholding the proud title
of <hi>Master,</hi> which Christ did expressly forbid, doth
greatly offend Presbyterian ears) But first I must
tell the Author of the Postscript: As to the exampls
of Paul and John, the case doth no ways meet, for
the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> are of the same spirit, and
hold the same principls, and have the same life and
conversation, which the Christians had, whom
Paul and John loved, and were kindly affected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
even as parents unto children.</p>
            <p>They are neither like seducing <hi>Elymas</hi> (a title
more aggreable to this Author) nor like <hi>Hymeneus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> delivered unto Satan:
nor have they the least affinity with such, as John
forbad the Disciples to receive into their house, or
give them a friendly salutation, for such were they,
who brought another doctrin unto them, then John
preached. See 2 Ep: <hi>Ioh:</hi> ver: 10.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas the <hi>Quakers</hi> bring no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
but the very same doctrin of Christ, which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58863:50"/>
Christ himself, and both John and all the Apostles
preached. And this, upon trial, we are assured by
the Grace of God, that we can make good against
this Author and all his Brethren; as likewise that we
can prove that he and his Brethren are the men, that
bring a contrary doctrin. For whereas Christ
preached himself to be <hi>the Light of the world,</hi> and
John preached him to be that <hi>true Light, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth
every man, that cometh into the world, that all
through him might believe.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> said,
<hi>This is the message, that we have heard of him, that
God is Light, and in him is no darkness at all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fellowship one with another,</hi> &amp;c. The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Teachers can not endure to hear the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
preached by the Quakers, and they are ready
to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ash with their very teeth at us, when we preach
<hi>GOD</hi> to be the <hi>LIGHT,</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> to be
that <hi>TRUE LIGHT, that inlighteneth EVERY
Man, that cometh into the World.</hi> And both Christ
and the Apostles preached <hi>God and Christ in men,</hi>
as wel as Christ his coming in the flesh, or <hi>God</hi>
made <hi>manifest in flesh,</hi> in that prepared body, which
was crucified at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and afterwards raised up
again, and glorified. And this same doctrin the
Quakers preach, whereas the Presbyterians are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for Christ his being in a true and real sense no not in
the very Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58863:50"/>3. Surely this <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>brethren</hi> have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>
an <hi>horrid injustice</hi> against the people called,
<hi>Quakers,</hi> in condemning them, whom neither he
nor his brethren do know, nor what principls they
hold, whereas they believe lyeing reports, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
men have invented against that people, and
there is a mind in them, that is too ready to give ear
to such lyes, and foment yea augment them.</p>
            <p>4. And yet I have really such charity to this man
and many of his brethren, that it is through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that they thus condemn us, and speake evil of
us, and therefor is their sin the more pardonable,
were it not that with a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>mad zeall, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
all means of information,</hi> whereby to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
either what we are, or what principles we
hold, otherwise it were impossible they could be so
ignorant concerning us, as really they are; for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
in this land know that we are not guilty of
these horrid things, which this man layeth to our
charge.</p>
            <p>5. And certainly this is a great sin in them, and
near bordering with that <hi>sin that shall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi>
that they refuse to be informed of us, and
are willingly ignorant themselvs, and seek by all
means to keep people in ignorance concerning us,
that they may not converse with us, nor read our
books, an usuall policy of the <hi>Popish Anti-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

them, as damnable Hereticks, not to be convers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </gap>

who upon an impartial search, have found
that we have been most grossly abused, and belyed
by these men.</p>
            <p>7. Which hath raised in them a love to us, and an

            <p>8. Now as concerning <hi>Iohn Livingston,</hi> whose

who, when a certain per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, did in a most rude, and Unchristian way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
him accesse into his house, yet having nothing
justly wherewith to charge him, and when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him, what was the reason of his carrying
so towards him, he told him, that he had joyned
with a people, that held blasphemous principles;
and when he again inquired, what these blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
principles were, he would not give an instance
in one particular; but found fault with him for speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the plain Scripture language of <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi>
which Christ and the Apostles used to one person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and of this rencounter <hi>B. F.</hi> a merchant in <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and I my self were both eye and ear-witnesses,
then present in company with the said person, and
it is a certain truth, that this was the first time that
<hi>Iohn Livingston</hi> spake with the said person, after he

in the dark, otherwise he could not have so mistaken
and misjudged us, as he hath done, if his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been in the <hi>Light,</hi> he would have seen and
known better what wee had been. But to passe
this, it doth not a little discover him to have been
but a weak and cowardly man, that at the meer will
and command of men, went over sea and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
his sentence of banishment with his own
hand, as others likewise did, which the <hi>Author</hi> of
<hi>Ius Populi</hi> doth plainly acknowledge. I challenge
the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Postscript</hi> to shew me, where
any of the true Prophets of God, or Ambassadours
of Christ did such a thing, surely this was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall

               </gap>lock, but
promise never to return to them, nor to his native
countrey on paine of death, without leave of men.
Now put the case that God had commanded him by
<hi>immediat revelation,</hi> or given him an <hi>immediat mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi>
to return, as he had wont to give immediat
messages to <hi>Elijah,</hi> did he not here bind himself up
not to goe, or else to make himself a transgressour,
guilty of death by his own hand-writting? And if it

any inferiour divinity, or deity, but the very same
God-head of the Father; so that Christ, as God, is
equall with the Father, and one and the same God
with him, of one nature and substance. Again the
Man-hood of Christ is a true and perfect Man-hood,
so that Christ as man hath a true and real soule di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the God-head, yet forever united with
the same, in a most immediat and wonderfull manner
of which union, no other soul or Spirit of men, or

the Man-hood of any other man hath, the

6. This is a meer quible about the invented
words of mans wisdom, which we deny, albeit the
truth of the thing it self we deny not, but faithfully
believe, to wit, that Christ as God, is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of the <hi>Three, that bear record in heaven,</hi> which
three are, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
and these three are <hi>One,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> declared, and we
believe that these three, that bear record in heaven,
are not three distinct natures and substances, but
<hi>the one in nature and substance:</hi> not <hi>three
Gods,</hi> but <hi>One, onely God:</hi> not having <hi>three under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadings,
three wills, or three powers,</hi> but one
only understanding, one only will, and one only
power.</p>
            <p>7. Yet they are three, otherwise then in meer
name, operation, or manifestation towards us
onely, being distinct in their relative modes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertys,
so that the <hi>Father</hi> is not the <hi>Word,</hi> nor is
the Word or <hi>Son</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> [allthough he be our
<hi>Father]</hi> nor is the <hi>Spirit</hi> that proceeds from the
<hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> either the Father, or the Son,
<hi>the Father is uncreated and unbegotten,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> or
<hi>Word</hi> from everlasting is <hi>uncreated</hi> and yet <hi>begotten</hi>
of the <hi>Father,</hi> the Spirit is neither created nor begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but proceedeth from the Father and the Son,
from everlasting, the Father did not become flesh,
nor was born, and crucified and rose, but the <hi>Son</hi> or
<hi>Word,</hi> &amp; yet the Father is in the <hi>Son</hi> &amp; the Son in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58863:57"/>
Father, &amp; the Spirit that proceedeth from them, is &amp;
was in them and with them from everlasting, and is
unto everlasting, and whatever the Father doth, the
Word and Spirit do the same, being one, as in nature,
so in operation. This Father doth all things by the
Word, and the Father and the word doe all things
by the Spirit, and yet as they are distinct in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or modes of being, so also in the manner or
modes of operation. As the Father is first in the
manner of his being so is he first in the manner of
operation, as the Son is second in the manner of his
being, so is he second in the manner of operation,
and as the Spirit is third in the manner of his being,
so is he third in the manner of operation. Yet this
priority is not a <hi>priority of time,</hi> but of <hi>order,</hi>
for they were three before time, even from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
and they all cooperat and work together.
And thus it may appear, that we are sound in the
faith, as touching this great mystery, and that we
differr not in the matter, or thing it self, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as to the manner of expression, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
grant, is not by words divinely inspired, as
namely a <hi>Trinity of persons,</hi> or <hi>three distinct persons.</hi>
Christ and the Apostles, who declared of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
expressed it not in these termes, of <hi>three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
persons,</hi> nor are these words recorded in
Scriptures, therefor we are not bound to expresse
our faith in these unscripturall termes, which the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58863:57"/>
holy Ghost hath not taught, nor indeed is there any
need of those termes, three distinct persons, but
rather they darken then explain the mystery, which
have occasioned, not onely some of the vulgar, but
even some of them, called the learned, to erre
grossely in their conceptions about the mystery it
self, as if the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,
were really three distinct substances, each having a
distinct <hi>understanding, will</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and as if
the word or Son were inferiour in nature to the
Father, and the Father greater then the Son, as
<hi>Origen</hi> is thought by some to have taught, and as
some do now teach, and such although they affirme,
that the Word and the Spirit are di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tinct substances
from the Father, and that the Father is greater then
they, yet they do not acknowledg, that the Word
and Spirit are created, or that they have their being
from the Father, by way of creation, but only by
way of emanation, and they affirme, that the Father
is onely the most high God, and the Word and
Spirit inferiour unto him, as being God onely by
participation from, and union with the Father, and
thus they think to defend themselvs, as not being
guilty of the <hi>Arian</hi> heresy, whereas it was a branch
of the Arian heresy, to say, <hi>that the Son or Word
was not equall unto the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whither or not they be guilty of the Arian
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eresy, sure I am they are in an error occasioned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58863:58"/>
in great part, by these unsound and unscriptural
terms of <hi>three Persons</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> for <hi>persons</hi>
signify <hi>substances,</hi> and not the <hi>modes</hi> or propertys of
one Substance.</p>
            <p>8. And it is wel known, that these words of
<hi>Three Persons,</hi> and 3 <hi>Hypostases</hi> have made great
<hi>contention</hi> in former times, and divers, judged to
be pious and learned men, have denyed them, and
disputed against them, as namely <hi>Ierome</hi> against
<hi>three hypostases,</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> disputeth solidely,
<hi>lib.</hi> 5. &amp; 7. <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> that the words <hi>[Three
Persons]</hi> are not properly applicable to the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it self; although he doth not know, what other
names to give them: and surely it is too great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and curiosity in any men, to dive further
into this mystery, then what God hath pleased to
reveal, or to give names unto it, which the Lord
hath not given. And yet it is more presumption, and
smelleth rankly of a persecuting spirit, to impose
upon others these words, which the Spirit of God
hath not taught, nor left upon record in the
Scripture; and yet, becaus we do not own these
words of mans wisdom and spirit, to cry out against
us, as blasphemers, and as denying the true Christ:
whereas we believe in, and do own the true Christ,
according both to his God-head and Man-hood,
more according to the Truth, and Testimony of
the Scripture, then our accusers do, as I hope in
its due place to shew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:58863:58"/>The <hi>Third Particular,</hi> whereof he accuseth us,
is, that we deny <hi>Christ to be a singular Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. But this is another quible, like unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for I ask him, What doth he mean by the
word <hi>[Person]</hi> whether the God-head, or both unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
If he place the <hi>personality</hi> upon the <hi>Godhead,</hi>
it resolveth into the second particular already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Godhead</hi> of Christ is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a <hi>person,</hi> but an <hi>invisible Power and Life:</hi> if
he place it upon the <hi>Manhood</hi> as united with the
<hi>Godhead,</hi> this is contrary to their own doctrin, who
teach, that <hi>the Word did assume the nature of Man,
but not the person, otherwise he would be two persons,</hi>
and thus they distinguish the <hi>personality</hi> from the
<hi>nature of man:</hi> but this is a most foolish, and
groundless distinction, that they have borrowed
from the Popish School-men. The Scriptur telleth
us nothing of this nicity, yet we do acknowledge
the person of Christ.</p>
            <p>10. And if by <hi>Person</hi> they understand his <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
or <hi>the man Christ Iesus,</hi> we believe that Christ
is man, and a <hi>singular man,</hi> that is to say, <hi>he is not
two,</hi> or <hi>many men, but one onely man:</hi> as also he is
singular for the excellency of his nature, even as
Man.</p>
            <p>11. So that, whatever excellency any other man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hath in his nature, Christ hath the same, and also
far greater, and more excellent in his, who
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58863:59"/>
               <hi>is the heavenly Man,</hi> or <hi>Lord from heaven, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Adam, that is a quickening Spirit,</hi> whereas
other men, in comparison of him, yea <hi>Adam the
first Man, is</hi> but <hi>of the Earth, Earthly.</hi> So that,
as farr as the most high heavens do excell the base
and low Earth, so farr doth Christ even as Man,
excell all other men, and that not onely in <hi>accidents,</hi>
as the Popish school-men, and the Presbyterian
Teachers, following them, do teach: but in <hi>nature</hi>
and <hi>Substance.</hi> And therefore, as the Heavens do
influence the Earth, and make it fruitfull, by the
virtue, that proceedeth therefrom, so <hi>the heavenly
Man Christ Iesus doth influence all other men, by his
Light and Life,</hi> that they may be fruitfull in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and righteousuess: and who remaine unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
it is not for want of the Life and Spirit of the
Heavenly Man, as not influencing them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
that by unbeliefe they harden their hearts
against his <hi>Heavenly breathings and influences.</hi> And
this distinction betwixt the very nature of the <hi>Soul</hi>
and <hi>Spirit of Christ as man,</hi> amd that of the soules of
all other men, is clearly held forth by <hi>Paul,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the wisdom given him of God, that whereas
the Soul of any other, as namely the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi>
was made <hi>a living Soul, the second Adam is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
Spirit,</hi> who <hi>quickens both the Souls and bodys of
other men,</hi> who in faith receive his <hi>quickening life and
Spirit:</hi> and whatever virtue the Souls of any other
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58863:59"/>
holy men have to quicken others, they have it not
of themselvs, nor yet immediatly of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but they derive it from the heavenly man,
or second Adam Christ Jesus, who hath it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
of the Father, who is the <hi>Mediator between God
and Man, even the Man Christ Iesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>12. And this doth manifestly hold forth a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
dignity and excellency in the nature of the
Man Christ Jesus, even as a man, above the nature
of all other men and Angels, which the Papists and
Presbyterian Teachers do both deny.</p>
            <p>13. And thus it may appear, how much more

            <argument>
               <p>1. The fourth accusation is false, for we owne no
other Iesus Christ, but him who was born of the
Virgin Mary. 2. He was the true Christ of God
before. 3. That the man Christ Iesus was from
the beginning. 4. Some Scripturs brought and
opened to prove this, as <hi>Eph: 3: 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Joh: 6: 38.
1 Cor: 15: 47, 48. Joh: 3: 13. Eph: 4: 9.
1 Cor: 10: 3, 4.</hi> the same proved from <hi>1 Tim:
2: 5.</hi> and <hi>1 Cor: 11: 3. 5.</hi> Christ was anointed
from the beginning, <hi>Prov: 8: 23. Psal: 2: 6.</hi>
6. The Man Christ before <hi>Abraham and John
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58863:60"/>
the Baptist.</hi> 7. Some more Scripturs opened, as
<hi>Psal. 110: 34. Amos 2: 13. Heb. 6: 6. Rev:
11: 18.</hi> And some more Scripturs opened out of
the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> to prove that the Man Christ
was from the beginning, as <hi>Gen. 32: 24. Gen.
19: 24. 8.</hi> That the outward flesh and blood is
not properly the Man, but the Soul or inward man.
9. More Scripturs opened out of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as <hi>Ezek. 1: 26, 27. Dan. 7: 9. 10.</hi> Christ
his Soul and heavenly flesh and blood from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
11. The Soul, Life, or Spirit of the
Heavenly Man doth as far extend as his heavenly
flesh and blood, even to all the Saints. 12. Though
they have not the center or root of his Soul and Life
in them, but onely a measure, ray or emanation of
it. 13. The Scripture no where saith that Christ
did take his Soul, but onely his outward flesh of the
Virgin, and so according to the flesh he was onely
the Son of Mary, David and Abraham by virtue
of his outward conception and birth.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> fourth Particular, <hi>whereof he accuseth
us, is, that we deny</hi> Iesus the Son of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>to be the alone true Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This is a false accusation; We own
no other Jesus Christ, but him, that was born of
the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> who, as concerning the flesh is
the <hi>Son of Mary,</hi> and the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the
Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58863:60"/>2. And yet he was the true Christ of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he took flesh, and before he was the Son of
Mary, or David, or of Abraham: for his being born
of the Virgin Mary made him not to be Christ, as
if he had not been Christ before, But he was Christ
before, even from the beginning, as I shall prove
clearly out of Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3: 9. it is said expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly,
that <hi>God created all things by Iesus Christ.</hi> Now
if all things were created by Jesus Christ, then Jesus
Christ was before all things; for <hi>the cause is always
before the effect,</hi> at least <hi>in order of nature.</hi> But to
this they <hi>object,</hi> that by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is meant <hi>the
Word onely</hi> in this place, whereas the <hi>Word onely</hi> is
not properly <hi>the Christ,</hi> but the Word as cloathed
with the Manhood, or the Man as united with the
Word. And so I <hi>answer,</hi> that the <hi>Word onely</hi>
is not properly <hi>the Christ</hi> without the Manhood;
but it is the Word made Flesh, or made Man,
And therefore seing the Apostle by the Spirit
of God hath declared that all things were created
by Jesus Christ, and that Jesus Christ signifieth
properly <hi>the Word made Flesh,</hi> or <hi>made Man,</hi> it is
clear, that according unto the Apostle, the Word
was mad flesh or Man, even from the beginning.</p>
            <p>3. And this will yet more appear, by comparing
this place with other places of Scripture, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6:
38. <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine
own will, but the will of him that sent me.</hi> Now
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58863:61"/>
Christ spake this, not simply as the Word or as God,
but as Man; for as God he had no will of his own
distinct from the will of the Father, for the Father
and the Word have but one onely will: whereas
the Man, or Manhood of Christ hath indeed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
will, which yet is always in union with the
will of the Father. And seing Christ spake this as
Man, it is clear from his own words, that as Man, he
came down from heaven, and was Man before he
descended to take part of our flesh in the <hi>Virgins</hi>
womb, and therefore Paul calleth him <hi>the Second
Adam, the Lord from heaven,</hi> and that <hi>heavenly
Man</hi> 1 Cor: 15: 47, 48. Also it is clear, that
Christ himself speaketh in the 6 of <hi>Iohn</hi> of his flesh
and blood, that did come down from heaven,
whereof men must eat and drink, to the end that
they may live by Christ <hi>Iohn</hi> 6: 51. <hi>I am that living
bread, which came down from heaven, If any man eat
of this bread, he shall live for ever. And the bread
that I will give is my flesh.</hi> Now many understood
not that saying in that day (as many at this day do
not understand it) for they thought he had spoken
of Earthly flesh and blood, and therefore they were
offended, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> said, <hi>How can this man give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his
flesh and blood to eat?</hi> Whereas Jesus understood
it of his heavenly flesh and blood: therefore he said
unto them, <hi>Doth this offend you? What if ye shall
see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58863:61"/>
So that Christ was the Son of Man, before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
that is to say, true Man; for <hi>Son of man</hi>
is a <hi>Syriack</hi> phrase signifying <hi>man.</hi> Compare with
this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3: 13. <hi>No man ascendeth up to heaven, but
he that came down from heaven, the Son of man
which is in heaven;</hi> see also <hi>Eph:</hi> 4: 9, 10. <hi>Now
in that he ascended, what is it but that he also descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the lowest parts of the Earth? He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
is the same that ascended farr above all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
that he might fill all things.</hi> And this will yet
further appear, if we shall consider what <hi>Paul</hi> writes
of this mystery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 3, 4. that the <hi>Fathers</hi>
[to wit, the people of <hi>Israel]</hi> (long before Christ
came outwardly in the flesh) <hi>did all eat the same
spirituall meat, and did all drink the same spirituall
drink, for they drank of the Spirituall Rock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> Nor can it
be said that it must be understood figuratively, to
wit, <hi>the Rock</hi> signified <hi>Christ;</hi> for we read no where
in the Scriptur of any Rock that followed the people
in the wilderness as outwardly, that was a figure
or type of Christ; but <hi>Christ himself was that Rock
that followed them.</hi> And certainly if the Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ came outwardly in the flesh, had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot eat of the flesh of Christ, and drunk of his blood,
they could not have had life by him: but they had life
by him, and therefore they did eat his flesh and drink
his blood. And therefore Christ had flesh and blood,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58863:62"/>
to wit, heavenly and spirituall, even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
on which the Saints in all ages did feed, even
from the beginning, such as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah, Abel,
Henoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. And seing Christ had
flesh &amp; blood from the beginning, he was man from
the beginning; for as God simply, he can not have
flesh and blood, For <hi>God is a Spirit;</hi> therefore it is
the flesh and blood of Christ as he is Man or the Son
of Man, as Christ said <hi>unless ye eat the flesh of the
Son of man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. All which prove effectually that the Man
Christ Jesus was from the beginning, and if the man
Christ Jesus had not been from the beginning, it
would follow that the Church all along from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
had wanted a Mediator and Head, for it
is the Man Christ Jesus united with the Godhead
of the <hi>Logos,</hi> that is the Mediator betwixt God and
man, as <hi>Paul</hi> declared 1 <hi>Tim. 2: 5. and the Head
of every man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God.</hi>
By <hi>Christ,</hi> Paul in this place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 3. understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>the Man Christ,</hi> which he placeth as a middle
between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men:</hi> so that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>head</hi> of
every man. But it is most absurd to suppose; that
the Church and Saints all along, untill Christ came
outwardly in flesh, wanted a Mediator and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
or that they wanted a head; for even as the
naturall body can not live without its head, so nor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58863:62"/>
can the Church, which is the body of Christ, live
without its head, which is the Man Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>5. But let us descend more particularly into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places of the Old Testament, and we shall
see the same truth confirmed abundantly, <hi>Prov.</hi>
8: 23. <hi>I was anoynted from the age, from the beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
so the words should be translated, the Hebrew
word <hi>nissakti</hi> signifyeth <hi>anoynted,</hi> and is so rendered
by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Lexicon,</hi> and also by the English
Bible <hi>Psal.</hi> 2: 6. in the margine, <hi>I have anoynted my
King upon my holy hill of Zion;</hi> the Hebrew root is
the same in both places, and both places are to be
understood of Christ, as is generally confessed.</p>
            <p>6. Now <hi>Christ</hi> signifyeth <hi>Anoynted,</hi> and it is
the Man Christ that is Anoynted with the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and not the Word or <hi>Logos,</hi> which is <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for the <hi>Godhead</hi> anoynts not the <hi>Godhead,</hi> but
it is the <hi>Godhead</hi> that doth anoynt the <hi>Manhood</hi> of
Christ, which Manhood hath been Anoynted from
the beginning, and therefore the Man Christ hath
been from the beginning, who is Gods <hi>Anoynted
King,</hi> and the Head of his Church in all Ages, <hi>the
First and the Last,</hi> even <hi>the first-born of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
who said to the Jewes, <hi>Before Abraham was
I am:</hi> and it was the Man Christ that said this to
the Jewes: and of him John the Baptist thus declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1: 30. <hi>there cometh after me a man that
is preferred unto me, for he was before me,</hi> and this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58863:63"/>
was the man Christ of whom he spake. Again let
us consider <hi>Psal.</hi> 110: 1, 3, 4. <hi>The Lord said unto
my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, untill I make
thine enemys thy footstool.</hi> and ver. 3. <hi>from the womb
before the morning-star I have begotten thee,</hi> so the
Septuagint and Vulgar Latin, which doth little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the Hebrew it self in this place. And vers.
4. <hi>Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek.</hi>
Now that Christ as man is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and not simply the <hi>Logos</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> I prove,
First, becaus here are two Lords, <hi>The Lord said
unto my Lord,</hi> the Father speaking unto the Man
Christ, for indeed the Man Christ is a distinct Lord
from the Father, as he is a distinct Being and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
as Man; and as Man he is a Lord and King,
who said <hi>All power in Heaven and Earth is given
me of my Father:</hi> but the <hi>Word</hi> simply considere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
is not a distinct Lord from the Father, becaus not
a distinct Being or Substance. Secondly, it is the
Man Christ that is Gods high Priest, and not the
<hi>Word</hi> barely considered, for a <hi>Priest</hi> is one that
prayeth unto God for the People, and mediats o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
interceeds betwixt God and them; but the <hi>Word</hi>

               </gap>
a distinct Substance or Being from the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whereas the Man Christ is a distinct Being, although

               </gap>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58863:63"/>
Man from the beginning, according to
which the Apostle said <hi>Iesus Christ the same yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to day and forever. Yesterday,</hi> that is, from
the beginning; <hi>to day,</hi> that is, at present; <hi>and for
ever,</hi> that is, in all time and ages to come. This is
the promised <hi>Seed,</hi> which God promised to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
after the fall, and actually gave unto them,
even <hi>the Seed of the Woman,</hi> that should <hi>bruise the

to his outward birth in the flesh, for many
ages, yet from the beginning this Heavenly Man
the promised <hi>Seed</hi> did inwardly come into the hearts

Man Christ was from the beginning,</hi> see <hi>Gen.</hi> 32: 24.
<hi>Now when Iacob was left alone, there wrestled a
man with him unto the breaking of the day:</hi> and that
this was Christ, is clear from <hi>Hosea.</hi> 12: 4. <hi>For it
was such a man, as was also the LORD GOD of
Hosts, to whom he prayed and made supplication;</hi>
whom Hosea calleth also the <hi>Angel.</hi> See also <hi>Gen.</hi>
18. where the Man Christ appeared unto Abraham
with two Angels, that are called <hi>men,</hi> ver. 2. (for
Angels are a sort of Heavenly Men) and one of
these three men Abraham prayed unto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was the Man Christ, who after he had talked

<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah with fire and brimston.</hi>
And <hi>Gen.</hi> 19: 24. it is said <hi>The Lord rained from the

man, or Angel, but the Heavenly Man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

that it was onely God that appeared thus, in
a fantastical forme and shape of a man, and not
that it was really the Man Christ Jesus: yet this is
by no means to be granted, otherwise we should

the cross,</hi> but onely that it was a phantasme or phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical

               </gap>ad, <hi>Rev.</hi>
1: from ver. 13 to 19. And this same Man the
Lord Jesus Christ <hi>Isaiah</hi> did see, Isa. 6. sitting upon
his heavenly Throne, so that <hi>his traine</hi> or <hi>skirts filled
the Temple.</hi> The same also appeared unto <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Gen. 3: 8, 9, 10. nor will it prove that he whom

it is said that he saw <hi>as the similitude of a man,</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58863:65"/>
for even when Christ came outwardly in the flesh,
he is said to be found <hi>in fashion</hi> or <hi>likeness as a Man,</hi>
and yet he was a true Man, and did truely and really
partake of our flesh and blood by his outward birth.</p>
            <p>10. Yet before this, even from the beginning,
he was the heavenly Man, and had his Soul and
Heavenly flesh and blood, by which he reached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Saints in all ages, and did refresh and feed
them unto eternall Life. And forasmuch as he gave
them of his flesh and blood from heaven, he also
gave them of his Life or Spirit, as he is <hi>the Heavenly
Man,</hi> or <hi>Second Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. For the Life or Spirit of the Second Adam
doth extend, as farr, as his heavenly flesh and blood.
And thus the <hi>Word was made Flesh even from the
beginning,</hi> and <hi>dwelt in us,</hi> as in all Ages; and they
<hi>beheld his glory, as the glory of the onely-Begotten of
the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</hi> yet he dwelleth
not onely in the Saints, but also without them, in
himself, and did so from the beginning.</p>
            <p>12. For the Saints can not contain Christ, even
as Man; they onely partake of some measure or ray,
or emanation of him, they have not the Center or
spring of his Soul and Life in them, but onely an
emanation or stream of it: the Center and Spring
it self was for most part in heaven, untill it descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and it shall not be found that Christ became

onely that he <hi>took flesh, and was the Son of Mary,
David and Abraham according to the flesh:</hi> but
according to his Heavenly Nature, even as man,
he was the Son of God, and was the Father and
Lord of all the Faithfull in all Ages, therefore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid

            <argument>
               <p>1. That <hi>Christ is in every man,</hi> yea in every <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in a true sense proved from Scripture. 2. That
it derogats no more from the honour of Christ then
from the honour of God the Father that <hi>he is in all
things. 3. Christ in the saints,</hi> proved from
Scripture. 4. <hi>Yea in all men,</hi> even the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
proved from Scripture. 5. The God-head
properly doth not suffer in men but the soule or life
of Iesus Christ the heavenly man. 6. More Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to prove that <hi>Christ suffers in the wicked</hi> as
<hi>Heb. 6. 6. Rev. 11. 8. 7. Paul</hi> preached
<hi>Christ in the Corinthians and Galatians</hi> when
unbelievers proved from <hi>1 Cor. 2. 2. Gal. 1. 3.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58863:66"/>
Eph. 3. 8. 1. Tim. 3. 16. 8.</hi> If Christ be in the
Saints he must be <hi>in all men,</hi> proved from a most
convincing reason, that otherwayes he would be
divided from himself and in discontinued places.
9. Christ is otherwayes in all men then in the other
inferior creaturs in regard of his operations. 10. And
otherwise in the Saints, then in other men, not only
in regard of operation but also in regard of union and
communion. 11. How Christ is, and yet is not, in
unbelievers in different respects, cleared by two
manifest examples. 12. Christ is otherwise in the
outward body and temple that suffered at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
then in the Saints. 13. The Saints union with God is
but mediat through the heavenly man Christ where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the union of Christ with God is immediat. 14. The
Saints not Christ, but Christians, and receive all
things from God by the Heavenly Man Christ Iesus:
15. How Christ hath given eternall life to all flesh or
all mankind according to <hi>John</hi> 17. 2. which place of
Scripture is falsly translated in our English Bible.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>THe</hi> fifth Particular <hi>whereof he accuseth us
is, that we affirme Christ to be</hi> a common sort
of thing, to be found in every man, as it was
in the Son of Mary, even the common Light
to be found in the mind of every man in the world.</p>
            <p>1. Answer. <hi>That</hi> Christ is in every man, yea in
every creature, <hi>we do boldly affirme, conforme to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58863:67"/>
the Scripture, which saith,</hi> all things were created
by him, even Iesus Christ the incarmate Word, <hi>or</hi> Word
made flesh, <hi>and therefor</hi> he is in all things: <hi>and as</hi> Iohn
<hi>said,</hi> he was in the world and the world was made by
him; <hi>for indeed it is impossible that the maker can be
separated from the thing that is made, I say; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Scripture that seeing</hi> all creaturs were made
by Iesus Christ, therefore he is in them all, <hi>even as
God is in all, giving them [and upholding them]
their beings, and ministring unto every thing, what
is needfull and fit, for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Doth it any more derogat from the honour
and glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he is <hi>in all,</hi> then it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
from the honour and glory of God the <hi>Father,</hi>
who is in <hi>all, and through all, blessed in himself for
ever more.</hi> For as God is a pure being and life, that
nothing can defile, even so is Christ Jesus, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
and incontaminable life and being, &amp; as
<hi>God is Light, so Christ is Light,</hi> a <hi>Light</hi> that <hi>shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
every where,</hi> even in the <hi>darkness,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
but the <hi>darkness</hi> cannot <hi>comprehend it,</hi> nor
can the darkness obscure and darken it, onely it can
and doth obscure and darken the eyes, of them who
are in darkness, that they cannot see nor behold the
glory of the <hi>Light.</hi> But more particularly to come
to the matter in hand, I shall first prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>that Christ is in the Saints;</hi> and secondly both
from Scripture and good reason, that is grounded
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58863:67"/>
on Scripture, that <hi>he is in all men,</hi> in a true sense;
yea in all creatures. And thirdly I shall shew that
in regard of his operations, he is otherwise in men,
then in the other creaturs of an inferior degree.
And fourthly that he is otherwise in the Saints, then
in other men, and that not onely in regard of <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but also in regard of <hi>union</hi> and <hi>communion.</hi> And
fiftly, that he is otherwise in the vessell or temple,
that suffered on the Crosse at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and is now
glorifyed in heaven, then he is in any, or in all of
the Saints, or in any other creaturs whatsoever
howsoever excellent.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>As to the first that Christ is in the Saints, see</hi>
Ioh. 6: 56. he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood, dwelleth in me and I in him, <hi>see also</hi>
Iohn 17. 23. I in them and thou in me &amp;c. <hi>see again,</hi>
Rom. 8. 10. And if Christ be in you the body is dead,
Eph. 3. 17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by
faith, Collos. 1. 27. Christ in you the hope of glory,
2 Cor. 13. 3. Seing that ye seek a proofe of Christ speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap>s,
how that Iesus Christ is in you, unless ye be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.
<hi>Many more Scriptures may be brought,
but these shall suffice to shew that</hi> Christ is in the
Saints, <hi>and</hi> Christ <hi>is</hi> Gods <hi>anointed</hi> King, Priest,
<hi>and</hi> Prophet, <hi>and therefor by</hi> Christ <hi>is not to be
understood the</hi> Word <hi>simply considered, as in God,
but the</hi> incarnate <hi>or</hi> ingrafted Word, <hi>or the</hi> Word
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58863:68"/>
made flesh <hi>that</hi> dwelleth in the Saints, Ioh. 1. 14.
<hi>for the</hi> Word <hi>simply considered as in God, is not
the anointed, but the annointer, whereas Christ is
Gods anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Secondly that</hi> Christ is in all men, even in the
wicked, <hi>see</hi> Amos 2. 13. Behold I am pressed under
you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaves. <hi>This
cannot be understood of God, or the</hi> Word <hi>simply
considered, that cannot be pressed or suffer any grief
but it is well understood of the</hi> incarnat, <hi>or</hi> ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
Word, <hi>to wit, the</hi> precious Seed <hi>of the</hi> life of
Christ in us. <hi>that is exceeding tender and is capable
of grief, and suffering, by mens sins.</hi> Psal. 95. 10.
Fourty years long was I grieved in this generation,
Isajah 63. 9, 10. In all their affliction, he was aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and the Angel of his presence saved them, in
his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare
them and caryed them all the days of old, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
and vexed his holy Spirit &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. This is the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> of the <hi>heavenly man
Christ Iesus,</hi> or the <hi>ingrafted</hi> or <hi>incarnat Word,</hi> that
is capable of grief and suffering, whereas the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is not capable of any suffering or grief, for all
suffering and grief is a finite and temporall thing,
whereas nothing can be in God but that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
and eternall, otherwise God would not be in all
respects, an infinite being which is <hi>absurd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. See again. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 6. They who fall away
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58863:68"/>
from Christ are said <hi>to crucify to themselvs the Son of
God afresh.</hi> Now they could not crucify him, if
he were not <hi>in them,</hi> because he was not outwardly
present with them, in his body of flesh: so that they
could not crucify him outwardly: and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8.
our Lord is said to be <hi>crucified in Spirituall Sodom and
Egypt,</hi> that is, the Apostat Church, <hi>Babylon, the
Mother of fornications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. And when <hi>Paul</hi> first preached to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and <hi>Galathians,</hi> in the time of their heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism;
he preached <hi>Christ crucified in them,</hi> see
1 <hi>Cor. 2. 1. Gal.</hi> 3. 1. The Words in both places
according to the Greek, are <hi>crucified in you:</hi> And
it was a great part of the mystery that <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to wit, <hi>Christ in the Gentiles,</hi>
which Sathan and his ministers laboured to hide and
obscure, as they do at this present, but Christ and
his Ministers labour to make known. See <hi>Collos.
1. 27. To whom God would make known, what is the
riches of the glory of this Mystery in the Gentiles.</hi> And
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 8. he preached the <hi>unsearchable riches of Christ
in the Gentiles.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. God manifest in
the flesh preached in the Gentiles,</hi> so the Greek in all
these places, but the Translaters of the Bible, not
understanding this so blessed &amp; comfortable a truth,
have translated these places, <hi>among,</hi> and not <hi>in,</hi>
whereas if Christ was among them, he was also in
them, seeing he was not outwardly present among
them, in his body of flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:58863:69"/>8. And seeing that both they who are not Saints,
as well as they who are Saints, are created by Jesus
Christ, he must needs be as really <hi>in</hi> the one, as in
the other. Also seing the Saints &amp; the wicked in this
world, walk up and down together, and are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
among one another, good and sound reason
teacheth us, that if <hi>Christ be in the Saints, he</hi> must
needs be <hi>in all men,</hi> yea <hi>in all this world,</hi> through
which the Saints are scattered, otherwise Christ
would be divided from himself, and be discontinued,
and in discontinued places, which is impossible, as
all men of sound reason must needs acknowledge.</p>
            <p>9. Thirdly, all though <hi>Christ</hi> be <hi>in all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs,</hi>
yet he is otherwise <hi>in all men,</hi> then <hi>in</hi> the
others creaturs, that are of an inferiour degree, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mankind, in regard of operation, because he exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or putteth forth, more noble operations, in and
upon men, then in other creaturs, men having
immortall souls that are more noble principles and
subjects of operation, then the inferiour creaturs
have, so that <hi>all men,</hi> even the <hi>worst of men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
of knowing and enjoying the <hi>blessed life</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erior creaturs are not, and that
which hinders them from this knowledge and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not the want of capacity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is in the
other creaturs, out sin, and especially the sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;
that they will not come unto him, who is
come unto them, that they may have life, as he
complained against the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:58863:69"/>10. Fourthly, Christ is otherwise <hi>in the Saints,</hi>
then in other men, and that not only in regard of
<hi>operation,</hi> but also in regard of <hi>union</hi> and <hi>communion,</hi>
for the <hi>Saints</hi> are <hi>joyned</hi> unto him by living bonds,
as the <hi>branches</hi> are unto the <hi>vine,</hi> and as the living
members of the body are unto the head, and they
are one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. Eph. 4. 15, 16. Ioh.
15. 5. Ioh.</hi> 17. 23. Also they have <hi>communion,</hi> both
with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> Christ Jesus, 1 Joh.
1. 3. <hi>and one with another</hi> in him, 1 Joh. 1. 7. and
<hi>Christ dwelleth in the hearts of the Saints by Faith,
Eph.</hi> 3. 17. And he is <hi>formed in them, Gal.</hi> 4. 19.
So that <hi>they are his mother</hi> who bring him forth, by
a <hi>Spirituall and divine birth, Matth.</hi> 12. 49. And
thus the Church brought him forth, long after he
was outwardly born, and crucified, and rose and
ascended, <hi>Revel. 12. 5. And she brought forth a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
who was to rule all Nations with a rod of iron,</hi>
this is the <hi>hidden man of the heart, 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 4. which

13. 14. who is the <hi>new man, Eph</hi> 24. And the

47, 48.</hi> So that having eat his flesh and drunk his
blood, they are members of his body, of his flesh,
and of his bones, Eph. 5. 30. whereas all other men,
who are not Saints, they have no union nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ, and he <hi>dwelleth</hi> not <hi>in them by

faith,</hi> he is not <hi>formed in them,</hi> nor <hi>revealed,</hi> as
he is <hi>in the Saints,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> declared <hi>he was in him,</hi> at
his conversion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 18. and then he preached
him, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>in the Gentiles,</hi> to the end that he
might be revealed <hi>in them,</hi> as he was <hi>in him,</hi> and
thus the being of Christ in the Saints, is after <hi>a more
speciall presence,</hi> then he is in others, whose <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are darkened,</hi> being <hi>alienated from the
life of God, through the ignorance that is in them,
becaus of the blindness of their heart. Eph.</hi> 4. 18.
And here observe, that he doth not say, <hi>becaus
that the life of God is not in them,</hi> but <hi>becaus of their
blindness and ignorance</hi> they were <hi>alienated and
estranged from it, being past feeling:</hi> so that once
they had a feeling of this Life, and therefore it was
in them, which Life is C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>11. Now becaus that <hi>Christ is not in Vnbeliever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
according to that special presence and revelation, as
he is <hi>in the Saints and Believers;</hi> but <hi>is hid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed
in them,</hi> therefore it is that sometimes
Christ is said not to be in them, even as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
say, in a cloudy and dark night, when no
<hi>Starres</hi> appear in the aire or Firmament, that they
are not in it, whereas they are in it, even then, but
they do not appear in it as when the air is clear. For
<hi>Christ the Light shineth in the darkness,</hi> although

8. In what sort of expressions I have heard some
of our Friends pray to Christ in our Meetings, and
which I have also used in prayer to my great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
9. That becaus all true Christians do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Man Christ Iesus, he, to wit, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Man must needs be really present in and
among them, in their meetings, and consequently
every where; but this is not meant of his externall
person. 10. Who pray unto the Man Christ and
do not believe him to be present, are <hi>real Idolaters,</hi>
as <hi>this Author of the Postscript.</hi> 11. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
refuted, that <hi>he is present as God, not
as Man.</hi> 12. That the Man Christ heareth our
prayers, proveth that he is present every where.
13. That distinction refuted that the Man Christ
Iesus knoweth our prayers and thoughts not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
perception, but by having them revealed to
him by the Godhead, which is the Popish evasion
for worshipping Saints and Angels. 14. Some
places of Scripture opened, as <hi>Heb. 4: 15, 16.
Psal. 18. 9, 10. 15.</hi> That Christ did immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kow the thoughts of men, proved from divers
<hi>Scripturs. 16. Omnipercipiency</hi> of the Soul of
Christ proveth him as man to be <hi>Omnipresent.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58863:76"/>1. ANd for these causes it is, that all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
do worship the Man Christ Jesus,
and pray unto him, as they do unto the
Father: so that he is a true and proper
object of Divine adoration, as is the Father, yea it
is in and through him that we can onely in a true
and acceptable way worship the Father, and call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
            <p>2. And even in the days of his flesh, they who saw
his glory, and did truely know what he was, did both
believe in him and pray unto him, and he bid his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
believe in him, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also
in me,</hi> said he, that is, <hi>in me,</hi> the Man Christ Jesus
whom God hath sent.</p>
            <p>3. And seing we are to believe in him, we are
also to call upon him, for that which is the proper
object of true Faith, is also the proper object of
true Divine adoration, as accordingly we find,
that they who had true faith in him, in the days of
his flesh did also worship him and pray unto him, as
the <hi>Wise men that came from the East</hi> did worship
him, even when he was an Infant, Matth. 2: 11.
<hi>And when they were come into the house, they saw the
young Child with Mary his mother, and fell down
and worshipped him.</hi> And here observe, it is not
said, <hi>they worshipped Mary his mother,</hi> no: they
were more wise, although they did know that she
was blessed above all Women, yet they did also
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58863:76"/>
know that she was not an object of Divine worship,
as Christ was. Surely these men, although com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
accounted <hi>Heathens,</hi> had more sound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
then all the <hi>wise men,</hi> so called, of the
<hi>Popish Church,</hi> who worship Mary the mother of
Jesus, and pray unto her, as they do also unto other
Saints, which is gross idolatry. Again see Matth.
8: 2. <hi>And behold there came a Leper, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, saying, Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me
clean,</hi> and this was the Man Jesus.</p>
            <p>4. And many such examples are to be found in
Scripture of those that worshipped him in the days
of his flesh, see Matth. 9: 18. and 14: 33. and 15:
25. And after his Resurrection the Disciples both
Men and Women did worship him, see Matth. 28.
9. 17. as no doubt they did so before and after his
Ascension the Disciples did call upon him, see <hi>Act.</hi>
7: 59. <hi>And they stoned Stephen, calling and saying,
Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 9: 21. the
Disciples are said to be they that call on this Name,
to wit, <hi>IESVS;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saluteth the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
thus, 1 Cor. 1: 3. <hi>Grace be unto you and peace
from God our Father, and from our Lord Iesus
Christ:</hi> and ver. 2. <hi>unto the Church of God which is
at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Iesus
called Saints, with all that in every place call upon
the Name of Iesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs.</hi> And it is the will and command of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58863:77"/>
that <hi>at the Name of Iesus every knee should
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow, and every tongue confess to the glory of God the
Father.</hi> So that whatever honour or worship is
given to the Man Christ Jesus, it redounds to the
Father. <hi>He that honours the Son, honours the Father,
and he that honours not the Son, honours not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And Rev. 5: 11, 12, 13, 14. All the <hi>Saints</hi>
and <hi>Angels</hi> and every creature are brought in not
onely worshipping the <hi>Father,</hi> but the <hi>Lamb, that
was slain,</hi> and this is the <hi>Man Christ Iesus,</hi> or <hi>Word
incarnate;</hi> for the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Logos</hi> simply considered
<hi>never</hi> was nor can be <hi>slain.</hi> All which Scripturs and
many more that could be mentioned, prove clearly
that the Saints did worship the Man Christ Jesus, and
did pray unto him. And they who believe not this
doctrin, are more blind, then the poor blind man
<hi>Bartimeus,</hi> who when <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> passed by,
saw him with the eyes of his Soul to be the Christ of
God, and prayed unto him, saying, <hi>Iesus thou Son
of David have mercy upon me;</hi> Mark 10: 46, 47.
Also the <hi>Canaanitish woman,</hi> that was not a Jew,
but in the Jewes account an <hi>Heathen,</hi> she believed
in him with a great and marvelous faith, and also
prayed unto him; and when he seemed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
her, yet she continued in prayer, saying
<hi>Lord help me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. I have been the more full and express in this
Particular, for three weighty <hi>reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58863:77"/>
               <hi>First.</hi> Becaus I know that divers <hi>Presbyteria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
Teachers in this Nation have openly professed, and
some have taught it in the Pulpit, that <hi>Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi>
or <hi>the Man Christ, is not to be worshipped,</hi> or
<hi>prayed unto,</hi> which occasioned a great contention
in their <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Presbyterys</hi> in some places, of
late years; to the great dishonour of the Christian
Religion, and of that Worthy Name, whereby
we are called.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Secondly:</hi> Becaus that some have ignorantly
accused us, that we <hi>did not pray to the Man Iesus,
nor call upon the Father in the Name of Iesus Christ;</hi>
which is a gross calumny.</p>
            <p>7. For many times have I both heard others,
and also I my self have called upon that Blessed
Name, expressly naming the words <hi>IESVS
CHRIST;</hi> although when we express not these
words, yet if we pray by the moving of his Life and
Spirit, we pray in the Name of Jesus, and also to
Jesus the Heavenly Man, that is glorified with that
glory he had with the Father before the world was.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Yea I have heard expressly such</hi> petitions <hi>put
up in our Prayers, at our Meetings, unto Christ as
Jesus,</hi> Son of David have mercy upon us, O thou
Blessed Lord Iesus, that wert crucified, and dyed for
our sins, and shed thy precious blood for us, be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
unto us. Thou that in the days of thy flesh wert
tempted of Satan, afflicted, bore our sins on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58863:78"/>
the cross, felt our infirmitys, and wert touched
with them. O thou our Mercifull High Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est,
whose tender bowels of compassion are not more strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
since thy Ascension, but rather more enlarged,
and whose love and kindness is the same towards thy
Servants in our days, as it was of old; help us, and
strengthen us: and by the power of thy Divine Life
and Spirit raise us up over all tentations, and indue us
with a measure of the same patience and resignation
that dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so fully in thee, and which thou didst so
abundantly manifest in all thy sufferings, in the days
of thy flesh. Thou art the same that thou wert, thy
heart is the same towards thy Servants, as when thou
wert outwardly present with them in the flesh. Thou
art our Advocat and Mediator in Heaven with the
Father: our Mercifull High Priest, who is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
with the feeling of our infirmitys. Thou, even
Thou, Blessed Iesus, thou knowest our most secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and breathings, which we offer up unto thee, in
the enablings of thy blessed Life and Spirit, that thou
mayest present them unto thy Father and our Father,
that in thee, we may be accepted, and our services al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and for thy sake our defects and short comings, our
sins and transgressions that we have committed, may
be forgiven us. <hi>These and such like expressions fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used by us in prayer, both in secret, and
also in publick, in our Assemblys, plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that we worship and pray unto the Mediator
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58863:78"/>
betwixt God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, the
anoynted King, Priest and Prophet of his People,
who also is God over all bessed forever. For he is
that Mighty One, upon whom the Father hath laid
help, so that although the Father himself loveth us,
and is most willing and ready to help us in all our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitys,
yet we can no otherwayes receive his
help, but as it comes to us by the conveyance of the
Man Christ Jesus, our alone Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> My third <hi>reason,</hi> (which is mainly for
my present purpose, and which alone is enough to
conclude) is, because it demonstrats this great &amp; bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Truth, to wit; that the Man Christ Jesus is <hi>really
present in</hi> and <hi>among us</hi> [and consequently <hi>every
where)</hi> I do not mean by his externall or outward
person, for that is ascended into Heaven, but in
virtue of his Divine Life and Spirit, or Soul <hi>extended
into us in his Divine Seed and Body,</hi> which is his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
flesh and blood, wherewith he feedeth the
Souls of them that believe in him. I say Our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
the Man Jesus and praying unto him, doth
plainly demonstrate, that he is really present <hi>in</hi> and
<hi>among us,</hi> and <hi>with</hi> us, as his Name <hi>Immanuel</hi>
doth signify, not onely as God, but as Man; for it
were a most absurd thing to worship an object that
is altogether absent, as the Manhood of Christ is,
according unto these Presbyterian Teachers. We
know how the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> mocked <hi>Baals</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58863:79"/>
with a Godly zeal and indignation, on this
account, as supposing him in their account as an
absent God. <hi>Cry aloud,</hi> said he, <hi>for perhaps he is
asleep, or hath taken a journey.</hi> As for us God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that we should worship an absent Christ, or call
upon a Saviour to help us, in whom we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as really present.</p>
            <p>10. Sure I am they who pray unto him, and yet
do not believe him to be present, and have not some
sense of his presence, are <hi>real Idolaters;</hi> for they
pretend to worship an object, which wanteth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
altogether essential to an object of Divine
worship, that is, <hi>real presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Nor is it enough for them to say, <hi>he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
as God, but not as man,</hi> for if the Man be not
present, he is not to be worshipped, and if he be to
be worshipped, as most certainly he is, then he is
present, for this is one of the great motives of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and prayer, that he whom we worship and call
upon, is present to help us, as <hi>David</hi> called him
<hi>

to come and worship <hi>before his presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. But again, Our praying to the Man Jesus
doth imply, that he doth <hi>really heare our Prayers,</hi>
and is really <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>perceptive</hi> of them, and
that not onely when we use vocal prayers, but also
when we pray onely in our most secret thoughts.
Now it is impossi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le that he could hear us, and be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58863:79"/>
               <hi>sensible</hi> of our <hi>prayers,</hi> and especially of our <hi>thoughts,</hi>
if he were not <hi>immediatly present in us,</hi> and <hi>with us;</hi>
For, to say that his God-head doth reveal our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and thoughts unto the Man-hood, doth no wise
answere the strength of this reason; for <hi>hearing</hi> and
<hi>perception,</hi> are <hi>immediate acts</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> and reach
unto the <hi>objects immediately,</hi> or the <hi>objects</hi> unto
them, but what is made known by revelation sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
doth not so reach, and that cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called hearing our prayers, or being sensible
of them. As suppose that God should reveal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to a man, in <hi>Persia,</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> that I am
praying here at such a distance, that man could not be
said, to hear me praying or be sensible of the very
breathings of my soul, as when the Lord revealed
to <hi>Ananias,</hi> that <hi>Saul,</hi> who after was called <hi>Paul,</hi>
did pray, yet who will say that <hi>Ananias</hi> heard <hi>Paul</hi>
pray at that time?</p>
            <p>Surely this is such a slender and deceitfull eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
&amp; answer, as the <hi>Papists</hi> use commonly to give,
when we bring this reason against their <hi>praying unto
Saints and Angells,</hi> to wit, that they do not, nor
cannot, hear our prayers every where, becaus they are
not every where present nor can be, becaus of their
limited capacity, they tell us, that they read ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

reject, for that is not properly to hear.</p>
            <p>14. And indeed none is fit to be a Mediator, but
he that immediatly heareth our prayers, and hath a
sense of the breathings and yearnings of our souls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and is <hi>touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitys,

and Husband of our Souls, to whom we
may approach, and whom we may kiss and imbrace,
and handle with the hands of our Soul, and whose
glory we may behold; even the glory of the Word
made flesh, and dwelling in us. Whereas the glory
of the <hi>Word</hi> as it was in God, before it became flesh,
or cloathed it self with the heavenly Manhood, no
eye of Angel or Saint ever could or can behold: for
the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> simply considered, in God,

in the Heavenly Flesh or Manhood of Christ, that
is the alone proper and <hi>adequat object</hi> of the <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation

flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>seen of Angels.</hi> Observe here, it is not
<hi>God simply,</hi> but <hi>God manifest in flesh,</hi> that is seen of
Angels, and <hi>is believed on in the world;</hi> although he
was both seen of Angels, and believed on in the
world, long before he was manifest in that outward

or analogy of nature and substance; therefore
we can not graffe an apple or cherry-graffe upon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58863:85"/>
stone; or iron, or bare earth; by reason of the
great unlikenesse and distance of their natures: and
yet the <hi>Word simply</hi> and <hi>nakedly</hi> considered in God,
before it was made flesh, is more unlike unto us, and
in nature more remote from us, then an apple is
from stone, or iron. Therefore to the end that
the <hi>Word</hi> may be <hi>ingrafted into us,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> again <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
into it,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> must be <hi>incarnate,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
flesh, as we are; for <hi>all men</hi> are a sort of <hi>flesh,</hi>
and so called in <hi>Scripture,</hi> in comparison of <hi>God</hi>
that is <hi>purely a Spirit;</hi> and though the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>men</hi>

               <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet comparatively as unto God, they
are as it were <hi>flesh.</hi> And thus the <hi>Word</hi> is become
<hi>flesh,</hi> that is to say, hath advanced a step, or degree
nearer unto us, then as it was in God before any
thing was made: and the <hi>Word</hi> was first of all <hi>made

            <p>10. For it is a <hi>more noble creation</hi> then all things

about; for it rather is a strife about words, then in

is not in us, as in respect of its Fountain and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Light, and Life, that was in him, that was born of

            <p>11. I do by no means acknowledg, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the <hi>Deity</hi> had onely its Center, in that

is in every place; yea the wole in the whole, and the

not his externall person, or outward body that is

subject of holyness.</p>
            <p>11. And thus having given an account, not
onely from <hi>Luther,</hi> and those who embrace the
<hi>Augustan confession,</hi> but also from <hi>Calvin</hi> himself,
(for whom the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have so great an
esteeme) of the <hi>wonderfull power</hi> and <hi>influence,</hi>
that the <hi>Manhod</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> hath in and <hi>upon</hi> the
<hi>Saints,</hi> and of his being so <hi>near</hi> unto them. Let us
now see, what their great <hi>Seer S. R.,</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi>
of the <hi>Postscript</hi> calleth him, saith to the matter.
Almost all his Epistles, especially the First part, are
so full of expressions, concerning that <hi>nearness</hi> of
Christ to himself, and of his enjoying his Love, and
hungering more and more after the enjoyment of
it, that it is needless to cite any particular Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys
out of the book for the same: yet for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of those that have not read his book of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
I shall cite some particular places, holding
forth that wonderfull <hi>nearness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that I plead
for, and that <hi>Christ</hi> himself is <hi>present with</hi> and <hi>in</hi>
his <hi>People,</hi> and that he giveth them not onely his
comforts and Graces, but himself to be enjoyed by
them, even in this life. See 1 part, Ep. 120. <hi>If
joy and comforts</hi> (saith he) <hi>came singly and alone
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58863:92"/>
without Christ himself, I would send them back
again, the gate they came, and not make them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
But when the Kings train cometh and the King
in the midst of the company, O how am I overjoyed
with floods of love?</hi> This is such a plaine testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that it quite destroyeth that deceitfull distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that the Presbyterian Teachers have, when
they tell us, <hi>Christ is in us by his Graces, gifts, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
but not by himself.</hi> For are not his <hi>joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
his gifts, or graces and operations?</hi> and yet <hi>S. R.</hi>
saith, <hi>If these came singly and alone without Christ
himself, he would send them back again the gate they
came, and not make them welcome.</hi> And indeed
Christ can not be separat from his Graces, no more
then the Soul can be separat from the love, and joy,
that is in it, and emanates from it; or then the
Sun can be from his beames, or the fire from its heat.
Again, see 1 part, Ep. 29. <hi>I can neither speake nor
write feeling nor tasting, nor smelling, come feel,
and smell, and tast Christ, and his love, and ye shall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all it more then can be spoken: To write how sweet
the honey-comb is, is not so lovely as to eat and suck
the honey-comb, one nights rest in a bed of love with
Christ, will say more then heart can think, or tongue
can utter.</hi> Surely these words hold forth an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat
presence</hi> of Christ, for we can not tast, nor
feel that which is not really present. Again, see
Ep. 191. <hi>There is nothing will make you a Christian
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58863:93"/>
indeed, but a tast of the sweetness of Christ, come
and see, will speake best to your Soul.</hi> This plainly
implyeth that Christ is present, even to them who
are not Christians indeed, seing to tast of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ is that onely, which makes one who is
not a Christian indeed, to be a Christian. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all this, I shall cite some express testimonys for
Christ his being <hi>in the Saints.</hi> See 1 part. Ep. 43.
<hi>It's not for nothing that it's said</hi> Coloss. 1: 27.
Christ in you the hope of glory: <hi>I will be content of
no pawn of heaven, but Christ himself.</hi> And 2 part.
Ep. 1. <hi>I have good confidence,</hi> Madam, <hi>that Christ
Iesus, whom your Soul throug forrests and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
is seeking, is within you.</hi> Many more testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys
may be cited, but these may suffice, to
prove that this great <hi>Seer,</hi> in the Presbyterians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
did believe that not onely the Graces and
Comforts of Christ are in the Saints, which are as
it were his train and attendants, but that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is in the midst of them. And if it be replyed,
that by <hi>Christ</hi> his being <hi>in the Saints,</hi> he meant <hi>is
God,</hi> not <hi>as Man,</hi> as we understand it.</p>
            <p>12. To this I <hi>answer 1. God,</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos
singly</hi> considered, is <hi>not Christ,</hi> but the <hi>Word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi>
or the Word made flesh, and <hi>planted in us.</hi>
For <hi>Christ</hi> signifyeth <hi>[Anoynted,]</hi> and it is the Man
Christ, that is Gods Anoynted: and indeed we
can not see, nor tast, nor smell, nor feel, of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58863:93"/>
               <hi>naked Deity</hi> of Christ, nor converse with Christ
simply as God, but as <hi>God-Man,</hi> or the <hi>Word incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi>
and the Presbyterians commonly teach, that
there is no accesse to God, nor communion with
him, but through the Mediator Christ Jesus, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
himself teacheth, for thus he writeth on the
Hebrews, cap. 1: ver. 2. <hi>That God is no otherwise
revealed to us then in Christ, for there is so great a
brightness in the essence of God, that it blindeth our
eyes, till it shine upon us in Christ.</hi> Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that we are as blind men to the Light of
God, unless it shine to us in Christ. By this it is
clear, that <hi>Christ</hi> importeth somewhat beside the
<hi>essence of God,</hi> which is his <hi>Manhood,</hi> or as he is
the Word incarnate.</p>
            <p>But 2. The Presbyterians now adays would not
onely exclude Christ as Man, but even as God, out
of his Saints, for they are greatly offended at <hi>Iohn
Owen,</hi> an <hi>Independent</hi> Teacher, who in his book
on <hi>the Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> hath affirmed,
that <hi>the Holy Ghost himself doth really indwell in the
Saints,</hi> so that not onely the graces and gifts of the
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> but he <hi>himself</hi> is an <hi>indweller in them,</hi>
and is <hi>united unto them,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> to <hi>him:</hi> and for this
<hi>Caudry,</hi> a Presbyterian hath found fault with him.</p>
            <p>And 3. I shall produce some of <hi>S. R.</hi> his own
words, and leave them to the Reader, whether they
do not hold forth somewhat of the truth of that,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58863:94"/>
which I plead for, although I believe he had not a
distinct and explicite understanding of it. See 2
part, Ep. 38. <hi>I know</hi> (said he) <hi>God is casten (if I
may so speak) in a sweet mould and lovely image, in
the person of that heavens-Iewel the Man Christ, and
that the steps of that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eep ascent and stair to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
is the flesh of Christ, the new and living way.</hi>
Surely these words import no lesse, but that Christ
as Man, although not as to his external person,
yet in some other mysterious way, is present with
the Saints on Earth, seing they can not see God, as
in himself, but as he is to be seen in that <hi>lovely
image</hi> of the <hi>Man Christ,</hi> whose flesh is the steps and
stair to the Godhead. And therefore we must have
<hi>that flesh in us,</hi> else we can not ascend to any true
communion with him in our hearts.</p>
            <p>13. But again, see a more express testimony,
that the <hi>Man Christ is in the Saints,</hi> &amp; buddeth forth
blossometh and beareth fruit in them part 3. Ep. 13.
<hi>But the Plant of Renown, the Man whose Name is the</hi>

                  </gap>oble Rose, casting a sweet smell through Heaven
and Earth, and must grow; and in the same garden
with him, grow the Saints.</hi> Now I would ask the
Author of the <hi>Postcript,</hi> Do these words of <hi>S. R.</hi>
hold forth a <hi>false Christ,</hi> or another Jesus, then the

               </gap> Jesus, the Son of Mary? If they do not, then
why doth he accuse the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as holding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ, onely becaus they speak of <hi>Christ in
them,</hi> as <hi>formed in them,</hi> budding and growing, and
bringing forth fruit of Life, who is <hi>the Plant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Root, the Seed, and Word Ingrafted.</hi>
And surely it is impossible to understand how the
Man Christ Jesus casts a sweet smell through Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, if he is not present both in Heaven
and Earth. Again, see 1 part. Ep. 127. <hi>If Christ
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave we to rejoyce in the free salvation of our Lord,
and to set up our banners, in the Name of our God!</hi>
I have cited these passages the rather, becaus many
Presbyterian Teachers, as wel as others, when they
hear, or read such words as proceeding from us,
namely, that Christ is a Seed or Plant of Life in us,
growing, sprouting, budding, blossoming and
bearing fruit, and that this Heavenly Seed and Plant,
is a tender Plant, as he is so called in Scripture, that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58863:95"/>
is bruised and wounded by mens sins, and hindered
to bring forth fruit in them, that give place to sin,
but groweth strong, and becometh exceeding fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
in all them, that joyn to it, and love it, and
deny those things that are contrary to its nature,
such as all kinds of sin are; then they cry out, <hi>horrid
blasphemy,</hi> this is to deny the true Christ of God,
the Son of Mary.</p>
            <p>14. But if these expressions be found &amp; orthodox
in <hi>S. R.</hi> I hope they are not blasphemous in us, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we hold forth no other Christ Jesus, but the same
that all the Saints believed in, and was of <hi>Mary</hi> and
<hi>David,</hi> according to the flesh, and before them,
and the Father and Lord of them, according to the
Spirit, who is the Saints <hi>hiding-place</hi> in all ages, as
it is written <hi>Isaiah</hi> 32: 2. <hi>And the man</hi> (to wit, the
Man Christ) <hi>shall be as an hiding-place from the wind
and a covert from the tempest, as rivers of wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r in
a dry place, as the shaddow of a great Rock in a weary
land.</hi> Surely this is a Great and Mighty Man, so
that we may justly say, as these did of old, <hi>what
manner of Man is this, whom the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inds and sea obey?</hi>
For indeed he commands the winds and the sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
all the creaturs, <hi>to whom all power is given in heaven
and earth:</hi> and though he hath his Deputys and
Servants under him, yet they can doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him.</p>
            <p>15. And therefore he himself is <hi>every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:58863:95"/>
and knoweth, seeth and perceiveth all things.
He knoweth the most secret thoughts and actions
of all men, both good and; he told the woman of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> who had been a bad and evil woman, all
that ever she did, even the Man Christ Jesus, as she
her self did acknowledge, and went and preached
him to others, <hi>Come,</hi> said she, <hi>and see a man, that
told me all that ever I did, is not this the Christ?</hi>
But to say, he told this as knowing it by revelation
from the Father, and not as the Man Christ Jesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is to equall other Prophets unto him, who knew
the thoughts of men by revelation, and indeed to
weaken the argument, that she brought, to prove,
that he was the Christ, becaus this man told her all:
but seing this Man knew all her deeds and thoughts
immediatly, and needed not Divine revelation, to
know them, therefore he was indeed the true Christ,
for no other man had such a priviledg, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he told her much more inwardly, then outwardly,
and therefore he was in her, to wit, by his Life,
Light and Spirit. And how could the woman, that
was cured of her bloody-issue, by touching the hem
of his garment, have touched him, <hi>Luk</hi> 8. if his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Soul or Life had not extended into her, for
her touch was not a bare outward touch, nor did she
touch his body, but onely the hem of his garment,
and although many touched him beside, in the great
presse of people, yet he felt her touch, that was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58863:96"/>
sort, then all the other touches; even a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
touch, so that her spirit reached unto his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and drew from it, out of his body, and he feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, said, <hi>who touched me?</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
albeit it was a woman, that touched him, and he did
ask the question in the <hi>masculine article;</hi> and indeed
a masculine and vigorous touch it was; her spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raised by faith, into a masculine and Heavenly
vigour, touched his Spirit, and drew vertue from
him, and therefore his Spirit reached unto her, that
did both so draw forth her Spirit towards him, and
also did convey unto her that healing vertue. And
surely many thousands have as really touched him,
as she did, by the spiritual touch of faith, who never
had his outward body, or external person present to
touch it, and have drawn virtue from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
their Souls have been cured, and some also have
found their bodys cured and restored to health.</p>

Manhood of Christ, to the great dishonour of our
Blessed Saviour. 10. The <hi>Quakers</hi> put not their
Prophets and Teachers in Christs roome, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
him exalted above all creatures, more
then the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> 11. The <hi>blindness</hi> and
<hi>darkness</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Postscript,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
the Saints to have any measure of that Light
that was, or is in Christ. 12. How furr the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of the <hi>Postscript</hi> hath outshot himself, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
Christ to be in the Saints.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANd thus having by many Scripture testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys,
and arguments builded thereupon,
together also with the testimonys of others,
and some of the Presbyterians own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
so fully proved, that Christ is in the Saints,
yea and in a true sense, <hi>in all men,</hi> and <hi>in all things,</hi>
as God is. Before I close this particular head, I shall
a little more narrowly consider the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Postscript</hi> his words in in the 5 <hi>charge.</hi> He saith,
we affirme <hi>Christ to be a common sort of thing.</hi> His
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58863:97"/>
designe is easily to be seen here, as if we undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ, but it is no undervaluing of him, to call
him <hi>a thing,</hi> seing the Angel called him <hi>that holy
thing,</hi> Luk 1: 35. <hi>That holy thing which shall be
born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> And
this <hi>holy thing</hi> we say is <hi>in all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. But if by <hi>common</hi> he mean, either that it is of
mens nature, or that all men have the enjoyment
of it, in that sense I deny that it is common, for it
is not of men, but it is in the nature of it, a <hi>most rare,
divine, and singular thing;</hi> and though it be in all,
yet it can be enjoyed by none, but them who are
Saints. But to understand by <hi>common,</hi> that it is the
free Gift of God unto all, whereby all may be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in that sense we do not deny it to be <hi>common:</hi>
nor doth its being common derogate any thing from
its excellency, for, <hi>bonum quo communius, co melius,</hi>
a good thing the more common it be, the better it is.
Is not God a common Creator, and yet he is not
the less good or exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lent; so nor is Christ the less
good or excellent, that he is a common Saviour,
in so farr that he doth put Life and Salvation within
the reach of every man in a day of visitation, that
they may be saved.</p>
            <p>2. But the summe or substance of this his 5
charge is false, namely that we affirme, that <hi>Christ
is in every man, as he was in the Son of Mary,</hi> for
we say. The Son of Mary is Christ himself, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58863:97"/>
though his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> be <hi>in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>in all men,</hi> yet not so as in the Son of Mary,
for it is in him in the fulness, and in us onely by ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from him. It is he, the Son of Mary, that
giveth us this living water, who is th Fountain and
Spring of it: whereas the stream of it is but in us,
and <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>Light</hi> is otherwise in the Son of
Mary, or Man-Christ, then in us, or any other
men, for he is in him by an immediate union and
communion: whereas he is in us but by the Man
Christ, as in regard of union and communion; so
that our union and communion with God is but
mediat through him.</p>
            <p>3. And this wonderfull mystery Christ himself
doth clearly hold forth, Ioh. 17. verse 23. <hi>I in them
and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi>
Observe here, an excellent order; <hi>Christ in the
Saints</hi> and <hi>God in Christ,</hi> So that as in respect of
union God is not immediately in us, nor immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united with us, nor we with him, but God is in
Christ and Christ is in us. And so God through
Christ is in us, and thus Christ doth declare himself
to be the Mediator betwixt God and Man, as he is
in them, <hi>Thou in me and I in them,</hi> here Christ is
the midle-man or Mediator as being in the Saints,
which confuts the <hi>gross</hi> and most <hi>comfortless doctrin</hi>
of the <hi>Prebyterians</hi> and others, who affirme that
Christ as Mediator is only without us, in heaven,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58863:98"/>
and is not Mediator in us, whereas he himself in
this place hath declared the contrary, <hi>thou in me
and I in them, that they may be made perfect in one;</hi>
So that of all things visible and invisible, <hi>Christ</hi> is
next unto God, and most near unto him, as in
regard of union and communion, and then the
Saints by their union with Christ are united also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and he unto them. And if Christ be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
in the Saints, then he is Man, or the <hi>Word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi>
in them, for the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Logos simply</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is not mediator, becaushe is of a nature as
remote from us, as the Father, being one essence
or substance with him, and indeed it is the Man
Christ, that spoke these words in prayer unto his
Father, for the <hi>Logos simply</hi> considered is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and cannot be supposed to pray unto God, for
that to which one prayeth is greater then he that
doth pray: and it is the Man Christ, or <hi>Word incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
who said, <hi>my Father is greater then I,</hi> so that
Christ as Man is inferiour to God, &amp; this is the same
Spirit of Christ, as Man, that prayeth and maketh
intercession unto God in the Saints, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. and
hath done so from the beginning, and by whom the
children of men in all ages have received grace from
God.</p>
            <p>4. For the seed of Gods Grace, which is the true
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d of regeneration that hath been sowne in all ages

Man, to wit, the Man Christ Jesus, as he hath expressly
taught himself, <hi>Math. 13. 37. He that soweth the
good seed, is the Son of Man,</hi> who is the good and
friendly Man, and therefore he hath been in all ages
and places of the world, becaus he hath sown his
seed in the world, and not in some corner of it onely;
and the seed which he hath sowen is the <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he is the <hi>Heavenly Man,</hi> or <hi>Lord from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whose nature as Man, is Heavenly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
all though it be inferiour to the God head,
for he said, <hi>my Father is greater then I,</hi> nor will his

Man, he is as great as the Father for the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of created beings of Heaven and Earth, visible
and invisible, are as the <hi>dust of the ballance, and
drop of the bucket,</hi> in comparison of God.</p>
            <p>6. And therefore that the Heavenly Man Christ
Jesus, his Spirit, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> doth <hi>every where
extend</hi> it self <hi>into all things,</hi> will not prove that
Christ, as Man, is equall unto God; nor yet confound
his God-head and Man-hood, it only proveth that
the Man Christ Jesus is a great and mighty and most
excellent being, farre above all, and excelling all men
and Angells, and all other angelicall and heavenly
powers, and principallitys; which is a most certain
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58863:99"/>
truth, and therefore do all the Angels worship him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as they are commanded.</p>
            <p>7. And this universall presence of his in all things
he declared himself, when <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him; among the multitude, <hi>why did yee seek me</hi> (said

in the things of my Father. <hi>Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 49.</hi> and

spake unto them, and indeed many at this day do

of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> brought against <hi>Paulus Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satenus</hi>
to prove, that Christ was before <hi>Mary,</hi>
and if Christ was before <hi>Mary,</hi> he was not only
God, but Man, for it is the <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Word incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
that is the <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Anointed</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi>
and not the <hi>Word</hi> or God-head <hi>simply</hi> considered.</p>
            <p>His 6, 7, and 8, <hi>charges</hi> are, that we affirme <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

and unjustly layd upon us will abundantly appear,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58863:99"/>
from what is already said, in answer to the former,
and therefore I need say the lesse, onely to let the
Reader know that we are so farre, from affirming
Jesus the true Christ, the Son of Mary to be onely
an <hi>ordinary vessell &amp;c.</hi> that we both believe and
affirme him to be <hi>a most Wonderfull and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

as having the Center and Spring of that Divine

him when he came in the flesh.</p>
            <p>10. Again, that we put our Prophets (whom
he falsly calleth false Prophets) in the place of
Christ, cloathing them with the glory of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
titles, as being Christ, as wel as he, becaus
containing the same Light with his, is such a grosse
and manifest lye and forgery, that a greater can not
be invented, for we do exalt him both with our
hearts and mouths, above, not onely, all men of our
own profession, but above all men and Angels,
and that beyond all comparison; yea we exalt him
more then this our <hi>acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ser,</hi> or any of his brethren,
even as Man, as having a substantiall dignity and
excellency, belonging to him as Man, above all men
and Angels whatsomever: nor will it in the least
follow from our principles, that becaus we have a
measure of his Light and Life in us, that therefore we
put our selves in his place, or roome, as is already
cleared: for he has it in the fulnesse, <hi>in whom the
fulnesse of the Godhead dwelleth bodily;</hi> and GOD
<hi>gave not the Spirit unto him by measure;</hi> whereas
whatever Light, or Life, Vertue or excellency we
or any Saints, or Angels have, is derived from
him, and is but a measure of his fulnesse: and God
the Father dwelleth in him immediately, but in us
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mediately through him, as is above declared and

            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:58863:100"/>11. And what a blind and dark man is this, that
will not acknowledge that the Saints have any thing
of that Light in them, which Christ hath in himself!
Let him tell us, and prove it from Scripture, if he
can, that Christ putteth any other Light, or Spirit
<hi>in his people</hi> then that which is in himself. But the
contrary is manifest from Scripture, that it is one
and the same Spirit, Light and Life, both <hi>in him,</hi>
and <hi>in them.</hi> But if some, more sober then this
<hi>Author,</hi> will acknowledge, that Christ is really
in the Saints; albeit they do not understand how he
is <hi>in all men;</hi> to such I say, <hi>viz,</hi> who affirme Christ
to be <hi>in the Saints,</hi> that, by this mans argument, to

               </gap>it, the Author of the <hi>Postscript,</hi> they deny the true
Christ, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and set
up the Saints in the place of Christ, as being Christ,
as well as he, becaus, as he saith, containing the
same Light.</p>
            <p>12. Let them consider how farre the <hi>Author</hi> of
the <hi>Postscript</hi> hath outshot himself in this particular,
and in stead of pleading for the true Christ, hath in
effect denyed him, and robbed all the Saints of
God, of having him in them, expresse contrary to
the Scripturs. And I have often wondered how
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hese men will so freely acknowledge, and plead for

that <hi>Christ is in all good men:</hi> yea seing they

               </gap>lead, that all good men, while they live on

earth, have sin, and sin daily in thought, word and
deed; yea continually: they must also acknowledg,
that in so farre as sin is in them, the devil is in them,
who is the father of all sin: and yet they will not
have Christ to be in all, no not in the Saints; which
sheweth them to be extreamely blind and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.
And I would ask them this one question,
Do they think that the <hi>Devil is a Spirit of a larger
and greater extension, then the Soul or Spirit of Christ
as Man?</hi> If they say, <hi>nay:</hi> then <hi>Christ is in all men.</hi>
If they say, that the Devil is a greater Spirit, then
the Spirit of Christ, as Man; then they plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that the Devil is greater then Christ, which
is horrid and detestable blasphemy.</p>

this is their language upon the matter,</hi> heare us, and
learn of us, but heare not Christ within you, learn not
of him, as he teaches you in your hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, <hi>as the</hi> Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<hi>tell you ye ought to do, for</hi> there is no true Christ
in you at all: that which reproves you for sin in your
hearts, is not the true Christ, but a false, nor is it
the least measure of that Light, which was in him,
that shineth in your hearts, and lets you see your sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this Light in you can not teach you the saving knowledg
of God, nor lead you unto God, although ye should
follow it never so faithfully, but we can teach you the
true and saving knowledge of God, and if ye doe what
we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id you doe, ye shall certainly be saved, we can
pawn our soules for you, therefore heare us, and ye
shall be saved.</p>
            <p>3. But if ye heare not us, ye can not expect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we are the alone Ambassadours, that God hath
sent unto you to teach you, and lead you into the King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom
of GOD; you need no other immediate Teacher,
or Preacher, nay, ye need not that Christ should be
in you at all, you need no immediate teachings of Christ
or of God at all: immediate revelations are ceased
since the Apostles dayes, and there is no use of them,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58863:102"/>
means are so plentifull. <hi>I appeal to all sober and
impartial men, if this be not to set up themselvs in
the place of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And what's the cause that these men are so
great enemys to the immediate teachings of Christ
in the hearts of people, but that they feare that if
people come to receive the teachings of Christ in
their hearts, they will deny them as false Teachers,
and so their trade and gain will down.</p>
            <p>5. But all true Preachers, they preach not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
but Christ Jesus, as the Apostles did, and
they preach him not onely ascended into Heaven,
and as being in heaven, but they preach him also
as being <hi>in the hearts</hi> of people, saying, <hi>The Word
is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,</hi> Rom. 10:
Deut. 30. And all true Preachers are glad, that
people come to know Christ, and learn of him <hi>in
their hearts:</hi> and they are assured that they who are
come to learne of Christ immediately, will never
despise or reject the ministry of those whom Christ
doth send, and in whom he speaks, for the <hi>sheep
of Christ hear his voyce,</hi> wherever it soundeth, and
they who love to heare Christ in themselvs, love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to heare him in others, and receive the Word,
not as the Word of Men, but as it is indeed the
<hi>Word of God.</hi> And thus I have gone through the
eight <hi>particular Charges,</hi> wherewith he hath so fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
charged us; and in plainness and simplicity of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58863:103"/>
heart, declared our beliefe concerning them, and
how that <hi>we owne the true Christ,</hi> as <hi>true and perfect
God,</hi> and as <hi>true and perfect Man,</hi> who, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the flesh, was the <hi>Son of David,</hi> and of <hi>Mary,</hi>
but yet was before Mary and David, and all men;
who is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> blessed for evermore.</p>
            <p>6. And seing these 8 <hi>false charges</hi> are the onely
foundation, on which the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Postscript</hi>
builds all his other calumnys, and his whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse,
his sandy foundation being removed, his
building falls with shame upon his own head: and I
wish his eyes may be opened by that Light, he hath
so maliciously reproached, that he may see, what
that Spirit is, that hath led him so to blaspheme the
true Christ of God <hi>in mens hearts:</hi> for certainly it is
not the Spirit of Christ, but of Satan, seing <hi>no man
speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Iesus accursed,</hi>
as Paul declared. O that he may be made to <hi>looke
upon him whom he hath pierced</hi> (in his tender <hi>Life,</hi>
and <hi>Seed in his own heart,</hi> by such malitious and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
speeches) <hi>and mourn bitterly for so doing, and
doe so no more,</hi> that he may find mercy of the
Lord!</p>
            <p>7. It were a needless labour to follow him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all
the rest of his discourse, or to give a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to every sentence, the whole containing no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
to prove us guilty of such things; he had
done more as a man, and as a Christian, to have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58863:103"/>
charged us with some things that we did truely hold,
and if he did suppose them to be errours, to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to refute them with solid arguments,
brought from Scripture and sound Reason; nothing
of which he hath done, but <hi>raileth</hi> on from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the end. It seemeth verily that he is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
skilled in the art of <hi>railing</hi> (which is a <hi>black art,</hi>
to be sure, too familiar to the tribe of <hi>black-coats)</hi>
then in the way of <hi>disputing.</hi> But I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

            <p>8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is like the rest of his <hi>false accusa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
we hate no mens persons, but their <hi>vices,</hi>
and farre be it from us, to oppose any of the <hi>true
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58863:104"/>
ministers of Iesus Christ,</hi> nay, we love them, and
honour them, for their works sake, and we judge
ourselvs bound in conscience, at all occasions to
heare them, and countenance them, but such men
as call themselvs <hi>the ministers of Christ,</hi> and after
triall, are found <hi>not</hi> to be his <hi>ministers,</hi> or sent of
him, we find ourselvs called of God to deny them,
and witness against them, as Christ did against the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, and as the <hi>Prophets</hi> did against the
<hi>false prophets,</hi> who taught for <hi>gain</hi> and <hi>rewards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. This hath been an <hi>old policy</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> which
many have used in former times, to call themselvs
with such <hi>splendid names,</hi> as <hi>Ministers of Christ, and
of the Gospel,</hi> when they have been rather <hi>ministers
of Satan, and of Anti-Christ.</hi> The <hi>Popish priests</hi>
and <hi>bishops</hi> doe the same, and the <hi>Pope</hi> calleth
himself <hi>Servus servorum Dei, a servant of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God.</hi> And indeed this is one of the great
stumbling-blocks, that the Popish Clergy and
priests lay in the way of the people, to keep them in
<hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>superstition,</hi> and beget a prejudice
in them, against the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and dissenters from
the Popish Church. <hi>Oh!</hi> say they, <hi>these men are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
hereticks, who deny our holy mother Church,
and her holy priests and bishops, and our holy father
the Pope, whom Christ hath appoynted, and set up as
his Vicar upon Earth.</hi> And then they reckon up so
many holy priests, and bishops, and so many holy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58863:104"/>
Fathers, as have been, and are in their Church.
And thus they seek to deceive the people, and to
speake freely, I do not question it, but there have
been some in the Popish Church, who had as great
pretences to holyness, and looked as like holy men,
as any to be found of the Presbyterian Teachers.
And I judge, the Presbyterians themselvs will not
generally conclude, that for these many hundreds
of years, there have been no holy men in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet hath been an <hi>Apostate
Church,</hi> for many hundred years, and yet all this
will not prove, that we ought to joyne to the
Church of Rome, becaus of some men that have
lived in it, or may as yet be in it, that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as holy, and of as good a life and conversation,
as any the Presbyterians can name among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs.
And the like may be said of the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Church, and Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
I suppose this Author and his brethren will
not be so uncharitable, as to conclude there are no
holy men in the Episcopal Church, or that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is a holy man: and I question not, but they
can instance some among <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that have taken and do take as great pains to
preach, as any Presbyterian Preacher ever did, and
greater also. Some of the <hi>Popish priests</hi> have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
into the remotest parts of the world, to preach,
and they alledge they have preached Christ, as much
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58863:105"/>
as the <hi>Presbyterians alledge</hi> they preach him at
home. <hi>Xaverius</hi> a Papist preached to the <hi>Chineses,</hi>
and was at greater pains, then any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> that
ever I heard of, for they commonly <hi>nest</hi> themselves
<hi>at home,</hi> and enjoy as much bodily ease and pleasure,
as other men, they seldom preach out of their own
<hi>parishes:</hi> but I never heard of any of them goe and
preach to <hi>heathens,</hi> where the <hi>Name of Christ</hi> hath
not outwardly been mentioned, as many in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Church have done. Nor will it solve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to say, that though there have been some holy
Preachers in the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> yet they preached
many errors with some truths, and therefore since
the <hi>Light is broke up more clearely,</hi> they are now to
be turned away from, although in these dark times
it might have pleased God to make some of them
<hi>instruments of salvation to peoples souls,</hi> which may as
yet be, where a further <hi>manifestation</hi> is not given of
God. For the same answer will as wel serve us
against the Presbyterians, as it will serve them against
the <hi>Papists.</hi> Admitt then that there may be some
<hi>holy men</hi> among the Presbyterian Teachers, and
that at times the Spirit of God hath breathed
through them (when they did little notice it, and had
not that care to attend his <hi>breathings,</hi> and <hi>movings,</hi>
so as onely to speak by them) and that when the
Spirit thus breathed through them, they have been
instrumentall to the Salvation of some souls; yet
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58863:105"/>
becaus these men did also preach many <hi>errours,</hi> and
did not regard <hi>the inward call</hi> and <hi>movings of the
Spirit of God,</hi> as they should have done, but spake
more frequently without them, then with them;
and in their own <hi>will,</hi> beginning and ending with
the <hi>houre-glasse:</hi> as also becaus they laid too great
weight on the bare <hi>outward call of men,</hi> and on <hi>meer
natural and acquired abili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ys,</hi> and have affirmed,
that <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>piety is not essentiall to a minister of
Christ,</hi> and have not preached <hi>the pure Truth, as
it is in Iesus,</hi> but for most part, grosse errours, as
namely, that <hi>Gods Grace is not Vniversal,</hi> that
<hi>Immediat Revelation is ceased,</hi> that <hi>we must sin for
terme of Life,</hi> that <hi>men may committ murder and
adultery, and yet be in a justifyed state, and perfectly
justifyed at that instant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. I say, for these and many others <hi>causes,</hi> we
can not owne them, as <hi>ministers of Christ</hi> according
to the pure order of a Gospell Ministry, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
because they take <hi>hire</hi> and <hi>wages,</hi> as much as
any, they are <hi>hirelings.</hi> Yet we do really make a
difference, betwixt those who are more tender and
conscientious, and others; and are glad to meet
with any such, for they are very thin scattered
at this day. And if we take more paines on such,
then upon others, &amp; some times give them a sound
thresh, it is in love to them, and in hope to find
<hi>corn</hi> among them, which we expect less to find
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58863:106"/>
among the profane, whom he calleth <hi>lazy lie-byes,</hi>
and <hi>idle loyteres,</hi> and yet such men were the farre

to charge sin and filthynesse upon the work of the
<hi>Spirit of God in the hearts of his people:</hi> whereas
the Scripture saith, <hi>his work is perfect.</hi> And indeed
how can any impure thing proceed from the Spirit
of God, that is altogether <hi>a most pure and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</hi>
Again, 2 part. Ep. 7. <hi>He who is woer and
suiter, should not be an house-hold-man with you, till
ye and he come up to his Fathers house together.</hi> This
is contrary to the Scripture, which saith, <hi>I will
dwell in them, and walk in them.</hi> And <hi>if any man
will keep my commandments, my Father and I will
come and make our abode with him.</hi> Hence the
<hi>Saints</hi> on Earth are called <hi>Gods Temple</hi> and <hi>house.</hi>
Again, 2 part. Ep. 48. <hi>The fruits that grow here, are

                  </gap>it we
be but half-hungered of Christ here.</hi> This is contrary
to the promises of the Lord, and experience of the
Saints: Did not David say, <hi>My cup overfloweth?</hi>
And is it not said in the <hi>Song, Eat, O friends, drink
abundantly, O beloved?</hi> And is it not promised in
the New Convenant, <hi>they shall not hunger and thirst,</hi>
&amp;c.? And said Paul, <hi>that ye may be filled with the
fulnesse of God.</hi> And of <hi>Barnabas</hi> it is said, <hi>he was a
good man, and full of the holy Ghost.</hi> It's true all
that is received in this life, is but as a first-fruits, and
earnest of that to come; yet there is a very blessed
and large enjoyment of Christ to be attained here,
so that the faithfull can say, <hi>they want no good thing,</hi>
and although they hunger, yet it is not for famine
or want, but to sharpen their appetite. Yea in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to himself he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ep. 140. <hi>O thirsty love, wilt thou set Christ the well
of Life to thy head, and drink thy fill, drink and spare
not, drink love, and be drunken with Christ.</hi> But
doth this agree with his former expression of being
<hi>half-hungered of Christ here</hi> in this life? Again,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58863:109"/>
1 part. Ep. 62. he saith <hi>[Reprobats are not formally
guilty of contempt of God, and misbelief, becaus they
apply not Christ, and the promises of the Gospell to
themselvs in particular, for so they should be guilty
becaus they believe not a lye, which God never oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to believe.]</hi> But this is to make God guilty of
hypocrisy, that reproveth the world of unbelief,
and offereth faith and Salvation unto all; nor doth
God obliege them to believe a lye, becaus Christ
hath given himself a <hi>ransome</hi> for <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>dyed</hi> for
<hi>all,</hi> as the Scriptures expressly declare. Again,
see 1 part. Ep. 3. <hi>Except a man mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yr and slay the
body of sin, in sanctifyed self-denyall, they shall never
be Christs martyrs and faithfull witnesses.</hi> And yet
in contradiction, he saith within 20 lines in the same
Epistle, <hi>Howbeit we can not attain to this denyall of
me and mine, that we can say, I am not my self, my
self is not my self, mine own is no longer mine own,
yet our aiming at this in all we doe shall be accepted.</hi>
This is another sin-pleasing doctrine, plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scripture, which faith, <hi>unlesse a man deny
himself,</hi> &amp;c. it doth not say, <hi>if he aime at it, he shall
be accepted.</hi> Surely this is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ue pillows under mens
arme-holes, and to embolden them in sin; for who
will not say, they aime at self-deniall, although they
attaine not unto it? Again, see 1 part. Ep. 14.
<hi>Some are partakers of the holy Ghost, and tast of the
good Word of God, and of the powers of the life to

<hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 4. But this is a grosse contradiction, seing
none are partakers of the holy Ghost, but by Christ.
But these mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 4. are such as having a
part in Christ, may fall from him. Again, see 1
part. Ep. 50. <hi>The best regenerate have their defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

unfavoury and unsound expression! contrary to
the promises of God, and the experience of many
that witnessed a cleansing from all filthinesse and
sin. Again, 1 part. Ep. 27. <hi>All Christs good bairns
goe to heaven with a broken brow, and with a
crooked legge.</hi> Contrary to Scripture, which faith,
<hi>Thou shalt walk in the way safely, and thy feet shall
not stumble,</hi> Prov. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: 23. And Christ is a perfect
Physician, who, as he cured the lame bodys of those
that believed in him, perfectly, so doth he cure the
lame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouls of all his people, even perfectly; for no
imperfect thing can enter into heaven. Again, see
1 part. Ep. 20. <hi>We are fools to be browden, and fond
of a pawn in the loof of our hand, living on trust by
faith, may wel content us.</hi> This he speaks as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
such, who seek after spirituall feelings, and
sensible enjoyments of Christ, which is according
to his brethrens doctrine, that teach We should
not seek to live by sense, (to wit, spirituall sense)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58863:110"/>
but by faith; a grosse and unsound doctrine! as if
faith and sense spirituall were opposite: whereas
faith doth always, in some measure, imply some one
spirituall sense or other, for unlesse we spiritually
heare, or feel Christ in some measure, we can not
believe in him, <hi>faith cometh by hearing,</hi> saith the
<hi>Apostle;</hi> and is not faith a laying hold on Christ
with the hands of our Soul? and how can we doe
this, without all sense or feeling of him in a spirituall
way? Surely the natural and outward senses are no
more necessary for the preservation of the naturall
life, then the inward and spiritual senses are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the preservation of the Spiritual Life of the
Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Also he hath frequently in his Epistles, too airy
and frothy expressions, no wise beseeming the
weight of the matter those expressions relate unto,
as 1 part. Ep. 120.</hi> 
               <q>Christ see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ep. 91.</hi> Will not a Father take his little dated Davie
in his armes, and carry him over a ditch or a mire?
<hi>Again, 1 part. Ep. 121.</hi> O if I could dote (if I may
make use of that word in this place) as much upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as I do upon his love.</p>
            <p>This is a hint of some of these many unworthy,

the <hi>Publisher,</hi> do so idolize this book of <hi>S. R.</hi>
his Epistles, as if there were none beyond it, except
the BIBLE.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In my second Section I say that</hi> S. R. <hi>in his
more pure times both experienced and declared of</hi>
Immediate Revelation, <hi>and the</hi> Spirits immediate

that he plainly declareth, he had the</hi> counsell <hi>and</hi>

<hi>See for this, besides the testimonys I have
already cited in the answer, these following, 1 part.
Ep. 2.</hi> It was not without [Gods special direction]
that the first sentence, that ever my mouth uttered to
you, was that of <hi>John 9: 39. Again, 1 part. Ep.

his lovely and kindly kisses have made me a poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner

a four-houres, a small tasting we have, or is to be had
in this life (which is true compared with the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
but yet I know it is more, it is the kingdom of
God within us. <hi>Again, 2 part. Ep. 2.</hi> O blessed

I have above observed, after all this he joyned with

cry up <hi>S. R.</hi> as a man of so great experience in
the things of God, yet I find himself ingenuously
confess. 1. part. ep. 46. that <hi>there is a gate yet of
finding out Christ, that</hi> he <hi>hath never lighted upon,</hi>
and saith he, <hi>O if I could find it out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Now this gate (blessed be the Name of the
Lord, and to his eternall praise we can declare it)
many thousands in this day do know, and by it they
find Christ and do enjoy his living presence dayly,
who is the bridegroome and husband of their souls,
and this <hi>gate</hi> is, <hi>to wait upon him, in the shinings of
his divine Light in their hearts,</hi> being retired and
gathered unto the same, out of all their own
thoughts, words and works, all their own willings
and runnings in the self-will, all selfish motions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and inclinations of self, in pure silence and

true desire, and prayer that we may find him, and
enjoy him, and as we have sought him by this gate,
or after this manner, we have never missed in some
measure, more or less, to find him.</p>

verse 2.</hi> The Lord appeared unto Elijah neither in the
wind, nor earth-Quake, nor fire, but in the still or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
small voice, <hi>to wit, that is heard in the stillness
or silence, of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. There is one particular more that I find in <hi>S.
R.</hi> that I cannot omit to take notice of, in the
same epistle 46. which I have above mentioned, <hi>eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
I know not</hi> (saith he) <hi>what Christianity is, or we
have stinted a measure of so many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce weights, and
no more, upon holynes and there we are at a stay.</hi> It
were good for the Professors to consider this and be
convinced of their error; whereas they say the holyest
Man on earth doth sin dayly in thought word, and
deed, yea every moment and cannot but sin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually;
Is not this to stint a measure of so many ounce
weights, or rather of a few grains upon holyness,
yea altogether to annihilate it? For I know
not how that can be called holyness, which cannot
keep the soul one moment from sinning. However <hi>S.
R.</hi> although here convinced of this errour, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
did fall foully into it, when he joyned with the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58863:113"/>
               <hi>divines,</hi> so called, at <hi>Westmunster,</hi> in that unchristian
assertion that no man by any grace given of God, can
perfectly keep the commandements of God, but doth
dayly break them in thought, word &amp; deed. This is
a bold &amp; presumptuons stinting &amp; limiting the <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>powerfull grace</hi> of God, <hi>in the hearts of his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi>
without all ground from Scripture, yea contrary
to it, which saith, <hi>his commandements are not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and his yoke is easy, and his burden Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Moreover, in my fourth Section, I referred
to some thing related by the Author of <hi>The fullfilling
of the Scripturs,</hi> concerning <hi>Iohn Welsh, Robert
Bruce,</hi> and some others in those dayes, which I said,
will not a little make for the present Testimony of
the people cald <hi>Quakers.</hi> Now for proof of this, I
shall give a few instances out of many more, which
may be brought out of the said book.</p>
            <p>8. First. <hi>The said Author telleth us (pag. 416.
2 edition) of a</hi> very solemne and extraordinary
outletting of the Spirit in the West of Scotland, about
the year 1625. <hi>and there after,</hi> which began in the
parish of Stewarton (whiles the persecution was hat
from the Prelatick party.)</p>
            <p>9. Which by the prophane Rabble of that time, <hi>was
called the</hi> Stewarton Sickness, <hi>and spread through
much of that countrey particularly at</hi> Irvin, <hi>through
the Ministry of</hi> David Dickson; <hi>of which he writes
that</hi> few Sabbaths <hi>(meaning first dayes)</hi> did passe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58863:114"/>
without some evidently converted, and some convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
proofs of the power of God accompanying his
Word, yea that many were so choaked and taken by
the heart, that through terrour, the Spirit in such a
measure convincing them of sin, in hearing of the
Word, they have been made to fall over, and thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
out of the Church, who after proved most solid and
lively Christians. And <hi>says he,</hi> this great spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide
of the Gospell was not of a short time, but for some
years continuance, yea thus like a spreading Moore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,
the power of godlyness did advance from one
place to another, which put a marvellous Lustre on
these parts of the country, the savour wherof brought
many from other parts of the land to see the truth of the
same. <hi>Again he telleth pag. 417.</hi> at the Kirk of the
shots <hi>20 of June 1630. that</hi> there was so convincing
an appearance of God and down pouring of the Spirit;
even in an extraordinary way, especially at that
sermon, <hi>Juny 21.</hi> the day after their communion,
with a strange unusuall motion on the hearers, who in
a great multitude were there conveened of diverse
ranks, that it was known <hi>(which he saith he</hi> can
speake on sure ground) near five hundred had at that
time a discernible change wrought on them, of whom
most, proved lively Christians afterwards. <hi>Now
that there was a</hi> true <hi>and</hi> reall appearance of God,
<hi>and breaking forth of his power and out letting of
his Spirit, upon many at that time, I veryly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58863:114"/>
and my soul hath unity with the testimony
hereof, and diver other testimonys of this nature
in the said book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. And certainly this was an immediat sensible
appearance and revelation of the power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, accompanying the Ministry of that
time, which produced such effects, and in truth the
very same power and presence of God, with the
very same and the like effects, is now again broken
forth in our day, among the despised people called,
<hi>Quakers,</hi> and that in much greater clearness, so
that more sound principles are made known unto
us, and many things, which were letts and snares
unto them, are discovered unto us from the Lord.</p>
            <p>11. And yet is it not a most sad and lamentable
thing that Professors who cry up the appearance of
God in that time, will not owne the same appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of God in the nature and kind of it, although
more clear, and glorious as to the measure, among
us now: but joyn with the profane rabble, to call
those unusuall motions, which are the reall effects
of Gods power and Spirit powerfully seazing upon
both souls and bodys of many among us, in great
trembling, cryes and tears, the signes of some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall
Possession, whereas the same persons, by
sobriety of life and conversation, and by a walk as
Christian-like as any of these a fore mentioned, &amp;
in many things exceeding them, and also by the sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58863:115"/>
of the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Christ in them,</hi> have evidenced that
they were led by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>12. Yea the <hi>Author</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>Postscript</hi> is not affraid
to impute these unusuall and extraordinary motions
that some times appear in the bodyes of some of our
friends, to a possession of Sathan, which if he did
as knowingly as maliciously, might truely be called
a blaspheming against the Holy Ghost. But they
are judged here by some of their owne prophets, for
seing it was the Spirit of God that raised these unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
motions in them abovementioned, why
should the like now be imputed to the Devill?</p>
            <p>13. O how like is this generation of hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
professors to the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> and
<hi>Iewes</hi> of old, who professed to owne the Spirit of
God in <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>prophets,</hi> and yet rejected and
resisted the same Spirit in Christ and the Apostles?</p>
            <p>14. And it is observable, that this glory of God
that appeared among them at that time, which was a
time of persecution, although it continued for some
years, yet afterwards when the Presbyterians got
into the sadle themselvs, and turned persecuters of
others that dissented from them, this glory did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear,
and in stead thereof, great complaining
of deadness, as it is at this day, among them who
have most ingenuity. This doth plainly show that
they did not <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> in his further <hi>leadings,</hi>
but rather went back, otherwise this glory would
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58863:115"/>
not have departed, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t continued, yea and increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them.</p>
            <p>And if some <hi>obiect,</hi> that this glory appeareing unto
that people at a communion, to wit; at that;
called <hi>the Sacrament of the Supper,</hi> it seemeth to be
no small argument to prove that God did owne that
externall action, as his ordinance, although the
people called <hi>Quakers</hi> deny it to be a standing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to the world and doe not practise it.</p>
            <p>15. To this <hi>I answer,</hi> that it is observable that
by the Authors own account the greatest outleting
of the Spirit was not on their communion day, but
on the day after, but that God did at times of that
externall action of breaking bread, condescend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; regarding their sincerity, and gave mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations
of himself, will not prove that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that thing unto them, or that their minds
were not in an error, in laying too great weight upon
that externall action, which was but a figure of the
true communion; for the same Author doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the Spirit of God did also wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accompany <hi>Luther</hi> in his Ministry, and yet
<hi>Luther</hi> did most grossely erre; as in other things, so
in the matter of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> teaching that the
<hi>body of Christ was consubstantiat with the bread</hi> and
that <hi>the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ward mouth receiveth the body of Christ.</hi>
And I believe, such as are sober and ingenuous of the
Presbyterians will not deny, but that the Lord did
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58863:116"/>
pour out of his Spirit, upon those <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
that dyed <hi>martyrs,</hi> that were both for Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy
and the Service-book; yet this proveth not,
that God did owne these things, as his ordinances.
It is the sincerity and earnest desires of mens souls
after God, that he regardeth, although they be in
error in some things which he winketh at, but doth
not owne. Yea did not Christ wonderfully appear to
<hi>Saul,</hi> while he was going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> to obtain
an order to persecute the Saints, a very unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wfull
action, but this proveth not that God allowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
in the same. Many other instances could be given
to shew the weakness of that objection, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in the darkest times of Popery, God raised
up some to be ministers of his Spirit that yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to hold many Popish errors; as not only <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
and <hi>Thauler,</hi> but even <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> who dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
little from the Papists in matter of doctrine, but
mostly blamed their ungodly life.</p>
            <p>16. A second instance I shall bring out of the
afore-said Author, is, pag. 422. where he giveth
as a sixt witness, &amp;c. the convincing appearance of
an extraordinary and Apostolick Spirit on some of
these instruments, whom the Lord raised up in these
last times, who as he saith had speciall revelations
from the Lord of his mind anent things to come,
&amp;c. But how doth this agree with their confession
of Faith, that saith, <hi>the former wayes of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58863:116"/>
himself to his people are ceased since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
dayes,</hi> and that <hi>there are no new revelations of
the Spirit,</hi> but that <hi>God hath committed his counsell
wholly to writing?</hi> And of such speciall revelations
he mentioneth divers, which I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to
find in the said book.</p>
            <p>17. A <hi>Third instance</hi> shall be that which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
mentioneth of <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> where I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of divers weighty particulars, as 1. that his call
was extraordinary pag. 429. to wit, <hi>by an inward
motion and pressing of the Spirit,</hi> and such a call I
confess is extraordinary, as in respect of the greatest
part of those, called <hi>Teachers,</hi> which yet is most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
yea and most necessary to every true teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and minister of Christ.</p>
            <p>18. 2. He tells pag. 431. <hi>that it was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of</hi> Robert Bruce, <hi>for a considerable time to keep
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> before he preached.</hi> And yet how do the
Professors now blame our silence, when even such
among us as the Lord hath given a true ministry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
do find it at times their place to be silent a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time before they speak, and sometimes for a
whole diet to be silent, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was of old?
Now I besech them to consider what did this silence
of <hi>R. B.</hi> mean, or what was his intent in being si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent
so long? was it not he waited to receive,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he was to speak from the Lord? Or at least to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Spirit and power of the Lord to assist him in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58863:117"/>
what perhaps was in his heart to speak? and truely
this is the very cause of our silence also, for we know
that no preaching nor praying can availe to quicken
or reach the soules of men, or profit either speaker
or hearers, but that which is in the immediat moving
and assistance of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>19. 3. He telleth plainly pag. 431. that <hi>he had
the Spirit of discerning in a great measure</hi> in so much
that having heard a sermon preached by <hi>Robert
Blair</hi> (it being the first he had preached) and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desired by the said <hi>Robert Blair</hi> to give his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning the same, did give it, in these
words <hi>I found,</hi> said he, <hi>your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ermon very polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and disgested, but there is one thing I did misse in
it, to vvit, the Spirit of God, I found not that;</hi> This
(as the Author saith) took a deep impression upon
him and helped him to see, it was something else to
be a minister of Jesus Christ, then to be a knowing
and eloquent preacher. Pag. 453. But the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
generally in this day, deny any such Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
as whereby one knoweth; supposing him
to be never so spirituall, when he heareth another
preach, whether he doth preach by the Spirit of
God, or no: &amp; when we affirm that the Lord hath
given such a discerning unto us they cry out many of
them, as if it were blasphemy to assert any such thing.
Again, whereas this Author saith, <hi>it is some vvhat
else to be a minister of Iesus Christ, then to be a knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58863:117"/>
and eloquent preacher:</hi> we say the same. But
how farr doth this contradict the Presbyterians do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that <hi>grace or piety is not essentiall or necessary to
the being of a minister of Christ,</hi> as <hi>Iames Durham</hi>
expressly affirmeth in his book on the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. 4. <hi>The</hi> Author <hi>telleth us that the said</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Bruce was deeply affected with the naughtiness
and profanity of many ministers then in the Church,
and the unsuitable carriage of others to so great a call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and did express much his fear that the Ministers
of Scotland would prove the greatest persecuters, that
the Gospell had; <hi>And so in this we have found his
words to be true, for the said Ministry of</hi> Scotland,
<hi>even</hi> Presbyterian <hi>as wel as</hi> Episcopall <hi>are the</hi> greatest
persecuters <hi>of the Gospell in this day, as formerly.
And their doctrine, that</hi> Grace or piety is not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to a Minister of Christ, <hi>nor an</hi> inward call <hi>by
the</hi> Spirit, <hi>opens a door to such a naughty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. Pag. 432. 5. He tells that on a certain
time when <hi>Robert Bruce was at prayer in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in Edinburgh, there was such an extraordinary
motion on all present, so sensible a down-pouring of
the Spirit, that they could hardly contain themselves,</hi>
yea which was most strange, even some unusuall
motion on those, who were in other parts of the
house, not knowing the cause at that very instant:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58863:118"/>
and one being occasionally present, when he went
away said; <hi>O how strange a man is this? for he
knocked down the Spirit of God upon us all;</hi> this he
said, becaus <hi>R. B.</hi> did divers times knock with his
fingers on the table And yet when such motions
and effects are now witnessed, when the Servants
of the Lord pray in our meetings, they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but in the same Pharisa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>call, Anti-Christian
spirit, as the Jewes said of Christ, they say of us,
that we have <hi>a devil,</hi> for which I heartily wish that
the Lord may forgive them, and open their hearts
to understand and receive the Truth.</p>
            <p>Many more observable passages might be cited
out of the same book, to convince Professors, how
these men, whom they have such an esteeme of, did
both in principle, practice and experience, in many
things agree with us, the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
against themselvs, who boast to be their Successors
and children, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> boasted, that they were
the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But surely seing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of this day, stop their ears at the <hi>inward
voyce</hi> of Gods Spirit <hi>in their own consciences,</hi> and
also at so many plain and clear testimonys of the
Holy Scripture, that make so abundantly for the
Testimony of Truth owned by us. I little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the testimonys of these men will prevail
with many of them, yea although even they should
come from the dead, and witnesse for the Truth,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58863:118"/>
against them, as Christ said in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>If they
will not believe Moses and the Prophets, neither will
they believe, if one should be raised from the dead.</hi>
Yet for the sake of many others among them, of
whom I have hope that God will in due time effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
reach them and open their eyes, I have found
my heart moved and drawn by the Lord to be at
this paines, for the good of whose soules I could
willingly by the Grace of God endure much labour,
suffering and affliction both inwardly and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they might see and owne the glorious work
and appearance of God among us, and be brought
to enjoy the same with us.</p>
            <p>23. And here in the close of all, I shall cite a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of this Author himself, which may be of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to some who are willing to understand, how
that the Presbyterians, even the most knowing and
experienced of them, did not know all that was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be revealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page 35. He saith,</hi> We wait and believe the
further accomplishment of this promise (to wit, the
words, <hi>Dan. last: ver. 4.</hi> Many shall runne to and
fro, and knowledg shall be increased) to the Church,
beyond all we have yet seen, that many Scripture
truths now dark and abstruse, shall be made so clear,
as shall even cause us to wonder at the grosse m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stakes
we once had thereof, yea that after generations shall
have a discovery and uptaking of some prophecys now
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58863:119"/>
ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cure, which shall as farr exceed us, as this time
goeth beyond former ages, which comparatively we
must say were very dark.</p>
            <p>24. Now I earnestly obtest and beseech such
among them, as have any measure of true tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and ingenuity, and do believe these words of
this Author, to consider in the cool of their minds
if possibly these principles and doctrins among us,
which they have called grosse errours and delusions
of Satan, may not be these Scripture truths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Author</hi> speaketh, and that their condemning
such principles were but their gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e mistakes, yea
surely we know it to be so, and many of us that
were formerly Presbyterians, are now made to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at our grosse mistakes, which we then had. But
this I understand of such as are really owned by us,
not of those which they do falsly alledge and impose
upon us. I shall cite one or two passages more of
this Author, and then leave it to the impartial and
ingenuous judge, if they do not arrive, upon the
matter at the same, which many of his Brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and nick-name with the Profane rabble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the termes of <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> and <hi>Quakerism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. <hi>Pag. 112. He saith</hi>—There is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
within, which goeth further then the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and passeth naturall understanding, whence
we feel, we tast, we enjoy, yea his voyce is heard
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58863:119"/>
in the Soul, which we surely know to be his.</p>
            <p>This is a plain testimony to <hi>inmedtat Revelation,</hi>
which is our main principle, and is so greatly oppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this day, by Presbyterians, as much as others.</p>
            <p>Again, pag. 229. He speaketh of an <hi>immediate
teaching</hi> of the Spirit, and of a mighty power of God
that can witnesse (in many young ones) ere they
can wel speak, or exercise Reason, the power of

               <hi>Again, pag. 120. speaking of</hi> Prayer, <hi>he saith,</hi>
It may seeme strange, how easily we can step out
from the world and the noyse thereof, in before the
Lord, without the least pause or time interveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>26. <hi>And again, he saith,</hi> Alas! It's sad,
this seemes rather a piece of invention many times,
then a matter of earnest with the Lord. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

appears <hi>(saith he)</hi> in our nearest approaches unto
God?</p>
            <p>27. <hi>And</hi> lastly, <hi>as concerning</hi> preaching, <hi>he
commendeth it in the said</hi> Robert Bruce, <hi>that at</hi> a
certain time wrestling earnestly with the Lord by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
before he came into the assembly, he was heard
<hi>say in his prayer,</hi> Vnto the Lord, I protest I will not

and preached in such evidence and demonstration of the
Spirit, that by the shining of his face, &amp; that showr of
divine influence that the word spoken was accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

had been in the Mount with God, and that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

her that conceived him. <hi>Pag. 444.</hi>

now greatly condemn, under the termeof <hi>QVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERISM.</hi>

ALEXANDER SKEIN
wisheth all happinesse, and the sound and
saving knowledge of the Truth, as it is in
IESVS.</head>
            <p>IT is no small matter of regrete, that so
many persons of all ranks and conditions are so
little concerned with the publike work of God,
and the matters of his Kingdom at this time. If
their own affairs goe wel, they matter little how it
goe with Religion. It was a great ground of the
Prophets complaint, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 1. That there were
<hi>none that sought the Truth, or were valiant for the
Truth on Earth, Ier.</hi> 9. 3. This is not onely the guilt
of the body of the Nation, but also the sin of these
that pretend to a piece of more seriousnesse: but
they should know, <hi>the eyes of the Lord are upon the
Truth, Ier. 5. 3. And the neglect of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great wrath, upon a people, and a hand from the
Lord, ver.</hi> 3. Whereupon the Prophet said, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.
Surely these are poor, they are foolish, for they know not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58863:121"/>
the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God.
This very thing hath with weight come near my
heart, when I have observed such an indifferency
amongst many, that they have been at little or no
pains to search for the mind of the Lord amidst all
the disputes and debats anent his Truth in their day,
and being thus exercised, the Lord hath in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
manifested this to me, that there are some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
obstructions that stand in the way, why people
have not a desire to search after the Truth.</p>
            <p>1. One is, that Truth is mostly the object of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and scorn to the multitude of the world, &amp;
the owners of it are hated, despised and persecuted,
and upon this account many are content to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>conviction</hi> of it, yea to hearken rather to any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may strengthen them to stand out against
it, then that which would incline them to come
under subjection to the yoake thereof. Wherefore
it was upon good ground that Christ said; <hi>If any
man will be my Disciple he must deny himself, and
take up his cross dayly and follow me:</hi> this is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
condition and qualification of a Disciple they
may as well renounce to be a Christian, as refuse to
take up the cross which is entailed on all that will be
followers of Christ, for <hi>if any love Father or Mother,
husband or Wife, houses or lands, &amp;c. better then Christ
he is not worthy of me,</hi> saith Christ, there must be
a compleat resignation of all that is nearest and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58863:121"/>
to us in the world if we mind to be reall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and to encourage all to make this choyce
there want, not many sweet and precious promises
of rewards both in time and eternity, though few
believe them.</p>
            <p>A 2. <hi>obstruction</hi> is that people have a perswasion,
they may be eternally saved, whether they embrace
the Truth or not, seing it is acknowledged upon all
hands, that many have been saved that have lived
and dyed in the same Profession they stand in; and
upon this ground they suppose they need not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
any thing that will disquiet their rest, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
their ease and render them obnoxious to the
crosse. But if this have any weight in it, it might
have as wel excused the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> &amp; <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Iewes,</hi> for refuseing the Gospell, and the
doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> that taught them
to forbeare <hi>circumcision</hi> and the Ceremonys of the
Law, becaus <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and all the
godly for many generations walked in the way of
their profesion, yea this might have excused the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
at the reformation to have rejected the Light the
Lord held forth to them, becaus it is acknowledged
that the sincere and single hearted amongst them in
preceeding generations were saved. But who amongst
the <hi>Protestants</hi> will say that this was a sufficient
ground to remain still in Popery? for had any of them
that walked up rightly in the way of the <hi>Mosaïcall</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:58863:122"/>
Ceremonys been living when these things became
deadly, and had opposed the Light of the Gospell,
which repealled them they could not have been safe.
Neither any professing Popery that had occasion to
embrace the Light of reformation, and yet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to that Light would needs continue to defend
that <hi>idolatry</hi> &amp; <hi>superstition,</hi> &amp; refuse to receive that
Light, after these waters were turned into blood,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 3. So it is now, though they believe that
many good Men, that were faithfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o what they
knew, &amp; walked uprightly acording to their measure
in former times; yet if they shall upon that pretence
presume to resist, reject, or refuse, the <hi>Light</hi> that
the Lord is further manifesting at this day, such
cannot have any ground to expect salvation. See
<hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 15. 22. If I had not come and spoken unto them
they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not had sin, but now they have nocloake for
their sin;</hi> But may expect to be numbred amongst
the enemys of Gods Work. It was the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of good Men in all ages, that they walked sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the dispensation of the Lord in their day,
and this is the great duty the Lord calls for from his
people, to <hi>follow the Lamb wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thersoever he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> this will be their commendation before the
Lord, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. When the life, Light and power
of God removeth from one dispensation to another,
to be alwayes a follower of that which is our duty,
for it is not to be expected that <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> if
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58863:122"/>
they were alive now would looke to find that life in
their sacrifices and externall rites which they found,
when they were upon Earth, no this is only to be
waited for in the spirituall way of the Gospell wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And to come nearer, if <hi>Cranmer, Hooker</hi>
and <hi>Ridly</hi> who were <hi>Martyrs</hi> for the <hi>Protestant
faith</hi> in beareing witness against the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the
<hi>Masse,</hi> &amp; thought it no small mercy to have the use
of a common prayer booke in English, &amp; no doubt
in that day might feel life in it; yet when the Light of
reformation encreased, it discovered that to be a
limiting of the Spirit of God in Prayer, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
had in it self a tendency to deaden the heart
by remaining in that formality. If they were
living now, the Lord would require of them to seek
after a more Spirituall Way of worship, where
the pure life of Christ was more to be found and felt
then in read prayers. Even so now when the Lord
is poynting forth a more spirituall way, which is by
following the pure motions of the Spirit of life in an
immediat way upon the heart in all religious dutys,
the Lord will have all his people to owne that way
both in practice and profession, and they that will
reject this, or refuse or oppose it. He will no less
reckon them as his enemys now, then these, that
have been refusers, or opposers of his work in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
generations.</p>
            <p>A 3 <hi>Obstruction</hi> is, <hi>Truth</hi> hath been for most
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58863:123"/>
part loaded by its opposers with many heavy slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
calumnys and lyes, and traduced with the nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
of <hi>errour, Heresy, blasphemy</hi> and <hi>delusion,</hi>
yea called <hi>devilisme,</hi> and what else malice can invent,
so <hi>Pauls</hi> religion was called <hi>heresy;</hi> Acts. 24. 14.
and Christians were a sect every where spoken
against, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 22. Yea Christ himself was said
to have a Devil, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 48, 53. And what wonder
then that the opposers of Truth in this day speake so
of Truth, as it is now manifested? The Professors
thereof are said to deny Jesus Christ that was borne
of the virgin Mary, where as they have often testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
they owne no other Christ, but him to be the
Saviour of the world, that was crucifyed at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and this we can say in the uprightness
of our hearts, as in his sight, that <hi>searches hearts.</hi>
Our opposers say wee <hi>deny the Scriptures of Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
whereas we owne all things therein (being rightly
translated) to be the dictate of the Holy Spirit and
that they containe all the <hi>substantialls</hi> of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and whatsoever is contrary to them, to be
but delusion; yea we are content to have all poynts
of controversy betwixt us and our opposers to be
determined by the Scriptures of Truth. We are
said to deny the Ministry and ordinances of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;
whereas we owne all the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithfull
Ministers,</hi> that are <hi>called of God,</hi> and that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and are not meerely <hi>men-made Ministers,</hi> that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58863:123"/>
are made to be <hi>Ministers</hi> in the meere will of men,
only endued with some measure of natural and
acquired parts, and feel not the power and vertue
of the life of Jesus Christ dwelling in their hearts,
without any sense of which power and life they can
pray and preach. But we owne all Spirituall and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preaching and prayer. As for the ordinances call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Sacraments</hi> we own them only according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Baptisme</hi> which is by the
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for <hi>Iohn Baptised</hi> with water, but
Christs Baptisme is <hi>with the Holy Ghost and with fire,
Math. 3. 11. Act.</hi> 1. 4. This is that <hi>one baptisme,
Eph.</hi> 4. 5. The <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> that is <hi>Elementary</hi>
we deny, as being but a <hi>carnal ordinance,</hi> which
are all repealed at the time of reformation under
the Gospell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. as all rites are, which
<hi>stand in meats and drinks, washings,</hi> or <hi>Baptismes,</hi>
as the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it. But we owne the <hi>Communion
of Christs body and blood</hi> according to <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 53.
compared with <hi>verse</hi> 63. Our opposers say we lay
the whole stresse of justification and remission of
sins upon our own righteousness, and we declare we
owne <hi>no meritorious cause</hi> of the remission of sins,
but the righteousness, blood and sufferings of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, that was crucified at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and as
it was done and performed by the Man Christ,
born of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and yet we profess none
are justified, but such as are in a measure sanctified,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58863:124"/>
and actually cleansed from sin, so as none are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in their sins. These and many more of the like
slaunders asserted with boldness and impudence by
malicious opposers, are no small obstruction to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
simple-hearted people, who are but too ready
to take things, of this nature, upon trust, without
tryall and proofe, especially if the assertors be in any
repute for a piece of seriousness, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees</hi> &amp; <hi>high Priests,</hi> who were in great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and esteem with the people, and thereby did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
their slender followers to preferre <hi>Barrabas
a murderer</hi> and a <hi>robber,</hi> to <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A 4 <hi>Obstruction</hi> is, that <hi>Truth,</hi> when it comes first
abroad, is at severall great disadvantages in the eyes
of the world, as <hi>first,</hi> it seldom hath the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Civil authority, but mostly is persecuted,
and laws and statutes made in opposition to it, this
is universally known in all ages, and throughout
these Nations, where it first appeared. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
it hath the opposition of the <hi>Nationall Clergy,</hi> so
called, and of the most learned of that sort of men,
who have the greatest advantages of authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
the body of the Nation; see <hi>Ioh. 9. 22. For
the Iews had agreed already, that if any men did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that he was Christ, he should he put out of the
Synagogue. Thirdly,</hi> Truth being a witness against
the abuse and superstitions which have through
length of time and long custome, been rooted and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58863:124"/>
strengthned so in a Nation, that it needs no less the
the power of God to extirpate, people can hardly
admit to hearken to any testimony against these
things whether they be personal or national cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
see <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 9. and he said unto them,
<hi>full wel ye reject the commandement of God, that ye
may keepe your own tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's not an easie thing to forsake old Customes,
this hath been a cause, why men in all ages have
stumbled at the simplicity of truth, becaus it was not
decked with the trimmings and ornaments of the
whore. I need not enlarge on this, the application is
so plaine. <hi>Fourthly, education</hi> and <hi>breeding</hi> in
<hi>wrong glosses</hi> and <hi>mistakes</hi> of Scripture proofes, hath
been none of the least hinderances of the progress of
truth, or of its reception, and for this let the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
divers reasonings of the <hi>Iewes</hi> against Christ in
his descent, doctrine and miracles be considered,
and men may then as in a glass see the image of
that spirit, that is in opposition to truth in this day:
and for this I referr the sober inquirer after Truth,
to <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi> his book, (called <hi>The outward
Iew a looking glass for Professors)</hi> this is such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that none acquainted with his writings, but
will allow him a good character, if he be not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicated
opposer.</p>
            <p>5. Another great <hi>Obstruction,</hi> which keeps
people from the search after Truth, is a light and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58863:125"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mind, which predominats in the most of Men
and Women in the world. This hinders Truth in
the very power and life of it, and permits none to
be serious in the search of it: it is not the conviction
of judgement in matters of truths, that the Lord
calls for only, or that his faithfull servants endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as if it were satisfaction to them to see many
owning it, or professing the forme thereof, these
are but at best like the stony or thorny ground, that
receive the seed with joy, and yet in a day of the
heat of persecution, turn from it, and so may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a discredit to the Truth. 't Is only these that
labour not only to know the Truth, and espouse it
in their understandings, but also endeavour to feel
the power and life of it reach their hearts, and this
not only for a touch at a time, but to live and feed
upon that life &amp; power, which flowes forth from the
fountain &amp; spring of it, I say these only it is, that will
be true witnesses of the Truth. Hence Christ spake
many parables to this purpose, as that of the <hi>wise mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi>
that <hi>sold all &amp; bought the pearle:</hi> &amp; the <hi>treasure
that was hid in the ground, &amp;c.</hi> Let all persons that
are of this light and airy spirit, consider their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
how uncapable they are not only to come to the
knowledge of the Truth of God in their day and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
but also utterly unfitted for being heires
of the kingdom, when time shall be no more. If they
did mind the care of their precioussoules, and consider
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58863:125"/>
their mortality, how uncertaine their time is, and
of what concernment it is to them to be truely
serious, they would not make too light of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of God and of the Truth, which concern their
everlasting salvation, but would find them of farre
greater moment, then these temporall pleasures,
profits and recreations, wherewith they are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
taken up.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, my desire to all, is that they would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
consider these few obstructions mentioned,
and apply their mind, to search after the wayes
of the Lord, and beware to take matters of so great
concernment upon trust from any Man, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of men; but impartially weigh and ponder by
the <hi>Light of the Lord in their own hearts,</hi> what is
<hi>Truth,</hi> and what is <hi>errour by</hi> what doctrine the free
Grace of God will be most esteemed, and the pride of
Man most abased, beware of an <hi>implicit faith,</hi> for

the faith of another. They are most to be suspected as
deceivers, that do most hinder inquiry and triall,
as many Preachers at this time are doing. It is a
known <hi>Popish imposition</hi> to <hi>forbid searching,</hi> and
is now renounced, and abominated by all sound
Protestants, therefore they are yet drunk with the
<hi>Whores Cup,</hi> that would obtrude their doctrine
to be beleived without triall, or to hinder from try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spirits, and from trying all things, that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58863:126"/>
what is best may be kept to. If any <hi>object</hi> that word
Prov. 19. 27. <hi>Coase to heare the instruction that causeth
to erre from the words of knowledge.</hi> I answer this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
a cleare and wel grounded faith, of the
Truth, from an inward principle, which few ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Professors can lay claime to, otherwayes this
might have excused the <hi>Iewes</hi> in not harkening to
Christ and his Apostles, in saying, <hi>we know God

should have remained in Popery without triall.
Wherefore friends, if ye will truely joyne and be
