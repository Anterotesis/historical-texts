            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ere this Present but as great as the Confidence
which makes it, I should then have assum'd
that as my Election, which now I do as my
Pennance. For</hi> Parthenissa <hi>has protested to me,
though she have been nourish'd in misfortune,
yet my Pen has been her highest; and that to
Dedicate her to any but my Lady</hi> Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
<hi>were to injure her as much in the address of her Adventures,
as in the Relation. Perhaps Madam, my opinion may be yours, and
that you will esteem her as guilty in her Iustice, as I am in my fault,
since the pennance she enjoyns me for one crime, is to commit a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
'Tis the respect I owe to you and to Truth, which makes me
use this expression, for I cannot write of</hi> Parthenissa <hi>so ill, but to
write to My Lady</hi> Northumberland <hi>is worse. But Madam, that you
may not conclude me a wilful offender, which seemingly I may appear,
by a knowledge of the greatest fault, and then by an election of it:
I have this to alledge in my justification, that had not the Theory of
Virtue taught me the noblest operation of it, is to pardon offences,
your practice had: For I have found you as much pleas'd in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on me your pardon, as I have been to receive it, or troubled
to need it. So that I cannot term that a crime in which you take
delight, nor condemn that performance which affords you any; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can you suspect this Truth, when for the manifestation of it, I
decline not so criminal a proof. Thus Madam, you may see I injure
you, but to do you right, and publish my transgression, but to do the
same of your Mercy. But since</hi> Parthenissa <hi>has us'd me at a contrary
rate, I shall not scruple to imitate her example, and to render her
fault as evident as she has mine: 'Tis, Madam, that she offer'd me
<pb facs="tcp:96335:3"/>
her pardon for this Book, if in it I would draw her Coppy by making
you my Original; but my respect and my disability render'd me unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the Will and Power of effecting it, neither can I better illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the greatness of the former, than by proportionating it to that
of the latter. You would not be what you are, could I have made her
what she would be; since to render any resembling you, were to injure
you in your noblest Prerogative, and to act a crime, which Nature
has not, or rather could not perform. Besides, Madam, could I have
represented her such a perfection, I could not have committed that
offence, for which this reparation was prescrib'd, for I could not have
continu'd the</hi> Romance, <hi>since thereby my Hero's friendships must
have yielded to their Loves, and with much more reason, than their
doing so, could have been condemn'd. There is a necessity in Books
of this nature, that the Beauties in them must have some particular
charms, the one above the other, but you possess all those graces in a
more sublime perfection, than any one of them; does any one of them,
and I have heard</hi> Parthenissa <hi>profess with as much concern as truth,
that if there be any thing in the Book which bears her Name that
relishes of the</hi> Romance, <hi>'tis only because you are not the subject of
it: Your Beauty would bring credit to more transcendent things, than
are there related, and make that which would require Faith in any
other case, appear as much Reason in yours, as that which confines
me inviolably to the highest ambition'd Title of,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Sun was already so far declin'd,
that his heat was not offensive, when
a Stranger richly Arm'd, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
blest with all the gifts of Nature,
and Education, alighted at the Temple
of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> where the Queen
of Love had setled an Oracle, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
as the Deity, to whom it was
Consecrated. The Stranger having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
himself, and learnt the unusual
silence of the Goddess, commanded his
servant to enquire out some retir'd lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, which whilst he was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his Master walk't about that sacred place, without so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the beauty, and rareness of the structure, and with so lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
and careless a pace, that those which consider'd it, easily
judg'd, 'twas chiefly the distempers of his Mind, which had so strong
an influence over his Body. Amongst many that were so employed,
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> the Prince of that holy Society, was so ravisht with those
charms, which in spight of fortunes cruelties, did yet inhabit his face
and shape, and so strangely sympathiz'd in those crosses, whose effects
were not more apparent, than their causes unknown; that he could not
abstain from interrupting the strangers melancholly, by going to salute
him, where after those civilities which are usually practis'd in such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
he invited him into a less frequented walk than that he had
chosen: The stranger inform'd of his quality and profession, was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be uncivil to either, and therefore obeyed his invitation, but
had far rather employ'd the time of the Oracles silence in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of his thoughts, though they never permitted him so much as
a good expectation, always representing his hopes and fears through a
false Optick, which had so transcendently alter'd him, that if the Gods
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96335:4"/>
could have been mistaken in the infliction of their punishments, so strange
a change had made them doubt, they had been so in him.</p>
               <p>The good <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who judg'd by the reliques what the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had been, led him purposely alone into a solitary Walk, to learn
his Adventures, and perceiving the unintermissiveness of his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
he took that for the rise, and told him, I have had no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
Sir, with my self, before I resolv'd to beg of you a relation of
your life; for I know by experience, that the repetition of a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is a new one, but the great Goddess, whose unworthy Priest I am,
hath often rais'd a curiosity in me to learn the Adventures of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who come to consult her Oracle, and afterwards has inspir'd me with
such advice, that from thence they have deriv'd their future happiness:
And I am strongly perswaded you may enjoy an advantage equal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many others, if you will furnish me with a resembling means. Alas,
Sir, the Stranger reply'd, though I am confident your Goddesses fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to you are great, and that your judgment is so, yet the higher
Powers have so incessantly persecuted me, that my folly would propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
my misfortunes, did I expect any ease but in the Grave; neither do
I know whether then I shall be at quiet; for sleep being the Image of
Death, and my Dreams tormenting me as much as my Thoughts, I may
with too much reason suspect, that what is the remedy of all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to others, will loose that property where I am concern'd. The vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Callimachus</hi> here interrupted him by saying, I shall not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that your miseries are great, since your diffidence of the Gods is so:
They are never more offended than when men despair of their Providence,
nor readier to assist, then when there is no visible relief, and yet a firm
reliance on it: The Deity being never more apparent than in doing
things as well beyond the Expectation, as the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ert of Man. Then
taking the Stranger by the hand, he begg'd his pardon for so necessary
an interruption, beseeching him to believe that great Truth, which both
his profession, and experience made him utter. The Stranger found this
reprehension to be as just as civil; and after having assur'd <hi>Callimachus</hi>
that 'twas his melancholly (not he) that had offended, did offer him as
a Penance to relate his Fortunes. <hi>Callimachus</hi> being highly satisfied with
it, answer'd him, You see how much the Gods are pleas'd with those
which assume their quarrel, for my performing it has not only produc'd
the ambition'd effect of making you perceive your fault, but hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
procured an engagement I was almost as impatient of, and would
it might please those Powers to give me the means as certainly to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
your misfortunes, as I am confident I shall be a sharer in them. By
that time this Civility was answer'd, they were come into a Walk so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Yew and Cypress, that it appeared a fit Scene for so sad a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
where <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s silence made the Stranger begin this ensuing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <div type="section">

                  <p>THough my misfortunes are of so sad a quality, that I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publish than conceal who I am, since I might find by divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my self, that cure from my Enemies resentments the Gods have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
my own from performing, yet because they have commanded me
to learn my destiny from this Oracle, I am determin'd not to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any thing which probably may hinder it, and if by that answer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96335:4"/>
it gives me: I find my Death as necessary as I now believe it. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also erect to be oblig'd to my own hands for my Cure, than to
those of my Enemies; 'tis upon these considerations onely, that before
I proceed any further, I must beg your secresie; my actions as you will
understand by the sequel of my discourse, having rais'd me Enemies whose
power is as great as their malice. <hi>Callimachus</hi> would here have made
him Protestation of that inviolable silence he desir'd, but the generous
Stranger would not permit him, believing himself sufficiently certain of
it, by having acquainted him now necessary it was: And therefore
not to give the holy Priest any time for so needless an assurance, he
thus continu'd his Story. My name is <hi>Artabanes,</hi> I was born in the Reign
of <hi>Orodes,</hi> the present King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> who is also called <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
(which is the name appropriated to all those Kings, in honor to <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
the first Founder of that Monarchy) I had my education with <hi>Orode</hi>'s
eldest son, the Prince <hi>Pacorus,</hi> whose favour I possess'd in no unconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ble
degree, while I had the honour to be near him. My Father, whose
name is <hi>Moneses,</hi> might now by a just succession wear the Crown of
<hi>Media;</hi> did not a nobler Principle invite him to decline it. He was
Unkle to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> the last King of that flourishing Countrey, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Brother to <hi>Tiridates</hi> his Father, who, by the infusions of evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
had received so great a jealousie of mine, that to vindicate his
innocency, and to remove his Brothers suspitions, he retir'd into <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
where <hi>Orodes</hi>'s entertainment was worthy the great Blood of the
<hi>Arsacides,</hi> of which <hi>Moneses</hi> hath the honour to be descended, and in a
short time, gave him his only Sister the Princess <hi>Ebuzara,</hi> who having
presented my Father with the unfortunate <hi>Artabanes</hi> (three years after)
with <hi>Lindary,</hi> she dyed, but <hi>Arsaces</hi> affection for her Husband did not,
and he multiplyed his favours on my Sister and me so abundantly, that
a long while we little found the want of so excellent a Mother, his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
care so well supplyed that loss. <hi>Moneses</hi> had his education among
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> whose Customs he so highly valu'd, that I was no sooner
fit to learn, than he had by liberal Pensions procured many of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to render my Education perfect; in all which exercises, as well of
the Mind as of the Body, those that flatter'd me would say, I was no ill
Proficient. One day as I was waiting on the King, there came in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in Mourning, who presented a Petition to him; But oh Gods! with
so much majesty and humility together, that I admir'd how two such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
things could meet in one subject, her Eyes had antipathy to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of our Sex, destroying all those that beheld them, her shape and
motion had peculiar Charms, and she had a certain vivacity and air in
her countenance, that assur'd me her wit was not inferiour to her beauty,
and yet one might easily perceive, that Time, which is the ruine of all
other Faces, would but improve hers, she being not then above fifteen
years old. I must ingenuously confess, my heart by some extraordinary
motions foretold proportionate events, and the sight of so many perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
made me inquisitive of her name which possest them: A Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
which stood by, soon satisfied my curiosity, by acquainting me her
name was <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> that she was the onely heir of the generous <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxtorses,</hi> who had been long General of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> that this young
Princess petition'd the King for a continuation of that Principality, which
had been enjoyed by her Father; who from all his services and victories
deriv'd no other advantage, than the honor of acting them, and at
his death had left no other Wealth behind him, but that of a high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96335:5"/>
While the King was reading her Petition, I took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of saluting her, and after some little civilities of telling her, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I find two things since my coming into this Chamber worthy of
my wonder, that <hi>Miraxtorses</hi>'s deserts should Petition for a Reward, and
that you should present it, or if I am singular in both these causes of
admiration I have a third, in which I shall have as many of my opinion,
as beholders of what creates it; If, Sir, reply'd she (with a little redness)
I had no better hope of success in my desires to the first, than I have no
pretence to the last cause of your admiration, I should despair of my
request, or at least onely expect that from the Kings favour, which I
now assure my self to receive from his Justice. Madam (said I) you have
so good a Title both to what you petition for, and to all I ascribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that I shall think you do more wrong the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
by disclaiming so great a truth, than Fortune has, by necessitating you
to desire, or <hi>Arsaces</hi> can, though he declin'd granting it; which least
he should, I humbly beg you not to refuse the duty of my friends
or my interceeding with him. Then without staying for her consent,
lest she should reject the first proffer of my service, I went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blushing and trembling to my Father, who then came in, and besought
him to employ his power with <hi>Orodes,</hi> in a cause so worthy his solliciting,
and the Kings concession. <hi>Moneses,</hi> who was always inclin'd to actions
of this quality, so powerfully perswaded <hi>Arsaces</hi> to grant the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>'s
request, that he did it. You may easily imagine I received no
small contentment in this little service, especially when after I had begg'd
her to accept it as an earnest of what I was confin'd to pay her; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
her blushes plac'd a true interpretation on my meaning: But
after that little disorder was past, whether to disguise it, or out of a
true sence of what she was then going to say, I cannot tell; but I can,
that her answer was, My obligation to you (Sir) is so extreme great,
that it makes me almost question the Kings justice, or my Fathers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which needed so powerful an intercession. I had no leisure to reply,
for <hi>Arsaces</hi> retir'd into his Cabinet, and she to her own house, whither I
desir'd to wait on her, but she would permit me to do so no farther than
to her Chariot. I withdrew my self immediately after to my own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
and passed the rest of the day with some impatience, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a Darkness equal to that which began to diffuse it self over
my Thoughts, that I might the more uninterruptedly entertain them.
As soon as I was a-bed, instead of that rest I usually took, I found mine
was disturbed by a throng of Assailants. But <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> beauty had
assum'd so transcendent an Empire over my memory, that my reflections
on it almost suppressed all others; which made me begin to imagine it
was Love, by my then resenting what I had heard of it. I must confess this
did somewhat surprise me, for my Governor had imbued me with so bad
a character of that passion (he being a Stoick) that I fear'd it almost as
much as I admir'd <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> which made me call into my memory
all those Antidotes he had given me, As the poorness of submitting to a
Sex the Gods had given ours the Authority over: The vast troubles in
purchasing our desires: The smallness (commonly) of the value, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd;
or the natural Inconstancy of Women, which by depriving us of a
known felicity, renders the loss greater. That by the definition of Love,
the Chase is a greater happiness than the Quarry; For Love is a desire,
and we never desire that which we enjoy, therefore with the fruition
the Love ceases; so that the best of Love is to be ill, but to be well again;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96335:5"/>
Who would be a Votary to that Passion? Many other arguments my
memory would have furnisht me withal, had not the growing Idea of
<hi>Parthenissa's</hi> beauty made them vanish; and then my Reason taking her
Defence, furnisht me with these Answers. That the Precedency that
our Sex had over hers, was rather an Assumption of our own, than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Gods; for amongst those Creatures which purely observe
the Dictates of Nature, and can neither Lie nor Dissemble, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine
Sex is courted by the Masculine; or if the Divine Law gave the
last preheminence over the first, yet the Law of Custom did suspend it.
That the consideration of troubles to a mind capable of so high a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
as the adoring of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> should rather inflame than diminish
the courage. In what darkness had the World liv'd, if difficulty had
not rather added to, than suppress'd the Desires of generous undertakings:
As for the smallness of the value if obtain'd, that is not the fault of
Love, but of Choice. That Inconstancy is not hereditary to the Sex,
the examples of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and many others sufficiently evidencing, that
is not their Nature, but their Vice: That it would be a difficult thing
to perswade a man who might grow rich, out of that desire,
from an apprehension that if he became poor again, his loss would
be the more unsupportable. And lastly, to Loves being a desire which
ceaseth with fruition; we might as justly say, that a Merchant which
courts Wealth, and makes his life his trouble to obtain it; when he has
his end, may as properly be call'd poor, as an enjoying Lover, by fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,
ceases to be one; for when he once has the possession, so many
unfancy'd joyes disclose themselves, that they afford sufficient nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to preserve, if not increase the fire; and the desire of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of that happiness does still maintain Love, if Love were only a
desire: For Fruition is not like lighting, that vanishes so soon as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
but as the <hi>Elizian</hi> Joyes, whose greatness consists in the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so that Love is better in the Quarry than in the Chase; yet the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is a happiness too, onely as the means, but Fruition perfects happiness
as the end. I tell you these little Reasonings, not that I esteem them
worthy your attention, but to acquaint you with <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s power:
since to captivate a heart that had no aversion to Love, is as common, as
to subdue one so prepossest with a prejudicate opinion of it, was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fit for <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> Beauty, in which all virtues were so evident, that
I needed not the help of time, but of sight to disclose them. I will not
trouble you any more in telling you how long it was before I did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
since at last I was necessitated to it, and had no sooner resolv'd there
was no mean between my misery and her favour, but I apply'd my self to
all wayes I imagin'd might render me the least unworthy of it. And to shew
how much the Gods contributed to the growth of this passion; there fell
out after many revolutions, an accident (even when my sufferings must
have disclos'd what I had brought my words to conceal) which did not
onely acquaint her with the greatness of my flame, but did also inspire her
with one which has since proved so fatal to us both. There was an Ancient
custom in <hi>Parthia,</hi> to celebrate the Anniversary of the Kings Coronation,
with all the shews of magnificence and joy, which the Art or Affections
of the people could invent; and because the <hi>Parthians</hi> were ever esteem'd
the Warlik'st Nation in the whole World, to continue that just reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they declin'd all those effeminacies which are so predominant in
other Courts, and absolutely addicted themselves to such Martial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
as are nothing less pleasing and delightful than the others, and yet fit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96335:6"/>
and prepare men more for the real use of Arms, and Acquisition of Glory.
'Twas this practice, which made the youth about the Court, to publish
over all <hi>Asia</hi> a solemn Tilting, where such as had any skill and courage
were invited to shew them, by divers Heralds expresly sent into all the
Kingdoms of the East. And though this was more upon Gallantry than any
other score, and that the Laws of it extended only to breaking of Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet there hapned an accident which wholly subverted the first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so innocent a meeting.</p>
                  <p>The exercises of it were to last three days, and Fortune, to evince
her blindness, had permitted me the two first to remain victorious: But
as I was coming out of the Lists, attended by the acclamations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of my friends, we heard a great noise of Trumpets and Clarions,
which imposed on us a general stop and silence, the King too, and all
the Court, at so unexpected Musick, return'd to their seats to learn the
cause of it: Their curiosity was soon satisfied by the appearing of Four
and twenty Blackamoor Pages, richly cloath'd, and well horst, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
each of them at the end of an Ebony stick tipt with gold, the
several Picture of some excellent Beauty: These were followed by
their Master, who was advantageously mounted, and whose Helmet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open'd, discover'd a Face more capable to create fear than any
other Passion; and yet even in those barbarous features, there was an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
evidence of a resembling courage and magnanimity. As soon as he
was come near the highest Scaffold, he sent one of the six Pages which
followed him, to enquire where the King was; who having obey'd, and
satisfied his Lord, he himself immediately advanc'd towards <hi>Arsaces,</hi> and
made him a salutation much after the rate of these ensuing words. Sir
(said he) I am of that <hi>Arabia,</hi> which is called the <hi>Happy,</hi> and am in
some degree ally'd to the King of that Countrey; I ador'd a Beauty
there, which had no defect but her cruelty, and though that soon ended
with her life, yet my Passion instead of dying with the object of it, did
the contrary; for it increast to such a height, that it seemed all those
flames with which she set so many hearts on fire, flew into mine, as the seat
of the great'st and perfect'st Empire: And though time be the common
cure of most misfortunes, yet it prov'd the increase of mine; for the
more I reflected on my loss, the greater I always found it; and at last
the operation of so just a grief, reduc'd me to so deep a melancholly,
that my King came to visit me, and to cure my Passion, spoke so many impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things against the perfection that had created it, (which he injuriously
said was equall'd by many) that not daring to expiate his offence with his
life, because of his character, I publickly vow'd never to continue in
his Dominions, and that I would visit all the Courts of <hi>Asia,</hi> to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that none but my own King durst say any Beauty was comparable
to that of the fair <hi>Mizalinza's.</hi> To effect this, I instantly abandon'd
the place of my birth, and publisht my design, and the conditions of
the Combat, (if any were so vain as to undertake it) which were, That
whosoever should defend the object of his Passion, by equalling it to her
that created mine, in case I became victorious, he should give me the
Picture of his Mistris, which I ever after carried with me, and hung up
as a Trophy. These Four and twenty several Beauties had the ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be compar'd to <hi>Mizalinza</hi>'s, and by the Death, or Conquest of
those which ador'd them, are now to wait upon her, whom their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Lovers equall'd them to. The fame of this great meeting, has drawn
me Sir to your Court, where if any be so presumptuous as to justifie such
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96335:6"/>
folly, I will not with my Lance alone (which I understand is the onely
Arms of this Tilting) but with my Sword maintain a truth which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalinza's</hi>
eyes, more than the defeat of the greatest Courages in the World,
hath abundantly justified. But perhaps (he coutinued) that the sight
of this charming beauty, will produce a confession, which may exempt
my Sword from that trouble; Thereupon with a deep reverence, he drew
out the Copy of so glorified an Original, and having exposed it to all our
views, he further added, that if any durst undertake to lessen her perfection
by a comparison, that the next morning he would appear on the same place
he was then on, to manifest to the offender, that nothing but his blood
was capable to wash away his crime. Then without staying for any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
he retir'd to his Lodgings, and left us in as great an astonishment
at his insolence, as at his Passion; But <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who was a Prince that in
his youth had been blest with a high valour, did so exceedingly resent
the impudence of <hi>Ambixules</hi> (for so this <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince was called) that
he publickly profest, if none in his Court had the courage to fight with
him, he would do it, for the defence of an Imaginary Mistris, rather
than suffer an affront to be done unto the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as great even as
the insolency with which it was committed. There is no doubt but that
<hi>Orodes</hi>'s Court was then replenisht with Men, who apprehended nothing
in dangers, but that they were not great enough; Yet at that instant,
the loves of the major part were so unhappy, that they durst not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Objects of them, and 'twas upon that score onely, this
<hi>Arabian</hi> had like to have engross'd an honour without drawing his
Sword, greater than ever he had obtained by it. The same misfortune
had then an influence over me, and I dare truly profess, if I had any
uncertainty in the undertaking to punish <hi>Ambixules</hi> insolence, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not from my apprehension of him, but <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> for whom I
durst hardly acknowledge openly I had a Passion, till she in private had
approv'd it; But I thought the crime of that presumption would not
equal that of the tacite confession and beauty transcended hers, and that
I had a less Title to her anger, by discovering my flame to defend her
right, than expose that to any apparent injury, by a concealment of
it: Neither was it impossible but I might return from the Combat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
receiving any such wounds, whose cure might necessitate my disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
in which case, I was resolv'd to conceal my self, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my Passion, till she, to whom it was addrest, would bless me with the
reception of it. 'Twas with these and many such reasons, that I assum'd a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to become the Protector of an Excellency, which had no misfortune,
but that it needed one, or that it had one so unworthy that honour as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes:</hi>
I kept this determination exceeding private, least if it had been
discover'd, my friends might have deny'd my first essay in Arms to have
been against so known a Conqueror; I had some difficulty too, to fit
my self with Armour, for that I had made use of the two precedent
days, was too publickly known to have been used the third. But, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
that the Prince <hi>Sillaces,</hi> my most particular friend, and who
merited abundantly to be so, had an excellent one, which he had made
for that solemnity, but being unfortunately troubl'd with an Ague, he
was necessitated to decline shewing his skill and gallantry, which indeed
I apprehended more than any others. These Arms I sent privately to
borrow of his servant, who, knowing his Prince could not possibly use
them, sent them to me; and I found that they were very fit, our shapes,
and heights being as resembling as our friendships. I will not amuse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96335:7"/>
my self to tell you how impatiently I past the night, nor how early I came
to the assignation, lest some others should have prevented me: I shall
not onely let you know, that I was there before any that might have
had my design, and before <hi>Ambixules</hi> too; whom I did not long expect,
and how at his entry into the Lists, manag'd his Horse with so much art
and grace, that he attracted all the eyes of the assistants: After he had
ended, I began the same exercise, to shew him I was not ignorant of it;
But not to dress a true story in cloaths of a Romance, I will pass by
the descriptions of our Arms, Devices, Motto's, and all things of so low a
nature; to acquaint you, that <hi>Ambixules</hi> having repaid me the civility
of looking on his Horses manage, demanded of me the sight of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
Picture; to which I told him, That the Excellency I ador'd, would
not be what it was, if it lay in the power of Art to represent it;
but that the Original being present, I would conduct him to it; where
his Justice must be as blind, as she herself is painted, if he did not
adore what he came to injure. Come, said <hi>Ambixules,</hi> smiling, I will go
see this Beauty, to convince you by a demonstration, that he which hath
seen <hi>Mizalinza's</hi> eyes, can be conquer'd by no others; but (he continued)
though contrary to my practice, I am content to begin the Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I see your Mistrisses Picture; yet you must oblige your self, that some
friend for you, after your death, will let me have the reward of it. This
insolence did not a little offend me, but being resolv'd to repair the
wrong with nobler Arms than those which had committed it; I onely told
him, I was confident to give him the recompence of his Victory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he won it, since it was impossible to see <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> without carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away her Image. By this time we were come so near her, that I
went to the Scaffold she was on, and without lifting up my Helmet (to
continue my disguise) I saluted her with a respect equal to my Passion,
and told her; Madam, if I have the confidence to beg your permission to
vindicate your beauty, 'tis out of a certainty that the success of so just a
dispute, cannot but prove as fortunate, as that it needs not any defence:
Neither do I draw my Sword to justifie that you are the persectest of your
Sex, but to punish <hi>Ambixules</hi> for not acknowledging it. Whilst I was
speaking these few words, she was in some disorder, yet it was so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
a one, that it rather was a friend than any enemy to her beauty; but
she quickly supprest it, to answer me. Whosoever you are, that to
give a long proof of your Courage, give as little one of your Judgment;
I shall conjure you not to undertake a defence, where the injustice of the
quarrel may give your Enemy an advantage, which I believe he would
hardly obtain on a contrary score. Madam (I reply'd) I know how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
betwixt your Modesty and your Justice, and consequently to
attribute to what you now speak, to the first; but if you have so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
a character of the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> I will convince her by an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
how much she has injur'd herself, and my election. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
saluting her with an infinite humility, but without staying for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
I desir'd <hi>Ambixules</hi> to return to the place of Combat, and to hasten
a decision of it; but he was so intent, and ravisht in the consideration
of <hi>Parth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nissa's</hi> beauties, that to interrupt his thoughts, I was forc'd to
tell him, <hi>Ambixules,</hi> I fear if you continue longer in the employment
you are in, I shall have but little honour in my Victory, having to deal
with one who will have lost his heart. This truth made him asham'd
of what he should rather have gloried in; so that turnnig about his
Horse, he rid with me where the Judges attended us, and by the way assur'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96335:7"/>
me that my Mistris had so much of <hi>Mizalinza</hi> in her, that having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht
me, he would desire no other Picture of her than that which he
carried in his memory. This Antedated Victory I excus'd upon the same
score that I had the former, being by this time come where it was no
time to talk. I will pass by acquainting you with the joy <hi>Arsaces</hi> had
to perceive this <hi>Arabian</hi> was not altogether unlike to escape unpunished;
the general wonder of all the Court who I was, and the secret repining
of many Beauties to perceive <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> could find a Protector, when
none of theirs had any; to tell you, That the three first courses, we
broke our Lances with equal advantage; and perceiving they were too
civil Weapons for our designs, we both, as if it had been by mutual consent,
drew out our Swords, and soon made each other feel of what temper
they were of; but <hi>Ambixules</hi> having given me a furious reverse, which
I was endeavouring to repay in the same coin, his Horse unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rose before, so that what I intended for his Master, fell upon him, and
the blow being given with all my strength, and lighting upon his head,
cleft it in two. I was extremely troubled at this misfortune, and having
begg'd <hi>Ambixules</hi> pardon for an undesign'd wrong, I trotted some seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
paces from him, and lighting off my Horse, I return'd again, and told
him, That to manifest I would take no advantage over him, but what I
had by the goodness of my quarrel, and that what I had done was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended,
I came to offer him, if he thought he had any odds in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Horse-back, to send for a fresh one, that then he should
make choice of that or of mine; or if he esteem'd himself in as good a
condition on foot, I was ready so to finish what we had begun. The
Arabian reply'd, That he knew his courage gave him sufficient advantage
over me in whatsoever posture he was in; and since I had kill'd his Horse, he
would not so long a time suspend his revenge, as that which must be spent
in sending for another. This rudeness so incenst me, that I repay'd it
with some dangerous wounds, but at the last, finding his fury more than
his strength made him continue the Combat, I retir'd two or three pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
with intention to preserve a valor I could not but esteem, though
I had receiv'd some dangerous effects of it, and told him; You see <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bixules</hi>
the power of Justice, which has reduc'd you to a condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging,
rather than persevering in your error, and that advantage
which the goodness of my cause hath given me, I desire onely to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
to obtain a confession from your tongue, which your weakness has
already made. Nor my weakness, nor my tongue (said he) shall ever
confess you have any advantage over me, and whilst I hold my Sword,
you shall find me a subject fitter to create your fear than your pity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he renew'd the Fight with much more strength than I thought he
had left him; yet for a while I onely defended my self, but when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his blows were so brisk, that my charity might prove my ruine,
and that he had so much vigor, as I might kill him without a stain;
I cry'd out to him; Since my civility cannot make you acknowledge
what your justice should, your death shall. Finishing these words, I
made him soon feel the punishment of a fault which might have had a
milder reparation, if the continuance of his insolency had not render'd him
unworthy of it. But to conclude this Tragedy, as soon as he fell, he told
me, Whosoever thou art, I forgive thee that death, which by my being
worsted, is rather my joy than my trouble, and though I scorn to beg
my Life, (were it in thy power to save, which I thank the gods it is
not) yet I do not, to conjure thee, to assure that Beauty which to have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96335:8"/>
fought against does more afflict me than to be reduc'd to what I am, that
'twas her Eyes which inspir'd thy Arm, and weighed down mine; and,
that had not shame been more prevalent with me than truth, I had been
her Champion, and not her Adversary; Conjure her to pardon a crime
which I expiate with my blood, and which my hand should have punisht
for her, if thine had not. He would have continu'd his recantation, by
which I perceiv'd I had not onely kill'd an Enemy, but a Rival, had he
not found, that his Tongue began to faulter, which made him, though
with much difficulty, turn himself towards the place where <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
was, and not having the strength to speak to her, he lift up his hands to
implore that pardon his hasty summons hinder'd him to express. As soon
as <hi>Ambixules</hi> was dead, all his Pages came, and presented me those Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
which had been the rewards of their Princes former Combats and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
me that they might have his body to carry into <hi>Arabia,</hi> which I yielded
unto; and then taking all the consequents of my Victory, I went with them
to <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> Scaffold, where I found her by an excess of goodness weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the death of her Enemy, which made me envy what I had deplor'd, and
forc'd me to think my success a misfortune, since it created the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa's</hi>
tears, who judging of my disorder by my silence, wip'd them away,
and thereby gave me the confidence to present her with all those fair Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and to tell her, That the Originals of them could no more complain
against their Servants unhappy defence, since thereby they had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to be hers, which was a felicity greater than any could have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their success. I then acquainted her with <hi>Ambixules</hi> last injunction,
which I said was a proof that not onely he, but his reason was vanquisht,
and that if he had earlier confest a truth which he could not but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of, I would rather have elected to have employ'd my Sword against
my self than him; so great and just was the respect I paid all Adorers;
under which Title I implor'd a pardon for having brought that to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
which needed none, and that her justice would acknowledge, what
that of the gods had, by the event of our Combat. To which <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
reply'd: I am convinc't of nothing by your Victory, but of your
Civility and Courage; the last of which, you are certainly very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of, when you durst undertake to employ it in so unjust a quarrel; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I doubt, by electing me for the subject of your difference, you had
an intention to manifest, that your Sword needed no other assistance, but
what it receiv'd from your Arm, and the concealing your self after a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
which the severest modesty might glory in, confirms me, that
you injure your Courage to avoid doing the like unto your Judgment,
and find more shame in owning the object your Quarrel, than satisfaction
in the effect it has produc'd, Ah! Madam, I reply'd, do not impute
the concealing my self to any thing but the respect I pay you, which is
so great and just, that I had rather decline what you are pleas'd to say I
may glory in, than hazard your anger by disclosing who I am; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the latter being far more prevalent with me, than any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
I can derive from the former. But after some discourses of this
quality, observing, that not onely all the Court, but <hi>Arsaces</hi> himself, was
coming towards <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> Scaffold, I thought it high time to retire,
and therefore made haste to tell her, that I was resolv'd to a concealment
of my name, till by a succession of services I induced her to pardon the
score upon which they were perform'd. A little Blush which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
caused, gave me a belief, that she understood my meaning, and
the apprehension I had for her reply, as well as being environ'd by the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96335:8"/>
crowd, made me take my leave, but on an instant, I found a certain cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
like the hand of Death seize on me, and suddenly after, I fell pale and
speechless at <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> Feet. This unexpected accident had a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
influence on her whilst she knew me not; but after she had discover'd
who I was, by some peoples pulling off my Helmet, to give me a little
air, she abandon'd herself so much to excess of grief, that many attributed
the effects of her good nature to a more obliging cause; and doubtless,
had I seen how happy I was in my misfortune, I had blest those wounds
which were the causes of it. In brief, as soon as those which stood by
knew me, they cry'd out, <hi>Artabanes</hi> is dead: which repeated noise coming
at last to <hi>Moneses</hi> and <hi>Lyndadory's</hi> hearing; they ran transported with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and grief to the place where I lay, and where they found <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>
with one hand stopping a spring of blood which issued f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om
a large wound <hi>Ambixules</hi> had given me, with the other endeavouring to
wipe away two springs of tears which ran from her fair Eyes. That cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
gave them as high a subject of acknowledgment, as the occasion of it
did of grief: But at last, a Litter being brought, and my blood stancht,
I was carried to <hi>Moneses</hi>'s Palace, accompanied by the tears of those,
whose Acclamations I so lately had. <hi>Arsaces</hi> did me the honor to walk
a foot by my Litter, and to see the first dressing of my wounds; where he
receiv'd an assurance from the Chirurgions, that I had none which were
dangerous; that loss of blood was the greatest harm I had sustained, and
that rest was one of the best remedies they could prescribe; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Chamber was immediately emptied of all but my faithful <hi>Syman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
But this deep silence was so far from producing the effect which those
that enjoyn'd it expected; that it did a contrary one, for then all my
thoughts began to assault me. What? said I to my self, can <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
have a greater assurance of the vastness of my Passion, than her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those Beauties which created it, and the services I have this
day render'd them? She were as unjust as she is fair, should she desire
any stronger proof of my Affection. But suddenly my opinion changing,
methought I heard <hi>Parthenissa</hi> say, Presumptuous <hi>Artabanes,</hi> dost thou
esteem me at so low a rate as to think, that nothing which thou hast done
to day deserves me? Thou hast lov'd me because I was lovely, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of thy Passion renders thy service the less, and thou hast more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
me by thinking my beauty needed that defence, than obliged me
by assuming it. This reproof, which my distemper made me fancy, came
from the Oracle of my Fate, had so powerfull an operation, that I cry'd
out; Yes Madam, I acknowledge your reprehension to be as just as my
presumption is great, and I am now so sensible of my Crime, that if you
do not speedily pardon it, I will revenge you upon the miserable <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi>
'tis but letting these wounds weep blood until their source be dry;
so Death more pitiful than you, will make my punishment the way unto
my quiet. These words spake in a high tone, made <hi>Symander</hi> almost as
frantick as my distempers had me; for being ignorant of the cause, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the height of my Fever made me rave, and fearing lest I should
put my words in practice, he ran to the Bed's side, and flinging open the
Curtains, besought me in tears, not to make my self the means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
a danger, which of it self was but too desparate: This action of
his put me out of that deep melancholly my Love and disorder had led
me into; and turning from him with a great sigh, I reply'd, Alas, <hi>Syman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
thou wouldst indeed think my condition desparate, if I assur'd thee
my wounds were the least torment that I suffer. Sir, said the faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96335:9"/>
if I thought so, let your torment be never so high, mine would be
equal to it. I will then conceal it from thee, I reply'd, for I love thee
too well to load thee with an unncessary grief, the weight whereof is
such, that I should think it a crime to wish it on my greatest Enemy. Ah!
Sir (he answered) give not my a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ction for you so ill return as to make
it render me uncapable of serving you: It may be, when I know the
cause of your grief, I may find out a remedy, my riper years may know
what yours have not attained unto, and if the sacrificing of so poor a
thing as my life can any way contribute to your quiet, I shall think it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
bestowed. His discretion and fidelity, made me disclose my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
having first confin'd him to an inviolable secresie, by all those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
which might positively do it. As soon as I had acquainted
him with this secret, I perceiv'd a visible alteration in his countenance,
as if the knowledge of this disease gave him an assurance of the cure;
and that his words might do what his looks had, he immediately told me:
if your recovery, Sir, of the wound you received from <hi>Ambixules</hi> were
as certain as of that Love has given you, my joy would be then as great,
as now my apprehension is: for I am confident your virtue and merit, will
obtain her affection, or your judgement, and resentment will prove
your cure. Dost thou think, said I, may Passion has already so dethron'd
my reason, as to credit what without any thou assurest me of? but allow
I were blest with perfections as great as thou canst fancy, yet compar'd
with hers, they would onely serve but as their foile, and consequently,
the more her perfections are disclos'd, the more it would bring an acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to my now cause of adoring them, were that capable of any: other
Lovers may hope by a resemblance in merit, to create one in Love, but
the object of mine is so peculiar in her Prerogative, that what others
drive from Sympathy, I must from Mercy: and to expect my Judgement
should recover me, were the same as to expect what gives the wound
should cure it too; since judgement acts in me, what fancy doth in others,
and finds more reason for my slavery than I can find to decline it: to
hope too for liberty by resentment, were a folly onely fit for her pity:
the Mariner that is going to be shipwrackt, may as justly hope by quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the winds to free himself, as I, by electing the same course,
may expect a resembling event: Alas her eyes are my destiny, and 'tis
not my will, but they that govern me; yet were I at my own dispose,
I would not alter my condition; for the contemplation of her Beauty,
though she prove cruel, is more Transcendent felicity than others derive
from fruition; so that thy advice must not be how to fly, but how to
conquer. To which he answer'd, Is there then no Mean to be expected
in your Fortune? None (said I) you take a way which looks as if you
shun'd your end; for can you think, while you contribute to your
sickness you advance your Love? No, but the contrary, for this disorder
not onely deprives you of your good Meen, but of time to Court the fair
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> in, and if you have Rivals (as sure such Beauty cannot but create
you some) what happy opportunity do you present them? Besides, if
you are so negligent of your health, the want of that will make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of what you need not apprehend on any other score. Ah! <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>
(I cry'd out) thou speakest of a felicity fitter for my desires than
expectation; but why dost thou flatter my hopes with joyes that will
ever be notional, and dost like Dreams, which making me believe any
airy happiness, please me for a moment, but when I wake again, I pay
with all real torments an imaginary Heaven, Truly Sir (reply'd <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96335:9"/>
I have always esteem'd despair as great a Crime as presumption,
and must therefore beg you, as <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> perfections keep you from
being guilty of the last of these, so let your own secure you from the first.
After he had spoken this, he was silent a while, and then he thus proceeded:
I have, Sir, always observed, that interessed parties, whatever the business is,
are the unfittest to conclude, especially in the affairs of Love, where Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
has so much dominion; and therefore, if a third person were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whose secresie and judgement were equally unquestionable, I think
it would much contribute to your design, especially if it were one of
the same Sex, and therefore (Sir) your sister the Princess <hi>Lindadory,</hi> if
she could be engag'd, 'twould turn my hopes of your success into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
the opportunities she may obtain may be denied to you, and she
may suddenly procure from <hi>Parthenissa</hi> a Declaration, which nothing but
sufferings and time can obtain by you. This advice I so well approved of
that I commanded him immediately to put it in practice, and though he
perswaded me by many motives to defer it till the morning, yet my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
was more prevalent with him, than his reasons were with me.
As soon as he had brought <hi>Lindadory</hi> to me, and that she was set on the
Bed-side, I took her by the hand, and having prest it between mine, I
look'd upon her stedfastly, and with a deep sigh, askt her, Do you love
me sister? Is the poor <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s life of any concernment to you? to
which she answer'd, If I thought Brother you askt this question as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, my trouble would be as great as my affection: Dear sister (I
reply'd) this proceeds not from my doubt, but to hear my joy repeated,
for the state I am now in is so sad, that I am forc'd to summon all my
felicities, to keep me from despair; the cause of it is, that I am in Love,
and the object of mine is <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who to see, and not to have a Passion
for, were as high a miracle as is her Beauty; and though she prove cruel,
yet her hatred could not be a torment greater than my folly, should I for
that decline adoring her. Thus you see clearly your <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s condition,
and now do not so much wrong it, as to think I make it worse than it
is, for if I could, it would not be so great a torment. I will not so much
abuse your patience (said <hi>Artabanes</hi> to <hi>Callimachus</hi>) as to relate every
particular circumstance of this Story; it shall suffice I tell you, <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dory,</hi>
who lov'd me perfectly, and knew my disposition so, did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that which was my desire, especially being grounded, as she confest,
on so much reason and justice; and therefore we then resolv'd, that she
should be my Agent and Confident, and that the next day she should
visit <hi>Parthenissa</hi> (as sometimes she us'd to do) and carry a Letter to her,
which I then writ, but with much difficulty, both in respect of the pain
my wounds gave me, and procuring <hi>Lindadorys</hi> and <hi>Simanders</hi> permission,
who were apprehensive, that sitting up (though in my bed) would prove
prejudicial to me, but having vow'd to them not to do it, would prove
much more so, I had the liberty to write these words:</p>

                  <p>The success which my sister assured me of, whether to create my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or to acquaint me with hers, made me after her departure take some
rest, though mine was often interrupted through different dreams; but
no sooner the day appear'd, which I did so long for, than I did as much
so, that it had been ended. I could never imagine till then, that impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
was so great a deluder, for mine forc'd me to think it the longest
day that ever I had seen, though it were but the first of the spring: but
the occasion which made it seem so tedious, was, that, at night
<hi>Lindadory</hi> had promised to bring my definitive Sentence. At last the so
much desired hour arrived, and immediately after, my sister, who was
no soner come into my Chamber, than I endeavoured to learn in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
her success: But <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who could not contribute to his health,
by seeing the condition of mine, came then to give me a visit, whose
company before was ever as pleasing, as at that instant it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
Love having so much of meanness in it, as to make us prefer our
own interest before our friends. But lest that impatience I was then in,
should yet seem to transport me, I must tell you something of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Sillaces,</hi> who has been so great an Actor in the ensuing Story. He
is Prince of <hi>Tabienv,</hi> and of an Extraction as famous for Antiquity as
Virtue: If Fortune had been as prodigal to him as Nature, he had long
since been possessor of <hi>Lindadory,</hi> and enjoyed a perfect happiness: But
his chiefest Riches consisting in that which the Old think to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Ornament, though it be in effect the Essential part of Men; and
my Father who esteemed a virtuous person without Riches fitter for his
Acquaintance than Alliance, deny'd <hi>Sillaces</hi> my Sister. His Passion for
<hi>Lindadory</hi> was till then unknown to me, and that which gave me the
first suspition of it, was, the alteration I perceiv'd in both their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
that night, when he so unhappily came in to disturb us: I believe
he easily found by our silence, that his company was not so pleasing as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96335:10"/>
it us'd to be, which he since told me he attributed to some light I had
discover'd of his Passion, not that he fear'd he would oppose it, but that
I was offended to learn it of any but himself. As soon as he had taken
up this opinion, he concluded himself fit company for nothing but his
thoughts, and therefore, immediately withdrew to entertain them, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me at liberty to do the same with <hi>Lindadory:</hi> To whom I abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said with all the impatiencies of Love, Fear, and Hope, Dear Sister,
What must your <hi>Artabanes</hi> expect? Have you receiv'd any return, which
may build my hope on Justice? If you have not, I should be as cruel to my
self as <hi>Parthenissa</hi> is to me, if I endeavoured to preserve a life she is so
intent to destroy: But if you bring me comforts, you will raise joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a height it never until now attain'd unto. Brother, she reply'd, I
find my waiting on <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> that her reserv'dness is proportionate to
all her other perfections, and consequently the procuring so much as I have
done, assures me, if all your Felicity consists in the obtaining her Favour,
you are not far from your desires. This I speak to stay your longing,
for now I must tell you, I never (till your interest ingag'd me) so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
obser'vd your Mistris; but in this short while I have discover'd
so many fresh Graces in her, and those shine so clearly, that not onely I
do extoll your choice, but wish my Sex were chang'd, that I might be
your Rival: For the Beauty of her Mind equals, if not transcends that
of her Body, and what my compliance yesterday approv'd in you, this
day my Reason does. Dear Sister (said I, interrupting her) though I am
ravisht with this description of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> how imperfect soever it be, yet
I must deprive my self awhile of the lesser happiness, and beg to learn the
greater, which is to know, if for this pleasing joy you put me in, I am
not more indebted to your kindness than hers? This you must tell me
truly, for you cannot long deceive me; and if once I find you do, by all
that's holy, I'll take so severe a revenge upon my self, you cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
you were the cause of it; for deprivation of hope is the highest
misery but deprivation of possession: Therefore, Dear <hi>Lindadory,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you by your affections, tell me really what interest I have in the
Felicity before you tell me what the Felicity is; for I have none; the
knowledge how great the Blessing is, will but proportionately increase
the Torment of being deny'd it; and if I have any, you are too cruel
thus long to keep me in suspence. My indiscretion (said he) would equal
your impatience, should I praise a happiness you so justly ambition, if
I knew you should ne'r possess it; but since you enjoyn me so powerfully
to tell you what I have done, you shall first learn, I have acquainted
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> that you love her, but with a Passion as far above all others,
as the Beauty is which creates it: and to confirm her in that belief, I
presented her with your Letter, which she made some scruples to receive,
but my importunities supprest them; that at last she read it; and then
told me, I have so little title both to the perfections, and the power
your Brother ascribes unto me; that I receive them rather for Civilities
than Truths. Oh gods! (I cry'd out, interrupting her) can she be ignorant
of that which is so visible? Or can so high a virtue be capable of as
high a dissimulation? Brother (said <hi>Lindadory</hi>) your impatience makes
you practice in your self what you but now condemn in me. Can you blame
(I reply'd) so necessary an interruption? Shall Modesty be esteem'd a
greater virtue than Justice? Or are they inconsistant together? But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you proceed, and grant me now your pardon, for which, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
my self not a second time to need it. I had no small trouble (said
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96335:11"/>
                     <hi>Lindadory</hi>) to make her confess she believ'd your affection was such as you
describ'd it, but the labor was far more difficult to procure from her any
thing to you, that might give you that assurance. But (she continu'd)
to obey your injunction, I will not give you all the particulars by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
knowing, that to relate the means, is onely pleasing but as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
to the end; which is, that I have brought you a Letter from <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa.</hi> Ah Sister! (said I, starting up) How many obligations have you
contracted in this one? then calling for a Lamp, after having a thousand
times kist, and idolatriz'd the fair Character, I read these ensuing words:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>PARTHENISSA to the Prince
ARTABANES.</head>
                        <p>IF by a loss of the greatest part of your Blood, you have discover'd that
which was an offence, you have discover'd too that which is partly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
since what acquainted me with the fault, acquainted me with the
punishment of it; and if I have now any resentments, they will sooner be
satisfied by your preserving than by your shedding that which is left.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>Alas, (said I, having ended reading) I may with much greater Justice
say of this Letter, that it has more of Civility than Affection, then she
of mine, that it had more Civility than Truth. Then letting my self fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my bed again, I continued; Unfortunate <hi>Artabanes,</hi> thou art yet as
miserable as ever; for here is not a enough kindness to make thee live,
nor cruelty to make thee dye. I now perceive there may be cruelty in
not being cruel enough; that a little kindness may be a great cruely, and
that suspension may be so order'd, that it may prove as great a misery as
deprivation. If your complaint were just (said <hi>Lindadory</hi>) I should be so
far from condemning, that I should participate with you in it. Take
heed <hi>Artabanes,</hi> lest you offend the gods; and that by not valuing this
high favour, you thereby provoke them to recall it. If every day you
make an equall progress to this, believe me, the wound of your mind
will be sooner cur'd than that of your body: Remember, if she were
as soon obtain'd as askt, that might in the future trouble you as much,
as the fear of the contrary does at present: Since 'tis in Love as in War,
where the greater the difficulty is in the success, the greater is both the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and Glory of it. If (said I) <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> perfections needed a
foil to set them off, there might be some reason in what you think has
so much. But in the possession of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> all joyes are included,
and not one without it, so that nothing but the end here can be term'd Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
I must confess, that in meaner Affections so much Nourishment as
this would preserve Hope from Death, but where the cause of the Love,
and the Love it self is so infinite, if all things else be not resembling, my
sufferings must: The wanting of never so little less then what will of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
suffice, is as bad as if all were wanting; as well in then Food of the
Mind as of the Body; therefore to be kind, and not kind enough, does
too deservedly lose that name and operation: You must not therefore mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
my condition at the same rate with other Lovers, but proportionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Beauty I adore, and then you will conclude as right as now you
do the contrary. All the Arguments <hi>Lindadory</hi> could use, were not of
sufficient force to moderate my despair; me-thought <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> Letter
had so much of indifferency in it, that I could not have too much of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96335:11"/>
for it; and that which prov'd no small accession to mine, was my
sisters confession, how difficult it was to obtain so little, which too I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
rather from her importunity than <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> favour. These, and

                     </gap>belief, that it were to be cruel to my self, not to die of those wounds which
were such, that they made the way to Death far easier than to recovery,
and consequently it had been a weakness equal to the punishment would
have attended it, if when the means to end all miseries was easie, and the
way to begin miseries was as difficult as to persevere in them, I should have
declin'd the first to embrace the last; in which resolve my Body so well
seconded my Mind, that my Fever so increast all that night, as the next
day, when my sister came to visit me, I was so near losing my life, it had
almost cost her her own, for she fell into divers fits of swounding, and the
last was of so long a duration, that <hi>Symander,</hi> who stood by, imagin'd she
had led me the way to death; but when she was recover'd from her seeming
one, she begg'd me with a throng of sighs and tears, not to cast my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
out of an imagination I was miserable, when really I was otherwise,
which if I would give her a little time to evince, I should be assur'd it from
<hi>Parthenissa.</hi> Ah! sister (I reply'd) if you could perform what you say, my
recovery would be as certain and speedy as my death will be without it,
Dear Brother (said <hi>Lindadory</hi>) give me but one days respite, and if I do not
satisfie my engagement, inflict on me what punishment you please, and I
will willingly endure it. All the penance (I reply'd) which I will impose on
you, if you prevail not, is, That you will give me leave to die, for then you
cannot more oppose my doing so, then my condition will require it. While
we were in this discourse, one of my sisters servants came and acquainted
her, that <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was come to give her a visit: <hi>Lindadory</hi> turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, told me softly, receive this as an earnest from the gods of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
blessing, who have doubtless sent her hither purposely to contract the
time of your suspension: Immediately after she went to her Chamber,
where <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was, who perceiving by my sisters eyes, as well as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
that some grief sat upon her heart, she told her, Madam, the place
from whence you now came, and the effect of some great sorrow, which is
too visible in your face, makes me apprehend something of danger in your
brother. Would it might please the gods (reply'd <hi>Lindadory</hi>) that you
would as soon apply the remedy to my grief, as you have found out the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of it, which if you will be but resembling to your power, you may
perform as easily as desire; for my brothers danger is the cause of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
you seem somewhat concerned in, for though those wounds <hi>Ambixules</hi>
gave him are very dangerous, yet those you have given him are much more
so, and creates his and my greatest apprehension: Therefore, Madam, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the ruinous estate he's in without the felicity of your Favour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this as a certain truth, that unless you assure him of it now, it will
be too late to do it hereafter: Give I beseech you to my prayers and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
what I am confident you would hereafter to his services, if he could
live to pay you them, and then gratitude will act in him what hope would.
<hi>Lidadory's</hi> reason, and the sad extremity I was in, furnish'd her with so
many arguments, both to move <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> judgment and pity, that at last,
with much difficulty, she acknowledg'd never to have had a higher esteem
for any than for me, and her inclinations wereof such a quality, that by
my services and fidelity, I might in time procure no unfruitful return of
them. This declaration was as pleasing to <hi>Lindadory</hi> as my recovery;
for indeed it was in effect the same thing; she begg'd her therefore to give
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96335:12"/>
me a visit, and assure me of what she had then said. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> would
have left that employment to <hi>Lindadory,</hi> but she excus'd herself, by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would be too good news to be credited from any but herself; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
further, that she might perform a visit of that high concernment, with
so much secrecy, that none could ever discover it, there being a back-stairs,
which went out of her Chamber into mine, where no company then was
(least it might interrupt my rest) and I am the more pressing in it (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<hi>Lindadory</hi>) not onely as it will be the efficient cause of his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but that seeing him in the forlorn condition he is in, you may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hereafter quarrel with your modesty for condescending to that now,
which if any longer delay'd, would prove ineffectual. Then without so
much as seeming to suspect a refusal, she took her by the hand, and having
led her into my Chamber, she opened the Courtain and told me, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I here present you with the rarest Physitian in all <hi>Asia,</hi> whose skill
I believe your very sight will convince you of. I could not fancy that
this rare Physitian was <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and knowing all others disability in my
sickness, I did not so much as turn my eyes that way, but being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
offended, that she who knew so well the nature of my disease,
should be so mistaken in the means of my cure, I reply'd, Sister I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that <hi>Parthenissa</hi> has rejected your Prayers, and that you have as a
last Essay, brought this Physitian to practice on me as on a lost Patient;
but 'tis in vain; I that feel the power of her Beauty will never so much
wrong the effects of it, as to believe any can cure my wounds but she
that made them: let me therefore desire you to implore this last favor from
her, that before I die, she would look upon the miserable <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and
give me leave once again to see that Beauty the cruel (but fair) cause of
my Martyrdome, which I have so much reason to hate, and yet have more
not to do it; that she may hear how zealous I'll pray for the preservation
of my murderer, and that she may live in joyes as great as she has the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to confer on me. These sad words had a powerfull influence on <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadory,</hi>
who fancying it a sin to jest so cruelly, begg'd me to turn about
with such earnestness, that at last I did: but great gods! How was I
surpriz'd? My amazment was such, that joy had lik'd to have perform'd
what grief but begun. <hi>Lindadory's</hi> raillery, and this surprize was of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much use to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who was so confus'd when she consider'd the
action she had undertaken; that though the time of her silence was long,
yet (as she told me often since) she was as long before she was able to
speak to me; but perceiving I was at least in an equal perplexity, that
did somewhat assure her; and then approaching to my Beds-side, she told me,
I am come to know (<hi>Artabanes</hi>) whether the power you said I had
over you was a Civility or a Truth? but I too visibly perceive it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the first, or else your recovery before now had assur'd me the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Ah! Madam (said I) reproach me not the crime you your self
make me commit; for 'twas not your commands alone could make me live,
but something added to them, which I thought fitter and easier for you
to imagine than I to name; but your not taking notice of it; alass, did
to too much, and being depriv'd of my hopes, I resolv'd under an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of cruelty, to be merciful unto my self, and by yielding to one death,
to free my self from a thousand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither, Madam, can I think you
will be offended at that Election, since by disobeying you once, I render
my self for ever uncapable of doing so again, but by my obedince, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your cruelty must have been as great as your Beauty, or my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
would have far more troubl'd you, then this one breach of your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96335:12"/>
commands. I perceive (reply'd <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) that you counterfeit an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
onely to extort a knowledge, which is fitter for my blushes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you than my words; but to evidence how great a power the Princess
<hi>Lindadory</hi> has over me, I do not only command you to live, but shall
judge of your passion by your obedience, and reward it so too. Alas,
Madam (I reply'd) must I then derive my Felicity from a third person?
and must the Means lessen the End? To which <hi>Parthenissa</hi> presently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
Your scruples are much greater than their cause, which intirely
to remove, I conjure you endeavour Recovery, which effected, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
I shall soon give that to your Merit, which I now say, I do to your
Sisters Commands. If (I reply'd) I must expect that Blessing by that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
onely, from this moment I renounce all hope of it, and therefore if
you are not resolv'd of your self to confer it on me, I beseech you let me
dye, otherwise you may be cruel, in thinking not to be so. Madam (said
<hi>Lindadora</hi>) I beg you to receive these importunate effects, as coming from
a noble Cause, a Love so perfect, that nothing but a retribution, which
is so, can confer on it any quiet; and since you have thus far proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
let not Words divert you, when the Action does not, but by assuring
him you will be favourable, preserve a life which I dare justify, is wholly
yours, and as wholly depends upon what you shall now speak. I know
not (reply'd <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> pulling down her Veil to conceal her Blushes)
what to say, but if what I have already spoken, do not satisfy, what you
are pleas'd to undertake, I will confirm. Divine <hi>Parthenissa</hi> (said I, print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my burning Lips upon her Hand) I desire no more, and may Torments
equal to your Hate (if such could be found out) fall on me, if ever passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was so pure as mine, or shall prove so constant. After a thousand as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
of my Joy and Fidelity, we heard <hi>Moneses</hi> knock at the door,
which occasion'd <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and <hi>Lindadory</hi> to retire softly the same way
they came; for we thought it not fit he should then know any thing of our
affairs. As soon as they were gone, he came in, and having enquired of
my health (which he found to be somewhat better'd) he went away again.
In brief, my speedy recovery being enjoyn'd me, as an evincement of the
greatness of my Flame, I was so willing to embrace any thing might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it, that in a short time my wounds were fully heal'd, and then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day I gave the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> so many new confirmations of my Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that at last she assur'd me of hers. I can truly affirm, never two Hearts
were more perfectly united, than ours. And if at any time so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
made my Desires rebel against my Reason, she immediately supprest
them with Reason; which was not onely an argument of the vastness of
her wit, but of the proportionate power she had over me. But why do
I name the Felicities we possest in those glorious days, when they were
so short, that the time that I have been telling you of them, seems to me
to be longer than they themselves were; and when they do but serve to
add unto miseries, which are but too great already, and are any other
way uncapable of accession. Fortune, which has been always ingenious
to persecute me, no sooner acquainted me with the blessing of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa's</hi>
Conversation then she sever'd me from it: For there happened a
difference betwixt <hi>Arsaces</hi> and <hi>Artabazus</hi> the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bounds of their Kingdoms; and as it is ordinary amongst Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
which are above the Laws, to have immediate recourse to their
Swords, and make them both plead, and determine their dispute; so did
they, and by it engag'd all the Gallantry of both their Kingdoms.
I was ambitious to do something that might give me an interest in <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96335:13"/>
by my Actions, and therefore resolved to undertake the Voyage;
I waited on her, to acquaint her with my design, and found her alone
in her Cabinet (as she confest to me afterwards) preparing Arguments
to divert me from that War, which she apprehended my Honor would
engage me in; but I interrupted her thoughts by telling her, Madam, the
joy of your Affection makes these Wars (the way to Glory) trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
for Love delights in none but what it self creates. Truly <hi>Artabanes</hi>
(she said) you can shew me no greater, nor pleasanter effects of your
Flame, than in observing what you now speak, since in this one action we
give and receive assurances of each others passion; for I have sufficient
proofs of yours, when your Honour cannot vanquish your Love, and
when you care not to satisfy the World, so I be pleas'd: And you of
mine, when the highest condition, (that of your Glory) cannot be of
sufficient force to make your absence tollerable. Alas, Madam (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
how miserable am I then? that must plead your Commands, and
make use of Arguments, which if they prevail, banish me from my Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and if they do not, make me unworthy of it: But since inevitably
I must fall into one of these misfortunes, I had rather embrace the first,
which though it make me perfectly wretched, yet 'twill extenuate your
choice unto the World, by evincing that the Man you elected to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
with your Affection, valued not the hazarding of his life to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it; and since, to the further manifestation of that Truth, he dare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself to the miseries of absence, who can suspect he will decline
any other proof of it? I now perceive (said she) <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that you
onely hitherto pretended a perfect Love; for one that is so, confines it
self to the Object loved, and makes the satisfying of it, it's onely end:
Alas, had I stood upon these Niceties, and not more consider'd you than
the World, you had never taken my Heart by Assault, but by Siege. To
which I reply'd: 'Tis not onely, Madam, to please the World, but to
establish my Felicity in the Future: for this War will every day create
new occasions for my Rivals to purchase Glory, and knowing your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to be equal to your other Perfections; I would not by my idleness
provoke yours so much to make me miserable; But then, it may be you
will answer, your inclination leads you to honour me with your esteem,
more than any other; but I beseech you, Madam, consider how weak
a Title that will appear, when manifested Vertue shall come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with it? No, fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> give me leave to act upon this Stage,
where I will do such things, that if Merit could claim an interest in you,
you should be mine by right, and I will no longer own the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
you have of me to your Goodness, but your Justice. Cruel <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes</hi>
(said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) have all the Vows of Love wrought so little on
your belief, as to think it possible, I can be any man's but yours? And
that which you even now stil'd Justice in me, would be inconstancy and
perjury: besides, these high things which you propound unto your self,
cannot be attain'd without resembling dangers, and should you miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in them (as the events of War are blind and uncertain) how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
would my condition be? when the universal knowledge of your
Virtue, will so drown all men in Grief, that those which should afford me
any Consolation, will need it themselves: and every Man will be a fresh
Object to renew my Sorrow: Besides, what you would so hazardously
court and sollicite, is of so speculative and airy a quality, that neither the
simplest, nor the wisest Soldier in the Army, would now exchange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
with the famous <hi>Alexander,</hi> the great ingrosser of it. That,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96335:13"/>
Madam, I reply'd, would rather evin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e a want of Virtue in the Living,
than the Dead: so perhaps, many Women now would not change con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with the excellent <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and yet that does not prove but
hers is more to be ambition'd. To contract my Relation, I made use of
so many arguments, that at last she resign'd the Field, but I perceiv'd it
was with much reluctancy, for she said, How just a cause have I to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that either my affection is not less, which might render your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
supportable, or that being so great, I cannot have proportionate
Arguments to divert your Design. But believe me, though my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be convinc'd, it is fit for you to undertake; yet my Love will never
be so. Ah Madam (said I) how kind, and how cruel are those words,
for your Love transcending your Judgement, how vast an evincement is
that of its being so; and on the other side, how cruel is the purchase of
that Felicity, by rendring your Love (the greatest of my blessings) now
the greatest of my troubles. After I had done speaking, she lean'd her
Cheek upon her Hand, and having thought a while, she lookt on me sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly,
with Tears running from her fair Eyes, and told me with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
voice, <hi>Artabanes,</hi> since you are resolv'd to go, I conjure you by
your Passion, remember that we have exchang'd our Hearts, and that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> as you say, more than your self, evince it, by having
more care of her Heart, than if it were your own. And since you will allow
nothing to surpass your Affection; yet at least allow mine to be equal to
it, and then consider those Torments my death would be to you, and be
not too prodigal of that life, which if lost, must involve me in resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
ones. These Words and Tears were so moving, that I held it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Duty, than a Weakness, to accompany her in the latter, which
she perceiving, began to ask me forgiveness, by having made me erre by
her example, and then went to a little Cabinet in her Closet, where she
took out her Picture, which she presented me, and I vow'd to wear, as
long as that other, I could not but carry about me whilst I did my Heart.
If you have ever resented the pleasing Flames of Love, you may
then partly guess how cruel this separation was; otherwise, your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
will be as far short of apprehending, as I am of expressing it. But
this being nothing essential to our story, I will pass it over, by telling
you, that <hi>Pacorus,</hi> eldest Son to the King, was General of the Army,
but my Father had the Superintendency of all: his deep experience giving
him that Honour, with as little Dispute as Envy. The Prince was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
by his Brother <hi>Phraates,</hi> and all other Great Men of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
amongst whom, <hi>Surena</hi> was the chiefest, either for Person, Wit,
Estate, or Power, but of an Humour so uncontroulable, that it clouded
all his other Virtues. These Troops were generally the gallantest, and
best fitted, of any I ever yet beheld; and in my opinion, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions were as far short of them, as they excell'd all others. After the
Army was in a moving posture, <hi>Moneses</hi> led the Body of it, by easy
marches, towards <hi>Miramnes,</hi> a strong Town, which the <hi>Armenians</hi> had
newly besieg'd with 50000 Foot, and 10000 Horse, the King being there
in person. <hi>Pacorus</hi> remain'd at Court ten days after, to receive his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and by that time <hi>Moneses</hi> was within three days march of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the Prince and all his Court overtook him, where a Messenger, from
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>overnor of <hi>Miramnes,</hi> assur'd <hi>Pacorus,</hi> that if in three weeks he had
no relief, it would be too late to send him any. The next morning
therefore he took a view of his whole Army, which consisted of near
near 40000 Foot, and 15000 Horse, but so much of resolution appear'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96335:14"/>
in the Officers and Soldiers looks, that he thought every hour of delay
so much time stolen from the Glory of his Triumph. The consequence of
this place was such, that immediately a Council of War was summon'd,
where after a long Debate, the Result of it was; That the Prince sent a
Herald with a Letter, to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> to invite him on the large,
and adjoyning, Plains of <hi>Arontes,</hi> to decide their difference by a Battel,
which would end the War, and the Miseries that inevitably would be a
consequence of it. <hi>Artabazus</hi> having consulted with the Chief Officers
of his Army, return'd this Answer,</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>ARTABAZVS King of Armenia, to PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORVS,
Prince of the Parthians.</head>
                        <p>The same Consideration which invites you to decide our Quarrel by a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
moves me to accept it, and since the Gods are our Iudges, we need
not fear Partiality, the justest Sword will be the sharpest, and therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
shall be esteemed guilty, by</p>
                        <closer>
                           <signed>ARTABAZVS.</signed>
                        </closer>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>This Answer was no sooner read, but Orders were given to every
Chief Officer, to repair to his Charge, and to exhort the Soldiers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Duties with Courage and Vigilancy. The next day we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped,
and pitched our Tents in the Plains of <hi>Arontes,</hi> the Scene of
the intended Tragedy. As soon as we were quarter'd, we might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Army marching down the Hills of <hi>Fenistia</hi> in exact
Order, and camped so, some forty Furlongs from us. By mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both Armies rested themselves two days, that they might come the
third, unharrast to the Battel. In the mean time, <hi>Moneses</hi> appointed to
every one his Command. The Prince honor'd me with the leading of
2000 Horse, all Voluntiers, and composed of the Youth and Gallantry of
<hi>Parthia,</hi> with whom I resolv'd to act something worthy the high Title of
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Servant. At last, the long desired day appear'd, but so Black
and Cloudy, that it hardly deserv'd that name, as if the Heavens had put
on anticipated Mourning for so many succeeding Funerals. Presently those
vast Plains were cover'd with Armed Troops, and the Generals having
taken all the advantages the ground would permit, gave the Signal of the
Battel: At the first shock, the Field was strew'd with dead Bodies, and
such a show'r of Arrows were shot into the Air, that the God's were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
from seeing or relieving either party. There were a thousand
things perform'd, which did better merit the Sun for Spectator in all his
Glory, than those sad and gloomy Clouds. But the Victory which was a
long time in suspense, at last seem'd to declare it self on the <hi>Armenians</hi> side,
by the valour of a young Gentleman, who with near 3000 Horse, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Death to his Enemies, and Victory to his Friends, wheresoever he
appear'd. So much Gallantry, I thought, was a fit Object for our Swords,
and turning to my friends, I told them so, with this litle addition; Tis too
low to imitate those that have done well: Let us be examples to them,
to do better, for you see the day is lost, unless recover'd by our Valours;
and Victory will now be so precious, it cannot be too dearly courted.
They all unanimously approv'd my resolution, and presently I led them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96335:14"/>
where <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was, (for so was this young Conqueror call'd) who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
our design, and guessing by our Countenance, we were not
Men to be slighted, presently rallied all his Soldiers, who were eagerly
pursuing the <hi>Parthians.</hi> By that time he had drawn them up, I charg'd
him, telling my companions, I would not invite them to that which I would
not be a sharer in: I was so well seconded by those which follow'd me,
that after a generous resistance, we broke those victorious Troops, and
had the execution of them, as long as they had had it of ours, and I was
so far engag'd in the pursuit of this Rout, that at last I perceiv'd the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-Royal,
which was guarded by at least 8000 select Men, which was
to me rather an invitation to attempt it, than the contrary, but least ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
might have been of a different principle, I told my Troop-Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
'tis true, their number surpasses ours, but you have just now learn'd,
that Victory is won by Virtue, not by Multitudes; you have done things
which will not be believ'd, but by some such powerful Witness: for to our
own Glory (but to our Countreys shame) we are not onely the Actors,
but almost the onely Spectators, and as your Valours have no limits,
let your success be resembling. By one general Acclamation, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
they would follow me to Death or Victory; I gave them no time
to cool, but by a successful Charge, I made a breach for them to enter;
they lost not the occasion, but with Vigor and Resolution improv'd it.
As we had almost effected our design, the same <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who had done
such noble Actions in the beginning of the Battel, and was beaten by his
Mens Fears, not his own, (for they had carried him away in the Throng)
rallied again some of his resolutest Troops, and was come with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the King; which he did with so great fury, that my Men lost all the
Glory of their former Actions, by an ignominious flight. I could not
believe it at the first, but seeing it was in earnest, I cryed out; 'Tis your
Swords, not your Feet must save you, which you may effect by almost
your desiring it, for the Enemy are not oblig'd to their Valours for this
disorder, but your Fears: If you doubt this Truth, do but turn your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and their Flight will assure you it. But when I perceiv'd they were
as deaf to me, as to their Honors, I told some which were running by me:
Is it thus then that you perform your engagement of following me to
Death or Victory? I will never live to see your shame, nor to participate
with you in it: Assure the Prince and my Father, I will sell my life so
handsomely, that it shall neither disgrace my Countrey nor my Bloud.
Having so said, I thrust my self into the midst of the Enemy, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to dye, and invoking the fair Name of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> my Rage
made me do things, which my Courage onely, could not have perform'd
for I made a Lane through the thickest Troops, and my blows were so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
directed, that wheresoever they did light once, they needed not to
do so a second time. Many of those which fled, hearing my last words,
turn'd about to know what I would do, but when they saw my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the unexpected success which attended it, many who were gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
found my designe so much so, that they returned to share in it, and
others who perceiv'd that those which thought to preserve their Lives,
did lose them, and that he which indeavour'd to lose his, did preserve it,
the same cause which made them decline the Fight, made them return
to it. I must confess, I was as much surpriz'd, as pleas'd, when I found
my self so well followed; I imputed it to the invocation of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi>
and was assur'd, that the same power which hath occasioned the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
change, which was, to make those that fled, to fight again; would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96335:15"/>
also perform the lesser, which was, to make those that return'd to fight,
overcome an enemy they had so lately worsted. Whilst this heat lasted,
we engag'd our selves so far, that Fear produced the effects of Courage,
there being no safety but in Victory, so that I had much ado to credit
my Eyes, the last testimony of my companions valour, having quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
the former of their want of it: At last I perceived one, who by the
care they all shew'd, of his preservation, I resolv'd was the King, which
made me cry out, There, fellow Soldiers, there is that which will make the
conclusion of the day more Glorious than the Progress, and will both fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
our dangers, and reward them too. They were so sensible of what
I said, that their valours gave an undeniable proof of their being so;
and the greedy desires I had to merit the Title of <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> Servant,
made me address my designs onely at the King: concluding, all consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the taking of him; and though Nature had deny'd me a Crown,
yet by my Courage, to present one to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> I knew would be
more pleasing to her generous disposition, which much more esteemed
the effects of Virtue, than those of Fortune, or Birth: To be short, after
I had received some Wounds, which were rather marks of Honour, than
Danger, and after Revolutions and Confusions, which were deriv'd from
the mingling amongst us, of another King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> at least, one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
like the first, in his Armour and Furniture, as well as by the Horse
he rid on, and disresembling him in nothing, but what more pregnantly
confirm'd me, he was the real <hi>Artabazus,</hi> since the highest Valour was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for the highest Title; I dismounted this second Commer, whereby
the first found and made opportunity of escaping, which the last no sooner
observed, than he told me, Generous Enemy, though my Body is at your
Mercy, my Liberty is not, this Sword, more kind than Fortune, will soon
ease me of all the miseries this day hath involv'd me in, unless you will
grant me one condition, which if you do not, I will deprive you of all
those advantages you do pretend unto by my Captivity; It is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prince, I may not be disarm'd, nor yield my self a prisoner to any
but your Prince. I thought it unjust, to destroy a Valour as high as the
Title of him that possest it, and when my Enemy was too much in my
power to remember he had been my Enemy, and yet I esteem'd it reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that those who had been my companions in Action, should be the
like in Advice. I found all their opinions proportionate to my own, which
I inform'd him of, in such submissive terms, that he assur'd us, Fate had
in some sort repaired his Misfortunes, that being destin'd by his, to be a
prisoner, he had fallen into hands, which knew the respects due unto his
quality. 'Twas observable, that in the taking of this prisoner, it seem'd
we had taken the Hopes of all his Party, at least depriv'd them of any,
but by flight, which they so universally began, and continued, that they
gave us more trouble to kill, than to break them. At the end of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
I found <hi>Pacorus</hi> with a joy in his Countenance, as great as his
success, he immediately ran to me, and after a thousand imbraces assur'd
me, that the King owed his Crown, and he himself his Life and Honour to
me; and that the Obligations were such, that it would be a Crime as great,
to hope the requiting of them, as the misfortune of the incapacity of
doing it: many other expressions of his Favour, he honour'd me with,
which I have now as absolutely forgotten, as I was then unworthy of
them. But I remember, I besought him to place those high Civilities, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon my Companions than Me, as being an act of greater Justice,
and consequently more proportionate to his Inclination: But Sir (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96335:15"/>
the gods have not onely favour'd your Arms, by an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of your Enemies, but by furnishing us with the Power of Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you with the most considerable of them, as well for Title as Vertue.
I then presented him with our Prisoner, at which, though his Joy were
very great, yet it was very short of my amazement suddenly after, when
the imagin'd King pulling off his Helmet, discover'd a Face so full of
Beauty and Courage, equally mingled, that it produc'd in all of us, the
same effect it had in me, and a silence too as general; which he begg'd a
continuance of, and which the Prince having enjoyn'd, he address'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto him in these terms. Sir, there is not one of the <hi>Armenians</hi> this
day but I, that hath not just occasion to complain against Fortune, since
in so publick a calamity, she has yet furnisht me with means to serve my
King, for I am not what I feign'd I was, but by seeming to be a King, I
preserv'd one. I know this Declaration doth surprize and incense ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but the action is too glorious to be conceal'd: I serv'd <hi>Artabazus</hi> in
the beginning of the Battel, by force, but when <hi>Artabanes</hi> Sword prov'd
too powerful to be resisted (for those were his very words) I then by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
endeavour'd to perform, that which was deny'd me by the other. My
Joy had been more perfect, had my first design succeeded, but yet I am
not devested of all, since the last did: the end being still the same, though
the way be not: Some for this (Sir) might beg your pardon, but I will not,
for that were to confess a fault, where there is none, neither will I so much
as expect my Life at your hands; since that were to act with the hope of
something besides serving my King, which was that I onely ambition'd.
No, generous <hi>Pacorus,</hi> consider that I deprived you of a King to grace
your Triumph, and put in practice what the consideration of that loss
inspires you with, so you will oblige your self, by sacrificing to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
one that has so highly injur'd you, and yet as highly glories
therein, and you will oblige me, by making me a Martyr to my Duty
and my Honour. The apprehension I had, lest this Confident (though
generous) Speech of <hi>Artavasdes</hi> (for that was his name) might invite
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> to confer on him his desires, made me tell him, Sir, I do not find
that you have occasion to be offended at this change; for 'tis not the
Name of King, that can make us ever apprehend a contrary success to
that the gods have given you this day, but Virtue and Gallantry, and we
have found so much of both, in this Gentleman, that I believe the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi>
have suffer'd a greater loss, than if we had taken their King; for
his Perfections transcend that Title, and 'tis more worthy of your Arms
to take the gallantest, than the greatest of your Enemies: And, Sir, to
evince, I do not speak this, to raise the value of the Present, my Friends
and I have offer'd you, I humbly beg <hi>Artavasdes</hi> Life, which we shall
not only receive as a reward above the services we do this day pay you,
but above all we can ever; for besides the preserving of so generous an
example for all Men to imitate, 'twould be an ill president, to see a
Prince punish a Subject for being faithful to his King. <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who
truly was generous, told me; If any thing could make me offended with
<hi>Artabanes,</hi> 'twould be this unnecessary interceding; for the services you
have render'd me, will drown under the name of Gratitude to you, that
good usage my inclination leads me to confer on the generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi>
but I here publiquely profess, that the Life I give him, proceeds from a
true sence of his Virtues, which I do not onely value, but admire, and
if I may obtain his friendship, I shall esteem it a happier purchase, than
that of his Person, or that of his Kings. Then addressing himself to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96335:16"/>
                     <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> he told him; If I were absolute Master of my Actions, I
would from this instant restore to you that liberty you have so merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
lost, but being accomptable to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> I shall beseech you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me to him, whether I shall suddenly go, and I am so confident
to obtain your freedom, that I dare almost assure you it: Besides, this
small time may procure me the happiness of your acquaintance, which I
so much value, that if I do obtain it, I shall justly believe 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
advantage I derive from this days success. To this high civility, <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
reply'd; Sir, never till now was I perfectly vanquished, the fortune
of War could give you but power over my Body, my Mind being free,
retrench'd you from the noblest part of your Victory; now 'tis entire,
and you have made me as enamour'd of Life, as I was of Death, since by
enjoying the former, I hope to find an occasion to evince my Gratitude
to him which gave it me. Many civilities past between them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
between <hi>Artavasdes</hi> and me, whose friendship, though I have ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
with an infinite concern, yet, as he afterwards assur'd me, it could
not transcend that, with which he desir'd mine. At the conclusion of
these civilities, <hi>Moneses</hi> came towards us, the care he had of the Army,
and of some wounds he receiv'd in the Fight, hindring him from being
a Witness of their beginning. But the Prince seeing him coming, went
to meet him, and told him so many handsome things of me, that I could
not have been more pleas'd to have deserv'd, than I was asham'd to hear
them. The next day the Funerals of the Dead were celebrated, and
in one general Fire, the <hi>Parthian,</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Bodies were reduced
to ashes. The season being very ill to prosecute the War, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
we had lost, rendring us unable to do it, <hi>Pacorus</hi> resolv'd to return
to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> whither he commanded me to attend him, that the people
(as he said) might see their Deliverer. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> also waited on him.
When we came within twenty furlongs of that great City, <hi>Arsaces,</hi> and
all the Court came to meet the Prince, and congratulate his success. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
would needs present me to the King, and expressed so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to me, in the relation of that late Battel, that my blushes will not
permit me to repeat it, not the civility <hi>Arsaces</hi> honor'd me with. But all
these favours were as so many obstacles, to hinder me from waiting on the
fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> which after a thousand importunate Ceremonies, I did.
Who can express the vast Felicity this favourable interview did bless me
with? the many commendations coming from that fair Mouth; those
Raptures of Joy for my safe return, or those Holy Vows of Constancy.
but why do I dwell so long upon this Subject? since it was but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,
and serv'd but as a Prologue to those Miseries, which are as endless
as they are great. <hi>Artabanes</hi> would have continued his Relation, but
that <hi>Callimachus</hi> being acquainted by his Servants, that Supper was ready,
besought him to defer it till the day following, which <hi>Artabanes</hi> obeyed,
and having only taken as much nourishment as would suffice Nature, he
retir'd into those magnificent Lodgings, <hi>Callimachus</hi> had prepared for him,
where he past the Night, as he was accustomed to do, which was, in the
contemplation of his sad condition, that furnisht him always with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Arguments, for the impossibilities of its alteration, that it made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
to appear Reason.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE morning was hardly old enough to permit a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
with civility, when the impatient <hi>Callimachus</hi> went
to <hi>Artabanes</hi> Chamber, to beg a continuance of that
Story, whose beginning had so satisfied him; But
<hi>Simander</hi> assur'd him, that his Prince was gone an
hour before into the Grove of <hi>Cypresse,</hi> to entertain
his melancholly. <hi>Callimachus</hi> (whose Curiosity was
so great, that it was uncapable of Delay, went presently to find him out,
which, after a diligent search he did, in one of the most retir'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
corners of it, and in a posture better expressing Sadness, than Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
could; his Back was lean'd against a withered Tree, his Eyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
towards Heaven, his Arms folded one within the other, and so
many Tears running down his Cheeks, that if moisture could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
that dead Trunk, it had needed no other Rain for its recovery.
And that his words might express what his gestures did, <hi>Callimachus</hi> heard
him cry out. Ye Gods! must I never be acquainted with your Power?
but onely through those Miseries you cast upon me by it? alas! Why
do ye furnish me with so much Frailty, and yet provoke me so much to
despair: or Why do our Priests teach us there is a Providenc; when
you are so careful by your Actions, to evince the contrary? then hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down his Head, he continu'd in a perfect silence, till he himself
drew it by a second Deluge of despair, which drowning both his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and Reason, necessitated him to expostulate thus, with whom
it was a Crime to do it. But what sins have I committed, to deserve
so deep a suffering? yet, allow my Guilt had been too great for your
Mercy, your Justice might have inflicted a punishment on my person,
which might have equal'd my offences; for you are no gods, if you are
not infinite in all your Attributes; but being so, why did the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>
suffer for my fault? or else was it a more sensible way of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
me, to do it through Her? If this were your Design, O gods!
I have more reason in exclaiming against you, than you had for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on me, that which provokes me to it; and to it; and to afflict the
innocent to torment the Guilty, does rather argue Malice than Justice.</p>
               <p>This impious reasoning frighted the good <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who fearing
lest it should continue, discover'd himself, and by a sharp and eloquent
Reprehension, disclos'd his anger, and the justice of it. To which <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
reply'd, That if he were acquainted with his Miseries, he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
what he had then utter'd, to his sufferings, and not to his irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Alas, <hi>Artabanes</hi> (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) how does your Passion blind you?
For you do not consider, that Sin is as odious to the Deities, as insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96335:17"/>
from Humanity; that 'tis an unexpressible Mercy, they do not inolve us
in all those Miseries, their Power and Justice is capable of: and whilst
there is any Curse not yet inflicted on us, we have more reason to esteem
them unjust for their Clemency, than for the contrary. 'Twas with such
Truths as these, that at last <hi>Callymachus</hi> disperst those Clouds of Dispair,
which so darkened our unfortunate Lovers Piety, and then conjur'd him
to finish that Relation he had the day before begun. To which <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
reply'd: I entertain'd you the last night with the beginning of my
own story, but now I must in order to it, acquaint you with that of my
Friends; the generous <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who was taken Prisoner, (as you heard)
in the Battel of <hi>Arontes,</hi> and whose Gallantry had receiv'd a Punishment
almost as great as it merited the contrary, had not I had the happiness to
prevent it.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> with the Reliques of his broken Army, retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into his own Kingdom, attempted a small Town of the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
call'd <hi>Offala,</hi> imagining by the taking of so little, to disguise a loss which
had been so great. The Garrison being inconsiderable, as well for their
Numbers as Resolutions, at first summons condescended to a Treaty, and
then to a Surrender; but had four and twenty hours given them for the
packing up their Baggage, during which, the <hi>Armenians</hi> had free
access at their pleasure, which proved fatal to the <hi>Parthians;</hi> for <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>'s
Soldiers, whether to revenge their Companions deaths at the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Battel, or out of some dispute which happen'd betwixt those of the
Army and the Garrison (as the <hi>Armenians</hi> gave it out) put all that were
in <hi>Offala,</hi> as well Citizens as Soldiers, most barbarously to the Sword;
which news, as soon as it came to <hi>Arsaces</hi> knowledge, so infinitely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him, that he vow'd, the generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi> Bloud should expiate
his Kings Crimes, and be a sacrifice to the <hi>Manes</hi> of his murder'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And though <hi>Pacorus</hi> represented how unjust a Revenge this was,
being a violation of that quarter of his life, which he had too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
hazarded, to lose it in a way, which was so much the contrary,
yet the King vowed by his Fathers Ashes (an oath that he never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
but afterwards he was unalterable) that <hi>Artavasdes</hi> should dye.
I was present when this sad determination was taken up, and finding
how unlike my perswasions were to deserve that name, I resolv'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
my Friends Ruine, and hinder my Prince from acting it, in a way
too as unfitting for him, as the punishment was unworthy the Person for
whom it was intended. To effect this, I went instantly to look <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
out, for (though a Prisoner) without any engagement, he had what
liberty he desir'd. After a diligent search, I found him in a Wilderness of
one of the Palace Gardens, where having acquainted him with what had
happen'd, and was resolv'd, I begg'd him to retire a private way that led to
my Lodgings, where he might remain secure, till his escape were believ'd so
certain that it self might contribute to it: But his generosity was so great
(knowing the danger to be so, in which I should fall, were he discover'd) that
his care of me had like to have render'd mine fruitless for him, for it was so
long before I could prevail with him, to accept of his safety by a hazard of
mine, that the Kings Guards were already abroad for his Committal,
and had not the way been very private to my Chamber, we had (doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tless)
been discover'd before we had reach'd it: but we came at last safe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where I commanded <hi>Symander</hi> to wait on him, and permit no other of
my Servants that Honor, nor to know of his being there; From thence I went
to learn what course was taken for his discovery, and how failing in it, was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96335:17"/>
relisht; I was soon acquainted, that all the gates of <hi>Ninive</hi> were shut,
and that one <hi>Rysolis,</hi> a friend of mine, was that night with some of the
Guard to follow <hi>Artavasdes</hi> (in case he were not found out before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture)
and that his believed escape had so much exasperated the King,
that he gave strict order none should pass the gates without his own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
till <hi>Rysolis</hi>'s return; who, by chance, I found, as he was preparing
himself for his Journey, and by his expressions quickly observ'd how much
the Office displeas'd him; His affection to virtue and to me, made me dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to him where <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was concealed, and conjur'd him to let
him pass as one of his Troop, and thereby render what was intended for
his ruine, the means of preventing it. This request found a ready re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
for he was as joyfull to serve me, as unwilling to obey his King in
so unjust a command: Then having promis'd me, that within two or three
hours he would call at my Lodgings; and undertake my desires; we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
our selves, he to prepare himself, and I to acquaint <hi>Artavasdes,</hi>
with his civility, who embrac'd it with moderation, and then told me, If I
thought it would not be too great a trouble to you, I would employ the
time I have left, in telling you the particulars of a life you are so earnest
to preserve. To which I reply'd, That it was a favour I should have
passionately begg'd of him, had not the apprehension of being thought too
curious, been more prevalent with me than my own satisfaction, but since
he was pleas'd to make that Overture, which nothing else had hinder'd
me from making, I would listen to his adventures, with an intention
which would speak how highly I was concern'd in them. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
told me I could not be concern'd in any thing that was more mine than
himself, began this ensuing Story.</p>

                  <p>IF ever Love had an absolute Empire over any heart, and was at the
same time admitted with a Joy that was so, it is over mine, but then I
speak as great a truth when I assure you that this extraordinary effect
had a proportionate cause, and that the Beauty, which prints her Image
in me, does it with a stamp as pleasing as indelible; and to know this the
more perfectly, you must first understand that my Father, whose name
was <hi>Annexander,</hi> is a Prince that possesses the highest power in all <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and derives his Pedigree from Ancestors whose Antiquity and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
have made them equally Famous; and though they never had the
glittering trouble of a Crown (which succession and not virtue common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casts on Men) yet they never wanted one of Lawrel; it seems too,
that the Fates destin'd our Family to furnish a General to the <hi>Armenians,</hi>
for in nine descents successively, one of it had always that Honour, and
possest virtues, of so peculiar a quality, that with truth I may say they
have been as glorious in their actions, as our Kings in their Titles. My
Father, who was nothing degenerated from his Predcessors, is so entirely
Master of all those realities and ornaments which render a Gentleman
worthy that name; that <hi>Artabazus,</hi> our present King, as a reward of his
services (which were the placing of his Father and him in the Throne
of <hi>Armenia</hi>) gave his Aunt the fair <hi>Lindesia</hi> to him for his Wife, from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96335:18"/>
which Marriage I had the honor to proceed. But before I do so in my
discourse, I must take a little digression to give you a Character of those
persons I shall be necessitated to mention in it. Our King had another
Aunt married unto <hi>Celindus,</hi> who was a Prince enrich'd with many good
qualities; but his natural ambition (which receiv'd so great an accession
from this alliance) made him employ them in such Criminal Designs, that
they prov'd more destructive to his particular, and to his friends, than if
they had been vices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artabazus</hi> has but one sister, much about the age of his own legitimate
son, the Prince of <hi>Tigranes</hi> (which is a name as much affected to the
Royal Blood of <hi>Armenia,</hi> as <hi>Arsaces</hi> is by that of <hi>Parthia</hi>) these two
have abundantly evinc'd that the Body is the molde of the Soul, for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>'s
shape is so horrid, that nothing can transcend it but his conditions,
and truly the first is onely tollerable but because it manifests what the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is. But the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> has all the gifts of nature in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessional
a degree, that nothing can excel the perfectness of her Body
but that of her Mind, whose morning, though adorned with all that so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a youth was capable of, gave but an imperfect earnest of what her
noon did produce. I must confess I was not so much master of mine own
affections, as not to burn at so pleasing a fire, but resented a pain, which
till then I never was acquainted with, for she had so equal a proportion
of Divinity and Beauty, that my Flame participated so equally of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and adoration, that neither could suppress the other. Oh! gods,
could I but tell you <hi>Artabanes</hi> what she is, I should have your excuse
for what I did, which was, that I resign'd my liberty with more joy than
any other could have recover'd his. But yet my Flame was as invisible
as great, for I concluded, the Beauty being extraordinary, the way ought
to be so, in which I disclos'd that I adored her. After an admiration and
silence of a year, according to the common Computation, but an age
according to mine, (such torments are there in a concealed Fire) my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who (admiring the high virtue of the <hi>Romans,</hi> always held a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
correspondency with them, partly out of a sence of their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
as also to make use of their Power and Justice in case <hi>Celindus</hi>
should rebel, who wanted not the will but the opportunity to do it) to
acquire himself more intimately their Friendship, and to instruct me in
the Civil and Military Discipline, sent me to <hi>Rome,</hi> whither I willingly
went, hoping that success in Glory, might be the way to success in Love.
After I had observ'd the most beneficial things there, I came to the Army
of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who was by the Senates orders making then a bloody War
against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> in which expedition, I gave some such proofs of my
courage, that he offer'd me any command which a stranger might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto. I declin'd this great Civility, by alledging, that my unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
as well as years, made me fitter to obey than command, that my
chiefest desire was to have the honor to be near his person, and that any
Office which should deprive me of that end, would be rather a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than a preferment: Not to trouble you with too many particulars,
though I would not take upon me any charge, yet I so fully satisfied <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi>
with my refusal, that he never declin'd, nay, rather augmented
his affection for me, and sent Letters in my favour to the Senate: but
that I was more justly proud of than all this, was a perfect friendship I
then contracted with the generous <hi>Ventidius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Patritian, who was,
even to wonder, blest with all the graces of Nature and Education. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time my Father, to make the <hi>Romans</hi> place a higher value on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96335:18"/>
me sent Two hundred young Gentlemen, of the chiefest Families in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
to serve under me, which the <hi>Roman</hi> General much approv'd, and
with whom I dare without vanity say, I did so many services, that he
(though of an extraordinary ambitious nature) was yet so just as often
to attribute much of the Glory of his success to our Valours. I will not
tell you the events of that War whilst I was in it, since the miseries of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> and the fame of <hi>Lucullus</hi> are yet so recent. <hi>Anexander,</hi> who
began to suspect that <hi>Artabazus,</hi> who absolutely declin'd <hi>Mithridates,</hi> in the
beginning, would now assist him, the <hi>Roman</hi> success rendring him jealous
of it, commanded me to return into my own Countrey, after two years
absence; which Summons I obey'd, and went home with Letters to my
King and my Father, more fill'd with <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s praises than truth.
All those young Gentlemen which had escaped the fury and uncertainty of
War; return'd with me. The desire we had to see our Friends; and I
particularly to behold the fair object of my Passion, which was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
by absence (for Love has that property, that as long as it hath
an existence; it will have a growth) made us so to hasten, that in fifteen
dayes we arriv'd upon the confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and having a desire not
to give any warning of our arrival, that we might the more agreeably
suprize all those who were concern'd in it, we marched with our Helmets
on, and with as little rest as the necessity of our Travel would permit.
The sixth day after our coming into <hi>Armenia,</hi> just as the Sun began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the World, we might perceive from the top of the Hill we then
were on, the City of <hi>Artaxata.</hi> The sight of that place, the then Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Altezeera,</hi> so transported me with joy, that in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of being so near her, I discontinu'd travelling, and having stopt my
Horse, offer'd some vows to the god of Love, that he would inspire the
Excellency I ador'd with a true knowledge of the greatness of my
Flame, and incline her to recompence it, but onely according to the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and true virtue of it. Observe, I beseech you in this accident, how
the gods favor the innocent, and by how strange means they work out
their deliverance. That little Rapture I was fallen into, had caus'd all
the company to stand, as I told you, it was in the place from whence we
might see <hi>Artaxata,</hi> and those in it, and in the adjacent Plain betwixt the
City and the Hill, might discover us. By that time I was beginning to
descend the Hill, we descry'd a Horseman that came out of a Wood some
thirty Furlongs from the Town, galloping towards us, and I, by chance,
being a good way before my Company, he no sooner came within call,
than he commanded me to tell <hi>Palisdes</hi> from <hi>Celindus,</hi> that the King and
<hi>Altezeera</hi> were but newly come out, that we should return to our station,
and not appear till <hi>Tuntini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> were engag'd. This unexspected Message
much amaz'd me, yet as soon as I heard those names, I began to suspect
some treachery; for my Fathers frequent Letters, when I was in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Camp, he acquainted me, that he had too-well grounded jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s ill inclinations to usurp the Crown; and therefore, turning
about, I commanded my Company to do the like, and as soon as we were
out of the sight of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> I left <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Souldier in charge with
one of mine, commanding him not to discover himself or us, and to have
a care of what was committed to his. Then I went and order'd my
faithfullest Servant <hi>Philanax</hi> to light off his Horse, to hide himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
some Trees on the top of the Hill, and never to have his eye
off the Plain, but as soon as he should see any fighting, immediately
to give me warning of it. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96335:19"/>
heights, whom I commanded to give me advertisement of what they
should discover. Having thus disposed of things, I return'd to my
Troop, assembled the chiefest of it, and acquainted them with the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
I had, that <hi>Celindus</hi> intended some treachery to the King and <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera,</hi> how that many things concurr'd to change that suspition into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
as that of the Soldiers taking us for a Troop that were to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
something by <hi>Celindus</hi>'s orders, that apparently the design was upon
<hi>Artabazus</hi> and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> by his saying they were but just then come out;
that his naming <hi>Tuminius,</hi> and taking us for <hi>Palisdes</hi>'s Troop, argued
there were many in the enterprize; in a word, all those circumstances
concurring, they were confirm'd in my belief; and after a small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
we resolv'd (the time being so short) to make <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
confess the whole Conspiracy, either by fair means, or by torment:
In order to which we went and told him, we were not <hi>Palisdes</hi>'s Troop,
but strangers coming from the Wars, and returning to our Countrey,
that we had heard much of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Gallantry, that we concluded his
design was virtuous, and that if it were communicated to us, we might
do him service. The Souldier who had a quick apprehension, finding
all was lost, unless by some subtilty he remedy'd it, answered us, I guess
the design is noble by the undertakers of it, but my quality is so low,
that I onely act in obedience of my Officers commands, and not being
able to inform you of the enterprize, I shall advise you to send with me
some of your Party to <hi>Celindus,</hi> who is not above twenty furlongs
hence, and I make no doubt, if Virtue and Reward will engage you in
his attempts, you shall want neither. We quickly found by his way
of speaking, that his condition was not so mean as he would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded us, and therefore, concluding he had some design by so plausable a
pretence, to free himself out of our hands; and that no fair wayes would
prevail, pulling off my Helmet, I made my self known unto him, and
drawing out a Ponniard which I wore constantly, I vow'd by all those
Oaths which men have most reason not to violate, That if he disclos'd
not the whole design, I would instantly kill him, but if he would, I'd not
onely engage my self for his pardon, but to give him as high Rewards
for his turning honest, as he could pretend unto, if his wickedness had
its wisht success. I added to those threatnings and promises all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
my judgement could furnish me to lay upon the deformity of his
hopes. The certainty of so sudden a Death, and the horror of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
made him by many sighs acquaint us with his repentance, and that
he desir'd no greater reward, than to have been kept from doing ill. He
then informed me, that his name was <hi>Evaxes,</hi> that he was one of the
chiefest in this Conspiracy, and that all those who were engag'd in it,
put on Common Soldiers habits, that in case the design succeeded not,
they might remain undiscover'd: That he had been drawn in by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindus</hi>'s
charming Eloquence, who having had some vent of <hi>Annexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
suspition of him, had with-drawn himself into the Province of
<hi>Saccasene,</hi> where he was Prince and Governor, as well by interest
as Commission or Birth: That <hi>Celindus</hi> was resolv'd to kill the King, and
to marry <hi>Altezeera</hi> to <hi>Tuminius</hi>'s eldest son: That the Prince <hi>Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
was privy to the Plot, but would not appear openly, till he saw
what success it had, but that <hi>Celindus</hi> had onely engag'd him in it,
to make his party the stronger, and for an invitation thereunto he
was promis'd to be continu'd in the Throne after <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s Death,
he having in return, engag'd himself to give the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96335:19"/>
                     <hi>Tuminius,</hi> which should be no sooner effected, than <hi>Celindus</hi> was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make away <hi>Tigranes</hi> too, and thereby settle the Crown upon his
own Posterity; the Laws of the <hi>Armenians</hi> not excluding the Female
Sex: That to effect this, he had sent divers Troops out of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to lie in the places adjacent, and that they might not be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
the Troopers came in by two and three in a company, disguis'd
in the habits of Peasants, and carried their Arms so privately, that it
was impossible to discover them; that having learn'd by his intelligencers
the King and <hi>Altezeera</hi> were to hunt that day, he had sent <hi>Tuminius</hi>
with Two hundred Horse, which lay in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Grove, who was to kill
the King, and those that followed him; and to carry <hi>Altezeera</hi> to the
ruines of an old Chappel, where, in a small bottom, <hi>Celindus,</hi> and some
Three hundred Horse lay, to secure his retreat to <hi>Artemita,</hi> which is the
first Town in his Government, and but an hundred furlongs from hence:
That <hi>Palisdes (Celindus</hi>'s other son) was appointed with 500 Horse more
to continue upon the Hill we then were on, least <hi>Annexander</hi> (who to
prevent any ill accidents had drawn 5000 Horse into <hi>Artaxata</hi>) should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the King and the Princess before they came to <hi>Artemita,</hi> where there
was a considerable body of Foot, and the rest of the Army (with which
he design'd to reduce all Forces or Places that should oppose him) were
quartered not above 20 furlongs off. This Relation (my dear <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) gave me as much Horror as Amazement; and
while I was enquiring what might be the cause that <hi>Palisdes</hi> was not
come, one of my Scouts came galloping and told me, he discover'd a
body of about 500 Horse, not eight furlongs off, that came on a round
trot, almost the same way we had marched. This Troop we easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
was <hi>Palisdes,</hi> whom I resolv'd to Charge, but first of all, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
away an Express to my Father, to acquaint him with what I had
learn'd, and to conjure him to send out as many Horse as possibly he
could spare, under some good Commander, but not lead them himself,
lest the Town might be betray'd in his absence. <hi>Evaxes</hi> assur'd me
thereupon, that <hi>Artaxata</hi> would be lost if he were once out of the Walls,
for <hi>Celindus</hi> had many Partisans there, that waited onely such an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to betray it. This being done, I began to order my Troop, which
consisted of 150, but of so clear Valours and Resolutions, that those vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
supply'd the defects of their numbers. But <hi>Evaxes,</hi> who perceiv'd
my design, begg'd me not to put all to the hazard, having so few Men,
and having to deal with those whose Resolutions were as great as their
Crimes, that he had thought upon a stratagem, which might effect my
design, without the hazarding it, which was, that he would go acquaint
<hi>Palisdes</hi> that <hi>Celindus</hi> had sent him purposely to assure him, that <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi>
and <hi>Altezeera</hi> were upon some intelligence return'd, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he should immediately dispose those Five hundred Horse into their
several quarters; with orders to be in the same place the next morning,
if they receiv'd no fresh ones to the contrary: That he, with the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of his friends, should go into the little Valley near the ruines of that
old Chappel, where they would consult what was most expedient to
be done, upon the intelligence they had and could learn. This, said
<hi>Evaxes,</hi> you need not be diffident will have a wisht success, for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisdes</hi>
knowing the power I have with <hi>Celindus,</hi> will obey any Orders
I shall bring him in his name. But he continu'd, You may suspect I
will betray you, and lay this design for the obtaining of my liberty,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96335:20"/>
which I would have you believe is for the securing of the Kings: I must
confess my former undertaking has been such, that all the civil Man
is capable of, may be believed in me, with some appearance of justice:
But I invoke the gods to be my witness, and beg them to be my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
if my heart and my words are not the same: But I will not desire
that obligation of you as to credit me, send a couple of these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
along, one at my right hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other on my left and if I fail
in my engagement, let them pierce me with their Javelins, and let that
be my reward. This discourse of <hi>Evaxes</hi> had something of probability
in it, and knowing it was but fighting, (which I determin'd to do)
in case he should betray me; I resolv'd rather to trust absolutely to
him, (which if he had any principle of virtue) would bind him then to
evidence it, than by sending two Gentlemen with him expose them to
an unavoidable loss, as likewise by trusting of him but in part, invite
him thereby to be false in the whole. Having made this my election,
I told him, Go <hi>Evaxes,</hi> and by so handsom an action efface the guilt of
your precedent Crimes, you shall be accompanied with nothing but
your goodness, which I know will be a confinement to you to do well,
than if all our Swords were at your Brest to punish you, should you do
otherwise. To which <hi>Evaxes</hi> reply'd, that if he had been still in the
darkness of his former Principles, so perfect a truth would have lighted
him into the way of virtue. Having so said, he advis'd me to withdraw
my self into a small bottom nigh the high-way, that I might remain undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
till the Enemy were in the Toyle, and I that would send one along
with him to the top of the next Hill, to give me warning when <hi>Palis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
and his friends should advance, and to advertise me if I were betray'd.
These last words he said smiling; and I having told him that I would
send one for the first reason, but not for the last, <hi>Evaxes</hi> gallopt away,
accompany'd with a Gentleman, whom he placed upon a rising
ground, where he might easily discover the effect of his Embassy:
To be brief, <hi>Evaxes</hi> so ordered his affairs with <hi>Palisdes,</hi> that he sent
back his Troops, and came along accompany'd with Twenty of his
Friends, that were the chief of the Conspiracy, who carelesly riding, fell
into our hands, and though surprized, made so gallant a resistance, that ten
of them were kill'd before we could reduce the rest. Those that remain'd
alive (in which number was <hi>Palisdes,</hi> though somewhat wounded) we
resolv'd to present unto the King, that justice not force might be their
Executioner. Having thus happily begun our first enterprize, <hi>Evaxes</hi>
offer'd to endeavor the delivery of <hi>Celindus</hi> into our hands by the
like stratagem, but were interrupted by <hi>Philanax,</hi> who came all out of
breath, and told me, that he saw many Soldiers in the Plain, who fought
so furiously, that it was easie to be imagin'd the gaining the Victory
was very considerable to them, but that the number was unequal, and
that those which were the lesser, seemed to have nothing but their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
to keep them from being vanquished. The great apprehension
I had, least my relief might not come time enough, gave me Wings, so
that though I came not so soon as I desir'd, yet I had this consolation,
that I omitted nothing which was in my power. When I was within
some few paces of the Scene where this bloody Tragedy was acting, I
might perceive a small company of Gentlemen, that had cast themselves
into a Ring, and in the hollow of the circle had placed one who I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
was the King, and defended him with courages fitter to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd than describ'd; but their virtue was yielding to their Enemies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96335:20"/>
Numbers, had not we then come to their rescue, and the sight of so much
barbarousness having inspir'd me and mine, with as much Fury, we fell
upon them with such violence, that we reduced them to that condition,
which their Rebellion deserv'd. <hi>Artabazus</hi> (for it was he) finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so miraculously preserved, came to me (for he found, by the respect
all those of my Troop paid me, that I was their Chief) and told me; that
he must attribute so miraculous a deliverance to the Tutelary gods of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
whose Altars should speak him grateful, and whose Instruments in
his preservation, should find him so, if any thing in his power could do it,
and therefore he desir'd to know those to whom he owed his Life. We
told him, that as soon as all was ended, we should satisfy all his Commands,
and in the mean time we assur'd him, that we had the Honour, to have so
near a dependance on him, that all our actions were so far from merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they were less than our Duties: But Sir (I continued blushing
and trembling) I beseech you, what is become of the Princess? Alas (said
the King) in the beginning of the Fight, I sent her away under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Nearchus,</hi> with twenty Gentlemen more, whom I soon observ'd
were follow'd by near thrice as many of the Rebels: what success <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
and his companions have had, I know not, but I am fearful by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
of their Lives, they have onely thereby assur'd their Fidelity,
and the Conquest of their Enemies. As the King was speaking, there came
towards us one of the Princesses Pages, who seeing the number of the
Dead, imagin'd that it was the Kings party defeated, and tnrning about,
sought his preservation in the swiftness of his Horse; but the Livery being
known, and guessing at the mistake, I follow'd and cry'd out to him, that we
were the Kings Servants, and desir'd to know where the Princess was; but his
fear made him suspect every one that had but a Sword in his Hand, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we had not overtaken him, had not his too much haste been the
cause of it; for his Horse being run off his Legs, fell so heavily, that I had
leisure to come up to him, and having inquir'd where the Princess was, I
could get no other answer from him, but Quarter, Quarter; and indeed,
he was so really possest, that I was one of <hi>Tuminius</hi>'s his party, that nothing
I could say for a long time, could make him believe the contrary; but at
last, some of the Kings Servants being come, he perceiv'd his Error, and
then told us; That <hi>Nearchus,</hi> with those twenty Gentlemen he had
taken with him, were, when he came away for relief, generously dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Princess's safety, in so advantageous a place, that none could come
behind, and but five a-breast before; but that most of them were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
wounded, and if they had not a sudden relief, they would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any. I commanded the Page to shew me immeditely where
they were, and having gotten some twenty of my friends with me, I left
the rest to guard the King, and flew with them to the place where the
Princess was. Gods! what fury was I possest with, when I saw the poor
<hi>Nearchus,</hi> with four more, disputing <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s safety, I fell upon them
with all the rage her danger could inspire me with, and cry'd out, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
brave <hi>Nearchus,</hi> the gods, who are concern'd in <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and your Valour, have sent them both this Relief. My generous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who were equally animated with me, did actions, almost wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the cause they fought for, and <hi>Nearchus</hi> finding so unexpected a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor,
gave proofs of an exceeding high courage; but we found <hi>Tuminius</hi>
his numbers, might, in time; have made our success doubtful, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the influence a Commander has over his Men, I called out to him:
Tis I <hi>Tuminius,</hi> that am come to take from thee <hi>Altezeera,</hi> if thy valour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96335:21"/>
fly as high as thy desires, thou shouldst by killing the Ravisher of them,
manifest to that fair Princess, thou hast a resolution able to overcome all
obstacles that dare oppose it. <hi>Tuminius,</hi> who wanted not courage, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
me: If there needs but the killing of thee, to assure her that
Truth, she shall not long doubt it; and would to the gods, I could as
easily vanquish her disdain, as all my other Enemies: He had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
done speaking, than he made himself a lane through the Throng, and
having separated my self from my companions, commanded them to let us
alone, till Death or Victory decided the quarrel. <hi>Tuminius</hi> having order'd
his Men the like, we began to fight, but with so much earnestness, as if
the Conqueror had expected <hi>Altezeera</hi> for his reward; I must confess, I
was so asham'd that one guilty Man, in the presence of my Princess, and
for her safety too, should dispute so long the Victory, that I prest him so
vigorously, and so unfortunately for him, that my Sword at last having
found the defect of his Armour, pierc'd him through and through, at which
thrust he fell, and with that stream which issu'd from his wound, he breath'd
out his life. All my friends made a great shout at my success, and fell so
briskly on <hi>Tuminius</hi> Soldiers, that by their fury, and by the loss of their
Commander, we had a Victory so cheap, that it hardly deserved that name.
The Field being wholly ours, I lighted off my Horse, and with an infinite
Humility, went to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and told her; Madam, The gods of whom
you are so perfect a Copy, have sent me hither, to serve you against your
Enemies, and have given you an entire Victory, lest their Justice or Power
by your loss, or want of revenge, might have been call'd in question. I
must confess, said she, the actions I have seen you do for my deliverance,
assure me, 'tis more than a humane Power which has effected it, but the
gods, whose delight is to relieve the innocent, made me not despair of
their help, though the means (till your arrival) was unseen: But, Sir,
shall I desire you to add two favours unto this I have already receiv'd?
that I may know to whom I owe the preservation of my life, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
my Honour, and that if there be any hopes of rescuing my Brother,
you would imploy your Sword in so just a quarrel, Madam (I reply'd)
my Name has been so little beholding to my Actions, that by them it is
not considerable, but for the King, I have already had the happiness to
serve him, and if I be not mistaken,, that Troop which you see marching
this way, attends him by my Orders. How? (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) does <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi>
as well as I, owe his safety to your Sword? sure then your Name
cannot be so unconsiderable, as you would make me believe it is, or if it
has been, it is so no longer; but I am consident you will not discover it,
to hinder us from being ungrateful, which unavoidably we must be, if once
we learn to whom we are Indebted. Madam (I reply'd) to take you out
of that Error, I will acquaint you who I am, that you may know, I have
onely hazarded a Life in your service, which I am resolv'd to spend in the
same employment: then pulling off my Helmet, she no sooner saw my
Face, but she cry'd out, 'tis <hi>Artavasdes!</hi> and there wanted nothing to
make my Joy as perfect as my Safety, but to owe the latter to his Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Just as I was going to reply, the King (who had learn'd by some of
my Troop, who I was (and by one of those who escaped <hi>Tuminius</hi> sword,
what I had done,) came running to me, and having embraced me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times, told me, I see <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that Virtue is born with us, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into us by Education, otherwise you could not be possessor of so
great a quantity, in so tender an age. Sir (said I) your goodness being
too great, makes you place a resembling value upon my services<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96335:21"/>
should be guilty of an equal presumption, if I did not attribute your
expressions to any thing sooner than your Justice, But, Sir, let not the
joy of your safety hinder us from receiving the benefit of it, nor me
from bringing this Gentleman to kiss your hands, who has washt away
his criminal intentions by his gallant performance. Thereupon I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<hi>Evaxes</hi> to the King, who acquainted him with all <hi>Celindus</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>'s
designes, and that we had taken <hi>Palisdes,</hi> who being shew'd to the
King, discover'd as much guilt in his Face, as he had in his Heart. <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>
commanded he should be safely kept, and ratified all I had promis'd
to <hi>Evaxes;</hi> then learning that <hi>Celindus</hi> had yet three hundred Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and the Town, we thought it not fit to lose any time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having by <hi>Artabazus</hi> command, and her permission, taken the fair
<hi>Altezeera</hi> behind me, and order'd our Men, we began to retire towards
<hi>Artaxata,</hi> when our Scouts came immediately, and brought us word, that
<hi>Celindus,</hi> with above 400 Horse (for fear multiplies) was marching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards us, and was but six Furlongs off. As soon as I heard it, I
turn'd about to the Princess, and told her, Madam, I am in a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with my self, than I can have with the Enemy, whether I should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you to the charge of some Gentleman, swiftly Hors'd, and endeavor
to secure your Retreat, or else by dying at your Feet, take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to acquaint you with that, which I shall not have the confidence
to do, whilst I am sure to out-live the discovery. To which she answer'd,
I have so good an opinion of <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that I shall esteem my self as safe
under his Sword, as in <hi>Artaxata,</hi> and I cannot conceive that his Heart is
capable of any thing which his words dare not reveal. Madam (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
I must confess I am guilty of a crime, but the cause of it is so Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that if it were not committed against you, I should not call any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that proceeded from it by such a name. But, Madam, the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and I must put you in some place of safety, that I may by the
hazarding of my life, secure yours; and would to the gods, the loss of
mine could give you as perfect a security, as the ending of it in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
would give me a satisfaction. The King by this time was come so
near us, that I could not receive any answer from my Princess, and askt
me what order I would settle, for the receiving of so bold a Guest; for
he was determin'd to derive his preservation wholly from my Sword. I
answer'd so large a Favor with a resembling humility, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<hi>Nearchus,</hi> to have a care of the Princess, I lighted from my Horse,
took down <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and set her up behind him; then kissing her hand,
I told her softly, Madam, inspire me by your Commands, that I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
things worthy your looking on; and remember, if I dye in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, you lose the faithfullest servant, that ever your perfections
did acquire you: But she was so perplext (whether through apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or any other cause) that she onely answer'd me in Tears, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
coming from her fair Eyes, enflam'd me with as high a Fire, as
ever they shot into any Lovers Heart. <hi>Celindus</hi> by this time was come so
near, that I had only leisure to conjure the King, that he, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
would fly to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> whilst I amus'd the Enemy; and having left
50 Horse for their Guard, I divided those that remained into two Bodies,
as the Enemy had done theirs, and having in few words, told my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
how highly they were oblig'd to their fortunes, that had furnisht
them with an occasion to shew their valours before, for the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the <hi>East,</hi> and the fairest Princess of the World, and how the
Victory, which was the onely way to preserve them, was as certain as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96335:22"/>their cause was just; I began the Charge, and fighting under the conduct
of Justice, Honour, and Love, I soon made a breach for my valiant friends,
who being carried on with a generous desire, routed that Wing we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
and thereby made a passage for <hi>Nearchus,</hi> who lost no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but got by with the King and Princess. But <hi>Stratolis,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the left Wing of our Horse, had not so good success; for though he
disputed the business with sufficient courage, yet he was over-power'd, and
at last worsted, so that in effect, we were but as we begun; for what I had
gain'd, he had lost, onely the King and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> by my good fortune, got
that other of passing by. We instantly rallied again, and determin'd onely by
skirmishing, to make good our Retreat, and not to hazard all at one
Charge, lest if foil'd, the King and the Princess might not recover <hi>Artaxara.</hi>
Our resolutions had such good success, that I held the Enemy in play long
enough for <hi>Nearchus</hi> design, had not the subtile <hi>Celindus</hi> imagin'd that I
would send the King and the Princess away with a small Guard, and with
the rest justify the retreat, which caus'd him to lay a hundred Horse in
Ambush betwixt us and the Town, who falling suddenly upon <hi>Nearchus,</hi>
so terrified his Men, that most of them were cut off, before they put
themselves in a posture of resistance. One of the Run-aways fled to me,
and with a countenance which acquainted me with his fear, told me, all
was lost, if I did not instantly remedy it. I left most part of my Horse
with <hi>Stratolis,</hi> whom I commanded to amuse the Enemy, and with thirty
of my friends, ran to the place where my help was so needful. But alas,
the first thing I saw, was a rude Soldier, who had dismounted <hi>Artabazus,</hi>
and was going to plant his Ponyard in his Breast. This impious action gave
me so just a resentment, that I clove with one stroke the offenders Head
in too, and leaping off my Horse, mounted the King upon him, and
seized on another that ran about the Field without a Master. But gods!
to how unparallell'd a height was my anger rais'd, when the piercing
shreeks of the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> reacht my Ears: For <hi>Nearchus</hi> being kill'd,
one of <hi>Celindus</hi> Officers had seiz'd on her, and was carrying her away.
I profess ingeniously, my dear <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that sight did so transport me,
that I think a Legion could not have hinder'd me from relieving her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or killing the causer of it. So that having made a passage through the
throng, I soon made another through him, and by that thrust, depriv'd
him both of his Life and Hopes. Then taking the overjoy'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, I went to the King, whom we overtook, retreating towards
<hi>Artaxata;</hi> but when we were come within some ten Furlongs of it, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a Body of near Five hundred Horse, coming towards us in a cloud
of Dust, as fast as they could gallop. <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who had generously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
all perils, now began to faint; but I told her, Madam, the god's,
who have hitherto protected you, have therby taught you not to despair,
and I am confident you are so highly cherisht by them, that if nothing but a
Miracle can effect your preservation, yet you shall not be deny'd it, or fall
into your Enemies hands, at least that Fate shall not be yours, whilst I have
a Sword, or Life to oppose it, my duty, and a higher consideration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
it from me: I begg'd her therefore, not to contribute to the danger,
by being astonish'd at it, nor to let go her hold; for I was confident, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for so transcendent a perfection, my courage would proportion my
cause: Having thus said, she embrac'd me with so great a satisfaction for
the transported <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that had it proceeded from Love, as it did
from Fear, I had wanted little of perfect happiness;but though the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
came from a wrong cause, yet I blest the danger, that gave me so high
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96335:22"/>
a contentment: But, alas, her apprehension soon ended, and my joy with
it, for we found it was the young <hi>Amidor</hi> my Brother, who by my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
command, was come out to rescue us, having received that adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
I had sent him. In this general satisfaction, I alone was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplext, having bought the publique security at too dear a rate for
my particular, yet the consideration that by it <hi>Altezeera</hi> was out of
danger, whose contentment I still preferr'd before my own, did soon ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all those sad thoughts, and having sent 200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of those Horse, under my
Brother to help <hi>Stratolis,</hi> with the rest we marched to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> where
<hi>Anexander,</hi> and all the City, receiv'd us with Faces that spoke their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
It were superfluous to tell you what <hi>Artabazus</hi> said to my Father,
and all those with him in my favour, I will therefore onely acquaint you,
that <hi>Altezeera</hi> (whose Beauty was grown to such perfection, that it
made me almost irreligious, by desiring to see no other happiness) having
led me aside, told me, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> I should too much wrong my resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if I coulp hope to describe them. To save me from <hi>Tuminius</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency,
and his Passion, are obligations of so high a Nature, that they
resemble his Virtues, which conferr'd them on me. Madam (I reply'd)
in serving you, I have perform'd my duty, and receiv'd my reward; But
Madam, had <hi>Tuminius</hi> the confidence to make his addresses to you? He
had, (said she) and would have perswaded me, that this enterprize was
onely the effects of his Love, not his Fathers Ambition. Alas Madam
(I answer'd) then he was pardonable, if at least he is so, that cannot avoid
committing of his fault. How? (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) now you know the
cause of his Crime, you seem to approve it. No Madam (I reply'd) but
pitty his inevitable fate; I say inevitable, because experimentally I find
it so. This I spoke in disorder and trembling; but alas, I had immediately
much more cause for both, when I heard her say, Ah <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> I have
been too patient, and by my not suppressing your first inconsiderateness,
have thereby authoriz'd what you have since committed, yet I give this
presumption to your services, but let me have no repetitions of it, least
you force me against my inclination to become your Enemy; she was
going away with that reply, but I conjur'd her before she went, onely to
hear mine, which she said she granted, not to me, but the company, who
otherwise might suspect in her disorder, the cause of it. Madam (said I)
the same consideration hinders me from flinging my self at your feet, and
begging your forgiveness, and though I thought <hi>Tuminius</hi> excusable in da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to adore you, knowing by my self, how impossible it was to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
yet I held him withal, so worthy of revenge, that to be sure he
should not avoid it; I inflicted it on him with my own hands, and before
you see me next, you shall be convinc't, I will not practice what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
and that I can punish aswell as commit a fault. These words I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
with a Countenance and accent as sad as themselves, which the
fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> was so sensibly mov'd with, thet she told me; Though your
Crime be great, yet I desire no other reparation, but that you will not
repeat it: And since you assure me, I have an Empire over you, larger
than I thought; evince that truth, I conjure you, by attempting nothing
against your life. I shall obey you, Madam (I reply'd) but I beseech
you, receive this obedience as the highest demonstration of it that I am
capable of, for my torments are as far from being describ'd, as (I fear)
they are from being cur'd: which I must not expect from Time, but Death,
which is a Truth, if all things fail of evidencing to you, my Death will
not. Though she were going from me, yet I am confident she heard my
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96335:23"/>
last words, (but her disdain, though I had armed my self against it) wrought
so powerfully upon me, that <hi>Annexander</hi> perceiving the disorder I was in,
came to me, and attributing it to a slight wound I had receiv'd in the
Fight, told me, that I should do well to retire to his Lodgings, (which
were in the Palace.) I obey'd his commands, and having took my leave
of the King, I did the like of <hi>Altezeera,</hi> but with a Countenance so
appropriated to my Condition, that she being moved with it, bad me have
a care of my health, which words made a great impression in me, for I
could not believe she was so kind out of a design to crown my Affection
with a reciprocal one, nor so cruel, as to preserve me onely to torment me.
In this suspence I arriv'd with my Father at his Chamber, where <hi>Lindesia</hi>
solemniz'd her joy for my safe return, and after I had paid her that which
my Duty and Inclination exacted from me; I begg'd leave of <hi>Annexander,</hi>
that I might, with some Horse, go see what success my Brother and my
Friends had; as I was receiving his answer, <hi>Amidor, Stratolis, Evaxes</hi> and
the rest, came into the Chamber, and told us, they had defeated all <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindus</hi>'s
Troops, but that he himself had fled, when he saw that releif co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the King. My design being so stopt, after I had receiv'd all my
Friends Civilities, and an Order, next morning, to wait upon the King, to
consult what was to be done for the suppressing of <hi>Celindus;</hi> I retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, under pretence, that a slight hurt requir'd some rest, as
the best remedy; Having thus freed my self from all but my own thoughts,
I went to bed, where thinking to be alone, I found my self most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied:
There the Perfections of the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> did so manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that I was wholly taken up in the contemplation of them; but
when I began to consider, that all those distinct Beauties were as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Enemies, that had design'd my destruction; I could not abstain from
saying, Unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes!</hi> what envious power is it, that has made
thee love so high an Excellence, that it is as great a sin to expect the
obtaining of her by Merit, as a weakness to believe she will be won with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. Dye then, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> and by one resolute action, declare the
greatness of thy respect, and that of thy sufferings which necessitated thee
to such a Cure. But alas, I continu'd, that remedy is deny'd me too, so
that I cannot live but in torment, nor dye, but by disobedience, the
first is consistent with my Nature, and the last with my Duty. Yes, thou
must live, I continued, after a long silence, since <hi>Altezeera</hi> has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and who knows, but thy sufferings may raise her compassion, and
the vastness of thy future Services, convert it unto Love: but suddainly
those pleasing thoughts vanisht, having no other Foundation, but a hope
so ill grounded, that it was as much weakness to expect her affection, as
it had been a happiness to possess it. Whilst I was in this manner enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
my sad thoughts, the day appear'd, and the Sun found me as full
of misery, as it had left me in. But <hi>Annexander</hi> having receiv'd advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that <hi>Celindus</hi> was drawing his Army together, to gain that by a great
force which a small one, and fortune, had deny'd him, came into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to give me advice of it, and to acquaint me, that <hi>Tygranes</hi> was fallen
sick; after <hi>Artabazus</hi> had acquainted him that he knew all his designes,
and severely reprov'd him for them, but that the King suspecting he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
one suffering, the better to escape another, had plac'd such strict
and vigilant Guards about him, that his desire of flying to <hi>Celindus,</hi>
should not be greater, than the impossibility was. I seem'd to be extreamly
affairs asham'd when he came in, to be found so lazy, in a season, when our
nats made it a vice rather than a fault, though indeed I needed Rest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96335:23"/>
more than to have been condemn'd for taking too much. But lest my
Father might discover something by my sadness, I conceal'd it as much as
I could, and by talking of <hi>Tygranes</hi> condition, endeavour'd to take him
off from being too intent in considering mine. As soon as I was ready,
we went to the King, who used me with transcendent favour, and having
assembled the Council, some advis'd considering <hi>Artabazus</hi> weakness, and
<hi>Celindus</hi> power, that it were fit to use him with all civility, to grant him
his desire, and endeavour by protraction to reduce him to his Duty;
others were of opinion, that when Princes capitulate with Rebels, they do
thereby discover their own weakness, and declare that to be Fear, they
would have to be thought Mercy, which is a Virtue that loses its value
when imploy'd on those that dispute with Swords: some said too, that
if it were requisite to grant <hi>Celindus</hi> any Conditions, 'twere fit that it
should be when he implor'd, and not when he attempted to force them:
others believ'd, that to intend to grant them then, was to be resolv'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to do it; since his Army and Faction was so numerous, 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
he would be ever reduc'd to so low a posture, and that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
would be destroyed for a Ceremony of State, by deferring to act
that but a short while, which necessity would enforce us to at last:
but the result of all was, That the chiefest of the Nobility and Gentry
which were with the King, should immediately go into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and with all expedition raise what Forces they could, and bring
them to <hi>Thospia,</hi> a Town of great importance, both for the bigness, strength
and loyalty thereof; That <hi>Celindus</hi> thereby might be either perswaded
or forc'd to his obedience. In pursuance of which, <hi>Anexander</hi> was sent
with all the considerablest Men in the Kingdom, to raise an Army, and
the care of the Town, and the Forces of it, the King committed to my
charge, which imployment I willingly attended, as the means to be
near, and serve the fair <hi>Altezeera. Anexander</hi> being dispatched, and
<hi>Artabazus</hi> having sent me my Commission, I presently repaired those
Fortifications that were defective, made new ones where they were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
sent out parties to fetch in Provisions and Forage, and to destroy
what they could not bring away, slighted all Grounds that were favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for approaches; and in a word, forgot nothing that I thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for a Siege. I found the number I had within, were (Inhabitants
and all) 14000 Foot, and 1400 Horse, which I divided into several
Troops and Companies, and to avoid all Treachery, made them still
draw Lots for their Guards. But in all this noise of War the silent fire
of Love did still possess me, and what with incessant toilings, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of mind, I so fell away, that a slow Fever seized on me, and
doubtless I had yielded to it, had not the care of preserving my Princess
given me Supernatural Forces. This declination was so apparent, that
<hi>Altezeera</hi> was not ignorant of it, and (as she assured me afterwards)
simpathiz'd with me in it, but her Spirit was greater than her inclination,
and consequently my pain than either. But while things were thus in
<hi>Artaxata, Celindus</hi> was not idle, and having got Advertisement, that
<hi>Anexander</hi> was gone to raise an Army; he resolv'd to employ his for the
taking of the Town before <hi>Anexander</hi> was able to relieve it, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of that determination, the tenth day after our Fight, he presented
himself before the Walls of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> with an Army of about 50000 Foot,
and 10000 Horse, well fitted with all things that he wanted, onely a
good quarrel. The order in which they marcht, made them as formidable
as their very numbers, and having drawn up in a Plain, on the <hi>East</hi> side
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96335:24"/>
of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> they advanc'd the two wings of their Army by degrees, and
inviron'd the Town, having cast a Bridge of Boats over the River <hi>Araxis,</hi>
which separates <hi>Artaxata</hi> by the middle, and began by flinging up of Earth
to secure themselves from our Sallies. The King from a high Tower of the
Palace, perceiv'd all the motion of that great Body with a resembling
Fear, which truly was one of <hi>Artabazus</hi> most predominant defects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
he was timerous to such a height, that it made his Subjects bold, but
<hi>Altezeera</hi> (who was then with him, and whose spirit was hardly capable
of apprehension, consider'd those with indignation, which her Brother
lookt upon with terror; in the mean time I had ordered all the Soldiers
to their several Posts, and being not able to indure <hi>Celindus</hi> so near,
without tasting of what composition his Army was made of, I got
a thousand Horse, and as many Foot in Arms, and by a furious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Sally, forc'd the next Guards to a hasty retreat, and in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
thereof, routed some Reserve-Troops, which came to oppose us;
The Camp at this hot Alarm, was presently all in Arms, and sent out
three Bodies of Horse, who added to our success, instead of finishing it,
and some of them that scap'd our Swords, told such miracles of our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
to apologize for the poorness of their own, that <hi>Celindus</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
at the head of 4000 Horse, came to know and redress his condition.
This made me think of retreating, not being so perfectly acquainted with
my Soldiers Valors, as to believe they might not be vanquished without
being killed, and having such good success, I was loath to adventure all
the gallantry of the Garrison at one push, where the advantage, if we
had success, could not be so great, as the prejudice, if we had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
it. Therefore I sounded a Retreat, and as I was making it leisurely,
<hi>Celindus</hi> sent 500 Horse a full gallop to ingage us, which they did; and
thereby too so far ingaged themselves, that not fifty ever got off, but
yet truly they defended themselves so well, and rallied so often, that I
was much troubled such gallant Men shonld be so ill imploy'd: but their
obstinacy in refusing quarter, made us think it a Justice to give them
none. The execution indeed was bloudy, for by those that reckoned
most moderately, in all this fight there were esteemed near 4000 to be
kill'd, and we lost about 300. This was our first Essay, and with this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
we return'd into <hi>Artaxata,</hi> before <hi>Celindus</hi> could come to the place
of revenging those deaths he had been a sad spectator of. Having by a
short speech thanked the Soldiers and Officers, and commended their
Valours, I took one and twenty Colours, which were the marks of our
that days success, and went to the Pallace, to present them to <hi>Artabazus,</hi>
who having seen what we had done (to honor us the more) came with
<hi>Altezeera</hi> to the Gate, where laying them at his Feet, I told him; Sir,
my fellow Soldiers and I, humbly present you these marks of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your quarrel, and beseech you to receive them as Fruits of our
Fidelity, and as an earnest of what we will hereafter pay you. To which
(having first imbrac'd me) he reply'd, Let not your Civility, under the
name of the goodness of my quarrel, rob you of that Glory your Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
deserves; 'tis that which presents me with these effects of it, and
which indeed is so great, that I know not whether I should sooner elect,
to have <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> or Justice on my side, but having both, I am as secure
as the gods can make me. After some civilities, the King retir'd into the
Palace, and the Princess to her Apartment, where observing my deep me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
she told me, smiling, If I knew not perfectly your zeal to my
Brothers service, I might, by your sadness, (after having paid him so signal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96335:24"/>
a one) suspect your Victory was rather your misfortune than design. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
(I reply'd) if it were so, I should rather be guilty of no Crime, at
least, if it be none to imitate you; for what in raillery you say of me, I
fear I may with too too much truth say of you in a Victory, which though
you knew but lately, you have long since acted. The fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>
blusht at what I had spoken, which made me (apprehending her reply)
not give her the leisure of making it, and therefore I hastily continued;
but Madam, if I have cause to be satisfied with my Fortune, I am certain
I have not to be so with my condition, for though the first gave me those
ensignes, yet the last necessitated me, to present them to another when you
stood by, at whose feet I have prostrated them with much more joy, than
I took them; but alas, my condition forces me to performances against my
inclination, which yet would be something extenuated, if as you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of that truth in this particular, you would pardon it in another.
<hi>Altezeera</hi> by not taking notice of what I desired, and feared she would, did
it in my opinion sufficiently, and obligingly: But that I might make no
sinister, or advantageous construction of her silence, she told me; The victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you have so presently obtain'd, could not have been more just, than
you be in so bestowing those signes of it, so that I am more oblig'd to your
intention, than I should have been by your performance, and yet in the first
I discover how concern'd you are to oblige me, since rather than not do it,
you would commit an injustice. Would to the gods, Madam, I hastily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with a deep sigh, you had the same indulgence for me; but, Madam,
I continu'd, will you permit me sometimes to believe you speak what you
do not intend, by being now convinc'd you do so? for you cannot be so
ignorant of your own power, and the duty I owe it, as to imagine I can
owe more, or so much to any other creature. The fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who
apprehended the continuance of this dispute, might prove a continuance
of her trouble, to put a period to it, told me coldly, I see, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi>
you must be victorious in all you undertake, and to be conquer'd by your
civility, is as unavoidable for your Friends, as to be so by your Sword,
is for your Enemies. Ah Madam (I reply'd) if you see me not, what you
say you do, you may when you please, and by permitting me to be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
over your Disdain, you may make me triumph over the Enemy I most
apprehend, and thereby render me as uncapable of losing, as of needing
any other Victory. Whilst I was thus speaking, the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> assum'd
a countenance so full of Severity and Majesty together, that I understood
her answer before she spoke it, though it contain'd these cruel words.
Since <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> you will force me to understand you, unless I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my self as insensible, as I fear (by your thus proceeding) you
believe me, I must tell you with a plainness as great as yours, that the
first time you speak to me of your Passion, it shall be the last, and if you
desire the continuance of my esteem, you must neither sollicite my Love,
nor acquaint me with yours, since if you do, I shall not onely revoke that,
but try if my Brother will be more successful than I have been, in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you the respect you owe, and ought to pay me. She had no sooner
done speaking, then she retir'd into her Closet, in which she lock'd her
self up, and left me in confusions, as great as their cause. O gods! what
did not say or think against my Princess cruelty, since it even propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the vastness of that Passion which was the object of it. I had
longer continu'd in that fatal entertainment, had not some of her Women
come into the Chamber, and lest they might guess at the occasion of my sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by the visibility of it, I forthwith went to my own Apartment, where
I spent the residue of the day, and the succeeding night, in all the Agonies,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96335:25"/>
and Tortures of a great and fruitless Passion. Many days I struggl'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that burthen, to which, doubtless I had yielded, if <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s safety,
and the honour of having it committed to my Sword, had not been the
most predominate. <hi>Celindus</hi> in the mean time assum'd a Resolution of
storming <hi>Artaxata</hi> in the open day, in a confidence, by so braving an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to efface his late affront, knowing that in all Wars, especially Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
ones, the people judge of the progress by the beginning, and that
whoever does lose his reputation, will soon after that, lose his Hopes and
Army. This intelligence was brought me by a faithful and intelligent Spy,
who came from <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Camp, and who had seen the scaling-Ladders, the
Faggots, and the rouling Bridges all fitted. This Advertisement I instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
communicated to <hi>Artabazus</hi> and the Council, who were all astonisht at
<hi>Celindus</hi> resolution, and believ'd he durst not have assum'd it, were he not
favour'd by some of the Garrison; the probability of which opinion
made me have a care of securing all within, as well as opposing those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
The night before this intended assault, not knowing whether I should
out-live it, and to render my death pleasing, or necessary, I went to <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera</hi>'s
Apartment, where having begg'd, and obtain'd the honour of a
private conference with her, after a small silence, and great disorder, I
told her, I should not, Madam, have presum'd to appear again before you,
to discover my repeated Disobedience, had not I faithfully endeavour'd,
to the uttermost, to have avoided it, but having found, that the Passions
your Beauties do inspire, are not to be cur'd but by you, or death, and
that that Truth cannot be a greater one than that is, that you are resolv'd
to decline being my Restorer; I am come, Madam, to conjure you by
your own quiet, and mine, to permit me in this following occasion to seek
out, and embrace a cure, your Justice, or cruelty denies me. Did not I
conclude, that the ending of my life now would be more advantageous
to you, than the continuance of it could prove, during the Siege and
Danger, I would rather groan under my Miseries, than ambition for them
such a period. 'Tis not much, fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> that the miserable <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
implores; for he begs not that you would make him happy, but that
you would permit him to be no longer miserable, which will not onely act
his cure, but your revenge also for having needed it: On which latter he is as
intent as on the former, and desires it as much on your score as his own.
These words deliver'd with a Look and Accent, that were very moving,
prov'd so with her, to whom they were addrest, who with a countenance
that told me so, reply'd. Though I confess your perseverance in your
Passion, and Disobedience, does much trouble me, yet I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your death would do it more, and till I have resolv'd that doubt,
I desire you not to do it; and if that be not sufficient, I command you
it, and shall judge of what you would perswade me, by observing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what I say can perswade you. If, Madam (I reply'd) my sufferings
were with hope, I might by my Reason, raise my Fortitude to the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
height, and therefore I do now in some sort, rejoyce at the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misingness
of my condition, that as my Flame excels all others, so the
Beauty which inspires it, may abundantly find by Obedience, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of that distinction, to be as great in the Effect, as in the Cause.
But, Madam, I humbly conjure you, if in the duty of preserving you,
I fail in that other of obeying you, ascribe it to the real Cause, and
give my death that sensibility which you have deny'd my Life.
This is a Mercy which Compassion may obtain, if not Cloak, and though
I should ambition the last, yet I dare not hope it, and implore your
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96335:25"/>
pardon for presuming to name it. I shall know, said <hi>Altezeera</hi> hastily,
how to distinguish between what seeks you, and what you seek. And
therefore believe me, if I find you guilty of the last, I shall deny your
death not onely the first of those two things you mention'd, but both.
These last words she deliver'd going away into her Closet, and her eyes
were so cover'd with tears, and her cheeks with blushes, that I knew
not whether compassion, or a more obliging cause carried her so hastily
away. As soon I found I was alone (which I had not for a good while,
so much my doubts, my fears, and my hopes were predominant) I went to
give the necessary orders for the reception of <hi>Celindus,</hi> the certainty of
whose intended assault next morning, I had that night confirm'd unto me by
repeated Intelligences. Aurora did but begin to give the World notice
of the days approach, when the shrill Trumpets, and other Warlike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
invited the Soldiers to draw out of their Camp, and to march
to the storming of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> which, if taken, would end the War, and
satisfie both their avarice and ambition. <hi>Celindus,</hi> to animate his Army,
made them a short speech, and therein acquainted them, That their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
as well as courages invited them by one gallant Action to conclude
that War, which time would render more difficult, and perhaps unfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
That his happiness or misery depended upon their Swords; as well
as their reward and honour did upon his Fortune; That since the ties
were mutual, the hazard would be so likewise; That therefore he would
be as well a Companion with them, as a Commander over them; and would
have as great share in the danger as the glory, which he doubted not was
as certain as it would be great, having those whose courages would court
victory so handsomely, that her Injustice must be as high as their Valors,
if she did not fling herself into their arms. The Soldiers encouraged by
so obliging words, testifyed their Resolutions by a shout (which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as loud as their guilt) and <hi>Celindus</hi> with the generous <hi>Phanasder,</hi>
(his Lieutenant-General) having order'd the manner of the Storm, the
first Troops advanc'd, and discharg'd a shower of Darts upon those which
I had appointed to man the Walls, and playing without intermission up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Battlements, they did (under favour of their shot) advance their
Battering-Rams, their Rolling-Bridges, and their Scaling-Ladders, which
were all order'd with so much advantage, that the Rams having made a
breach, <hi>Celindus</hi> in person, at the head of Four thousand Men, presented
himself at the mouth of it, with so assur'd a countenance, that the dull
Inhabitants, and some Soldiers which had the guard of that quarter, fled,
and left him the passage clear. Whilst these things were acting on the
North side of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> I was disputing against <hi>Phanasder</hi> the weakest
place of it, which he had assaulted with so much fury, that I atttibuted
our Victory to the justice of the gods, rather than to any humane means, and
I had but newly beaten him off, when a Soldier that fled from the Breach
which the Enemy had enter'd, came running to me, and told me, that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindus</hi>
with near half his Army was within our Walls. This news (as you
may easily imagine) did not a little surprize me, and having leisure to
exclaim against Fate, that thus endanger'd <hi>Altezeera,</hi> I took most of those
men with whom I had defeated <hi>Phanasder,</hi> and ran with them to the
place the Soldier guided me unto, where I found that <hi>Celindus</hi> had possest
himself of that Street which led directly from the Breach unto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and was already beginning to force open the Gates of it, when I
cry'd out, hold <hi>Celindus,</hi> do not think the gods have so much abandon'd
the innocent, as to permit the King and <hi>Altezeera</hi> to fall into thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96335:26"/>
the ill success of <hi>Phanasders</hi> Forces, shews that they are under the
protection of Divinity, and if that argument will not make thee credit
it, thy own defeat shall. Finishing those words, we thrust our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the thickest Squadrons, where my valiant Friends so well acted their
parts, that we soon cloathed them with their own Livery (despair.) But
I must give <hi>Celindus</hi> that due, that what Troops our Resolution disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
his rally'd again. To be brief, we were so tir'd with our former
action and this too, that we had been absolutely vanquish'd, had not <hi>Amidor</hi>
come to our Rescue; who having defeated those Assailants that had
storm'd his Quarter, and learn'd the danger I was in, came with 1000
Men to my relief so seasonably, that it was when we fought not in
hopes to avoid being defeated, but to avoid deserving to be so. This
supply so disheartned <hi>Celindus,</hi> that he began to think of a Retreat,
which almost as soon was put in practice: but the Enemy were much asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
when they heard a hideous cry behind them, which was occasioned by
some 500 Men that <hi>Amidor</hi> had sent secretly out of a Salliport, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
falling upon those that guarded the Breach, made them fly to
<hi>Celindus</hi> for safety. We so husbanded this disorder, that we absolutely
routed the Rebels; and the slaughter had been much bloodier, had not I
been the occasion of hindring it; for during the Fight, I receiv'd some
wounds, out of which ran such abundance of Blood, that in following
the execution, I fell down pale and speechless, and suddenly a rumour being
dispers'd that I was kill'd, <hi>Amidor,</hi> and all the rest were so much concern'd
in my loss, that they neglected increasing <hi>Celindus</hi>'s; who in our disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
found his safety. When <hi>Amidor</hi> and the rest of my Friends came to
me, they saw me environ'd with dead Bodies, and with as little sign of
life as those I was amongst, yet they carried me to my Chamber, and lay'd
me on a Bed. The news of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s defeat, and my death, came at
the same time to the Palace, and as two contraries of equal strength,
the one destroy'd what the other rais'd, onely the King and <hi>Altezeera</hi>
(especially the latter) seem'd to be more concern'd in my loss than their
own safeties. The former consider'd me as one, whose past service had
render'd me considerable, and whose present condition made him think
my help would have prov'd so, which were the grounds whereon he
built his grief. But the latter, besides those considerations, added that
of her Friendship (and perhaps affection) which drowned all the lesser
ones, as the Stars are not seen when the Sun appears. The first thing she
imagin'd (as she afterwards told me) was, that the gods had resolv'd
to ruine her Family, and as an earnest thereof, had taken away the chief
Supporter of it, (for that was the Title her Goodness gave me) to the
end she submitted with much less reluctancy than to the means; But (as
her mind was never at rest) she believ'd on the other side, that my death
was the effect of her Cruelty and my despair; and then she abjur'd all
those severe Laws, which under the name of a great distance in Blood,
consines us to much greater from Felicity. The horror which invaded all
her Faculties was very great, whilst she lookt upon herself as the cause of my
death; but it was suddenly rais'd to a higher pitch; For when she was
considering the sadness of her condition, she had withdrawn herself to a
Window that look'd into the Court, where she had not been long, when she
might perceive <hi>Amidor,</hi> and the rest of my Friends carrying me all pale
and bloody towards my Chamber; That object having rais'd her grief
to an incapacity of being rais'd higher, she suddenly accompany'd my
loss with a flood of Tears, and having fetch'd two or three deep Sighs,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96335:26"/>
fell into a swound. (Happy <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that by a suppos'd Death, discover'dst
that Truth, which to have been certain of, thou would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st have purchas'd
with a real one: But rather wretched <hi>Artivasdes,</hi> that thy Fate should
be so different from thy desires, that whether living or dead, thou should'st
always torment the fair <hi>Altezeera.</hi>) But the noise of which the Princess
made by her fall, was the cause that some of her Servants ran to help
her; who having employ'd all the Arts they knew (after an hour) reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
her again. In the mean time, whither by the motion whilst I was
carrying to my Chamber, or what other cause to ascribe it to I know not; but
I was no sooner laid upon my Bed, than I began to give some signs of
life, which <hi>Lindesia</hi> (who sat weeping by me) perceiving, began with
raptures of joy to raise her hopes, and to imagine, that by the help of
some able Chirurgions I might be recover'd, which being sent for and come,
and having search'd my wounds and dress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d them, found they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dangerous, yet to console my Mother, told her they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urable;
and having given me some Cordials which brought me to my self again,
they withdrew themselves, The first thing I askt was, whither <hi>Altezee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
was in the possession of <hi>Celindus?</hi> To which <hi>Amidor</hi> (who had not
stirr'd from my Bed-side) answer'd me she was not, and that we had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
so entire a Victory, that nothing could could it but the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I was in. I lifted up my eyes and hands as my retribution to the
gods, and conjur'd <hi>Amidor,</hi> that his Affection to me might not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the Town, the preservation of which I now wholly left to his care,
and that he would go to <hi>Artabazus</hi> and receive his orders, and assure <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera,</hi>
that nothing but the impossibility of not waiting upon her should
have diverted me from that duty and happiness. <hi>Amidor</hi> to satisfie me,
went unto the King, and told him how miraculously the gods had restor'd
me to life, and that I had sent him to acquaint him with it, and to receive
his commands whilst my weakness render'd me uncapable of that honor.
<hi>Artabazus</hi> seem'd to be as much pleas'd as surpriz'd with this news, and
would needs have gone and visited me; but <hi>Amidor</hi> told him, that I
was but newly come to my self, and that the alteration which so great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
would necessarily produce might be prejudicial to my health; therefore
humbly besought him to delay that high favour till I were in a condition
fitter to receive it. The King at last yielded to <hi>Amidor</hi>'s request, and
committed the charge of <hi>Artaxata</hi> to him, who immediately went to
<hi>Altezeera's</hi> Chamber, and sent in to desire the honor of speaking to her.
This message exceedingly perplext her, for she imagin'd he came to accuse
her of being my Murtherer (for she had not yet heard I was alive) and
in a manner acknowledging herself guilty of it, she knew not with what
face to entertain him; yet at last she sent him an admittance, knowing
that the sight of her grief would rather make him pity than condemn her.
(But you may wonder (generous <hi>Artabanes</hi>) continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) that
<hi>Altezeera</hi> should believe my Brother knew my Passion. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That <hi>Amidor</hi> and I had so perfect a Friendship, that she believ'd I
had nothing of reserve for him, neither indeed had I. <hi>Altezeera</hi> who lay
upon her Bed, (and who had sent all her Servants out, that none might
be witness of that freedom which she resolv'd to give her sorrows, and
entertain <hi>Amidor</hi> with) no sooner saw him come, but with Eyes full of
Tears she told him, Are the gods then, <hi>Amidor,</hi> so much declar'd our
Enemies, as to rob us of <hi>Artavasdes?</hi> I say our Enemies; for tyes of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
are as great as those of Blood; and as you had the honor to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd
unto him by the latter quality, so I had the satisfaction to possess
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96335:27"/>
him in the former. Alas! How dear have we bought our instant safety?
'Tis by a loss that nothing could augment but our outliving it. She
would have proceeded in this sad, and pleasing language, had not her
Sighs and Tears hinder'd its continuance; which speechless Orators so
well acted their parts, that though <hi>Amidor</hi> knew their cause was groundless,
yet it was impossible for him to abstain from keeping her company; which
she perceiving, forced herself to tell him. No, no, <hi>Amidor,</hi> it is I that am
onely guilty, and should onely bear the punishment; my cruelty is the
source of all our miseries, but I will take so severe revenge upon my self
for it, that you shall say, though I knew not how to recompence Love, yet
I knew to punish Ingratitude. But <hi>Amidor,</hi> who was confident that this
discovery of <hi>Altezeera's</hi> affection would be more powerfull towards my
cure than all other remedies, thought it high time to disabuse her, and
therefore told her, Madam, <hi>Artavasdes</hi> is too much your Servant to leave
this World without your permission, your commands exacted that at his
hands, and the gods who knew how how just it was for him not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
you, have restor'd him to life, but it will not onely last long enough
to beg your leave to dye, if you are resolv'd to neglect and scorn his
Passion. How! (said the Princess, starting up) does <hi>Artavasdes</hi> live?
This delusion, <hi>Amidor,</hi> this delusion cannot last, do not flatter me into a
Joy, which, if not real, will make my misery the geater; it cannot be, I
saw him dead. Madam (<hi>Amidor</hi> reply'd) would he were as certain you
would not scorn his Adoration, as I am that he lives to pay it you, his
happiness would be then greater than your doubts. My happiness, said
<hi>Altezeera</hi> would be as great as my torment, could I but credit what you
say. Madam (said <hi>Amidor</hi>) if you suspect this truth, your eyes may give
you that satisfaction which my words cannot, by my waiting on you to
his Chamber, where your suspitions will soon vanish. I accept your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
(said the Princess, abandoning her Bed, and giving <hi>Amidor</hi> her hand
to lead her thither) for I can have no quiet whilst I have any doubts.
ut, Madam, (said my Brother) let me beg you to leave all your disdain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
you; for the least quantity of that poyson kills all his hopes, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
himself; 'tis not now with him as at other times, where rigour
did appear Justice, his sufferings and services now stile it Ingratitude,
though he gives it still the former name, and onely expects his felicity from
your goodness, not his condition. So high a Modesty (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) merits
an equal Reward, and I should be too unjust should I deny it him. By
this time they were come unto my Chamber, and finding none in it but
one of my Pages, <hi>Amidor</hi> commanded him out, and opening the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
told me the Princess was come to visit me. The sight of so high
a Beauty produc'd a proportionate effect; for before she was come
in, I could not turn in my Bed, but now I did towards her, and with a
firm voice told her, At last (Madam) at last the gods have heard my
Prayers, and commiserating my condition, have made my Enemies swords
more pitiful than you; they have given me that death you were pleas'd
to deny me, and in so blest away, that 'tis in defending and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
you; so that nothing could add unto this Felicity, but that I had
deferr'd receiving of these charitable Wounds till the last day of the War,
that you might have had no further use of my services, and that
your security and my quiet might have been establisht at one time: But,
Madam, since the gods do call me from you sooner, I conjure you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I dy'd serving you, and let that extinguish your resentments against
an ambition which cannot be greater than was the impossibility of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96335:27"/>
it. Alas, <hi>Artavasdes</hi> (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) think not of dying, the gods
who have already rais'd you from Death to Life will perfect that good
work: They are too just to rob us of you. They would be too cruel
Madam (said I) did they restore me to my health; Your Disdain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
me torments so great, that Death is a comparative happiness unto
them. But, Madam, I do beg your pardon, you commanded me not to
trouble you any more with my Passion, and I'll obey you, onely let me
beseech you to receive these importunities as my last Crimes, and upon
that score to forgive them; for I vow never to offend you more. Nor I
(said the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>) to receive your addresses as an offence: No (<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>)
your Virtue has obtain'd the Victory, and I command you now to
live, that I may shew you by my affection I know how to value and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
yours. Alas, Madam, (I reply'd) What do you do? You may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
by this art hinder my death awhile; but as soon as I discover I am
deluded, by all that is most Sacred, I will not live a minute: Take heed,
fair Princess, you may do like a merciful Judge, who when the Delinquent's
ripe for Death, and made his peace with Heaven, by giving him a pardon,
his future courses may be more criminal than his precedent ones, and
thereby make that which was intended for his good, the occasion of his
greater ill. Banish those groundless fears (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) for my intentions
are as clear as you persuade me your Flame is, and as a confirmation of it,
I engage my self before <hi>Amidor,</hi> never to decline what I have promis'd.
Ah! Madam (I reply'd) Why am I not in a condition to fling my self
at your feet as some expression of joy, which certainly cannot kill,
since I am yet alive: But, my Princess, give me leave not onely to call
<hi>Amidor,</hi> but the gods to witness, that I will never decline the Passion that
I pay you, but will maintain my Flame alive even in the Grave; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vanquisht
your Disdain, it cannot be overcome; and if ever I alter
this profession, make my future punishment equal to my present felicity. As
I had done speaking, <hi>Lindesia</hi> came into the room, and my Princess having
commanded my Love to be as silent as constant, withdrew herself, and
left me in such extasies of joy, that they had like to have made me
ever uncapable of any; for all my wounds fell fresh a bleeding, and I
was so taken up with my present raptures, that had not <hi>Lindesia</hi> been more
careful of me than I was of my self, I had dyed in, and by them; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
discover'd that my sheets were all bloody, she came running to me,
and so timely, that the least delay had render'd her care fruitless: But my
wounds being again bound up, they enjoin'd me to take my rest, as
the best and easiest cure. Thus, my dear friend, you see how at last my
desires were crown'd, and little obstacle remain'd to the perfection of
my happiness, but my health, which by degrees I recover'd, and that which
contributed most unto it was, the daily visits of the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> whose
conversation charm'd my ears as much as her Beauty did my eyes, and
every hour discovering new perfections, I blest that suffering which had
given me so high an interest in them. My wounds which admitted of
forty dayes for their cure, did little afflict me, because the Enemy never
attempted any thing during that space against <hi>Artaxata,</hi> which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by those wounds <hi>Celindus</hi> had receiv'd in the Assault; in
which also he had lost so many Men, and so many others were render'd
useless; that whilst he was recovering he sent <hi>Phanasder</hi> for a Recruit,
and had drawn his Aamy some twenty Furlongs from the Town,
contenting himself to block it up at so civil a distance. But as if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
believ'd it necessary that nothing should be done whilst the chief
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96335:28"/>
Actor in either side was unable to appear; she so order'd all things, that
at the same time I was perfectly cur'd, <hi>Celindus</hi> was so too, and <hi>Phanasder</hi>
came to the Camp with a supply of near Ten thousand Horse and Foot:
So considerable an addition rais'd <hi>Celindus</hi> his hopes, and being ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to recover his losses, and to employ the fury of those new Men on
some design where disadvantage of being repuls'd could not be so preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
as the honour of success would be glorious, elected the storming
again of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> as most proportionate to his Revenge and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and having made his chief Officers approve of his design, he gave
order that all things should be in a readiness for so bold an one. But
whilst <hi>Celindus</hi> was troubling himself to be Conqueror of a Town, I was
so in my affection, and was more satisfyed in my Victory, than he could
have been in his, had his pride and designes arriv'd at their ambition'd peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.
O Gods! what uninmaginable joys doe mutual fires create in Love; at
least mine were so great, that whereas in other affairs the ignorance of
things hinders us from describing them; here the knowledge of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the same effect: In brief, our Passions so increast, that we thought
all conversation but our own was as troublesome as that was pleasing;
and therefore studied how to be private without discovering that Flame,
which we at least as much endeavor'd to preserve so, till a fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
were offer'd to move <hi>Artabazus</hi> to unite our hearts by an Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeal
tye as firmly, as they were already join'd by sympathy and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
One morning whilst the Sun was yet but rising, I waited upon
my Princess into a Garden of Pleasure, contiguous to the Palace, and
adorn'd with all that Nature and Art was capable of; there the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
separating themselves to take that divertisement which was most
agreeable to their fancies; <hi>Altezeera</hi> and I by degres left those that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on us, and entring to an earnest discourse, we engag'd our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
into a little Wilderness, in the center whereof was a spring, whose
water was receiv'd into a Cistern of Alabaster, which was held by a statue
of a Nymph cut in white Marble; There we might perceive a Gentleman
whose postures as well as actions exprest his troubles; and though we
could not discover his face, yet we might his tears running down it into the
Cistern, and in such abundance, as if the Fountain and his eies strove
which should most load the fair Nymphs Arms. Such an unexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
had made us desire to learn the cause of it, and fetching a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
by the help of some Orange Trees, we came so near, that without
being seen we might see him and hear him; and as his mind was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
agitated, so we were not long in expectation, till we heard him
fetch a deep sigh, and then casting up his eyes to Heaven, cry'd out; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
<hi>Amidor</hi> (for 'twas he indeed) shall not the Divinity which dwells
upon her face, thy friendship, nor his engagements suppress thy Passion?
Shall the highest Beauty make thee commit a resembling Crime? O no, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than interrupt so pure a Love deprive thy self of Life, and by a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Death settle their quiet, and confer on thy self thine own. Then he
paus'd awhile, and suddenly striking his hand upon his breast; he sigh'd, and
said: O—it cannot be—her eyes inspire no Flames which reason can
extinguish, he knows their power is not to be resisted, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
with the cause, if he be reasonable, he cannot blame the effect: and
if he be not, he is not worthy of thy friendship: but alas, thou talkest as
if he were the onely obstacle, when thy own defects will perhaps more
fight against thee, than thy fidelity unto thy friend, or thy Mistresses
to him. Then weeping awhile, he continu'd; What? shall the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96335:28"/>
of ill, make thee as miserable as the real ill? Fie (<hi>Amidor:</hi>) can a
courage capable of loving her, be capable of fear? No: 'tis not in thy
nature nor thy custom to apprehend, but this timerousness is the effect
of thy treachery to thy friend, and since the gods so punish the thoughts
of wickedness, how much more will they the wickedness it self? Cast
away then so criminal a Passion, or if that be impossible, at least by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
of it, so torment thy self, that if before, or after thy death they
discover it, they may rather pity than condemn thee. Having so said,
he borrow'd some of that water he had given the Nymph, and having
washt his eyes, that they might not betray what he resolv'd to keep se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
he went away, but not in a greater trouble than he left <hi>Altezeera</hi> and
I in, for we found by his discourse, that the object of his Love was to the
object of his friends, and that his friendship and affection were the causes
of so noble and sad a conflict; But we could not sufficiently admire his
resolution, which we esteem'd so generous, that we assur'd our selves, a reward
equal to his virtue would crown it: and being both much concern'd in
him, we determin'd by a curious inspection into all his actions to discover
who they were that caus'd his disorder, but if that course did not succeed,
then by acquainting him with what we knew, engage him to tell us what
we were ignorant of, that we might employ our selves the better to serve
him. In this design we return'd to the Palace, where we found that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Inhabitants of <hi>Artaxata</hi> had petition'd to <hi>Artabazus</hi> to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate
their condition, since by their wants they were reduc'd to such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
that if by some means, a Peace were not concluded with <hi>Celindus,</hi>
or the Siege rais'd, they must yield to him rather than to Famine. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal
of this Paper, much perplext the King, as well from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Subjects wants, as the knowledge of their impudence, and the
fear of their treachery; but before he made them any return, he consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with those about him, who were all (except <hi>Crasolis</hi>) of opinion,
that a mild answer should be given them, and by kind usage and assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a speedy remedy to all their grievances, endeavor to keep them
within the limits of their duty; But <hi>Crasolis,</hi> whom we too apparently
suspected was a friend to <hi>Celindus,</hi> represented, that under the formal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of a Petition there might be treachery conceal'd; that the not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of such insolent demands in their very birth, would authorize
their growth; that lenity insuch a case would appear fear, and that would
introduce a ruine: That if (on the other side) a vigorous remedy were
apply'd, it would not onely extinguish the first sedition, but deter the
people from a second: and therefore he was of opinion, that some of the
chiefest contrivers of the Petition should be instantly executed in the Court
of the Palace. Thus <hi>Crasolis</hi> would have rais'd the Kings Enemies within
the Walls, as well as without, that <hi>Celindus</hi> might make use of the disorder;
yet he would have that pass for his courage and honesty, which indeed was
his treachery. But the moderate advice took place, and the people, upon
the Kings engagement of soon remedying their miseries, return'd with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
for him, whose ruine was design'd by <hi>Crasolis</hi> in their petitioning. The
night which succeeded this day was not half spent, when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Army to Storm <hi>Artaxata</hi> the second time, gave us a
hot alarum; but being advertis'd of his design, he found us prepar'd to
oppose it. Perhaps he thought that darkness would be more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Arms than light, that his Men not seeing the danger, would
go more resolutely on it, or that the enterprize would be more formidable
unto us, when obscurity (the ingenderer of confusion) was join'd to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96335:29"/>
horror of an Assault. But my dear <hi>Artabanes,</hi> I will not so much tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
on your Civility as to particularize all the accidents which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in that bloody Night; it shall suffice to tell you, that after the
Town was won and lost three times, we at last remained the Possessors
of it, (though it cost us much blood, and the Enemy more) but that
which brought us so often into hazard, was, That <hi>Artaxata</hi> was twice
set on fire, by the treachery of those within, which requiring many
hands to quench it, robb'd us of so many hands for our defence. Some
Prisoners that we took acquainted us who were the Traytors, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seiz'd upon, confest their Crime, and receiv'd the punishment it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd:
There was also one of the Prisoners that being upon the point of
death, and repenting his Rebellion, sent to me, and to discharge his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
assur'd me, that <hi>Celindus</hi> had a friend in the Kings Council, who
gave him a constant intelligence of our proceedings; but he could
not inform me of his name, yet by some circumstances, I was fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
that it was <hi>Crasolis;</hi> but the King believ'd him both so honest and so
able, that if he had merited as well the first of those attributes as the
last, <hi>Artabazus</hi> had been as happy as he was deceiv'd in him; But he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
the King so absolutely, that he onely lookt through his eyes, and
heard but with his Ears, which excess of favour that perfidious man hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
to his own, not his Kings advantage. <hi>Celindus,</hi> who perceiv'd
that force was unsuccesful, and that two assaults had cost him near 7000
Men, lost all hopes of taking <hi>Artaxata</hi> by Storm, and therefore began
to make his Approaches, and endeavor to possess himself of that by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and time, which valour had deny'd him; but not wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the blind events of War, he design'd to attempt something by
Treaty; and lest that moderate way might appear to his Army the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of fear and despair, he cloath'd it with a pretence of rendring us
thereby the more secure, and consequently the more surprizable, or if
his overtures were yielded unto, they should bring as much advantage
to his party as a Conquest could. This opinion carried so good an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
with it, that he obtain'd his Armies concurrence. But the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<hi>Artaxata</hi> was in, in the two precedent Assaults, and the scarcity
of Victuals which now began somewhat to afflict the Inhabitants (though
not in so high a degree by as much as was represented to <hi>Artabazus</hi>) gave
<hi>Celindus</hi>'s Partizans too plausible a rise to renew their former requests,
and to put the King in mind of his engagement of soon ending their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
by Treaty or Force. The multitude much discontented by the length
of the Siege, greedily laid hold of the exhortation, and came far more
numerous to the Palace than the first time; the King having receiv'd their
Petition (as his custom was) assembled his Council, to give them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
And the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> whose Virtue and Birth gave her an equal
interest in the Publick, was by the Kings command at that consultation,
where whilst we were debating of an answer for the Petitioners, an Officer
came to give me notice that a Trumpet, with a Gentleman sent from
<hi>Celindus,</hi> desir'd admittance, having some things of high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to offer, touching a happy Peace. The King thought this a fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to defer giving the people an answer, and commanded them
to retire, which they did, but with bitter execrations, that if they had
not a speedy return, and proportionate to their demands, they would
act that which they onely mention'd in their former Petition. <hi>Crasolis</hi>
omitted not to take notice of that insolent expression, but the people
being gone, there arose a dispute, whether the Gentleman employ'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96335:29"/>
from <hi>Celindus</hi> should be admitted. Those that were of that opinion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
it by representing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Laws of Custom, and of Nations, allow'd
Princes to hear the desires of their rebellious Subjects, otherwise the War
would never determine, but by the absolute extirpating of the offenders,
where the expence of Treasure, the hazard, and the time, would not be
repaid, were the victory never so perfect. That it might be <hi>Celindus</hi> would
propound some conditions which would suit with his own interest, and
the Kings too; That if his motions were not heard, the people might be
possest they owed their ruine to the Kings wilfulness, and that they were
much more humble and reasonable, than perhaps they really were; that
his Affirmative being not to be confuted by any apparent proof, might
pass for currant, and the <hi>Armenians</hi> thereby enraged, might run to the
last extreams; That the Propositions must be reasonable or unreasonable,
if the first, then to be embrac'd, if the latter, then to be rejected; and by a
Declaration convince the World that they were so, and finally by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
the insolency of his demands, confirm Subjects in their Loyalty,
and satisfy strangers with the equality of their proceeding. Those that
were of a contrary judgement, alledged, That the Law of Custom in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Rebels to capitulate with their Princes, was not binding in
it self, but onely as far as advantages might be derived from it; that
<hi>Celindus</hi> his craft and wickedess were so great, that the first gave
as little Hope of obtaining any advantage by Treaty, as the latter
of enjoying it, if obtain'd. That no miseries which could befall a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by being overcome by his Subjects, could equal the infamy of yielding
to them, since the first is an act that the gods force him unto, but the
other a misery he throws himself upon, and he is more justly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
that makes himself the instrument of his own ruine, than he who
is found to be made so by a power he cannot resist; that by rejecting his
demands, the people will probably assure themselves, that <hi>Artabazus</hi> is
in a good condition, and that he has some certainties of a speedy and sure
relief, since otherwise he would not decline any overture of Agreement;
That this will invite their patience, and continue their Loyalty; That
the state of affairs were not so low, as to act those things which necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
onely can render legitimate; That to divulge his overtures, might
prove ruinous, how insolent soever they were, for if they offer'd peace
upon any Terms, the people who judge of the goodness of the offer, by
the benefit which they derive from it, will think their ease cannot be too
dearly purchast, and thereby make that which is design'd to engage them
more vigorously in the Kings service, the way to make them all embrace
<hi>Celindus</hi>'s, But not withstanding these Arguments, the King inclin'd to the
first opinion, and the Gentleman being admitted, he presented the King,
upon his knees, a Letter from <hi>Celindus,</hi> and being order'd to withdraw,
<hi>Artabazus</hi> open'd it, and commanding it to be read, found in it these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing words.</p>

                        <p>THE god's shall bear me witness with how much sorrow I have consider'd
the goodness of your disposition, so highly misled and abused by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
and wickedness of <hi>Anexander,</hi> and with what reluctancy (having
fruitlesly attempted all other means to free you from so low a subjection) I have
been necessitated to make use of force. I conjure also the same gods to make me
the object of their fury, if having your engagement for the banishing of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exander,</hi>
and all those whom he has infected with his Principles, and the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> to <hi>Palisdes,</hi> I do not instantly lay down Arms,
and count it more glorious, to return to my first Quiet and Condition, than to
possess as many Crowns, as you have Subjects; and as the former of these is
the onely way to put the affairs of this Kingdom in a right temper; so the
latter is the only means to confirm and settle them in it. I shall therefore
humbly beg you so to consider of this request, as that it may not produce a

                  <p>THe Letter was no sooner ended, but some of the Council repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the King, that the requests were as unpardonable as
he that made them, and that though they had not been so, yet they
might have been more aptly offer'd before he had attempted any violence
against him or <hi>Artaxata,</hi> That being made after, they were to be lookt
upon as the effects of his despair, not to that pretext he seem'd to cloak
them withal; That <hi>Anexander</hi> was the chiefest Pillar that sustain'd his
greatness, which made <hi>Celindus</hi> so earnest to remove him, thereby more
secretly to ruine it, and that to sacrifice so faithful a Servant to <hi>Celindus</hi>'s
ambition, was under the appearance of banishing but one Man, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to seduce most men; who seeing Virtue was ruinous, would find suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
motives in their nature, as well as interest to make them decline
it; That to deterr <hi>Celindus</hi> from storming any more <hi>Artaxata,</hi> 'twould
be fit to give him advertisement, that <hi>Palisdes</hi> should be exposed to all
the Darts and Arrows that were flung or shot at those defended it;
To which last motion <hi>Amidor</hi> reply'd, That it were not onely to wrong
our courages, but to make <hi>Celindus</hi> believe our condition was very low,
when we elected, for our preservation, courses that were so much so;
that if he were repulst, he might perswade his Men, he ow'd the Affront
not to our valours, but to his fears of destroying <hi>Palisdes,</hi> whereas
'twere wiser (as well as more generous) to purchase our securities by our
virtue, which would, in his first attempt, cut off all his hopes of a second.
This was much controverted, but at last, <hi>Crasolis</hi> made this ensuring Speech;
Sir, As I cannot look upon your present condition without great horror,
so I cannot without a resembling joy, consider, that there is yet some
overtures made, by which you may be preserved from ruine; for indeed
'tis a signal mercy of the gods, that <hi>Celindus,</hi> who has had so much wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96335:30"/>
as to act what he has done, should not carry on his design to the
uttermost, but that his power being boundless, his ambition should yet
put limits to its self, and offer to be contented with a part from you,
when by himself he might possess the whole: But Sir, as those Gentlemen
which have spoken already, do well observe, we shall pay dear for this
peace; 'tis true, but yet, if we accept not of it, we are like to pay dearer
for a War. I must confess, to banish <hi>Anexander,</hi> goes as much against
my Reason as Inclination, and to sacrifice so generous a Subject to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
is to make us hereafter embrace Vice for our Interest, To give the
Princess too unto <hi>Palisdes,</hi> is that which will render our sorrow, as great
as is <hi>Celindus</hi>'s ambition in demanding her, or <hi>Palisdes</hi> happines would be
in possessing her. These Sir, are the effects that will proceed from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Requests, but alas, what will be the Miseries that attend a refusal
of them? <hi>Anexander,</hi> instead of banishment, to be murther'd before your
eyes, <hi>Altezeera</hi> forc'd to be <hi>Palisdes</hi> Wife, your own Life made an Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the assurance of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s, your faithful Servants expos'd to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as great, as their Fidelity merits recompence, and in a word, your
Kingdom suffers miseries sufficient (if rightly plac't) to punish the crimes
of those that are the causers of them. But (Sir) as we have seen the
inconveniences of granting his demands, through the optick of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
to the action, so let us consider them, in their last formidable
dress. To consent then to <hi>Anexanders</hi> banishment, if you look upon it,
as in relation to your self, is, by being depriv'd of his conversation (it may
be too but for a short while) to settle the quiet, of your people, and
free your self from apparent ruine; if in respect of him, I knew his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
disposition so well, that he will imbrace his retirement as his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
being your Majesty and your Kingdom will derive theirs from it.
To give <hi>Altezeera</hi> to <hi>Palisdes,</hi> methinks has nothing in it of so much ill, as
the being forced unto it; for <hi>Palisdes</hi> Person and Birth are eminent, and
all his actions and inclinations generous, except this last, where his Fathers
Commands, and not his own Desires have made him faulty, and when
Crimes do bear the name of Duty, they are fitter to be pardon'd than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
being the effects of a noble cause; and if his highest Vice be his
Obedience to his Father, what will then his Vertues prove? The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
too, not being engag'd to any, may, with less reluctancy, give her self
to <hi>Palisdes,</hi> whose Youth is so promising, that 'tis probable she may esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
her own felicity, by restoring that of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and instead of
the giving a portion with her, you may receive a Kingdom by giving of
her, (for so I look upon it, as the state of your affairs now stand) in a
word, when I consider that we hear not so much as hopes from <hi>Anexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
when I see <hi>Celindus</hi> with a powerful Army under your Walls; and
when I came but even now from hearing those within them (whom too
you rely upon for your preservation) threaten, nay swear to deliver you
up to your Enemies, with execrations, which give me as much horror to
relate, as if they executed them; I cannot, though with sadness above
description, but give my humble opinion, that <hi>Celindus</hi> should have his
Request granted. Many of those that were guilty of <hi>Crasolis</hi> Crimes, and
of Fear, so fortified his opinion by divers other arguments, and by their
concurrence, that I found <hi>Artabazus</hi> yielding. Great gods! who could
then relate the several disorders I was in? but alas they were nothing
then, to what they did increase unto, when I read upon my Princesses
Face, the Indignation which such Councils had raised in her; the sight
of which made me address my self to the King, in a posture that did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96335:31"/>
speak my resentment, and tell him. Sir, That <hi>Celindus</hi> who has had
the impudence to take up Arms against you, should demand the Princess
for <hi>Palisdes</hi> is not strange, but that any Loyal <hi>Armenian</hi> should advise
you to grant it, is that I cannot sufficiently wonder at: the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
I can make of those, who are of that opinion is, that their fears
exceed their judgements (may be their honesty.) Shall his defeats be the
steps to his ambition? and shall our having given them drown our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages?
the gods forbid: But Sir, allow we were as low as these
Mens spirits are, which gave that counsel, what heavier yoke can we groan
under, than that we would now submit unto: shall our fears give that to
<hi>Celindus</hi> which his Courage ne'r could purchase? and shall we by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous
apprehension, count all those deliverances the gods have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
sent us, as so many <hi>Omens</hi> of our ruine? or else Sir, have these
Men seen any coldness in our courages, on which they build their despair?
if not; why do they so much wrong them? what, shall <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who
is a recompence too high for Vertue, be a sacrifice unto Rebellion? O
Sir! do not by such a recompence, invite your Subjects in the future to
revolt: what guilt can be so ugly that such a reward will not invite us
to imbrace? let us not then by contributing unto the Crime, make our
selves worthy of the punishment; not let these mens timerousness per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to that, which if once acted, the gods must never after protect
you, unless they have design'd to appear as unjust as they would have you
be to your self and the Princess, who are more threaten'd by their fears,
than our condition. But as I was going to continue my discourse upon
those subjects that related to the suppressing of the mutinous people, and
my Fathers particular, a Gentleman came in and told <hi>Artabazus,</hi> there was
one which wore <hi>Celindus</hi> Colours, being well mounted, was scap'd from
the Camp, and though followed by five or six of the Enemy, had recover'd
the Port, and begg'd earnestly to be presented to the King, alledging
that it was about affairs of high concernment, and which could admit of
no delay. <hi>Artabazus</hi> commanded forthwith, that he should be brought
in. The Man no sooner heard the permission, (for he waited at the door)
than he flung himself at the Kings feet, and told him, Sir, <hi>Anexander,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a thousand difficulties, which nothing could render supportable, but
the consideration of him for whose sake he endured them, has brought
an Army of 30000 Men into <hi>Thospia,</hi> where a violent Feaver, (envious of
his glory) has flung him into his Bed, and though his torments are
very great, yet he resents none so fully as those which proceed from the
impossibility of his serving you in person: but since his fatal sickness (as
if all things had contributed to increase that misfortune) there has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
so high a dispute betwixt <hi>Stratolis</hi> and <hi>Falintus,</hi> who should have
the happiness to command the Army for your relief; that some sad events
are thereby already fall'n out, and hourly will be augmented, unless <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
(who they all beg for their General, during <hi>Anexanders</hi> indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition)
be instantly sent to take the charge of the War, and lest your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should doubt the truth of what I now deliver, I shall humbly desire
you to peruse this Ticket, which being presented, we found 'twas sign'd
and written by <hi>Anexander,</hi> and onely begg'd the King to credit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he should relate. The joy we all receiv'd at the assurance of so
powerful an Army's being ready to relieve us, did mitigate our sorrow,
at the hearing of <hi>Anexanders</hi> not being able to Head it. But <hi>Artabazus</hi>
and the Council, (to lose no time) thought best to dispatch <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
without the honour of an Answer, which they concluded was the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96335:31"/>
fittest they could return his ambitious desires, and to send me that night
away, though the wicked <hi>Crasolis</hi> oppos'd the latter, alledging, that the
Town would doubtless be lost, if I were once out of the Walls, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
I might be taken or kill'd, endeavouring to pass the Enemies Guards,
that then, not onely <hi>Artaxata,</hi> but the Army would lose its Head, and
chief Defender, and therefore he was of opinion, 'twere better to send a
Commission joyntly to <hi>Stratolis</hi> and <hi>Falintus</hi> to command the Army, than
to expose all to so great a hazard. This advice was not given out of any
affection to the publique, or my particular, but that he believ'd, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Stratolis</hi> and <hi>Falintus,</hi> there would arise such distractions, as <hi>Celin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
might injoy the advantages of them. But (as I told you, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at that present took not place, and to omit no opportunity, I went
to take leave of the King. and assur'd him, that within fourteen days, I
would either make him absolute Monarch again, or by my death evince
that 'twould not be the defect of my desire, but of my Power; and since
the time was so short, I begg'd him to give me an assurance, that he would
not (before those days were efflux'd) admit of any Treaty with <hi>Celindus.</hi>
The King having satisfy'd my request, embrac'd me very affectionately,
and conjur'd me not to fail at the time appointed, lest the people should
force him to accept of those conditions, his Reason and Inclination made
him equally detest, which having faithfully promis'd, I went to my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
Chamber, who not being able to conceal her grief, had commanded
all her servants out of the room, and lay upon a Bed, abandoning her
self so excessively to sorrow, that I surpriz'd her in the greatest height of
hers, and told her, Madam, if I could admit any doubts of an ill success,
where your safty is concern'd, so bad an Omen as your sadness is would
infuse them into me. To which she answer'd, I must confess, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi>
that when I consider the many dangers you must expose your self unto,
and the many more that you will, I find my Tears so just, that I esteem it
a sin to redeem them, neither can you believe the assurances I have given
you of my affection to be as real as indeed they are, without consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my grief, as a necessary Tribute of my Love, and not an Omen of your
ill success. My Princess (I reply'd) your sadness could not but kill me,
did I not look upon it as the effect of so happy a cause, but pardon me if
my zeal to you be so great, that I even condemn the demonstrations of
my own felicity, when they prove troublesome to you. Alas, said <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera,</hi>
what would you have me do? not to deplore your absence, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with my affection, and to do it, is prejudicial to your content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but since 'tis impossible to suppress the first, at least by a quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
make the last cease, which can admit of no ease, during your absence
Madam (I reply'd) the gods shall be my witness; that I will neglect no
time, nor shall any thing but death hinder me above fourteen days from
coming to adore you at your feet: <hi>Celindus</hi> and his Army shall feel what
fury possesses me at this separation, and my their sufferings know, how
dangerous it is to oppose <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> when <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s safety is the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
But, said the Princess (interrupting me) take heed you do not so
much trust your courage, as not to consult your judgement, and to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
that heat which may prove so fatal to us both, remember that what
<hi>Artavasdes</hi> suffers, <hi>Altezeera</hi> does, and as you love her life, preserve your
own. I should be too prolix my dear <hi>Artabanes,</hi> should I tell you all the
words that sad farewell furnisht me with, I will therefore hasten to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
and onely let you know, that having kist my fair Princess hand,
I took leave of her, and then of <hi>Amidor;</hi> to whom I left the care of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96335:32"/>
                     <hi>Artaxata,</hi> and what I valu'd infinitely above it, and having given a hot
alarm to every quarter of the Camp, but that through which I past, I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in two days after at <hi>Thospia,</hi> where I found <hi>Anexander</hi> in much danger,
by the violence of his Feaver, who haing commanded me to leave the
care of him unto the gods, and to imploy all mine for the Kings deliverance,
I forthwith acquainted the Army with my Commission, who joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me, and lest delays might prove prejudicial, we marched with what
expedition possibly could be made, towards <hi>Artaxata,</hi> and the tenth day
after my departure from thence, I camped thirty Furlongs off <hi>Celindus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Hill, within sight of the Besieged, where having call'd a Council of
War, by their consents, I sent a Trumpet to him with this ensuing chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</p>

                        <p>DId not your taking up of Arms against your King assure me, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there are no gods to punish wickedness; I should despair of your
accepting a pitcht Battel for the ending of the War, lest terrified by the Divine
Iustice, your guilt should weigh down your Sword: but your rebellion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates,
that you believe no Deity but Power, and since your Courage is the
best of your Qualities; I should gladly receive an assurance, that to save many a
thousand lives, you would venture your own against me in a single combat.
But whether by Battel or Duel, I leave it to your choice, either of which shall
be highly acceptable, as an assured way to punish <hi>Celindus,</hi> by the hand of</p>

                     <hi>CElindus</hi> having perus'd my Letter, thought fit to give me Battel,
knowing that his Army could have no Provisions but what they
fought for, and that <hi>Artaxata</hi> had so good a Garrison, and my Forces
were so numerous, that if he defeated not the one, or took the other, he
must in a short while, be blockt up, and then his party which follw'd
his fortune, not him, would desert him; therefore thinking my defeat
would be more facile, than taking the Town by Storm, he sent me this

as you think me the contrary. To morrow by the Suns rising, I shall be in
the adjoyning Plain, at the head of Fifty thousand Men, who are too greedy
of Honour to suffer me by a single Combat, to rob them of their share in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of an entire Victory, which will be as certainly ours, as that you have an

                  <p>THe Trumpet being return'd with this pleasing Answer, I found that
nothing but the gaining of a Battel could more satisfy my Army,
than the assurance of one, which being suddenly to ensue, every one
was employ'd in performing what was fit for so considerable a day, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96335:32"/>
no sooner appear'd, but both Armies marcht out of their several Camps,
and being drawn up, expected onely the signal to begin the Fight: <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindus,</hi>
who knew that his Fortune depended upon the gaining or losing
of that Field, had left no Forces to justify the ground he had won by
approaches, being assur'd, that if he were Conqueror, <hi>Artaxata,</hi> without
the formalities of a Siege, would be one of the first Fruits of his Victory;
yet to delude those of the Town, and to keep them from sallying, he left
as many Colours flying as were usually upon the Guards, with certain
Men well mounted, who had order (in case of a Sally, to run away with
them unto their Army. A little before the Battel, <hi>Celindus</hi> made a Speech
to his Soldiers, and I to animate mine, told them these few words. Friends,
and Companions in Arms, I speak unto you more out of custom than
need; if I thought any thing could raise your courages above that which
nature has, I might represent unto you the justice of the War, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
objects for whom you are now to decide it, your Wives, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and your Liberties, who all expect their settlement from your
Swords: There is something too above all this, which I might mention
(for these must dye with you, sometimes before you) 'tis Honour, which
is eternal, and will make your memories precious to posterity, when other
things will be forgotten, and turn'd into dust. But (my generous Friends)
I see so noble a resolution in every one, that I will no longer detain
you from that Victory, which your Cause and Looks assure me of. These
words being finisht, I advanc'd with the right wing of my Horse, and
so vigorously charged the Enemies left, that we instantly routed them,
and had an Execution as bloudy as their crimes deserv'd: But <hi>Celindus,</hi>
who led the right wing of his Army, wherein he had plac'd the gallantest
of his Cavalry, fell so vigorously upon <hi>Stratolis,</hi> who commanded my left,
that after a small resistance (<hi>Stratolis</hi> being kill'd) <hi>Celindus</hi> made many
others follow his fate, to redress which disorder, I left some few Troops
to chase the scatter'd Rebels, and rallying the rest, ran to the rescue of
my Friends, whom <hi>Celindus</hi> on my approach forsook, and having drawn
up a second time, and learnt that it was I that came to fight with him;
he advanced some hundred paces from his Body, and calling me out by
name, told me, 'Tis now <hi>Artavasdes</hi> that I shall satisfy both your desires,
I have yielded to a Battel, at the requests of my friends, who would not
permit me to ingross that honour to my self, which by their valours,
they were confident would be largely distributed amongst them: and now
I seek a single combat to please my own inclination, to demand satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for <hi>Tuminius</hi> his Blood, and your insolent challenge. We were both
so earnest to lose no time, that we spent no more in words, but began a
Duel, in which the gods so favour'd the justice of my Sword, that <hi>Celin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
fell by it; but those Horse which were spectators of his death, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
endeavour'd to revenge it, that it cost us dear before we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to what their valours merited, but not the quarrel in which
they employ'd them. Whilst these things were thus acting, <hi>Phanasder</hi>
and <hi>Falintus,</hi> who commanded the Foot of both Armies, had not been idle:
but <hi>Falintus,</hi> who was over-power'd, after a vituous resistance, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by <hi>Phanasder,</hi> who, to shelter him from the fury of his Soldiers, had
cover'd him with his own Body, and receiv'd some wounds that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for his prisoner. <hi>Evaxes,</hi> after <hi>Falintus</hi>'s misfortune, still disputed
the victory, though his resistance proceeded more from his resolution than
his numbers, which were so diminish'd, that he was just upon the point of
being conquer'd, when a Body of about Fourteen hundred Horse, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96335:33"/>
Four thousand Foot sallied out of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> and so opportunely on the
Enemy, that it restor'd the courage of our fainting friends. Gods! what
prodigies of Valour did I see their Leader act: He pierc'd the thickest
Squadrons like Lightning, and, in a word, so chang'd the face of affairs,
that <hi>Phanasder,</hi> from conquering began to defend himself; to effect which,
he had gotten near Eight thousand of those who had most resolution, and
having cast them into a square Body, resolv'd to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell his Life so dearly,
that the Purchasers should repent the bargain. In this posture stood affairs
when I came from defeating <hi>Celindus</hi> with nine thousand Horse, and all
the Foot I could possibly rally, I confes, it pitty'd me to see so many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi>
expos'd to death, whose courages deserv'd a fortune as good, as
the condition they were then in, was the contrary, I therefore command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Soldiers of my Army to draw off, that I might endeavour to
save their Countrey-men. So pleasing an Injunction, obtain'd a ready
obedience, and advancing near enough to be heard, I represented to them,
that the care I had to make my Victory as little stain'd with Bloud, as the
necessity of it would permit, made me offer them in <hi>Artabazus</hi> name, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pardon, so they would lay down Arms, and ingage, by their future
Loyalty, to efface their present want of it. They all answer'd me, that
they had vowed their Lives and Fortunes to <hi>Phanasder,</hi> and what he
thought good, they would submit unto. I then desir'd to speak with him,
which he no sooner understood, than he came out unto me, all hideous
with Bloud, and askt me what it was I would have. I told him, 'twas
his, and the safety of those few the Sword had spar'd; That he had practis'd
so much gallantry to <hi>Falintus,</hi> that it made me earnest to preserve the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessior
of it; and that the condition he was in, was so unfit for resistance,
that the acting of his destruction, was easier than the desire of it. I am, said
<hi>Phanasder</hi> (interrupting me) as much above your Power, as your Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening,
for the gods which have been so cruel, have yet left me a Heart
to desire death, and a Sword to act; for that which I have done to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus,</hi>
'twas the self-same honour guided me unto it, which makes me hate
to owe my life unto my Enemy. How willingly (said I) would I change
that name, and be esteem'd your Friend? to purchase it, I will confess, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and your want of it, reduc'd you to what you are. I will engage
my self to obtain for you, and those under you, an <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> from
the King, and I will onely beg that you will confer your friendship on
me, which I will value at a higher rate than all the other Glory I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from this days success. 'Tis a strange thing how much civility works
on a generous Mind; what the advantage I had over him, nor the fear
of death cold act, my kindness did, which prov'd so prevalent, that fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away his Sword, he came to me, and embracing me, said; 'Tis now
indeed <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that I am vanquisht. Your goodness makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that which your Sword, nor all the World besides could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
me to. I should be now as unjust as you are generous; did I not
with joy embrace a Friendship, which I will ever value above all things,
but my Honour. After a thousand Embraces, and Assurances of an Eternal
Friendship, <hi>Phanasder</hi> led me to the reliques of his Army, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to fling their Arms down at my Feet, to whom he said, they owed
their lives, and many other expressions of a quality, too tedious to be
related. Things being brought to this happy period, I left my Army in
the Field, in which they had gained so much Glory, and taking <hi>Phanas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and some twenty of my intimatest Friends, I gallopt to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> to
give <hi>Altezeera</hi> and the King an account of our success, and to receive their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96335:33"/>
Orders; when we came to the Gates I found them shut, and having told
the Guards who I was, they instantly admitted me, and inform'd me,
the King and the Princess were Sacrificing for the Armies success: I went
directly thither, and lighting at the door, all arm'd, sprinkled with
Bloud, gave so hot an Alarm to the people, that they began with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cries, to fly out of the Temple, imagining we were <hi>Celindus</hi>'s Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who having got the Battel, were come to seize upon the King, and
that which more confirm'd them in their fears, was the sight of <hi>Phanasder,</hi>
whose Face, (by the loss of his Helmet) was uncover'd, and the great
shouts those of the Garrison made when they were inform'd, by some that
came along with me, of our Victory. <hi>Artabazus</hi> all the while I was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
towards him, was moveless as a Statue; but the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> no
sooner saw me tread upon the first steps of the Altar, but drawing forth
a Ponyard, which she had conceal'd for a last remedy, was lifting up her
hand to have plung'd it into her Breast: but observing her design, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it by seizing that cruel weapon, and pulling off my Halmet; gods!
what a sudden alteration did that action cause? it was so great, that the
King, <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and all the company hearing at the same time of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s
his defeat, and death, did not then relish that happiness with so high a
contentment, as they said it deserv'd. But at last their joy having dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
those Clouds, which fear had ingender'd, their contentment was
proportionate to the change. <hi>Artabazus</hi> gave me all the testimonies of
his favour he was capable of, but <hi>Altezeera</hi> did in such obliging terms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
her contentment and affection, that I was ravisht in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both. But after I had given the King and my fair Princess an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our success, I presented <hi>Phanasder</hi> unto <hi>Artabazus,</hi> and having
acquainted him with my Engagements, and magnified his Gallantry, I not
onely obtained what I had promis'd to him and his, but also <hi>Celindus</hi> his
Government for him. That which made me so intent on <hi>Phanasders</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
was the high opinion I had conceived of him, and the confidence
I had, that it was grounded on a proportionate Justice. But amongst all
those friends which came to congratulate my Victory, I mist my dear
<hi>Amidor,</hi> and inquiring the cause of it, I learn'd, that the Forces which
had sally'd out of the Town, were under his Command, that 'twas he
had done such miracles, and that probably having follow'd the execution
somewhat vigorously, he was not return'd to the Camp before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from it. I rested satisfied therewith, and receiv'd the Kings Orders
to quarter about <hi>Artaxata,</hi> till he saw whether those Towns which had
declared for <hi>Celindus,</hi> would return to their Loyalty without being forced
unto it: And least any disorder might happen in the Army by my absence,
I was going thither, when (alas) I met my poor Brother, mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
carrying by to his Lodging: so sad an object soon clouded all my
joy, and made me return with him, to know what I might expect of his
fate. The ablest Chirurgeons being sent for, searched his wounds, and
found they were incurable for their Art. But the generous <hi>Amidor</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
by their looks, our fears, seem'd to be as full of satisfaction, as we
were really the contrary, and having conjur'd the Chirugeons to deal
clearly with him, whether there were any likelyhood of recovery, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from them a sad Negative. Then turning towards <hi>Lindesia,</hi> (who
abandon'd her self to an excessive Grief) he begg'd her not to be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for his death, than he was for to dye; That it being a Tribute, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature was to pay, he was happy that it was in so good and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Cause. Then desiring all those that were in the room to leave it,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96335:34"/>
except <hi>Altezeera</hi> (who was come to visit him) and I, he addrest himself
to us with an accent capable to inspire pity into a fury, and told us.
Since my own weakness, as well as the Chirurgeons judgement, assure me
I must dye, I have begg'd this opportunity to reveal a secret to you both,
which no torment should have made me disclose, and which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
my Actions never did. Know then, to silence your sorrow, that these
mortal wounds are the effects of my desire, and not my ill fortune, for it
was necessary for your quiet, as well as mine, that I should receive them,
since I could not resist the inevitable charms of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Beauty: start
not, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> for by that time I have finisht my discourse, you shall
have more cause to pity than condemn me: the highest Powers shall bear
me witness, how much I did resist this criminal passion, how it forc't, not
found an admittance, and when 'twas gotten in, how I purchast its silence
by my torments; yet at last, finding it would be conqueror, I resolv'd to
end my pain by death, which I sought so many several ways, that it must
have been unjust, had I not found it out. You weep, fair Princess, is it for
sorrow, that by dying, I shall be so soon freed from those sufferings my
Crime deserves? the compassionate <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who all this while did melt
away in Tears, perceiving he was silent, in expectation of her Answer,
told him, alas <hi>Amidor,</hi> what actions have I ever committed, that you
should judge me guilty of so high a cruelty? 'Twere more charitable, as
well as just, to attribute these demonstrations of my grief, unto my pity,
for your condition, which so abundantly deserves it. Why then Madam
(reply'd <hi>Amidor</hi>) you can pity me, after the knowledge of my fault?
Great gods! to what misery do you reduce me? thus to convert that which
should be my greatest joy, into my greatest torment, and thereby render
any satisfaction at my death as impossible, as I do ill deserve it; since
not to receive her pardon, makes my death as full of horrors, as the cause
of it is of Beauties; and to obtain it, makes my crime as great, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
against which I have committed it. Ah Madam, dry up those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
drops, or else shed them to wash away my guilt, for certainly they
are powerful enough to perform whatsoever you employ them for; And
you my dear Brother, (addressing himself to me) can you have so much
goodness to forgive your Rival, when 'twas not in his power to avoid that
fatal Name? Look upon those bright Eyes, which certainly will at the
same time that they acquaint you with my fault, acquaint you with the
necessity of it, and obtain your pardon for it. You that know so well
their influence, must withal, rather pity than condemn my submission to
it. But I find death seizing on me; farewel happy Lovers, may Joyes,
such as Raptures never reacht, wait on your Flames, may every thing
contribute to make you as contented as I shall dye, having obtained your
forgiveness, which I beg with Tears; and if they find you inexorable, I
will with Bloud—Alas <hi>Amidor</hi> (I cry'd out) would it were as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
in my Power to recover, as 'tis in my Will to forgive thee. Ah
(said <hi>Amidor</hi>) talk not of recovery, I would rather be my own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
than by living interrupt so pure a Passion; once again farewel,
my summons is so short, I shall have onely time to beg you, never to think
upon <hi>Amidor,</hi> cloath'd in his ambitious desires of possessing so Divine a
Beauty, nor with his unavoidable infidelity to his Friend and Brother;
But when you consider him, let it be in his pennance for his crimes, and
let that voluntary death he has so resolutely expos'd himself unto, obtain
that mercy for him, which he implores with his last breath; and so indeed
it was, for having with one hand, taken the Princesses, and kist it, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96335:34"/>
with the other embrac'd me, his fair Soul fled away, and left its noble
dwelling in our Arms. Who can repeat the sad words so great a loss
extorted from us, which really we found of such a quality, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair'd
to find a cure even from time. The King' and all those that were
not enemies to vertue, did manifest a resembling sorrow, for his Youth was
as promising as it was unfortunate. Here (said <hi>Artabanes</hi> to <hi>Callimachus</hi>)
<hi>Artavasdes</hi> could not resfrain shedding some Tears, and perceiving I took
notice of it; he begg'd my Pardon for so just an effeminacy, and then
hasten'd to a conclusion in these words; <hi>Phanasder,</hi> who did now without
reserve, embrace the Kings interest, was so prevalent with the revolted
Towns, that <hi>Armauria, Artemita,</hi> and <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> it self, came upon their
knees, and yielded up their Keys and Lives to the Kings Mercy, and in a
word all the upper <hi>Armenia,</hi> from <hi>Niphates,</hi> did the like. But in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Armenia, Zenaxtus</hi> (a Brother of <hi>Celindus</hi>'s) kept entire the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Aerethica</hi> and <hi>Horzen,</hi> and the Towns of <hi>Satala,</hi> and <hi>Nicapolis,</hi> who
for all <hi>Artabazus</hi> threatenings and promises, would not lay down Arms,
but was preparing a vast Army to revenge his Brothers death, and to
act his Brothers ambition: which to effect, he sent to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> to invade
the higher <hi>Armenia,</hi> and assur'd him of a considerable Party appearing
for him as soon as he should pass the River <hi>Tygris,</hi> and offer'd him all the
Upper <hi>Armenia</hi> for his share, so that he might have the Lower for his own,
which nevertheless he would do homage for. You know, my dear friend,
that this overture was so listened unto by your King, that instantly he
rais'd that great Army which defeated ours, more by our valour, than
by those that follow'd you. <hi>Artabazus</hi> had some intelligence of <hi>Arsaces</hi>
intentions, and to prevent them, thought fit to raise an Army, and carry
the War into your Countrey, to keep his own quiet, at least, the Upper
part of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and having given the Command of a numerous one to
<hi>Anexander,</hi> who was perfectly recover'd, and order'd him to suppress
<hi>Zenaxtus,</hi> he laid siege to <hi>Myramnes,</hi> where you came to raise it, and where
I had the honour to become your Prisoner, which should be as pleasing to
me as my Liberty, did not my passion for <hi>Altezeera,</hi> make all things that
banish me from her, insupportable.</p>
                  <p>Thus the gallant <hi>Artavasdes</hi> finisht his story, and gave me by it, as much
reason, as I had formerly inclination to love him. After some few expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of my esteem, both of his Passion and Vertue, I told him, 'tis with
much difficulty, (generous Prince) that I condemn the cruelty of my
King, being it furnishes me with an occasion to serve you; neither can you
doubt, but I am more a friend to your satisfaction than my own, when
I deprive my self of so great a blessing as your company, to restore
you to the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s. Your Civility (reply'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) is so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
that I must think any thing a misery, that forces me from being
near the Possessor of it; and do therefore as much resent <hi>Arsaces</hi> injustice
out of that consideration, as commend my good Fortune, for making it
the means of sending me to my Princess. After a Million of inviolable
Vows of Friendship, <hi>Rysolis</hi> came in, to whose immediate care I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> Whom I will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> now leave returning to his happiness, and
continue the Relation of what divested me of mine.</p>
                  <p>The good <hi>Callimachus</hi> was so earnest in his intention, that he would
not so much as, by one word, give him the least interruption; which
<hi>Artabanes</hi> perceiving, he proceeded in the History of his own Life in these
tearms.</p>

                  </gap>osperity, that
it was hardly capable of accession, but by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Diminution; but alas, all those morning
glories were soon clouded: for <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that whereas in other Women, Fancy is the Rule
for Beauty, in her, Judgement was; and where there
were Eyes to see her, there was a Heart to adore her.
In the beginning of my Fortunes, I acquainted you with a Prince of the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> called <hi>Surena,</hi> whose Person, Extraction, and Parts, render'd
him very considerable. This Gentleman one day, saw the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi>
and consequently fell in love with her (for that was an unsever'd effect of
seeing her) and as all things naturally desire their satisfaction, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
so the wound which those fair eyes had made (though unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily)
was too dangerous to delay the cure; he found, after a long
debate, that the Fire was too pleasing to be quencht, that the end was
so inviting, the way could not be the contrary, although none could heal
the wound but she that made it; and to say truth, my Rival had too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
a flame to conceal it long, and thought it was to be unjust unto
himself, to languish without acquainting the Author of his Torments with
them, who perhaps, might be as willing to ease him, as he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of the contrary. This resolution once assum'd, he conveys a Letter
one evening into <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Night-cloaths (but by what Art I could
not then imagine) pre-supposing she would perceive it there, and so out
of curiosity read it. That which made <hi>Surena</hi> hasten this Essay, was, That
the next morning <hi>Lindadory</hi> being to Hunt a wild Bore, to sacrifice it to
<hi>Ceres,</hi> as an Annual Duty, and having learnt <hi>Parthenissa</hi> would accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
her, he imagin'd, that during the Chase, he might discover what effect
his Letter had produc'd; for not having the happiness to be known to
her, he could take no just pretence, to be inform'd of it at her own house.</p>
               <p>The morning destin'd for Hunting being come, and she intending to
honour my Sister with her company, I went to wait upon her to Court,
and coming something early, I found her not drest; it happen'd too,
that when I came in, <hi>Zianthe,</hi> that waited on <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and who was
the onely Confident in her Amours, was gone out about some occasion;
and my Princess uncovering her Night-Linnen, I perceiv'd <hi>Surena</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but not knowing what it was, I told her (Laughing) I see Madam,
you have a Servant, besides <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that dares declare he adores you;
for by the place you think fit to give that Paper, I cannot but imagine
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96335:35"/>
'tis sent from some body that has a Passion for you. <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who
thought it had been some Verses I had made, and hidden there purposely,
told me, smiling, I renounce all Servants but <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and to shew you
I am real in what I say, I give you leave to unseal the Letter, and conjure
you to read it aloud. And I, conceiving it had been somewhat of Raillery
open'd it, and read these ensuing words.<floatingText type="letter">

Letter a lesser crime, than by an unlicens'd death, to have depriv'd you of your

reject the faithfullest Heart that ever Love did yet inspire, I shall receive it as

               <p>O gods! if Thunder had fallen at my feet, my amazement had been far
short of what it was at the ending of this Letter, and if silence had been a
sign of guilt, I might have thought <hi>Parthenissa</hi> capable of it: For my part
I knew not what to say, to suspect her constancy was a crime too great to
enter into my thoughts, and how that Letter was brought in the place I
found it, I could as little imagine, but lest my silence might breed in her,
a sinister opinion of my belief, I told her. Madam, I hope this experiment
will make you acknowledge, that my saying, I had as many Rivals, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
of you, was rather a Truth than any thing else. I must confess,
she answer'd, I had rather believ'd you than have had this witness brought
to convince me; but that Truth cannot be greater than my admiration,
how this Letter came hither, unless for your diversion you writ it your
self, and fixt a name to it, which I believe as little dreams of Love for
me, as I do to confer mine on him: And therefore, I beseech you <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,</hi>
rid me of the trouble I am in, by telling me the truth. Madam (I
reply'd) by the respect I owe you, I neither writ the Letter, nor ever
saw it till now, but I do know the Hand to be <hi>Surena</hi>'s. Upon this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
I saw her put on a more serious countenance, and having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
silent a while, she told me, I was, till now, confident, <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that
you should need no other way to reap my Heart, than by my Actions:
but now I fear, to continue me in your good opinion, I must make use of
Vows, and consequently owe that to your goodness, which I assur'd to
my self always to obtain from your Justice. Therefore I swear by all that
is most holy, and by our endless Passions, I never knew that <hi>Surena</hi> lov'd
me, nor can fancy how this Letter came to my hands; besides these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, you may imagine, if I had had the perfidious design of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any addresses but yours, I would never have disclos'd it my self.
I had not the patience to hear her further, and begging her pardon for it,
I reply'd, Ah Madam, what do you mean, you could not use me thus,
but by esteeming me guilty of believing you unconstant; for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you now impose on me, is too great for any other crime: when
you would raise my Faith to credit any thing you speak, if you make
use of Vows, or imagine there can be a higher reason to induce my belief,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96335:36"/>
than your commanding it, you do me as great an injury, as I should do
your Virtue, or my own Felicity, could I think you capable of change;
neither can I be more certain that your eyes conquer whosoever they
look upon, than I am, that your generous Mind despises every Victory,
but that over the too too happy <hi>Artabanes.</hi> Truly (said she) if there be
an obligation in doing Justice, I now received one from you, and must
increase the score, by beseeching your advice, how to suppress this
growing flame, with such secresie, that none may know it liv'd, but
we that know 'tis dead; for if I do not answer him, he may feed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with hope; and if I do, I then acquaint him that I know his Passion,
and though my return be never so cold, he may impute it to a wrong
cause, and so that which we elect for the extinction of his Passion, may
prove the nouriture. As I was about to answer her, <hi>Zianthe</hi> came in, of whom
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> ask'd very strictly, how that Letter came, where 'twas found,
who seem'd to wonder at the accident, as much as we, and upon her as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of endeavouring to discover the Actor, we gave over any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquiry of it, and apply'd our selves, how to remedy the business,
and to ease the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> of it; I undertook so to manage this new
Love, as I would free her from any future trouble by it. <hi>Zianthe,</hi> who
imagin'd I would elect that course, which all Rivals use, to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of their competitors, presently told her softly, that she foresaw I
would decide this difference by a Duel, which could not but be fatal
to her, which soever way Fortune inclin'd: For if <hi>Artabanes</hi> prov'd victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
the strict inhibitions the King had so often reiterated against Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
(though it were his own Son that fought them) and the powerful
prosecution of <hi>Surenas</hi>'s Friends, will, if he escape not the hands of Justice,
assuredly bring his Head upon the Scaffold; or if he do, then a perpetual
banishment will inevitably follow, and you must not expect, that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first Prince of the Blood, will be any Title to hope for a sparing
of his; on the other side, if <hi>Surena</hi>'s Sword prove victorious, you cannot
any way fancy the greatness of your grief, but by comparing it to that of
your loss, and which soever way the chance does fall, you must come
upon the Stage, and then you are at the mercy of any that will blemish
your Reputation, which though unjustly taxed, is of so pure a tincture,
the stain will never be effac'd. These reasons of <hi>Zianthe</hi>'s, and many others
of the like quality, were so prevalent with <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> that she came to
me, and conjur'd me by the strictest tyes she could invent, not to take
any notice to <hi>Surena</hi> of his Letter, which if I did, she would esteem it as
an argument I suspected her constancy needed my help, and she ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
I should derive the entire possession of her Affection, onely from
Her, and not from my Sword: Besides (she continued) what greater
punishment can you inflict upon your Rival, than to see him deny'd
what you so absolutely possess; and if his Perseverance be great, my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
shall not be inferior to it, which will render him an object fitter for
pity, than your hatred. Many other reasons she alledg'd, and after all
she would not quit her Chamber, till I had faithfully promis'd to obey
her. Immediately after we went to prosecute our intended sport. That day
<hi>Surena</hi> seem'd to accompany the Prince <hi>Phraates,</hi> but it was indeed, to wait
an occasion, to know what effect his Letter had produc'd. The assurance
I had in <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Vertue and Affection, made me further all I could,
my Rivals designe, that she might find my confidence was more in her,
than in my self. But I easily saw, that <hi>Surena</hi> did not more endeavour to
meet her, than she to avoid him, yet at last in a narrow lane, where 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96335:36"/>
to do so any longer, I saw him fall into discourse with her, but
being at too great a distance, I could not hear it, yet I perceived by some
passionate gestures, he was very earnest in what he said, but after a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hours time, the company parted them, and I easily read in his
looks his success. The Sun by his declining, warn'd the Hunters to retire,
and <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> accompanying my Sister to her Lodgings, begg'd her,
that we might be private, and then having acquainted her with my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
Letter, she told me, You remember <hi>Artabanes,</hi> the long narrow lane
we rid through, it was there where <hi>Surena</hi> overtook me, and if he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any pleasure from his entertainment, he owed it not to my inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but my necessity. After a few indifferent discourses, he told me,
with some disorder, I perceive, Madam, by your shunning of me, that my
Letter, which declared my Passion, is fallen into your hands, and I now
find my apprehensions were not unjustly grounded. Sir, (said I) I must
confess this morning I found a Letter in my Chamber, which I burnt, if
it were, as you say, a declaration of your passion, would that were also
reduc'd to that nothing the Paper is. Ah Madam (he reply'd) can you
be so resembling to the gods in Beauty, and not in disposition? for they
are never offended with a Heart which does adore them with that devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which mine does you: if it be a crime for me to love you, then it is a
sin for you to be so lovely: and if my Flame be an offence, you must quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with your perfections, which are the causes of it. If your Passion (I
reply'd) be so great as you say it is, I must then believe your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not your judgement, attributes those perfections to me which has
rais'd it, for Beauty being but Fancy, you may perswade those, which
otherwise would tax your choice, that you pereive as many perfections
in me, as I know I want, but lest your affection may prove a deceitful
optick, my Charity shall put you in the right way, which is to decline
your addresses to me, for besides my great want of merit, I am as rigid as
the perfectest of my Sex, therefore, I beseech you, owe this cure to your
Reason, and not to Time. Madam (he answer'd) 'tis Reason gave the
wound, and neither Time nor your Disdain, shall ever make me alter the
resolution I have so justly assum'd, you may as easily hope to separate Light
from the Sun, as my Heart from that Passion which possesses it: no, fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa,</hi>
I am resolv'd, if I cannot be Loves Favourite, I will be his
Martyr, and if your Scorns cannot extinguish my Desires, the coldness
of the Grave shall never triumph over them, but the gods will preserve
so pure a Flame a live, to be a pattern for future Lovers to imitate. Sir,
(said I) so much affection deserves all that I can return, which is my
Friendship, and that again conjures you not to cast away so noble a
Passion on one that must be necessarily ungrateful, for that which
you desire I have given to another, and were it in my Power to recall it,
it is not in my Will. I hope this will shew you with how much justice I
intreat you not to ingage your self in so ruinous a design, for should I
now confer on you my Love, and you receive it, your indiscretion will be
as great as you would perswade me your passion is, for my constancy, (the
cause of your contentment) would be always the occasion of your fear. Ah
Madam (he reply'd) would to the gods you were but yet pleased to bless
me with your Affection, for then the joy would be so absolute, that I should
onely have the Power to contemplate it, and not how I came to the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. But Madam, I am too bold to hope for any pleasing answer,
till my Services assure the vastness of my Passion. I bless this hour,
that gave me opportunity of telling you of it, and that your Rigor
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96335:37"/>
cannot be greater than my perseverance. Thereupon (without sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
for an answer) he went away; But I impute those words (she continu'd)
to the first flame of Love, which commonly is the most violent: For my
part, I am resolv'd to wear so much coldness on those actions which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to him, that if he have that spirit men believe, I am confident 'twill
change his love into resentment. Madam (my sister reply'd) I foresee
many sad accidents will oppose your loves, if by a speedy overture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your friends you do not consummate a Nuptial; What should divert
you from that election? Your Flames are too virtuous and too just not
to be owned; and being so, who will oppose them; this declaration will
silence all Rivals growing Loves, and make your happiness as sure as 'twill
be great. Ah Sister (I answer'd) 'tis true, our Passions are so pure,
they know not a comparison; but yet my Father (whose commands I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
last night) will, I am fearful, resist this vast felicity; for as soon
as I had left you, he sent for me to wait on him, which I did, and
after he had walked two or three turns without speaking one word, he
at last told me: <hi>Artabanes,</hi> The gods having given me the blessings of a
son, I have found so high an one in it, that I shall enjoin you to endeavor
to partake of the like contentment; I should think my death as full of
contentment as my life has been of honor, could I see you matcht in
a Family that might assure me you should have a successor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ours: To effect this has been long my care, and never till now
could accomplish it: It is but lately I had a motion made me, which I
much approve; 'tis the Princess <hi>Zephalinda (Surena's</hi> Sister) whose Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
Beauty, Person, and Blood, assures me you will think your self highly
satisfi'd with such a Marriage, at least I shall be. I must confess this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
did infinitely surprize me; but least he should guess the true
cause of my astonishment, I told him: In the first place Sir, as I cannot
but return my humble thanks for your care, so I must not but acquaint
you, that I am not ignorant of how high a concernment Marriage is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happiness or misery, till death dissolves the knot; and since Felicity
is onely opinion, there is none can prescribe positive rules for the making
it; but every man must be his own judge; contentment something resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
mens tastes; that which is pleasing to one, to another may be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The consequence being so great, and the choice not to be made by
Proxy, I shall beseech you give me leave to learn whether that Princess
be possessor of such perfectious as may assure me of such happiness: this
nothing but time can do; and if she appears not such to me as she does
to you, I will then acquaint you with it, and hope you will not compel
me to make her and my self miserable. As I am (said he) <hi>Artabanes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to you, so I expect that you be obedient unto me; and then
he withdrew himself into his Closet. This was the substance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
and my return to it, for I did not hold it fit to acquaint him with my
Passion till first we had advis'd together: for I perceiv'd by his last words
how his inclination stood, and I too well knew how difficult he is to be
removed when he has once taken up a resolution not to be so. Then I
besought <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to honor me with her advice, since I had put all that
was dear unto me to her ordering. To which she told me. <hi>Moneses</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
(which I am absolutely ignorant of) being the chief thing in this
affair, by which we are to be guided, makes me as unfit to advise; as
your knowledge of it renders you most capable. Madam, (I reply'd)
that my Father is resolv'd to be obey'd is not more certain, than that I
am determin'd the contrary, for in this case obedience is a crime, so that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96335:37"/>
the end being now resolv'd, we have nothing to advise upon but the
means that may best conduce unto it. Which in my opinion Madam (said
<hi>Lindadory</hi>) is, that <hi>Artabanes,</hi> make some seeming addresses to <hi>Zephalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
(for <hi>Moneses</hi> is sooner vanquish'd by yielding than resistance)
and doubtless she cannot be so perfect (especially being compar'd with
the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) but he may find some defect in her person or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which may make his declining her appear an effect of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not disobedience: for if my Father find his refusal of serving her,
roceeds from his being possest with a Passion for another, he will impute
my Brothers deserting <hi>Zephalinda</hi> to his Pre-ingagement; and then I am
so well acquainted with his disposition, that it will be impossible to alter
it. Thus by concealing your Flames a little longer, you may attain that
happiness which by a speedy declaring of them, may receive many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
if not an absolute ruine. Madam (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dory</hi>)
I much apprehend if <hi>Artabanes</hi> can have no other inducements to
obtain <hi>Moneses</hi>'s permission of declining <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and making his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to me, than her imperfections, and my having none, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
may be justly reverted by your Father, who may more aptly apply
that to <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> which your goodness confers on me. My Princess (I
reply'd) there could be no greater joy befall me than that <hi>Moneses</hi> were
to consider both with the eyes of justice, and that I were to possess his
election, you will then quickly find how injurious to your self modesty
has been, and how vast a felicity his judgement will confer on me. I
have (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) so good an opinion of yours, that I will banish
those apprehensions the knowledge of my own defects do raise in me;
and they being supprest, I have nothing to say against the fair <hi>Lindadory's</hi>
advice. 'Tis not enough (I reply'd) that you have nothing to say against
it, but if you will have it observ'd (Madam) you must strictly enjoin it
me, for I have so great a reluctancy to that action, that it must be some
powerfull Charm as your Commands which can make me undertake it.
Since (reply'd <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) the performance is so necessary, and that you
assure me the onely means that must enable you to do it, is my Commands,
I do enjoin you it, but my affections make me (I fear) uncharitable
to <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> by wishing, you may quickly find as many defects in her,
as I desire perfections to merit your esteem. Madam (I reply'd) the
first of your wishes is as unnecessary as the last; for when <hi>Zephalinda</hi> is
to be paralell'd to you, it would be as difficult to find no imperfections in
her, as to find any in you. Having taken this resolution, I began to apply my
self to put it in practice; and that which gave me some probability of its suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was, that <hi>Zephalinda</hi> had as much aversion to Love, as Beauty to create
it. The first addresses I made her, were receiv'd with a coldness proportionate
to her practice and my desires. But I must confess, I contributed as much
as I could to it, and apprehended nothing so much, as that which most
men in <hi>Parthia</hi> would have esteem'd their highest Felicity. I know not
whether that which I intended as the means to want her affection, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it: for I have been told, that some Women, where they find but an
indifferency, make it their design to bring it to an extreme; and so mens
coldness does often ingender their Flame: But whatsoever was the cause,
I began too soon to perceive that which I too much fear'd; and knowing
now she once honor'd me with her affection, it would be difficult if not
impossible any longer to conceal mine; I resolv'd forthwith to acquaint
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> with it, who I found exceedingly satisfied with the ingenuity
of my proceeding, and by the greatness of her contentment for an action
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96335:38"/>
she could but in justice expect; I somewhat believ'd she had a diffidence,
whether that which was begun as a pretence, were not turn'd into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality;
having once taken up this opinion, I cast out some words which
might give her a rise to conceive it, and she who had as piercing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
as any Creature was capable of, soon conceiv'd my suspitions,
and as readily acknowledg'd the justice of them, but with words so apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appropriated to her design, that she made that little jealousie the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
obligation she could place on me, as proceeding from a proportionate
Passion: and to say truth, <hi>Zephalinda</hi> was capable of shaking a constancy
less firm than mine; for besides her Beanty, which was fitter for wonder
than description, she had a freeness and a grace in all her action, peculiar
to herself, and surpast by none but <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> her wit and virtue were
resembling unto all her other qualities, and (in a word) she enjoy'd so
many perfections, that had I not been prepossest with a former Passion, I
had esteem'd hers as great a happiness as I then thought it a misfortune.
But perceiving by <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> words, that she had contracted some little
diffidence of me, and knowing that where there is once a jealousie, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing contributes to the growth of it; I told her, Madam, since I
find, that there may be an ill construction made of that which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
but by your commands, I am resolv'd with your permission (which
I humbly beg) to take away all occasion of such a misfortune; for being
innocent I would not look like guilty. The way, Madam, which I would
propound, is, freely to acquaint <hi>Zephalinda</hi> with our Passions; and truly
I have discover'd so much virtue and discretion in her since my feign'd
addresses, that my duty to them, if not you, would confine me to this;
and which proceeding will not onely take off her resentment for what
is past, but invite her assistance in the future, and that in my opinion
can in no way be so effectually done, as by obtaining from her to use me
with a disdain so unsufferable that my declining her may appear as just
to my Father as it will be necessary to me. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> would not grant
my desire, till first she had received reiterated assurances from me, that
I made it, not to satisfie her suspition, which my expressions had not done
sufficiently, but as I held it a justice to <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and the best way in
order to our affairs. This was no sooner fixt upon, than I apply'd my
self to out an opportunity to act it: and not many dayes after, I lighted
upon one, such as I desir'd; for going to wait upon <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> I found
her alone in her Closet, where (having shut the door) I flung my self at
her feet, and told her, Madam, I know not with what face I shall disclose
a secret to you, neither do I well know how I can longer conceal it: Your
goodness makes me desire to tell it, and the same goodness makes me a
asham'd to do so; but since persevering in my crime, will make the mercy
I beg of you an injustice, I will no longer conceal it. 'Tis Madam, though
I have made my addresses unto you, I have given my heart and liberty
to <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> I was forc'd to this crime to obey <hi>Moneses,</hi> and disguise
a Passion as great as the offence by which I did so; but that which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extenuates my sin is, that as soon as I had the honor to know you,
I made my self known unto you, and as a testimony of the high and just
opinion I have of your virtue, the same instant in which I declar'd I have
injur'd you, I trust you with the power to punish it; my ignorance of
you made me commit my crime, and my knowledge of you makes my
pennance, which I am confident is more severe than your justice can be.
The gods shall bear me witness, had I not been preingag'd, I should have
implor'd the joy of your affection with raptures as worthy the felicity,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96335:38"/>
and I do ill deserve it; but since it was otherwise destin'd, give me
leave to conjure you to convert your affection into friendship; I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of that, though not worthy of it; and since I cannot give you
the first place in my heart, permit me to give you an equal one in my
esteem: This Madam is the condition, and this is the request of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Artabanes;</hi> who can hardly have the confidence to beg your pardon,
because he knows himself unworthy of it; and having so highly wrong'd
your goodness, must not expect that for his satisfaction you will wrong
your justice. Though I know this discourse did trouble her, yet she
conceal'd hers with so much art, that I almost doubted what I was
certain of; but judging by my silence that I expected an answer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me, she would not give i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> till I were risen, in which I obey'd her,
and then she told me, That you have obtain'd a Mistress, <hi>Artaban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> more
worthy of you than I am, shall always be my satisfaction, and not my
trouble; if I have receiv'd your counterfeit Flame, 'twas because you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me it would create your felicity; and if I paid you a reall one, 'twas
a duty to your merit; but since I lov'd you more than my self, and that
the declining of my affection will be more pleasing than the continuance;
the same consideration which made me give it you, will reduce me to
recall it, yet I could wish you had never rais'd it, or that you had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
some other cure for its suppression; but I hope I shall be so much
Mistress of my inclinations, as if they have an existence, yet they shall be
invisible; and if they must trouble any, it shall be <hi>Zephalinda</hi> onely,
Who believing your professions before her no title to them, too soon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
a hope of that, which 'twere an injustice to confer upon her:
for that friendship which you beg, it shall be pay'd you, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and zeal worthy the object; and I will value yours at so high a
rate, that I shall esteem it almost a sufficient reparation for that pleasing
happiness you have robb'd me of. Ah! Madam (I reply'd) can you so
soon pardon, and so soon oblige? Will you then allow no interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
my fault and your reward? If any thing could make me think my
being <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> misfortune this would; but my condition is such, that
the breath I should spend in the expressions of my gratitude, I must employ
in begging you to increase the causes of it; 'tis Madam, that you would
henceforth use me in publick with your highest scorn; This my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
and your resentment may quickly lead you to; and upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
my future joy; but if you should entertain me so in private, 'twould
blast all my happiness, and destroy what it should build; for by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your virtues, I find your friendship is as necessary to my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> love. I know not (said <hi>Zephalinda</hi>) to what intent
you mean this; but if it be to delude the World, the action will be so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to my inclination, that my ill counterfeiting will reveal what you
would strive to hinder. Then (I reply'd) I am undone, and to make my
ruine more sensible, 'tis by the greatest virtue that ever was possest: but
even now I suspected your resentment would ruine me, now I find your
goodness will: for justice to condemn is common, but for friendship to
destroy, is a fate onely fit for the crime of <hi>Artabanes,</hi> who is so unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that virtue loses its nature where he is concern'd. <hi>Zephalinda</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
perplext to see me in so great a trouble, told me, if by any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mine I may convert your disorder into as great a joy, assure your
self <hi>Artabanes,</hi> I will force my inclination to an obeying of you, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an impossibility shall hinder me from it; therefore I conjure you
acquaint me for what great advantage you would imploy my friendship,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96335:39"/>
in a thing so inconsistent with it. Madam (said I) my Father, who knows
your merit, has so strictly enjoyn'd me to serve you, that if by any
fault of mine I should decline adoring you, I must expect all that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
can inflict on me, and lose the hopes of possessing <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
by his consent: your scorn may make the discontinuance of my addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to you appear a kind of justice to him, and so incline him to listen
to my making them to <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> You see by this how much I am
therein concern'd, and by it too, how much I do respect you, for sooner
than the world should say I forsook the fair <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> I had rather give
it so strong a testimony of my unworthiness, as her neglect. Alas <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
(she answer'd) I had rather the world should think you just by
deserting me, than give it so infallible an argument of my want of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as to decline your Passion; but since your happiness depends so
much upon my counterfeiting scorn, I will endeavor to build your joy by
the ruine of my own, and care not what men do think of me, so you
thereby obtain the happy <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> Judge Sir! if ever there were
a higher generosity than this of <hi>Zephalinda's:</hi> instead of revenging an
injury, she pardons it, instead of punishing an offender she obliges him,
and so much to her own prejudice, that to establish her Rivals content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
she ruines (by her confession) her own. I must confess her virtue
had so great an ascendant over me, that I had almost deplor'd the hopes
of my own felicity, since they were so likely to ruine those of hers. You
may easily guess, I left her with as high a satisfaction of her virtue as I
was troubl'd at the necessity of being ungrateful to it. As soon as I came
to <hi>Parthenissa</hi> I gave her by my relation so just a cause of affection to <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalinda,</hi>
that from that hour she vow'd her the second place in hers.
and in process of time, they contracted so firm a friendship, that though
her Brother were highly concern'd in the breaking off <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and mine, yet she was not onely our Confident but our Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and discharg'd both with such secrecy and judgement, that we knew
not which was most meritorious. But this friendship could hardly be
greater than that which <hi>Arsaces</hi> had for <hi>Surena,</hi> which did every day so
clearly manifest it self, that the Courtiers ador'd him as the rising Sun,
and found the onely way to obtain any thing from the King, was
to be promis'd it by his favorite, who truly (setting the imperiousness
of his humour aside) which doubtless he had whilst he courted the Kings
favour, he had charms hardly to be resisted: Neither could <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Brother be greater, than the scorns I receiv'd in publick
were from the Sister, which at first she personated so well, that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
often to wait upon her in private, to learn whether that which we
design'd for a fiction were not metamorphos'd into its contrary; but at
last she acted them as a task, and so constrain'd, that her behaviour seem'd
to condemn me of that unkindness which her modesty would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her words to do. But one evening I receiv'd a testimony of her
friendship proportionate to that Character she had given me of it; 'Twas
a little note which she convey'd into my hand, and though many were
present, yet it was so artificially that 'twas impossible any could take
notice of it. The words were these:</p>

one, for whom you have none. You had best therefore suddenly break off the
false, and manifest the true Flame; before <hi>Arsaces</hi> appear too openly for your
Rival, who then may look on your affection, as a contempt to his authority.
Tell me <hi>Artabanes,</hi> does not the betraying of a Brother, the advancing of my
Rivals, and the ruining of my own hopes, at least, deserve your friendship, and
yet that is all I demand, since the impossibility of expecting more, would be as
great, as the sin of doing so.</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>AS soon as I had done reading these few lines, I communicated them
to my Princess, who did not onely much approve of the advice,
but more of the gallantry of her that gave it. The same night I waited
upon <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and taking an opportunity, I made her <hi>Parthenissa's,</hi>
and my own retributions, for so unimitable a friendship; but time being
exceeding precious, and there being then with <hi>Zephalinda, Surena, Silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Lindadory, Parthenissa,</hi> and many others, the chiefest of the Court,
I resolv'd no longer to delay that which was design'd between us, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
privately advertis'd <hi>Zephalinda</hi> of my intention, I began a discourse
of the importunity of Lovers, as a Rise to effect it; The subject was so
copious, that there wanted no matter of entertainment, but that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon most, was occasion'd by <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s saying, that she admir'd
at those, who when their Mistresses declar'd they could not love them,
would yet continue their loves: as if importunity could ingender Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
To which <hi>Surena,</hi> as believing himself most concern'd, reply'd: I
should (Sister) have an ill opinion of that General, who designing to
take a Town, would, upon its refusal to yield at the summoning, raise
his Camp, and march away: 'Tis just so in this case, what our desires can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perform, perseverance must, and since modesty and practice does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Women at first to deny their Servants, 'twould be a great want of
discretion to take that for their disdain, which is but their Passion. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(said I) there may be something more added in this particular, for
since by daily experience we find, that a high Passion ingenders a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
Scorn, the first giving the Power, if not the Cause unto the
last, why may not we as well expect that an opportunity may beget an
affection, the difference being but equally great? That which you say
(answer'd <hi>Zephalinda</hi>) is a clear mistake, for certainly never any Woman
hated a Man for loving her, but she having some aversion to the person,
he imputes it to his Flame; but to that which my Brother says, I must
confess I think it a madness, where there is an affection to abandon it upon
the first refusal, but sometimes Men are apt to give our bashfulness a
longer being, than indeed it has, and have so good an opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they often call that which is our aversion, our modesty, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96335:40"/>
by making us better natur'd than we are, trouble themselves more than
they should: for my part, I would deal ingeniously with my Lovers (if
I had any) and tell them what is modesty; and what is aversion, that they
may owe their suffering to themselves, and not to me, for I think it a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to make Mens Torments the witnesses of my Beauty. I must confess,
Madam (I reply'd) if all your Sex would practice what you declare, we
should have as much cause to admire their goodness, as their beauties, but
that which deludes many, is, that some Women have hated two or three
years, sometimes more, and then at last have loved those, whom they so
long slighted; and though examples of this quality be very rare, yet some
proving the possibility of it, every one flatters himself with a belief it
may be his fate; just as in War, where though but one amongst a hundred
thousand raises himself from a common Soldier to a General, yet the
success of that one, does raise more expectations, than the miscarriages
of so many others doe deject. Besides Madam (said <hi>Sillaces</hi>) other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whose beauties have not charms so strong, but their Rigor may prove
their Lovers cure, do often hold on their Servants by expectation, and so
by Art supply the unkindness of Nature, but where so many perfections
reign, as you are Mistress of, that declaration which you would have pass
as an excess of goodness (and perhaps mean it so) may appear as high a
mark of your power; for knowing your servants to be surely charm'd,
you may well advise them to assume their liberty, and they be no more
oblig'd to you for it, than when a Gally-slave is bid by his Keeper to get
free, and yet is still kept fast in Chains. I should too much trespass on your
patience, did I tell you all the particulars of that entertainment, I will
therefore onely acquaint you, that some words were spoken, which gave
me a fit opportunity to beg <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> that since she had made a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of dealing clearly with her Servants, in what related to her reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
concerning them, she would give me my sentence, by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me what return that Passion, I so justly paid her, might expect. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Artabanes</hi> (she answer'd with a gesture as full of disdain in appearance,
as it was obliging in effect) I thought my actions would have exempted
my words from that trouble, but since you will have it in as much plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as reality, you must know, I cannot receive your passion, but if my
saying will be a diminution of your grief, that it proceeds not from any
defect in you, or from any aversion to you in particular, but out of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
aversion to Love, I may very truly profess it. Ah Madam, (I reply'd)
you are cruel in thinking to be merciful, and at once load me with so much
misery, that I must sink under the burthen: You should have prepar'd me
by degrees for my ruine, and thereby have lessen'd it, at least of one misery,
which is the suddenness and unexpectedness of it: But Madam, do not think
that my discontent is of so mean a nature, that the consideration of the cause,
can lessen the effect: No, fair <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> that with which you would console
me, does but augment my Torments, for had you been capable of Love,
I should by Zeal and Sufferings have had some expectation to have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
yours, but this general hatred to the sweetest Passion, cuts off all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and leaves me as full of misery, as my ambition for so high a
flame can merit: but Madam, may not I fear some conceal'd love is the
cause of this cruelty, or that some happier, or more deserving Man,
may make you alter this ruinous resolution? Neither of both (said <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalinda</hi>)
I attest the higher Powers, that were I to have any man, it
should be <hi>Artabanes,</hi> but not having him, I vow by the domestick gods,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96335:40"/>
that listen to my oath, never to marry any other, and I conjure you by
your own quiet as well as mine, to speak to me no more of Love, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
for me any, lest you force me to that aversion for you, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but your perseverance can render legitimate; carry that noble
Flame unto some other object, whose antipathy to Love may not so
blind her Judgement, as to refuse your Passion, which I shall pray may
be successful, and that your Felicity may be equal to your merit; But
if instead of my affection, you will receive my friendship, I do ingage
my self to pay it you, and shall endeavour by the perfectness of that,
to repair the deficiency of the other. Ah Madam (I reply'd) all the
consolation you then give me, is, that every one that dares offer you
his Heart; shall be cloath'd in my Livery: but to make my torment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
my sufferings proceed from one that at the same instant in which
she professes her self my friend, ruines me; yet I shall strive by my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
to manifest how ill I did deserve my misfortune, and since ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my self perfectly wretched, must be an argument of that Truth, I
attest the self-same Powers, which even now you invok'd, never to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
you any more with my Passion; but by silencing or transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it unto some other object, take from us both the trouble, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of it would create: but the high honor of your friendship I
embrace with a joy proportionate to the vastness of the benefit, and will
pay you mine, with a constancy, as great as you assure me your aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is to love. Who could express the astonishment of <hi>Surena,</hi> at this
profession? his endeavours truly were so pressing, to alter his Sisters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
that it sufficiently revealed his concern in it; but all was in
vain, for after those protestations, we remain'd unchangeable. This busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thus handled, was, for a good while, the entertainment of the
Court, and made <hi>Surena</hi> so to hasten <hi>Arsaces</hi> to appear for him, that
though an unexpected accident fell out, which much contributed to the
publique, declaring my self a Servant to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> yet before I could
effect it, <hi>Surena</hi> obtain'd from the King a visit to her in his favour, which
did exceedingly perplex our affairs, and forc'd me to mannage my
Flame with as secresie a troublesome as great; but that which I told
you, did so much advance my being at liberty to profess my Passion
to my Princess, was, that my Father, either out of the knowledge of
the World, and consequently of the emptiness of it, or else not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to see <hi>Surena</hi> in higher Power than himself, forsook the
Court, and resigning up his Estate and Offices to me, retir'd into a
Solitude, where under a seeming banishment from all Earthly Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he more perfectly enjoyed them, and either out of a dis-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to <hi>Surena,</hi> or out of his indulgence to me, he gave me the
free Election of my Mistriss, and then (as I told you) withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from those cares, which take away the relish of all our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But <hi>Moneses</hi> could not more contemn the vanities of the
Court, than <hi>Surena</hi> was in love with them, he had nothing but
succeeded as he desir'd, unless it were his Passion, in which (though he
neglected no opportunity, nor omitted to make use of his Masters Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
his progress was so slow, that it clouded all his other pleasures;
and by his daily frequentation of <hi>Parthenissa</hi> discovering new charms,
it made his misfortune the more unsupportable; For my part, though
I had those publique advantages of entertaining her freely, and the Kings
Power and Countenance to second my addresses, yet in those happy
days I receiv'd in private so many fresh assurances of my Princesses af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96335:41"/>
and constancy, that I could hardly wish my Rival a greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
than the continuance of his. In this condition I was, when Fortune
began to declare an irreconcileable hatred to me, in which she has been
so firm, that I admire from whence she has merited the name of Inconstant.
The Province of <hi>Tabiena,</hi> one of the most considerable ones of <hi>Parthia,</hi>
generally revolted, and the Rebels having, in a pitcht Battel, defeated the
Kings Lieutenant, and kill'd 10000 upon the place, so exasperated <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
that he rais'd an Army of 80000 Men, to vindicate this disgrace, and till
it was upon its march, never would declare who should be General; but
then with a high obligingness, he told me, that he had made choice of me,
as well to follow his Inclination as Judgement, that I must perform Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
onely to justify the opinion he had of me, and that the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the dawn of day, as I valu'd his service, I was to repair unto my
Command. I must confess I was surpriz'd, both at the thing, and at the
suddenness of it, but since 'twas the way to serve my Prince, and to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I supprest all those troubles which my separation from <hi>Parthenissa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to create, and having with an humility sutable to the obligation,
accepted the Kings Commission, I went that evening to kiss the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>'s
hands, and to offer up those sighs, which that sad departure so
justly exacted; but not finding her within, I expected her return, and till
then, I entertain'd <hi>Zianthe,</hi> my Princesses Favourite, who after some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
drawing her Handkerchief, let fall a Letter out of her pocket, and
perceiving it seal'd, I snatcht it up, more out of curiosity, than any other
design, as soon as she saw I had it, she begg'd me with so much earnestness,
and in such pressing terms to restore it, that I began to suspect it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of concernment, and finding the Superscription a Cypher onely, I
broke open the Letter, thinking it had been some private Amours of hers;
but alas,, soon found it was <hi>Surenas</hi> Hand, which <hi>Zianthe</hi> imagining by
my amazement, she gave a great shreek, and flinging her self at my feet;
with her hands held up, conjur'd me to restore, and not read it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thrust on by my ill Fate, I kept her off, and read these words;</p>

               <p>Oh gods! how many thousand distractions did the reading of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
involve me in! I that resented the torments, cannot describe them, at
first I was pale as Guilt, and an universal trembling seiz'd upon all my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet presently, the consideration of all my wrongs inflam'd me with
so much fury, that had <hi>Parthenissa</hi> then come in, I had sacrific'd her to it.
But at length I cry'd out, great gods! where shall Virtue inhabit, if <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>
be not a fit Mansion for it? and who shall ever expect a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96335:41"/>
for his Fidelity, when mine is thus rewarded? then looking upon
that cruel instrument of my undoing; I told her. Ha! <hi>Zianthe:</hi> how
could you thus long conceal this Treachery? Sure <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is contageous, else your pity (if all other motives had fail'd) would
have made you disclose what the just gods could no longer conceal. The
wretched Maid finding my Choler rais'd to the highest pitch, flung her
self again at my feet, and with a flood of Tears told me. The conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(Sir) of your being so long betray'd, was as great a grief to me, as
the knowledge of it is to you, but I could not reveal that treachery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being guilty of one to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and drawing by it a ruine on her
as certain as just. My innocence shall bear me witness, how I labour'd to
divert her from an action so perfidious, but when I found all was in vain,
I was forced to submit to what I could not oppose, yet with a grief, which
equalled the greatness of her crime; but since the gods have so evidently
declared themselves in revealing a treachery so secretly carried, I think
it rather a Charity than a Sin to acquaint you with that which I hope
will prove your cure. After that <hi>Surena</hi> began to possess the Kings esteem,
I found a beginning of a coldness in <hi>Parthenissa</hi> for you, and something
of inclination for your Rival, which increast proportionably, as <hi>Arsaces</hi>
favour did, and that being come unto the highest degree, this resembl'd
it; in a word, I cannot compare the greatness of her passion to him more
fitly, than to that she formerly paid you: but perhaps you may wonder
why they should write to one another, having the opportunity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of conversation. To which I answer'd, <hi>Surena</hi> was suspicious, that
all <hi>Parthenissa</hi> did profess in his favour, was but meerly to gain time, and
to free her self from the Kings importunities, who never left solliciting for
his Favourite; Now he knew, Letters were a proof that she could not
deny, when she might her words, therefore he put her to that tryal,
and besides, he shewed them to the King, as an evincement of his victory,
which as he said, <hi>Arsaces</hi> would not credit, but by some such undeniable
testimony. Things being come to this height, all their designes were,
how to delude you, which truly they were so industrious in, that I have
as often admir'd at <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Art in dissembling, as at her treachery it
self. Amongst all those Presents which <hi>Surena</hi> sent her, she places on none
so much value, as on a little pocket Looking Glass, which of late you
have seen her wear; and though the excellency of the Workmanship
might induce her to value it, yet the esteem she places on it, proceeds
from another cause, for between the Glass and the Case, in a little Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which is artificially shut with a screw, there is her Lovers Picture;
and, as if all things had contributed to undelude you, yesternight some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being amiss in it, she left it off to be mended. <hi>Zianthe</hi> without
straying to know whether I had a mind to see it, went and fetcht it, to
shew the truth of what she had alledged. The Glass I very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd,
having seen <hi>Parthenissa</hi> lately wear it, and set even a doting value
on it; but the rage of being so egregiously deluded, stifl'd those resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
my fury inspir'd, which silence <hi>Zianthe</hi> attributing to my attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
she thus continued her discourse. I have, Sir, given you a clear Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of my Mistresses Infidelity, which indeed, is so excessive great,
that I hope you will think it a sufficient happiness to have mist her, and
your Rival sufficiently punisht in obtaining her; in my opinion, the crime
is so odious, that with the first opportunity I will abandon her service,
and think it more contentment to have but a bare subsistance, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
is cherisht, than to possess all the plenties of the Court, where
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96335:42"/>Vice has so much dominion: all that I have to beg of you is, that you
will make the best profit of this discovery, without revealing the Author
of it, for it can be no advantage to you, and will be an unavoidable ruine
unto me. <hi>Zianthe</hi> thus ended her discourse, and filld' me with so much
fury, that without saying one word, I left her: but as I was going out, I
met a Servant of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, who mistaking me for one of <hi>Parthenissa's</hi> meni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ones, desir'd me to tell <hi>Zianthe,</hi> that her Princess lay that night at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena's</hi>
with <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and that he was come to wait on her thither. This
additional proof of her inconstancy, made me say to my self: Is she then
not onely contented to be wicked, but to glory in't? and has she no
sooner led me into misery, than she forsakes and insults over me? but yet
(I continu'd) why do I blame this action, for since she has stain'd her
Beauty with infidelity, 'tis an obligation to me not to hide it. Then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as answering <hi>Surena</hi>'s servant, I went to my Lodging, but in
such a posture, that had I met with any, betwixt that place where I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so fatal a poison, and my Chamber, my actions had discover'd my
condition. Being come home, I flung my self into my Bed, and by a
thousand extravagancies, exprest the miseries I groan'd under; at first I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to kill my self, having so much out-lived my hopes, but the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of so barbarous a crime, and to leave the world without revenge,
retain'd me. Then casting up my Eyes to Heaven, my Tears invok'd
that Justice my rage hinder'd my words from demanding. At length I
cry'd out, Great gods! Why do you tempt frail Man, so justly to destroy
himself, and yet make it a sin to do so? Or why is life esteem'd a blessing,
when without it we could not suffer misery? Then pausing a while, and
after starting up, I continu'd; Ah! no, were to destroy my self no sin, I
would not do it: First, those that have injur'd me, shall dye, and then
the triumph of my revenge will be pleasing: Yet <hi>Parthenissa</hi> must not
fall, her Sex preserves her; but to kill her Lover, will be a more sensible
grief to her, and consequently, a more pleasing joy to me. But couldst
thou, (I continu'd) <hi>Artabanes,</hi> look upon her with any satisfaction, were
her miseries proportionate to her crimes? O no, those charms would melt
thy anger into pity, rather kill thy Rival nobly, and shew by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
how much she has mis-chosen; then fly into some Desart, where
thou shalt never hear again th' enchanting name of <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> and in
the horror of some silent Grove, pine away thy life as a Pennance, for
having believ'd any of her sex, could prove constant.</p>
               <p>My distractions were so high, that it was day, e'r I could elect any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
yet in the end I assum'd this last, as finding it fittest for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
and despair, and immediately calling <hi>Simander,</hi> I commanded
him with secresie, and without dispute, to carry a Paper I gave him to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,</hi>
and tell him, I expected him in the Eastern Meddow, near the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Grove.</p>
               <p>The Challenge contain'd these words.</p>

prove, whether the gods will be as favourable to you, as her infidelity. In a word,
my death must secure your Affections, and yours must revenge me on your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
Mistriss; and though her inconstancy render her unworthy my Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96335:42"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Simander</hi> immediately suspected what it was, but not imagining the
cause, began to make some question, for which I took him up so short,
that I put a silence to all his doubts, and sent him away to perform what
I had commanded; then dressing my self, I took one of my best Horses
(for 'tis the custom in <hi>Parthia,</hi> for all Men of quality to fight on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back)
and went to the place appointed, where I had not long been,
but <hi>Simander</hi> came, and acquainted me that <hi>Surena</hi> would be with me
instantly. These words were hardly deliver'd; when I might perceive him
that sent them, onely attended by one of his Servants. I had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to delay my revenge by any expostulation, but drawing my sword,
and galloping up to him, bade him defend himself. The first encounter, he
gave me a slight hurt upon the Bridle-hand, and I him in his right Arm,
and after a few passages for the gaining of the Crupper, I won his, and
ran my Sword through him up to the Hilt, with which he fell, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to repeat my thrust, the remembrance of his excellent Sister, stopt my
hand, and made me tell him, That which I have done, though it be too
little for my resentments, yet it is too much for <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s Brother, for
which Relation I give thee thy life. If (reply'd <hi>Surena</hi>) thou payst
<hi>Zephalinda</hi> any affection, evince it in taking that little I have left, she is
so generous, she had rather hear I am dead than live by my Enemies
Mercy, therefore I conjure thee by those wrongs thou sayst I have done
thee, and by thy affection to my Sister, finish what thy good fortune has
so far advanc'd, and by one wound more, end those torments, my being
vanquisht will throw upon me, and secure thy love to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> which
whilst I live, will be unsafe. Why (said I) dost thou by that name, tempt
my fury, and revive an anger, whose justice is declar'd in thy defeat; fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
for I dare not trust my self with my resentments. Ending these words,
I turn'd to <hi>Surena</hi>'s Servant, and bade him have a care of his Master. Then
going to my own, I told him, come <hi>Simander,</hi> since death refuses to ease
my misery, I will seek some other cure, and commanding him to follow, I
gallopt away whether my Fortune would conduct me, and continu'd
moving, till towards night, where coming into a Grove, whose unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
was fit for my melancholly, as well as safety (for I was loath <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>
should satisfy her Eyes with my Execution) I lighted off my Horse,
and giving him to <hi>Simander,</hi> I flung my self upon the Grass, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to consider the sad condition I was in, which was so much the more
so, by how much my happiness had been so lately great. <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
appear'd so odious, that I could not have the patience to think on
her, nor it. But that which caus'd indeed, my real grief, was, the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
return my sad condition forc'd me to make the fair <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> who
for all her gallantry and friendship, had no other payment but the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of her Affection, and the murther of her Brother. These thoughts
were more insupportable than my own misfortunes, and that which
brought an accession to mine, was, that my actions of Ingratitude would
be as apparent, as my sorrows for them would be the contrary. After a
thousand reflections of this quality, I resolv'd at last to write to her, and
finding no Ink more proper for the occasion than some Bloud which ran
from a slight hurt, I made use of it, and writ these few words.</p>

to have fallen by <hi>Surena's</hi> Sword, and so have merited your pity, rather
than to have been necessitated to implore your Mercy. But great gods! to what
a strait did you reduce me? To dye, had been the triumph of my Enemy, and
to kill, makes the trouble of my Friend; the first rendring me unfortunate,
the latter guilty: But since those Powers which create our destinies, has made

               <p>I writ another Letter to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> wherein I told him, that I was almost
as much troubl'd to draw my sword against his Favourite, as at the cause
of it; that I had injur'd his Laws, to avoid doing the like unto his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which might have receiv'd some blemish by his electing one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
a publique affront that wanted courage to resent a private one of
the highest nature; that though by this action I had render'd my self unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of serving him, yet by declining it, I had made my self unworthy
of that honour; so that of two crimes, I elected but the least. And since
the gods by <hi>Surena</hi>'s defeat, declar'd him guilty, I could not believe that
he which bore their Image, would be of a different opinion. I folded these
two Letters in a third, to my generous friend, the Prince <hi>Sillaces,</hi> to whose
care I commended <hi>Lindadory,</hi> and all things else I had any concern for, and
from whom I begg'd a thousand pardons, for not having acquainted him
at first with the cause of those miseries, which forc'd me to a voluntary,
and eternal banishment. Whilst our Horses were taking that refreshment
which their hard travel requir'd, I was disputing what course to elect,
and after many Proposals, I resolv'd to pass through <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi>
and so thence by Sea for <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the darkest horrors of those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which separates that Countrey from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> spend those sad days
allotted to miserable life. That which made me fix upon this place above
any other, was, that the horridness of the <hi>Alpes</hi> would be more sutable
to my melancholly than any other, and by being in the heart of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, I knew the innate hatred of the <hi>Parthians</hi> to that people, would
never permit those which should search after me, to doubt of my residence,
or if they did, the danger of coming into an Enemies Countrey, might
deter them from following me.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Artabanes</hi> putting a stop to his Narration, addrest himself to
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> and told him, I have, Sir, to obey your commands, forc'd my
inclination to relate unto you, a part of my unfortunate Life, least you
might have fail'd in the knowledge of those particulars, which perhaps
<hi>Simander</hi> was not perfectly acquainted with: But now, what is remaining
he has been an Actor, or a Sufferer in, and consequently, will omit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is worthy your knowledge; I shall therefore beg you (if you
are not already tir'd with the hearing of my misfortunes) permit <hi>Siman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
to put an end unto their Story, and give me leave to absent my self
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96335:43"/>
from a relation that will awaken despair, which of it self is but too apt
to torment me. The good <hi>Callimachus</hi> having by a thousand expressions,
excus'd the rudeness of his curiosity, told him, Generous <hi>Artabanes,</hi> I
have already (I fear) so far transgress'd, that I cannot expect a pardon
from a less goodness than yours, and therefore will not persevere in a
crime which may make you as justly my enemy, as Fortune is unjustly
yours. <hi>Artabanes</hi> having made <hi>Callimachus</hi> a return suitable to his civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
commanded his faithful <hi>Simander</hi> (who was present at the latter
part of his relation) to satisfy his engagement, and then retir'd into a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
to entertain his Melancholly, which was too just not to be great.
<hi>Artabanes</hi> was no sooner gone, than <hi>Callimachus</hi> invited his faithful <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>
to obey his generous Prince, which he did, by continuing his
Adventures in these words,</p>
               <p>AFter my unfortunate Master had assum'd a resolution so suitable
to his despair, and that all those reasons my affection furnisht me
with, could no way alter it, I thought it my duty as much as 'twas my
inclination, to bear a share with him in all his miseries, and justify by
my sufferings how ambitious I was to deserve a favour which I had no
title to, but his having conferr'd it on me; and though by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
and commands, he disswaded me from tying my Fortunes
upon one to whom (he said) the gods had so much declar'd themselves
Enemies, yet I was as firm in my resolution of waiting on him, as he was
in his of abandoning the World. By this time our Horses having taken
that rest which we thought fitting, we began to continue our journey,
the Moon affording us her Light, and the first Village we came unto, we
waken'd some Peasants, where my Prince having seal'd his Packet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
one of them (by giving him a good reward) to carry it the next
day to the Court, and present it to the generous <hi>Sillaces.</hi> This being done,
we continued our voyage, but because I have so many essential things to
relate, I will not load your patience by repeating all those accidents
which happen'd in our crossing of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> nor till our
coming to <hi>Antioch,</hi> since without any considerable adventures, we
at last safely arrived there; onely I may not omit to inform you, that in
twenty days travel, I never heard <hi>Artabanes</hi> repine at <hi>Parthemissa</hi>'s cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
either that his wrongs had extinguisht his Love, or the greatness
of his resentments hinder'd the expressions of them; but I am the more
inclin'd to believe the latter, since his Sighs and Tears (his inseparable
companions) acknowledged some internal grief, produc'd them; and
truly he was thereby so chang'd, that had not his griefs been an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
proof of him that utter'd them, I should have suspected I had
chang'd my Master. But as if all things had contributed to hasten my
Prince unto his solitude, we met a Ship at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ready to weigh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where she was to unload her Merchandize in a Man of
War, that was directly bound for <hi>Ostia,</hi> which is a small Harbor the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
makes, when it falls into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> sea. This conveniency we
joyfully embrac'd, and the Wind blowing fair at <hi>East,</hi> we were full of
expectation in few days to arrive safely in that famous Island where the
Queen of Love had chosen her earthly Residence. We were not many
Leagues from our desired Harbor, when those upon the Main-top that
were looking for Land, cry'd out, a Sail, a Sail; the Master of our
Ship went instantly up to discover the truth of this Alarm, and had
not been long there, but clapping his hands upon his Breast, he said with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96335:44"/>
great Passion we are all undone, 'tis <hi>Menas,</hi> This was that <hi>Menas, Pompey</hi>
the Great took at Sea, when he commanded the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him how he durst commit so high sins, as to kill those, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Goods, which never did him any wrong, was thus answer'd:
If (said he) my Actions are Crimes, why then dost thou practise them?
but because thou rob'st securely with a whole Fleet, thou givest thy
self the name of a Conqueror, and because I rob with more hazard, and but
with one single Gally, thou call'st me a Pirate, when there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between our performances, but that which Force and Numbers
create. This bold, (and perhaps true) reply so operated on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Pompey,</hi> that he gave <hi>Menas</hi> his life, for which he did him such
signal services, that at last he gave him too his liberty; but being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
from his Youth, to that barbarous profession, he could not decline
it, and in a short while after fell to a relapse. He was indeed so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in all those Seas, that oftentimes his name presented him with Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and truly I believe we should have felt, as well as heard that Truth,
had not <hi>Artabanes,</hi> (perceiving our fears) by a generous exhortation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
us to a defence. For, if (said he) your Enemies are generous, your
Gallantry, if you be vanquisht, will make your usage so: if they are not,
your resistance may purchase your safety, at least, 'tis more like Men to owe
our sufferings to our misfortunes than our selves. To be brief, his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
Eloquence furnisht him with such powerful Arguments, that those
timerous Spirits, which even now were ready co yield without disputing
the Victory, were now so alter'd, that they breath'd nothing but the
combat. We were in all, (Passengers and Seamen) about an hundred,
and my Prince taking upon himself the whole charge, divided his Men
into two Squadrons, the one he took to himself, the other he gave me the
honour to command. Then, lest those new-rais'd courages should
cool, he commanded the Pilot to tack about, and resolv'd to save <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
the labour of overtaking him, who was chasing us with Oars and
Sails. 'Twas then I perceiv'd in my generous Prince's Face, a dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Clouds, his Miseries had there created, and in their place,
a Countenance so Martial, and so Charming, that 'twas as impossible for
his Enemies not to fear, as for his Friends not to admire him. By this
time the Pirates were so close come up, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> commanded the
Seamen to grapple <hi>Menas</hi>'s Gally, and not giving him leave to Assault
us, he leapt into the thickest of the Enemies, and with his Sword made
the Pass easy for those that follow'd him. Our Adversaries, who were
not accustomed to resistance, found this Action as strange, as we knew
it to be generous; and I believe their amazement something contributed
to our seeming Victory, but when those that fled the fury of my Prince's
Arms, had acquainted <hi>Menas,</hi> that unless he appear'd, and acted, all would
be lost; that old Pirate, who at first thinking us unworthy his Sword, had
commanded one of his Lieutenants to take us, finding our resistance need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his Power, instantly arm'd himself, and with a select number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which he always reserv'd for some such desperate exigency, came
out upon the Decks, where by the greatness of his loss, judging at
the greatness of his danger, he call'd up that Courage, which had
made him so justly famous, and therewith renew'd the Fight with such
resolution, that many of our Men, being terrified with the Fury of his
blows, began to shrink, and at last, to retire unto their own Ship; this
cowardice heightned our Enemies, which <hi>Artabanes</hi> easily perceiv'd,
and observing, the turn proceeded onely from the Valour of <hi>Menas,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96335:44"/>
he made a lane through all those that oppos'd his doing so, and at
last, joyning with the old Pirate, with one blow, he struck him at
his Feet, and finding by the rare temper of his Helmet, that his fall
proceeded from being stunn'd, not kill'd, he was searching the defects
of his Armor, to finish his Victory: which whilst he was doing, one
of the Pyrats coming behind him, had lift up his Sword to kill my
generous Prince, but as the gods would have it, I came to his rescue
and with one blow cut that sacrilegious Arm off, and with a thrust,
ended his life. The noise which the Pirate I had kill'd made in falling,
saved <hi>Menas</hi>'s life, for my Prince turning about, to learn from whence
that death proceeded, some of the Enemies (taking the opportunity)
dragg'd their Captain into the Stern-Cabbin. But to be brief, our
companions, whose Courages (by the sight of so much Blood) were
quite drown'd, abandon'd the generous <hi>Artabanes,</hi> who being too weak
of himself, having onely so unworthy a Second as <hi>Simander,</hi> to resist
such numbers as came fresh upon him, receiv'd so many wounds, that
his strength began to fail him, but yet upon his knees, he so generously
disputed the Victory, that Fortune by it appear'd sufficiently blind, for
could she have seen his vertue, she could not but have rewarded it, but
at length he lost such a Sea of Blood, that he could make no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
and crying out, Ah Death! thou art merciful, and curest the
wounds which <hi>Parthenissa</hi> gave, He fell, (as I then thought) eternally.
Oh gods! what did not my rage then make me utter? I found my grief
so much, that bestriding my generous Princes Body, I cry'd out, finish,
finish, ye barbarous Tyrants your cruelty, and bend all your Swords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Breast, for since you have by Numbers, not Valour, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the perfectest of Men, I will no longer survive that loss; and indeed,
their desire of Blood so well seconded my desire of losing all mine, that
having received as many wounds, as I was confident would not give me
the misfortune of out-living my Prince, I flung my self on his pale Body
and having a thousand times embrac't him, and kist his hands and feet, I
there fainted, acting those last expressions of my Fidelity. In the mean
while, <hi>Menas</hi> by the care of his Soldiers, being come again to himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what was the issue of the fight, and what was become of him,
whose Valour he had, so much to his prejudice, resented? they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that all but the valiant Enemy he enquir'd after, and one more,
had long since yielded themselves to mercy, but he, as if his forces had
been increased by his Companions fears, was yet nobly disputing his life,
which was so weakn'd by many wounds, that if he were not yet dead,
the time of his fall could not be long. <hi>Menas,</hi> whose Nature had some
light of generosity, though clouded by his Profession, and the daily exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of cruelty, was so taken with <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s courage, that causing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be carried upon the Deck, did there intend to preserve him, if it
were in his power. I knew not whether the belief of our being kill'd, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
our Conquerors from doing us any further harm, or whether my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and actions to my Prince, did suspend for a while the cruelty of
those Monsters, but whatsoever was the cause, they wounded us no more
after we were fallen, and <hi>Menas</hi> coming when the Pirats were beginning
to strip us, forbad it, and commanding his Chyrurgeons to employ all
their skill in our recovery, or if it were past their Art, then he ordered
<hi>Galippus</hi> his Lieutenant, to give us burial, as if himself had been in our
condition. And because his care should equal our need of it, he caus'd
us to be brought into his own Cabbin, where our wounds being searcht,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96335:45"/>
the Chirurgeons assur'd him, my Master had none that were mortal, and
that onely the loss of Blood had reduc'd him to that extremity; For what
concern'd me, they told him, I was in much more danger, but if they could
draw out the head of a Javelin that struck in my back, there might be some
hope of my recovery. In the mean time, by strong Cordials we came to
our selves, but my Prince, long before me, and to my great glory (as those
that waited on us, told me) the first thing he said, was, Ah poor <hi>Siman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
For my part, as soon as I found my wounds drest, and remember'd
with what design I receiv'd them, I tore off all my Plaisters, and calling
those that were by me, a thousand names for their care, I vow'd by all the
gods I would no longer live. Then I begg'd them with Tears, to bring me
to my Masters Body, and permit me to expire upon it. They seem'd to be
very glad, that my despair proceeded from a cause they could so easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
and therefore to console me, they vow'd my Master was alive, and
in the same Cabbin; but I could not credit so great a happiness, till some
of them acquainted him with my diffidence, which made him force himself
to say, yes <hi>Simander,</hi> I live, Fortune is yet too much my Enemy, to end
my miseries. Ah Sir, (I reply'd, with excessive raptures of joy) your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
will at last conquer her. 'T is a strange thing, how after the knowledge
of my Prince's being alive, I willingly endur'd all those hideous pains,
which conduc'd to my recovery, courting my Chirurgeons to hasten my
cure, though by the increase of my torment, that I might be quickly well,
to be near my Prince, and to pay him that service I have ever vow'd
him. During the space of a quarter of a year, whilst our wounds were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we receiv'd as many civilities from <hi>Menas,</hi> as we could have expected
from our Friends, but we were no sooner perfectly recover'd, than he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
my Prince to be brought unto him, (and with a countenance (as
barbarous as his Profession) told him, I have sent for thee, to know what
madness 'twas invited thee to make a resistance, where hope, (as flattering
as 'tis) could not afford thee a probability of success? To which my
Prince reply'd, with an assuredness more suitable to his mind than his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
I know not why thou shouldst think it strange, that the desire of
preserving my liberty, should not be as powerful with me, as that of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
me of it, or of a little gain was with thee; but when my life was
as great a blessing to me, as now it is the contrary, I never knew why
Death was not a better election than Chains. Yet me thinks (said <hi>Menas</hi>)
thou shouldst not prefer Death before Captivity, since the former cuts off
all expectation, and the latter allows thee some. The first (reply'd <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>)
as it cuts off all hope, so it cuts off all shame and suffering; and the
latter, whilst it leaves us onely expectations of good, makes us resent all
evil: but if there be any Spirits so low as to make such a choice, I wish it may
be their fortune. How dar'st thou (said the old Pirat) so far provoke me,
when thou knowest thy life is in my hands? because (reply'd <hi>Artabanes</hi>' tis in thy hands. But why (continued <hi>Menas</hi>) didst thou tye thy self so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately to me, rather than any other, when thou knewest, that by it thou
gavest him the Will that had the Power to punish thee? I found thee (said
my Prince) the worthiest of my Sword, and an action is gallant, 'tis not my
custom to consult with Fear. <hi>Artabanes</hi> had no sooner spoken these words,
than <hi>Menas</hi> imbrac't him, and cry'd out, O the most generous amongst
Men! if <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great were not living, thou deservest thy liberty:
but to be his, is more glorious than freedom, and 'tis to that Honor I
design thee. After a million of barbarous Expressions of the highest esteem
he had of my Masters generosity, he declar'd, he should be his companion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96335:45"/>
till his arrival at <hi>Ostia</hi> (which was the place we had at first design'd,
though for a different intention) where in few days after we came,
and there <hi>Menas</hi> elected fourscore of his best slaves (the most of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Gentlemen) amongst which my Prince and I were two) and having tied
to every of them a little Chain of Gold as an evincement of servitude;
he sent us ashore under the conduct of <hi>Gallippus a Silesian,</hi> in whom he
put his greatest confidence, and who was ordered to present us
to <hi>Pompey.</hi> The next day after our landing, we came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and saw
that glorious Town proud with the spoils of all the World, and some of
those great Men who from private Citizens rais'd themselves by their
virtue to give Laws to mighty Kings, and have in time added more Crowns
to the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> than there are almost inhabitants within her
Walls. But we soon learn'd that <hi>Pompey</hi> the great had but lately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the voyage of <hi>Asia,</hi> to receive <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Command and Army, who
was sent for back by the Senate, being, after all his Victories, become a
triumph to his Soldiers. Yet though <hi>Pompey</hi> had left <hi>Rome,</hi> he was not
gone out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but was necessitated to remain at <hi>Capua,</hi> for some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
were not yet perfected. This made <hi>Gallippus</hi> send a messenger
to <hi>Menas</hi> for his orders, and us continue for some time longer in <hi>Rome</hi>
than otherwise we should have done. I cannot here omit a very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
accident that besel my Prince, who as he slept, had a Snake which
came and inviron'd his Temples, in the form of a Lawrel, which a slave
possest with <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s spirit of Divination observing, cry'd out, that it
was an infallible sign of his being victorious and successful in the Wars.
By this <hi>Menas</hi> had sent directions for us to go by Land to <hi>Capua,</hi> where
<hi>Pompey</hi> then was, and where at last we arriv'd, and were by <hi>Gallippus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him, just as he was going to take ship for <hi>Asia.</hi> This great Man
(when he saw <hi>Artabanes</hi>) fixt his eyes on him, and calling some of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Friends, told them, Either all the rules of Physiognomy are false,
or that slave (pointing at my Prince) is not what his present habit speaks
him, but possesses a mind that deserves as good fortune as that he is now
in his ill. Sir (reply'd <hi>Gallippus</hi>) his looks cannot promise more gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
than his actions will make good; and had not <hi>Menas</hi> esteem'd it a higher
hap-piness for him to be your Slave than to be free, he had long since restor'd
him to that liberty his misfortune not his want of courage made him lose:
Thereupon <hi>Gallippus</hi> told him all the story how my generons Master was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Prisoner, which when <hi>Pompey</hi> had heard, he reply'd, The gods forbid,
that because your Captain has a better opinion of me than I merit, that
therefore this Prisoner should undergo a misery which by your own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
he does not but upon that score. Thereupon he commanded <hi>Gallippus</hi>
to set my Prince and me free, and to tell <hi>Menas,</hi> that furnishing him with an
occasion to oblige a gallant Man, was a greater present than all those other
slaves he bestowed on him. <hi>Gallippus</hi> who had contracted a high opinion for
my Masters virtue, was going with a great satisfaction to observe <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
directions, when <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s ill fate (which has never been tir'd with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
him) made <hi>Lentulus Batiatus</hi> (who was extremely taken with my
Prince) so earnestly to beg him of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that at last (though with much
reluctancy) he revok'd his promise, and not onely granted <hi>Batiatus</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
but also gave him all those other slaves which <hi>Menas</hi> had presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him. This <hi>Batiatus</hi> was the chiefest Citizen in <hi>Capua,</hi> and one who
<hi>Pompey</hi> durst not disoblige, being of his Council in that great design of
making himself Emperor of the World, whose foundation was then laid,
but after was destroy'd by the happier fortune of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96335:46"/>
what this did but imagine. <hi>Batiatus</hi> having waited upon <hi>Pompey</hi> out
of <hi>Capua,</hi> was no sooner return'd then calling for my Prince, he ask'd him,
his Name and Countrey. <hi>Artabanes,</hi> whose hatred for him was as great
as just, told him, with an accent which exprest his resentment, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a slave, he had neither Name nor Countrey. Which reply so incens'd
the barbarous <hi>Batiatus,</hi> that he commanded him instantly to be put into
Chains, and kept with his other common Slaves. Great gods! when I
saw those hands loaden with Irons, which if virtue had been a title to
Empire should have sway'd the Scepters of the World; What did not
my fury suggest in me? I curst a million of times <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
that had cast my dear Master into miseries almost as great as
his virtue, and condemned with many imprecations the weakness of
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s, which the desire of an unworthy Citizen could soon destroy:
at last I was resolv'd to acquaint our Tyrant with my Princes quality and
birth, and by the assurance of an excessive Ransom, free him from that
Captivity his unjust Fate had flung him into. But then the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those sacred Oaths <hi>Artabanes</hi> had extorted from me never to reveal
that secret but by his consent, supprest my resolution, and made me take
up that of endeavouring to perswade him to it himself, or else to give me
his permission for it. Therefore taking my opportunity, I begg'd him
with a stream of Tears, that he would not by any obstinate silence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
so low a destiny, but by acquainting <hi>Batiatus</hi> with his quality,
procure a civil usage till his Ransom came: That then he would return
into <hi>Parthia,</hi> there having obtain'd a pardon for <hi>Surena</hi>'s death, evince
to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> by a carriage void of all trouble, how easily he could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
himself of his Passion, when she could throw off her Constancy;
that it was her virtue not her beauty onely he ador'd: and since she
could decline the first, he could as easily the latter. Hold thy peace <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>
(said my Prince, interrupting me) do not add unto my miseries
by thy impious discourse of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> she is yet the highest thing in my
esteem; for I am upon better consideration apter to believe 'twas some
defects she found in me than any which were in her, that made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
the blessed joy of her affection; and so that which thou termest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,
may be her Justice. No, no, <hi>Simander</hi> (he continu'd) since
the gods have profest themselves so much my adversaries, tie not thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
unto the most wretched of men: I have some Jewels that scapt
the Pirates, take them and buy thy freedom, then return into thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
where I shall pray thou may'st enjoy a felicity equal to thy virtue;
and let me alone to wrestle with my misfortunes; for I had far rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in this miserable Prison, and under the weight of these Chains, than see
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> scorn my Flame, or by her embraces recompence any others.
By this thou may'st in some sort guess at the greatness of my torments, when
slavery is a comparative happiness. My Prince had no sooner done
speaking than flinging my self at his feet, I told him, Oh Sir! Have all my
miseries not yet obtain'd your leave to bear a share in your misfortunes?
Can you speak to me of felicity when you are loaden with Irons? Alas,
What fault have I committed, that you should esteem me worthy the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of liberty? I attest the gods, that the sence of your torments create
the greatest I endure, and that I can drown my own by the consideration
of yours; whose liberty I would joyfully purchase by the loss of my own
eternally. Therefore, Sir, (I continu'd, embracing of his knees) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you by your virtue, and those services which I hope I shall live to
pay you, and by that <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> whom you do yet so highly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96335:46"/>
do not banish me from the glory of suffering with you, nor have
so low an opinion of my fidelity, as to think any thing but death shall
separate me from you. To which <hi>Artabanes</hi> reply'd, That his knowledge of
my affection for him, and not his diffidence of it, made him press me to
return into <hi>Parthia,</hi> but since I assur'd him, to be near his person, was a
higher satisfaction, he granted my request, though it were to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of his misery, which he profest to me was much increast by
the share I had in it. I had scarce kist his hands as an acknowledgement
of his favour, and my joy, but <hi>Batiatus</hi> came in, who commanded his
Chains to be taken off, that he might be the fitter for that employment
to which, next morning, he design'd him; then he selected some twenty
of the ablest Slaves, who, together with <hi>Artabanes,</hi> were set apart for
Gladiators, and then went away. The Gladiators (as the <hi>Romans</hi> call
them) are certain Captives who are kept to fight at sharp, one against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in Amphitheaters, for their Masters, or the Peoples pastime, which
sort of Combats, always ends at least with the loss of much Bloud, and
oftentimes with the lives of the Actors. As soon as my Prince learn'd by
some of the other Slaves what he was destin'd to, he curst a hundred times
his ignorance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Customs that had sav'd <hi>Batiatus</hi>'s life; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
had he known the cause why his Chains were taken off, he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
them to kill the Commander of it. But after having walked two
or three turns, with looks and actions, expressing his just resentments,
he at last desir'd his fellow-prisoners silence and attention; which being
easily obtain'd, he spoke to them much to this purpose; Friends and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in misery, That Fortune has made us Slaves is her fault, that we
should continue so, will be ours, since a quiet submission to her cruelty
tacitely acknowledges we deserve it, and makes that which is an effect
of her blindess, appear a confession of her justice. You have assur'd
me often, that you are all Gentlemen, that Title obliges you sooner to
wear death's Livery than <hi>Batiatus</hi>'s; let us therefore, by some gallant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
shew how worthy we were of Liberty, or by dying hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely,
how unworthy we are of Chains: Death is the worst can
befal us, yet it is a comparative happiness to our present condition: If
the gods do not favour our endeavours, but take from us all those ways
that lead to freedom, they do thereby invite us to kill our selves; which
to perform, is not to sin, but to obey them. To move us to this, you
see to what the cruel <hi>Batiatus</hi> designs us, let us therefore resolve to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
when we are upon the Theatre Arm'd, to make use of our Swords
to a contrary action to that, for which they were given us; and since they
delight in Bloud, let us make them surfet of it, by employing our lives
which they destin'd for their pleasure, unto their punishment: This is the
way, if we cannot reach our liberty, yet at least to reach revenge, which
will be as pleasing as the Irons we now wear are insupportable. My
Prince had no sooner done speaking, than, <hi>Canitius,</hi> (one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
amongst the Slaves) reply'd, That he was sorry such powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
were laid down to invite them to that action, since their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
of it now, would rather appear to proceed from their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than their inclinations: That he so well understood the hearts of
his companions, he durst engage himself they would every one of them elect
Death before Slavery, but that he was of opinion, they might obtain
their liberty by a less hazardous way, than what was then propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for every day (said he) the Gladiators are to fight, 'tis the custom
to feed them very early, that they may digest their Meat before the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96335:47"/>
combat, and be the better able to perform it. This being most certain,
my advice is, when our keepers to morrow come in to feed us, we seize
upon their Swords, and kill them, lest they should make any noise;
then with their Keyes we may open the doors to our liberty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
(being early) the Streets may be so empty of people, that with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
resistance we may get out of the Town, and recover the Mountains
of <hi>Pettely,</hi> where it will be difficult, if not impossible to take us. This
motion was highly relisht by all the company, and the onely thing my
Prince dislik'd in it was, that <hi>Batiatus</hi> would scape unpunisht, but the
rest consenting, he saw 'twas in vain to oppose it. You may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
we were not a little impatient till the break of day, which no sooner
appear'd than our Keepers (which were four in number) came into our
Prison, where whilst they were distributing of victuals and blows toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(for Cruelty is a badge inseparable from their Office) <hi>Artabanes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius,</hi> one <hi>Castus,</hi> and I, drew out their Swords, and sheath'd them in their
own bodies, with such expedition, that they had their fate before they
could fear it: Then taking their Keyes, we open'd the doors of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and coming into the great Court of <hi>Batiatus</hi>'s house (which we
were necessitated to pass thorow to get into the Street) we might perceve
him (as the gods would have it, who always punish cruelty) attended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a couple of his menial Servants, and (as we conjectur'd) coming to
visit us; his amazement was so great when he saw us all at liberty, that
he had not power to fly, which gave <hi>Castus</hi> sufficient time to take away
his life, but his Servants scapt, and by their cryes drew many people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Streets, most of them in their shirts, for it was very early: Those
of the <hi>Capuans</hi> that had Arms, perceiving we had but four Swords, fell
upon us very resolutely; and (doubtless) had cut us off had we not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a narrow Lane, where my Prince, <hi>Canitius, Castus,</hi> and I (who
were those onely that had Arms) making good the entrance of it, gave
our Companions time to break into a Cooks-shop that was behind us;
where having fitted themselves, some with spits, others with long knives,
and such kind of Weapons, observing how our Enemies increast, and that
delay would bring a certain ruine, we charg'd them so furiously that we
made way through all those that oppos'd us, and by the death of some 30
or 40, ecover'd that Gate of the Town which leads to the Mountains
of <hi>Pettely</hi> just as some of the Inhabitants were going to shut it, who as
soon as they perceiv'd us, fled and left us a free passage, the <hi>Capuans</hi> not
daring then to pursue us any further. In this Retreat, my Prince and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius
brought up the Rear,</hi> Castus <hi>and I led our Companions; and
though we were four wounded, yet it was so favourably, that it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
not our march. We were not sixteen furlongs out of <hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a</hi>
                  </hi> (which
according to the <hi>Roman</hi> account makes two Miles) when we overtook
some Horses loaden with Weapons for Fencers, going to <hi>Salapia,</hi> those
Horse and Arms we seiz'd on, (but did the owners no harm) and had
scarcely fitted our selves with them, when we might perceive 300 <hi>Capuaus,</hi>
that follow'd us with an eagerness that spoke their intentions. The inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our numbers did somewhat startle our Companions at the first, but
my generous Prince so animated them, that he made them not onely resolve
to fight, but save the <hi>Capuans</hi> the labor of half their march; the Enemy
perceiving our intentions, receiv'd our charge with much resolution, but
<hi>Artabanes</hi> gave it with more, and did act in that occasion things so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
himself, that at last the <hi>Capuans</hi> were routed, and most of them kill'd,
for we follow'd the execution to their very Gates, which we found
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96335:47"/>
so ill guarded (an universal fear having seiz'd upon all the Inhabitants)
that had our numbers been proportionable to our advantage, we might
have possest that great City. But we were satisfi'd with our success, and
at night retir'd our selves to a place of very strong scituation, which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
shew'd us, who, by good fortune was perfectly acquainted with that
Countrey. This place I speak of was a Hill of a great height, in the
middle of a Plain, about eight Furlongs circumference, and inaccessible
every way but one, by which also there could not come above five a-brest;
The next morning we met together to chose our selves a Captain, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a body how little soever without a head is a Monster. My Prince
was elected, whose valor and conduct in the late Fight gave him that
place without either opposition or envy, to whom we all swore obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
till we might get out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and so return to our own Countreys,
for we were of several Nations, though the most of any one were <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi>
Then our new Soldiers desiring to know their Captains Country
and Name, came and begg'd of him the knowledge of both, but my
Prince, who would not acquaint them with either, lest it might in
time discover him, desir'd their excuse, telling them he was ty'd to
a concealment of both by some considerations: The <hi>Thracians</hi> then;
who I told you were the most in number of any one Country, cry'd
out, that they would thenceforwards call him <hi>Spartacus,</hi> which in their
Language signifies Captain or General, and all the rest willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to it, which I shall beg you, (said <hi>Simander</hi> to <hi>Callimachus</hi>) to take
notice of, for I shall for a while call my generous Master no more but by
that name, since 'twas under it he purchas'd so great a proportion of Glory,
that it cannot have an end till the World have. O gods! (said <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
to <hi>Simander</hi>) Is it then <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that under the name of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus,</hi>
did from so weak a beginning shake the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire worse than
ever <hi>Hannibal</hi> did? And who so fill'd the World with his generous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that not to have heard of him is as great wonder as any he perform'd?
This (reply'd <hi>Simander</hi>) is that same, <hi>Spartacus,</hi> who coming into <hi>Italy</hi> a
Slave, loaded with Chains and Miseries, by his virtue and courage had
certainly subjected the greatest Empire of the World, if at lest his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had been of that temper which <hi>Hanniballs</hi> were; for <hi>Spartacus</hi> knew
as well how to make use of a Victory as to win it, if that great general
had done the like, and had follow'd success as much as success did him,
he had made the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Lords of all the World. One great advantage
<hi>Hannibal</hi> had, which was, though his Army were compos'd of several Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet they never mutiny'd, but with as much satisfaction as duty observ'd
his orders. If my generous Master had enjoy'd that blessing, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
had now held that Empire in possession, which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> only
had in expectation, as you shall hear by the sequel of my discourse. Which
said <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I must interrupt, to beg you to resolve me two doubts, the
first is, Why the <hi>Romans</hi> gave out that <hi>Spartacus</hi> was a <hi>Thracian?</hi> and the
second, Why they said he was kill'd in that famous Battel of the Trenches,
which he fought against <hi>Marcus Crassus?</hi> To satisfie your first doubt
(reply'd <hi>Simander</hi>) I must acquaint you that those <hi>Thracians</hi> which
gave him the name of <hi>Spartacus,</hi> when they saw his glorious Victories,
and that he would not then discover where he was born, resolv'd since
he took his name out of their Language to give him his original from
their Countrey, which my Prince did not contradict for those reasons
I formerly specifi'd, so that the <hi>Romans</hi> when they said he was a <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
gave out but that which they credited themselves. To your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96335:48"/>
cond doubt, which concerns his supposed death, I shall beg your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
but a little, that I may tell it you in its due order; for I perceive by
your questions you are already acquainted with so much of my Prince's
adventures, that it will very much shorten the Relation of them. I
must confess (reply'd <hi>Callimachus</hi>) though my profession and inclination
have made me these few years live a recluse life, and give me no great curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to enquire after news, yet your generous Princes actions have reach'd
my ears, but in so confus'd a way, that you will do me a singular favour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me with all the particulars, being so enamour'd of his virtue, that
I cannot but be highly interested in any thing that relates unto a further
knowledge of it: then begging <hi>Simanders</hi> excuse for having desir'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
his Relation, which he besought him to receive as an argument of
his great concernment in <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s safety, by his silence invited him to
continue his discourse, which <hi>Simander</hi> did in these words: I left off where
<hi>Artabanes</hi> under the name of <hi>Spartacus</hi> was chosen Captain by his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which title oblig'd him to provide for all their fafeties: his first cares
were, to fortifie our Fort, (which he did by making many Traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
upon the Avenues) and to procure a Magaxine of Victuals, which at
last he accomplisht; but with much difficulty, being constrained to fight
for every thing he brought in. The <hi>Capuans</hi> too were taking order for
their safeties; and having found by their first essay, that 'twas not an easie
thing to conquer us in the Field, but far more hardly to be effected in the
strong Fort we were in, having furnisht it with all necessaries for three
Months, dispatcht away some of their Citizens to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquaint the
Senate with what was past, and to implore their aid for the suppressing
of their Bondmen (for so they always term'd us.) The Senate taking
their motion into debate, and finding how great prejudice all <hi>Italy</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Slaves that were risen in <hi>Sicily</hi> (which were not then quite
supprest) how that from a weak beginning, they had made a dangerous
progress, and that it would bring their Fame and their Empire into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
when that their very Slaves could endanger both, resolv'd for this
expedition to employ <hi>Clodius</hi> the Pretor, with Three thousand Men, who,
having receiv'd his Commission (which was to put us all to the Sword)
left <hi>Rome,</hi> and by great marches advanced towards us: we were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of these preparations by the industry of <hi>Castus</hi> (who knowing the
Countrey was empoly'd as a Spy, and till we were besieg'd, brought
us frequent and true intelligences; but at last the Pretor and his Army,
(which was recruited by some additional Forces out of <hi>Capua</hi>) were come
so near us, that they drew up in Battalia, and faced our Fort. <hi>Spartacus,</hi>
who was resolv'd to make them dispute every foot of ground, made some
such vigorous Sallies, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were hinder'd from Camping above
24 hours, and had our numbers been equal to our resolutions, we had
made our Enemies know, that those they had to deal with, had nothing
of Slaves but the Name. My Prince having acquainted <hi>Clodus,</hi> by the loss of
Two hundred of his Soldiers, of what temper we made, gave him leave
to settle his Camp, lest he might harrass his own Men more than the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
The Pretor, who understood the art of war, and knew the truth
of this Maxime, That a place strong by scituation is easily blockt up,
elected that way of conquering us; But since I have so many things of
Soldiery to acquaint you with, I must run them over briefly, by telling
you, That though the season of the the year were very incommodious
to lodge in the open air, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> having endured a world of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
by the fury of the weather, would not (for all) decline their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96335:48"/>
Seige, but by the continuance of it reduc'd us to that extremity for want
of Victuals, that we resolv'd, rather than suffer the torments of Famine,
to fall upon all the Army, and with our Swords in our hands dye, acting
our revenge; which determination we had the next morning put in
practice, had not I found out a strange way for our deliverance: for the
evening preceding that day, in which we resolv'd to perform our despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
enterprize, as I was looking over our Fort, I took notice of certain
wild Vines, that grew upon the side of the Rocks, so thick, and in such
abundance, that I began to fancy it no very difficult thing, by their
help, and our own industry, to get down into the Plain. This imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I instantly communicated to <hi>Spartacus,</hi> and to the rest, who having
viewed the place, were all of my opinion; we therefore began to make Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
like those in Ships, for the Vines being supple, of a great length, and
strong, were almost as useful as Ropes, and the Rocks not making one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
precipice, but in some places resembling Scaffolds and stages, did so
facilitate our attempt, that two hours before day, we all safely descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Plain; my generous Master having led us the way, which was
always his practice, where there was any danger. Then as we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to advise with <hi>Castus,</hi> what way to take to recover the Mountain,
my Prince over-hearing it, came, and begg'd us to make use of no other
guide but him, and to take no other way, but that which led to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Camp, where Victory, as certain as it would be glorious, did attend us:
In a word, he told us so many arguments for embracing so happy an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
that they preferr'd the honor of the attempt before their own
safety, and obeyed <hi>Spartacus,</hi> who leading them some ten furlongs about,
fell into <hi>Clodius</hi> Camp, and found them so unprepar'd, (for they kept no
Centuries, but towards the Advenues of our Fort, having all <hi>Italy</hi> to friend
besides) that we kill'd above 500 of them in their Hutts, before they
took the Alarm, which at last was so hot (not knowing from whence so
great an execution proceeded) that <hi>Clodius</hi> and all those that escap'd the
fury of our Swords, were obliged to their Feet for their safeties, and left
us the quiet possession of their Camp, with all the Riches, Victuals, and
Arms in it. The report of this great success, was so suddainly dispersed,
that in less than ten days, above 1000, as well slaves, as discotented
and poor Men, came to offer their service to my Prince, who willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them, and gave Arms to such as wanted any, out of those he had
taken from the Pretor. But <hi>Spartacus</hi> having no bank of Treasure to
maintain such a confluence of People, as every day came thronging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Ensigns, and knowing, that to live upon the spoil, was as dishonest
as unpolitick, and would so scatter his Army, that the <hi>Romans</hi> could not
miss an occasion of destroying it, publish'd, that if the Countrey would
send him in a competent proportion of Victuals and Money, they should
receive no prejudice, but if they neglected so favourable an offer, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
miseries they suffered by it, must be cast upon the score of their
obstinacy. This in some places prevail'd, but in others it did not, those
enjoyed the effects of his clemency, and these resented the reward of their
wilfulness. But to confine my self to my ingagement of running over
briefly all my Princes generous actions in this War, I will acquaint you,
that the <hi>Romans,</hi> after the defeat of <hi>Clodius,</hi> sent <hi>Varinus</hi> the Pretor with
800 Men against <hi>Spartacus,</hi> and because his Army was to be formed out of
several Garrisons, which of necessity would take up some time, he sent
<hi>Furius</hi> his Lieutenant, with 2000 Soldiers before him, to preserve the
Countrey from our incursions, which my Prince having intelligence of,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96335:49"/>
drew out a thousand of his select Men, and marcht all night with them
towards a Valley, which <hi>Furius</hi> was to pass through next morning, and
there, an hour before day, in two small Groves about a furlong asunder,
he lodg'd his party. We had not long continu'd in expectation of our
enemies, but we saw <hi>Furius</hi> in the head of his Army, marching in very
good order, which <hi>Spartacus</hi> soon broke, for discovering himself with six
hundred of his Soldiers, he gave the <hi>Romans,</hi> so resolute and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a charge, that at first he discompos'd them. But <hi>Furius,</hi> who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
how unconsiderable our numbers were, soon rallied his men, and
then gave us so vigorous a repayment, that we found it high time to give
the signal for <hi>Canitius</hi> and <hi>Castus,</hi> with those four hundred Men that were
yet in one of the Groves for our reserve, which no sooner appear'd, than
the Enemy fled, not knowing but that every Wood might have been so
furnisht. The Countrey being very fit to follow the execution, there
escap't not above 100 in all, of which number, <hi>Furius</hi> was none, who
scorning to owe his safety to his flight, thrust himself into the midst of us,
and there found that fate which <hi>Spartacus</hi> endeavoured to prevent; but
the eagerness of his Soldiers was such, that he could only oblige him in
design, and not in action, yet after his death, he gave him a Burial suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the esteem he had conceiv'd of his Courage. This defeat increas'd
our Army much more than the <hi>Romans</hi> lost in it, and the Senate no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
heard of it, but they resolv'd by a powerful force, to pluck up this
War by the Roots, and not to send inconsiderable numbers against us,
which did but serve to increase our reputation, and eclipse their own.</p>
               <p>In order to which, they gave <hi>Cossinius</hi> the command of 10000 Men,
and joyn'd him in Commission with <hi>Varinus,</hi> who by this was recruited
with more than <hi>Furius</hi> had lost. <hi>Spartacus</hi> quickly found, that if these
two Armies should joyn, 'twould be difficult, if not impossible, any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to maintain a War, and therefore was projecting some way to avoid
this storm, but fancied none so probable as by taking the field, which
might furnish him with an occasion to fight with them asunder. His Army
then consisting of 8000 Men, he marcht directly towards <hi>Varinus,</hi> who
lay encamped 60 Furlong from our Fort, in expectation of his Colleague,
who had then newly left <hi>Rome.</hi> My Prince having faced his Camp, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him out of it, and by many other ways endeavour'd to provoke
him to Battel, but when he perceiv'd all was fruitless he entrencht him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
eight Furlongs from the Pretor, gave out, that his Men ran away
daily, and for four nights successively kept great Fires in his Camp, and
permitted none of his Soldiers to appear without, nor within his Trenches.
The first night having advertisement, that <hi>Cossinius</hi> was within a little
days march of <hi>Varinus,</hi> with as much silence as an Army could rise, he
quit his Camp, leaving some few to continue those accustomed Fires in
it, and marcht all night towards <hi>Cossinus,</hi> whose Scouts being taken by
some of ours, after a few threatenings, confest that their General was not
then in his Camp, but lay at a small Village not far distant from it, to
make use of certain Baths which were there. <hi>Spartacus</hi> immediately sent
<hi>Castus</hi> with a commanded party of select Horse to surprize him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his march towards the Enemy, but <hi>Cossinius</hi> got the Alarm time
enough to recover to his Camp, which he was no sooner come into, than
our Army stormed it, and after a bloudy resistance entred. There <hi>Cossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
observing how my Prince pierc'd, and broke his resolutest Troops,
had the confidence to fight with him, which cost him his life. His fall
was no sooner divulg'd, but all his Army sought their security in their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96335:49"/>
feet, having found their Swords were unable to give it them; some two
thousand escap'd, the rest were kill'd, and a few taken. The day by this
time appear'd, and shew'd our Soldies, that the riches they had purchas'd
by the victory, was as great as the Honour. Having rested and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves awhile, the next night we return'd to our own Camp, where
we found how well <hi>Varinus</hi> had been deluded by our Fires, and our
Soldiers not shewing themselves the five precedent days. This, Sir (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Simander</hi>) is so strange, that were it not as general a known truth,
I should not have the confidence to tell it you. The next morning after
our return, <hi>Spartacus</hi> sent five hundred prisoners (taken at <hi>Cossinius</hi>'s <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat</hi>)
unto <hi>Varinus,</hi> and bid them tell him, though the <hi>Romans</hi> usage to
him, and their barbarous Commissions they gave their Generals of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Mercy, deserved in justice, a proportionate return, yet he esteem'd
an ill action fitter to be avoided than imitated, therefore presented him
those Captives, having only exacted an oath from them, of not bearing
Arms against him for a year. 'Twere hard to tell the severall conjectures
our Enemies had in their Camp, when they perceiv'd those five hundred
unarmed Men march up to them, but 'twere far more difficult to describe
their grief when they knew the cause of it. The rage of this defeat, and
the confidence <hi>Varinus</hi> had of not being reliev'd, made him alter that
cold resolution of protracting the War, and by erecting a Scarlet Coat-Armour
over his Tent (which is the <hi>Romans</hi> signal of Battel) gave us
as much joy, as our success did afterwards afford him discontent. But his
fury not having absolutely blinded his judgement, he drew up his Army
in so advantageous a place, that he might retire safely into his Camp, if
he found the Victory inclin'd to our side, which precaution he soon
made use of, and by it deferr'd his ruine for a few days, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
happen'd near <hi>Salapia,</hi> a considerable Town in the East part of
<hi>Italy,</hi> where the success was so entire, that not above fifteen hundred
escaped, in which number <hi>Varinus</hi> was, having lost his Axes and Rods,
the badges of his Pretorship, with the Officers that carried then, to
whom <hi>Spartacus</hi> soon restor'd them, and them to their liberty; but our
Army commanded them to tell the Senate, that their General would not
make use of the Regalia's, till he had the Empire too. Amongst those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
then taken, there was some young Men of <hi>Salapia,</hi> who thinking
to have a share in <hi>Varinus</hi> Victory, were (the day before his defeat) come
into his Army, and finding so different a fortune to that which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
desir'd to speak with <hi>Sparta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us,</hi> where they told him, that <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi>
was without any Garrison, that the chiefest Citizens in it, were their
Friends and Kindred, and such with whom they had much power, which
they would employ for the reducing of it into his hands, if he would
restore them their freedom, and engage his faith that their Town and
Townsmen should enjoy the same Immunities and Priviledges under him
that they did under the <hi>Romans;</hi> in a word, they so represented the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
the <hi>Salapians</hi> were in, and the interest they had in them, that <hi>Spartacus</hi>
granted un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o them whatsoever they desir'd, and immediately march'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
thither. That which induc'd those Prisoners to make that overture,
was, that some of our Officers in their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scourse, had not only assur'd them,
that the first design we should go upon, was to take in their City, but
that they themselves must expect the last rigor of War, if they did not
contribute their assistance in the reducing of it, which if they would
undertake, and perform, might not onely be a singular advantage to
<hi>Salapia,</hi> but preserve their own lives, which were so justly forfeited to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96335:50"/>
the Law of Arms. These Men, through such like infusions, were so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
that partly out of relation to themselves, and partly out of care of
their Town, which (without yielding) by the greatness of our Army
(then indeed grown very considerable) must become in few days a prey
to the insolent Soldier, inclin'd them to that motion, which was the
cause of furnishing my Prince with an occasion of serving two of the
most virtuous Lovers that time did produce, and in obliging them, he
receiv'd a far higher satisfaction, than by taking of so important a place.
By this our Army having fac'd <hi>Salapia,</hi> half those young Men were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to try their power, the other half remaining as Hostages for them,
and truly they were so successful in the attempt, having terrified the
<hi>Salapians</hi> with the vastness of our Forces (which impressions they were
apt enough to receive by the bloody defeat of <hi>Varinus</hi> the Pretor)
that immediately they deputed some of the chiefest Citizens to treat with
my Prince, for the conditions of their surrender, and had so far advanc'd
the work, that every thing was on the point of conclusion, when a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
from the Town desiring, and being admitted to speak with the
Deputies, whisper'd them something in the Ear, after which, they all
begg'd leave of <hi>Spartacus,</hi> to return for a while, there being in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
some tumults happen'd amongst their <hi>Salapians,</hi> which nothing but
their Presence could appease, which being granted, and they not a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour return'd, but those young Men that were imploy'd into
<hi>Salapia,</hi> were sent back into the Camp, all the Walls Mann'd, and
bloody Colours hung up, of which so sudden an alteration we
could not imagine the cause, till those Prisoners told us, that
during the Treaty, a young Gentleman called <hi>Perolla,</hi> who under
the <hi>Romans</hi> had purchast much Glory, had by an Oration so perswaded
the <hi>Salapians,</hi> that they were resolv'd rather to hazard their ruine by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
than purchase the avoiding of it by a submission; that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
having taken up that determination, would have detain'd them,
lest <hi>Spartacus,</hi> incensed by their inconstancy, might inflict the punishment
of it on them: Against which, they represented the injustice of the action,
the certain death of their companions; and how 'twould give one that
had the Power, the Will to destroy <hi>Salapia;</hi> but finding all their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
rejected, they went to <hi>Perolla,</hi> whose Gallantry, they said, was as
great as his Courage, and having acquainted him with the conditions on
which they were sent into <hi>Salapia,</hi> and their desires, he not onely highly
commended their honesty, but gave strict order they should return to
the Camp, which no one durst oppose, all of them having trusted him
for the time being, with the absolute Command, We soon found by this
relation, the occasion of so sudden a change, and that <hi>Salapia</hi> must be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast
with as much difficulty as a little before we were perswaded to have
obtained it with ease. But <hi>Spartacus</hi> having fac'd it, found himself bound
in Honour to make them repent the contemning of his Mercy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
instantly securing all the Avenues, he gave directions for many
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aling Ladders, Rowling Bridges, and Faggots, to be forthwith provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
Then calling for all the <hi>Salapians,</hi> who were fifty in number, he
told them, That he was sorry their Citizens had deluded him, but
'twas onely in relation to themselves, since it would render their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
as just, as it was inevitable: that to conquer so considerable a
place, was more for his Honour, than to have it given him: That he had
endeavour'd to make them yield by fair means, because he preferr'd the
saving of Blood before the Glory of his Army: That for their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96335:50"/>
their declining the temptations of their friends, and returning
to his Camp, when they could not but doubt his resentment was a strong
proof of their Gallantry, or of the high opinion they had of his; either
of which causes were equally obliging: that by the character they had
given him of <hi>Perolla<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he was more ambitious to have him for a Friend
than an Enemy, but would not desire that happiness then, left it might
deprive him of a certain Victory: That he so much valued Virtue (though
in his Enemies) that lest <hi>Perolla</hi>'s might not be well seconded, he gave
them all (as well for his sake as for their own) their liberty, and leave
to imploy it in his service, for the defence of <hi>Salapia,</hi> which he assur'd
them would be all little enough, against an Army on whom Victory did as
constantly as justly attend. The <hi>Salapians,</hi> who expected a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
entertainment, after many expressions of their joy and gratitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
That if upon their return, they could not perswade their Citizens
to yield unto so generous a Conqueror; that yet at least upon their Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
they would confirm the good opinion he had of their Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and either make his Victory worthy that name, or his defeat the
more excusable by their resistance. <hi>Spartacus</hi> extremely pleas'd with this
promise, assur'd them, that he would in very few days summon them of their
promise, and observe, if they would satisfy this last engagement, as punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as they had their first, which if they did, he would confess in giving
them their freedom, he had more oblig'd himself than them. These young
Men being come to <hi>Salapia,</hi> so magnify'd my Prince unto <hi>Perolla,</hi> that he
knew not whether the misfortune was greater, in having so much Virtue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his Enemy, or the happiness in having so ample an occasion of glory.
Two days were past in light skirmishes, whilst our preparations for an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
were perfected: The third, an hour before 'twas light our Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
and every Division having receiv'd their Orders, began a furious
Storm, which was receiv'd with an equal Resolution: Six hours together
the business was disputed, without any apparent advantage on either side,
and every place fill'd with Horror and Blood, Death being given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in a thousand several ways: at last <hi>Canitius,</hi> who had the Command
of all the <hi>Germans</hi> in the Army, planted one of our Ensignes upon the
Walls, but was so suddainly repulst, that before my Prince could have
time to commend his courage, he had cause to pity the misfortune of it:
Nine of our several Commanders had the same fate that day, aswell in their
resolutions as misfortunes, and <hi>Spartacus</hi> perceiving, that they at last
fought, rather by Duty than Inclination, sounded a Retreat, which
was so readily obey'd, that the Enemy found, it rather proceeded from
apprehension than discipline, and therefore fell so briskly in our Rear,
that it had endanger'd all the Army, had not my Prince in Person with
500 of the resolutest Men, made head against them, and though he stopt
the execution, and at last made them retire, yet it was so leasurely, and
in such good order, that their Retreat appear'd rather their Election than
their Necessity. <hi>Spartacus</hi> having doubl'd his Guards, and taken strict
Order for the rendring ineffectual of all Sallies, return'd to his Tent more
unsatisfy'd with the repulse, than with the loss, where all those Officers,
whose wound permitted them, and who had that fatal day escap't <hi>Perolla</hi>'s
Sword, came to justify themselves, professing that they were not more
troubl'd at their disgrace, than desirous the next morning to repair it,
and manifest by their Victory, that the suspension of it proceeded from
their want of Fortune, not of Courage, or by their death shew whose
Soldiers they were; That their affront (by a joynt concurrence, of all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96335:51"/>
their observations) proceeded from <hi>Perolla,</hi> who was ubiquitary, and
knew no certain Post, but where there was the certain'st danger, which
he courted with an eagerness as great as his success. Many other expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they made, to vindicate the affront, and to shew how willing they
were to repair it, which would be too tedious to relate, and to which
my Prince reply'd, that he was as much satisfy'd with the sence they had
of their misfortune, as troubled at the occasion of it, that according to
their desires, the next morning he would again storm the Town, and
help them to vindicate their Credits, or bear a share with them in their
failer: and in pursuance of that resolution, commanded them back to
their several charges, with Orders, as soon as the day dawn'd, that they
should begin again the Storm, that the Enemy (if overcome) might
acknowledge by the not altering the Assailants, nor the order of the
Assault, that it was their Fortune onely had suspended their destructions,
The Officers by many expressions having thank'd <hi>Spartacus,</hi> for so high a
Compliment plac'd upon their Courages, were retiring, when there came
in news, that <hi>Granicus,</hi> with most of those others which we thought had
been kill'd by the <hi>Salapians,</hi> were coming to my Prince, who extreamly
surpriz'd at the accident, sent for them in; <hi>Granicus</hi> therefore, (with Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
of his companions) immediately presented himself, and told him:
after the Assault, Sir, was ended, <hi>Perolla</hi> commanded all the Prisoners to
be brought unto him, and having learn'd, that I was of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
quality amongst them, addrest himself unto me, and spoke to this
effect. That liberty which both you and your companions have lost, by
my fortune, I here again restore you, and for your Ransome, I shall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire you to tell the generous <hi>Spartacus,</hi> I am exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
that he has so much cause to look upon this action, as an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Gratitude, and not of that Affection his Gallantry has created me;
and though his usage to the <hi>Salapians</hi> he sent me, expects this as a just
retribution, yet the high opinion I have of his Vertue, was no way an
inferior motive: tell him besides, that those, whose wounds will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to go off with you, shall receive an entertainment which
shall speak the opinion I have of their General, that their healths and
Liberties shall be the same thing, and that I almost think it a misfortune
to defend my Countrey, since by it I am necessitated to be his Enemy.
This high Generosity had so powerful an influence on my Prince, that
had not his Honor been so deeply engag'd, he had rais'd the Siege, and
would have thought it more Glorious to decline fighting against so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and civil an Enemy, than to have conquer'd him; but that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
which binds us to follow other Mens opinions more than our own,
forc't him to continue his former designe of storming <hi>Salapia</hi> next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and I dare truly affirm, the desire he had of taking so considerable
a place, was more prevalent with him, out of an expectation, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might evince himself worthy <hi>Perolla</hi>'s friendship, and find an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to oblige him, than any other consideration whatsoever; which
lest the fury of his Soldiers might prevent, he assur'd those that could save
the generous <hi>Perolla</hi>'s life, should have a more considerable reward
than his Ransome. The day no sooner appear'd, but <hi>Castus</hi> began the
Assault on the East side of the City, and <hi>Canitius</hi> with his <hi>Germans</hi> on
the West, where <hi>Spartacus</hi> himself was, who perceiving many of his
Men kill'd, and the rest extreamly shaken, to avoid the precedent days
fate, took up his own Colours, and cryed out; Those that love their
Honour, or their General, let them follow me, then marching a round
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96335:51"/>
pace thorough <hi>Canitius</hi>'s Men that were flying, he came against a cloud
of Arrows to the foot of the Wall, where erecting some Scaling-Ladders,
he resolutely and successfully climb'd up, and after a bloudy dispute,
beat off the Defendants, and planted that Colours he had in his hand
upon the Rampire; I had the honour to be the nearest to him in this
action, where he did so many noble exploits, that Fortune must have
been as unjust, as they say she is unconstant, had she refus'd him this
Victory. No sooner had our Army perceiv'd how easy a passage my
Prince had made, than above 6000 of them enter'd by that way, and
without shedding any more Bloud, rendred themselves absolute Masters
of the City; but whilst <hi>Spartacus</hi> was taking order to preserve the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapians,</hi>
as much as in such an occasion was possible, and that he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
many of his Officers, and I with them to do the like, as I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through one of the fairest streets, I saw a great confluence of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
about a House, whose Structure sufficently spoke the magnificence
of the owner, and being come thither, I inquir'd what was the cause of
it, one of the Officers soon inform'd me, that a company of young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
onely, considerable for their resolutions, had made so generous
a defence, and so slighted all Quarter, that they were necessitated to
make use of numbers to suppress them, and that now at last they had
kill'd all the Defendants but one, who having gain'd a narrow Stair-case,
was yet making of it good, with so much courage, that he deplor'd
the destroying, as much as the effects of it, and that he understood this
generous man's name was <hi>Perolla.</hi> You may easily imagine the hearing
of that name, gave me an unexpressible desire to save the Master of it,
and having conjur'd the Officer to run and acquaint <hi>Spartacus</hi> with it, I
thrust my self into the croud, and by many actions which shew'd my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
and haste, commanded them in <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s name, to forbear
any further attempt against so generous an Enemy. This Order found a
ready obedience, as well out of the knowledge they had of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my dear Master honor'd me with, as out of a desire to preserve <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla,</hi>
who they now fought against, rather to shew that an Army might
kill him, than out of any design, they had to doe so. At last by the help
of our Officers I came to the place where the gallant <hi>Perolla</hi> stood, who
appear'd to me to be less weary with conquering than our Soldiers were
with assaulting him, and spight of that Bloud which endeavour'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
his Face, I perceiv'd a Countenance so Spiritual and so Lovely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that I knew not which most to admire, but my wonder was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rais'd to a higher pitch by the sight of a Lady, who possest the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Beauties of shape, stature, complexion, and features, in so inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
a degree, that an affection for her could not so properly be called
Passion, as Reason. The contemplation of so many perfections had almost
made me forget the design I was come for, which fault I soon repair'd,
by addressing my self to the generous <hi>Perolla,</hi> and telling him. The great
<hi>Spartacus</hi> (Sir) who cherishes Virtue whereever it is plac'd, has sent me
hither to preserve so great a possessor of it as you are, for he believes
your Gallantry is a stronger obligation on him to serve you, than your
imploying of it against him, is to make him your Enemy. Since (reply'd
<hi>Perolla</hi>) that is your Generals Principle, the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> here is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
object to employ that generosity on, which I believe you cannot
doubt, when I assure you, that her exterior parts are as far short of the
Beauties of her Mind, as the Passion I pay her is unworthy the Object:
for her sake I can beg, though not for my own, and will acknowledge you
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96335:52"/>
civility as great as your courages, if you will promise me she shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an usage as proportionate to her merit, as you can possibly pay her:
this engagement will be more obliging farr than my own safety, and make
that death which my sad fate now renders necessary, as full of happiness
as such a deprivation is capable of. As I was about to answer him, I was
hindered by a great noise, which turning about to discover the cause of,
I perceiv'd it was my Prince, who with incredible haste was breaking
through the Croud, and came time enough to see the perfect <hi>Izadora</hi> fling
her self at her Lovers feet, and tell him, Alas <hi>Perolla!</hi> can you talk of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in death, and yet think of leaving me behind you? did you ever
find any felicity in separation, that you beg it even of your very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
or have you so low an opinion of my passion, as to think I can
survive you? Ah Madam (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> interrupting, and putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in her posture) if you will lessen my trouble, give me rather marks
of your disdain, than of your love? since the vastness of that score now
creates my sufferings, which are so great, they cannot be increast but by
new additions of your favour: Judge then, if it be not time to dye,
when my highest blessing, that of your Affection, proves my torment. Then
(reply'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) my condition will as much require death as yours, for
'tis as impossible for me not to augment your sufferings whilst I live, as
'tis to survive you, which since my sorrow will not permit, let my Love
anticipate the effects of it: this will be more proportionate to my vows,
and cut off the tortures of a lingring life, so Death, the enemy to other
passions, may prove the friend of ours, and conferr that union on us in
the other life, which our Fates and cruel Parents have deny'd us in this.
<hi>Izadora</hi> (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) flatter not my hopes with an union in the other
World, the gods which held me unworthy of you here, will have much
more cause to continue that belief, when instead of your mortality, they
shall cloath you with the reward of Virtue; alas, then you will be fitter
for their adoration than mine. Can there be (she reply'd) a felicity in the
other World for <hi>Izadora,</hi> if she be divided from <hi>Perolla?</hi> do not by such
suggestions fright me into a hatred of <hi>Elizium,</hi> which, if what you say
be true, will lose its quality, and fancy not the gods unjust, onely to
make us miserable: no <hi>Perolla,</hi> we have walkt too exactly in the paths of
Virtue, to fear Death, and as an argument of this truth, that minute
which separates your Soul from the fair Mansion it now inhabits, shall give
mine freedom, for to dye, is a Blessing or a Curse, if the first, I will not
be deny'd it too, if the latter, I hope 'twill hinder your despair, when
you know I will involve my self in it. This noble dispute had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
longer, had I not told <hi>Perolla,</hi> that <hi>Spartacus</hi> was come, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was so ravished with the Virtue of these Lovers, that his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made many who knew him not, suspect that his suspense proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his being as absolutely vanquisht by the Eies of one of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as his Sword had been victorious over all the rest; But <hi>Parth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nissa</hi>
was too deeply fixt to be defac'd, and her Beauty had got so absolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e an
Empire over <hi>Artabanes</hi> Heart, that since her inconstancy could not destroy
it, nothing else could have that power. But the Lookers on, who took
his Affection to Vertue, to be a Passion of another quality, were not long
in that error, for <hi>Izadora,</hi> who perceiv'd <hi>Perolla's</hi> great Heart could not
make any desires to my Prince, esteem'd it an action fitter for her Sex to
undertake, and addressing her self to him, put him out of those raptures
their gallantry onely had created, by saying, Generous <hi>Spartacus</hi> did not
that Title assure me you will receive a greater contentment in giving
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96335:52"/>
                  <hi>Perolla</hi> his Life, than he can resent by receiving it, and that I furnish you
with an occasion to oblige your self more than him, I should now have
been silent, and joyfully participate in his Fate, rather than be indebted
for his preservation to a less noble Enemy: but your Gallantry is such,
that the cause of his being conquer'd, takes away all resentment from
the Effect. <hi>Izadora</hi> had continu'd speaking, but that her gallant Lover
interrupted her, crying out, Oh Madam! Can you think <hi>Perolla</hi> will live
after he has been so unworthy and miserable, as to obtain your safety by
his Prayers, whilst he had a Sword to purchase it? add not so much to my
misfortunes, as to make your Affection the cause of all those Torments
I must hereafter suffer, should I now live; no <hi>Izadora,</hi> my death shall
shew, that nothing but the desire of your safety could have induc'd me
so long to survive my Honor. Finishing those words, he had flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the point of his Sword had not my Prince (guessing at what
he meant) ran to him, and though it were time enough to hinder his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
determination, yet it could not prevent a slight wound which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
his sad intention. <hi>Izadora,</hi> on the other side, thinking <hi>Perolla</hi>
had been his own Executioner, resolv'd to bear him company, and with
a courage which disdain'd exclaiming against Fate, drew out a Ponyard
which she had conceal'd for some such desperate exigency, and cry'd out,
this stroke <hi>Perolla</hi> shall prove more kind than you, and give us that union
you would so cruelly deprive me of: then lifting that fatal weapon, she
had (doubtless) perform'd what she spoke, but that by thrusting away
her Hand, I made that wound light upon her Arm, which she intended
for her Heart, but having mist her aim, she was going to double her
stroke, had not I forced the Ponyard from her. Whilst I was thus imploy'd
<hi>Spartacus</hi> obtain'd an easy conquest over <hi>Perolla,</hi> who no sooner heard
his fair Mistress cruel determination, than the bare sound of her death,
banish'd all thoughts of his own, and having perceiv'd the service I had
render'd him, he flung himself at her feet, and told her, I will live, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
since this wretched life is so dear unto you, and on that score I
shall cherish it, as much as I should detest it upon any other: Judge <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
then, how precious your life is to me, since to continue it, I can
be content to live in infamy. Live, generous <hi>Perolla</hi> (said my Prince)
and since the belief of your being vanquisht is the cause of your despair,
banish that groundless doubt, for you are so far from that condition, that
you are the Conqueror, your Vertue has made you invincible, nor was
it fit the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> should derive her safety from a less noble cause;
I renounce all right to her preservation, and the wonders which your
Sword has hitherto acted, shall be increast by this addition of remaining
victorious in a Triumphant Army. Ah Sir, (reply'd <hi>Perolla</hi>) whilst you
endeavour to make me a Conqueror, you are doubly so, your civility acts
now what your courage did before, both which are so unresistable,
that when I consider who you are, I shall excuse my self in my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and since you attribute miracles to my Sword, I will make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
one, which is to yield it self up. <hi>Perolla</hi> had satisfy'd this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
had not <hi>Spartacus</hi> so absolutely declin'd it, that all those which were
present easily perceiv'd, his denial proceeded as much from his justice, as
his civility. Whilst these two great Persons were by a thousand embraces
confirming that friendship which they vow'd to each other, <hi>Perolla</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
espy'd some Bloud runing out of the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Arm: alas,
how fatal was that object like to prove, his passion made him act many
extravagancies, which nothing but Love could render legitimate: but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96335:53"/>
when he remember'd the cause of her wound, how soon was that new
created harmony dissolv'd? and having again found, that all his attempts
against his life were fruitless, he prostrated himself at his fair Mistresses
feet, and told her: Must I then, Madam? must I the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>see that precious
Bloud shed for my sake, and at the same time be render'd uncapable of
emptying all my veins to bear it company, and expiate my crime? must
you spill your Bloud to preserve my life, whilst I make use onely of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to preserve yours? Ah <hi>Izadora!</hi> be merciful, and permit me by one
stroke, to end the miseries which these thoughts will still create. Alas
(said <hi>Izadora</hi>) has your rage so much blinded your Judgement, as to
think, that what is the cause of this slight hurt: if continu'd, will prove
its reparation; rise, rise <hi>Perolla,</hi> and believe me, if these few drops have
either manifested my Passion, or sav'd your Life; they are too gloriously
spilt to be deplor'd, and if they create any resentments in you, they should
be of a contrary nature to those which now appear. I must confess (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Simander</hi>) that my memory does not contain all the particular
passages of so rare an entertainment, and therefore I will not so much
wrong such virtuous persons, as to cloath their conceptions and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in any other language than their own; I will therefore in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your pardon for so high an omission, continue my discourse, by
acquainting you, that after a friendship was contracted, which was as
perfect as the friends themselves were, that <hi>Perolla</hi>'s despair was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
conquer'd, and that his, and his <hi>Izadora</hi>'s wounds were drest, my
Prince invited them to his Quarters, out of that Massacre and deluge of
Bloud, which his new friend had made, and though his many wounds
render'd the least motion, both dangerous and painful, yet he thought
the greatest torments would be in his separation from the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi>
and therefore having made his pain appear the less, to make his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
really the greater, he assur'd my Prince, that without any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency,
he would wait upon her and him to those Lodgings he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
her, whither as they were going, they might perceive some barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Soldiers driving before them two Gentlemen, whose Age and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
merited a different usage (though their past actions did not) and
I dare avow, though their sufferings were great, and that the manner in
which they were inflicted, was as sensible as the pain; yet they did bear
them with much joy, for each of them by the knowledge of his own usage,
guessing at that of his Enemies, found his satisfaction in his very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But they were no sooner perceiv'd by <hi>Izadora</hi> and <hi>Perolla,</hi> than
both of them with many Tears, and passionate actions, begged my
Prince that their Irons might be taken off, which was no sooner motion'd
than granted, though those which kept them, alledged, that they were
the Men which had spilt most of their companions bloud at the assault:
then my dear Master desir'd <hi>Perolla</hi> to acquaint him what high relation
could produce such rare demonstrations of affection, as he expret at their
captivity? to which he reply'd, Sir, I must acknowledge that Gentleman
(shewing <hi>Blacius</hi>) to be the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Father, and the other, (shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Pacuvius</hi>) to be mine, though truly they have retain'd nothing,
but the name and the power of Parents, they are those which we have
reason to hate, and yet cannot; and though they have stifl'd all the dictates
of nature, and oppos'd the purest flame that ever burned; yet we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
out Duties to them so entire, that we resent any affliction which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
them, with a grief proportionable to their joy, if the self-same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
had arriv'd to us. <hi>Spartacus</hi> being inform'd of their qualities, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96335:53"/>
them with much respect; but he perceiv'd, assoon as they had learn'd
to whose intercession they owed that favour, that the means of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
supprest the contentment of it. This action made him extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admire, what strange causes they were, which could have so unusual
an operation, and having found at last, that each of them rely'd upon
the justice of his cause, he desir'd to hear their difference, to which the
Fathers willingly consented, as being confident in their right, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard a true character of my Prince's Justice, as on the other side,
<hi>Izadora</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi> willingly submitted to it on the same grounds. The
next morning then being appointed for this Audience, my Prince having
conducted our virtuous Lovers to his own Quarters, which when he
had surrender'd them, and there (as a mark of his confidence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
acquainted <hi>Perolla</hi> with the word, he withdrew himself to settle
and secure his new Conquest, leaving them in as high an admiration
of his Gallantry, as he had conceived of theirs. The next day was not
many hours old, but he was inform'd by the messenger he had sent to
complement the generous Lovers, That they expected with much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency,
the Judge of their Felicity or Misery: to satisfie their longing,
he waited immediately on them, bringing with him their Fathers, where
finding by the Chirurgeons, that so long a disourse as their fortunes
must amount unto, might prejudice <hi>Perolla</hi>'s health, they prevail'd with
<hi>Izadora</hi> to undertake the Relation, which a general silence inviting her
to perform, she began it in these words.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Must Sir, as a friend to Truth as well as to our Fathers
inform you, That their hatred is not a purchas'd but an
hereditary one, and bears so antient a date, that the
original cause of it as absolutely forgotten as the sad
effects it has produc'd are recent, that what was but
passion or resentment in the beginners of this fatal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
has turn'd to nature in their Children, that our
Parents have inherited their predecessors Malice as well as their Estates,
and as if fortune had hitherto affoded instruments to nourish this sad dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
in seven descents successively our Ancestors have always left heirs
male to perpetuate this quarrel, whereby many of our Families have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd
their lives to the blind rage of the authors of them: but at last the gods
having given <hi>Pacuvius</hi> no other heir than the generous <hi>Perolla,</hi> and <hi>Blacius</hi>
than the unfortunate <hi>Izadora,</hi> all those which were concern'd in these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
differences, began to make it their hopes as well as 'twas their
prayers, that by an union of us two, this antient animosity might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht;
but alas, the higher Powers it seems had otherwise decreed, for
<hi>Blacius</hi> more troubl'd that he wanted a Son to inherit his hatred than
his estate, imagin'd (since my Sex exempted me from those violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
which he held so necessary to his blood) he ought to collect in
himself all the resentments of those which should have succeeded him, and
act some design suitable to his hatred and despair, that the effects of it might
be always recent enough in <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Family, to supply the expiration of his
own (Pardon me Sir, said <hi>Izadora,</hi> addressing herself to her Father, if I speak
those words which you have your self so often reiterated.) And on the
other side <hi>Pacuvius</hi> seeing but one man of his Enemies alive, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olv'd to
be reveng'd on him in such away, that the manner of his death should be
as deplorable to his friends as the very extinction of his Family. (I must
beg your pardon to Sir, said <hi>Izadora,</hi> addressing herself to <hi>Pacuvius</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are the Father of my <hi>Perolla,</hi> though what I say your profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as well as actions have endeavoured abundantly to justifie. These
Sir (continu'd <hi>Izadora,</hi> speaking to <hi>Spartacus</hi>) were the reasons and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our <hi>Parents</hi> when <hi>Perolla</hi> and I were in an age as innocent as that
we now are in is miserable; and as a further evincement of their hatred,
I have been often told, that <hi>Blacius</hi> was angry with nature for having given
me this little Beauty, least it might tempt <hi>Perolla,</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi> was the like
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96335:54"/>
at the inevitable charms of his virtuous son, lest they should raise in
me a Passion which might create that union they so abundantly fear'd;
therefore what education they thought fit to give us was in private, in
which if we made any progress, <hi>Pacuvius</hi> and <hi>Blacius</hi> thought it as great an
injury to have it publish'd as other Parents would to have had it conceal'd.
Judge (Sir) on the other side, if ever there could be a higher hatred
than that which subverted the dictates of Blood and Nature, (and on the
other) if there could be a greater affection than what conveted anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
into sympathy. I must (before I proceed any further) acquaint
you, That though <hi>Salapia</hi> and <hi>Capua</hi> be near thirty miles distant, yet
<hi>Pacuvius</hi> has a vast Estate there as well as here, and as if all things
had contributed to nourish the distraction of our Families, <hi>Blacius</hi> has the
like there too, lest (as I believe) by being separated, their rage might
want that flame which the sight of each did inspire. To hinder me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from the knowledge of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s increasing excellencies, <hi>Pacuvius</hi>
sent him to <hi>Capuas,</hi> and remov'd thither himself shortly after; where
whilst his gallant Son was making a large proficiency in all those reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and ornaments which have since made him the greatest glory of our
Times; <hi>Hanniball,</hi> that victorius Captain, who had made <hi>Spain</hi> his first
Conquest for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> undertook <hi>Italy</hi> should be the next, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
past such dangers, which to believe, is almost as hard as to have
overcome them, and suffer'd miseries to invade the <hi>Romans,</hi> which no
Nation else would have undergone, but to have avoided them; he at
last scal'd the Walls of <hi>Italy</hi> (the Alpes) which indeed was a very
strange thing, most men believing it a task as difficult to enter this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
that way, as to subdue it when gotten in, and having with Fire
and Sword made wayes where natures self had deny'd them, in four set
Battles at <hi>Ticinum, Trebia Thasimene,</hi> and <hi>Cannae,</hi> vanquish'd the Consuls
<hi>Puicus Cornelius Scipio, Sempronius Longus, Caius Flaminius, Terentius
Varro, and Paulus Aemilius,</hi> whose defeat invited the <hi>Attelanian,</hi> the
<hi>Calatinians,</hi> the <hi>Samnites,</hi> the <hi>Brutians,</hi> the <hi>Lucanians,</hi> and divers other
people of <hi>Italy,</hi> to submit to that yoke they esteem'd it impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
and had the great Captain follow'd <hi>Maherball's</hi> (the General of his
Horse) advice, and marched directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> he had without all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
possest himself of that triumphant City, which since has given
Laws to those that might have impos'd theirs on her, but having mist
his opportunity, and thereby the <hi>Romans</hi> having chang'd their fears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nobler Passions, he apply'd himself wholly to the Conquest of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi>
(the second <hi>Rome</hi>) where <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s hatred to <hi>Blacius</hi> soon furnish'd
<hi>Hanniball</hi> with an opportunity proportionable to his desires: For my
Father has been always so inviolable a friend to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he
almost rejoyc'd at heir defeats, since they furnish'd him with an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Pacuvius</hi> were very much their friend, yet he was much more his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges,</hi>
which Passion was so predominant, that it made him act things
both his reason and interest condemn'd, and which no other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could have seduc'd him to. To confirm this truth, when he found
that <hi>Blacius</hi> was unalterable to this Empire, and that their probable
ruine did rather confirm than shake him, he resolv'd under an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of securing himself and <hi>Capua</hi> to ruine my Father, to which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was the apter to incline by <hi>Hanniball</hi>'s Letters, which assur'd
him, if by his power <hi>Capua</hi> were deliver'd into his, the Citizens should
find no alteration but the difference of their Protectors, which small

him no positive offers, since that were to confine to certain Articles the
recompence of his merit, and put limits to those rewards which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
should have none. I must do <hi>Pacuvius</hi> that right as to profess I
believe, though these glittering promises advanc'd the putting his design
in execution, yet his revenge was the onely cause of it, which made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
rather to ruine his Countrey and Enemy together, than preserve
both. Alas, What miserable events has that blind fury produc'd? and, How
has it darken'd those many other virtues which would else so clearly shine
in our Fathers? The fair <hi>Izadora</hi> could not speak these words without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some Tears, which did not onely abundantly manifest the goodness
of her disposition, but as much prov'd that grief it self when it dwelt
in her face could not but relish of the place in which it resided: but
this disorder being vanquish'd, she thus continu'd. <hi>Pacuvius</hi> had no
sooner recev'd <hi>Hanniball</hi>'s Letters than he assembl'd the chiefest of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi>
(where <hi>Blacius</hi> then was) and by too great an Eloquence for so
ill a subject, so represented the forlorn condition of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the
triumphant one of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the advantages of accepting the
Conquerors offers, and the miseries of declining them; that at last the
<hi>Capuans</hi> fears and <hi>Hanniballs</hi> Armies advancing to besiege them, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his destructive Oratory, all the Citizens resolv'd to buy their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by the loss of their Faiths, and present their new Master with their
Keyes and Liberty: and though <hi>Blacius</hi> by a world of arguments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to divert so fatal a determination, yet all the advantage he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from it was, to manifest his affection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to make it
evident, that the <hi>Capuans</hi> submitting to the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> was an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as opposite to reason as honesty. <hi>Magius</hi> also, my Fathers Brother
(betwixt whom there was always as great a difference in humours as near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in blood) in this design join'd with <hi>Blacius,</hi> but to no effect, the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
having shut their ears to all motions but those of becoming slaves to
<hi>Hanniball;</hi> who, being informed by <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> that <hi>Capua</hi> was at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
made into it a triumphant Entry, many thousands of people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting
thither, to behold that Man in whom such virtue dwelt, and
upon whom fortune so constantly attended, that whilst his courage was
subduing his Enemies in one place, his Fame effected the like in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
But whilst these solemnities were performing, <hi>Blacius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himself into this city; more out of apprehention that his death
would be pleasing to <hi>Pacuvius</hi> than to decline sacrificing himself for
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: But <hi>Magius</hi> continu'd still at <hi>Capua,</hi> and his
Counsels being told to <hi>Hanniball</hi> by <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Father, so exasperated
him, that as a testimony of his fury and power he demanded <hi>Magius</hi>
of the Senate, whose fear clouding their justice, deliver'd him up,
and who immediately he caus'd to be executed in the Market-place.
For this Death <hi>Hanniball</hi>'s cruelty was not so much condemn'd as
<hi>Pacuvius'S,</hi> whose hatred to our blood was so exorbitant, that though
<hi>Magius</hi> did ever oppose <hi>Blacius,</hi> and was always oppos'd by him,
yet the being my Fathers Enemy was so prevalent with <hi>Pacuvius</hi> to
save him, as being his Brother was to condemn him: Thus by this
sad tragedy the <hi>Capuans</hi> found sufficient cause to repent, though not
to repair their inconstancy. But now (Sir) I shall tell you a passage
which perhaps will be as much admir'd for the gallantry as the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it: <hi>Hanniball</hi> who indeed had contracted a real friendship with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96335:55"/>
                  <hi>Pacuvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> either as esteeming his interest in the <hi>Capuans</hi> necessary to
confirm and augment his Conquests, or his virtues worthy that honor,
or both; but as a mark of his esteem and trust, he lodg'd in his house
without the ordinary guards which attended his person: In the mean
time <hi>Perolla,</hi> who always had a high inclination to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and consequently detested his Fathers actions; began to project the
death of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> in which nothing made him irresolute but the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of the Laws of hospitality, and since the consequence was
of so generous a design; it will not be amiss to acquaint you with some
of his reasonings, before he elected it. What (said he to himself) shall
I kill the upholder and revenger of our blood? Shall his friendship to my
Father be the cause of his ruine? and, Shall he receive his death from
those with whom he trusts his life? Shall I, to revenge the <hi>Romans,</hi> stain
my own reputation with a Murther, and ruine my own Family? Who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
'scape being sacrific'd to the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> fury? Shall <hi>Rome</hi> owe her
safety to a cause which if she approv'd, rendr'd her unworthy of it? Shalt
thou kill a Conqueror, whom the gods have freed from their own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
punishment (Thunder) by covering him with Laurel? Shalt thou
make away an Enemy. who in thus giving thee the power to destroy
him, makes it a crime to do it? besides he is one who owes his Conquests
onely to his Courage and Conduct; and if the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht
with those Arms, she deserves that Fate, which to oppose, were to
contradict the justice of the gods, and virtue it self: Ah no <hi>Perolla,</hi> leave
off the thoughts of such a design, than which nothing can be a greater
Crime but the performing it. He had certainly gone away, alter'd, though
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot pleas'd with these reasons, had not his good Genius inspir'd him with
what you shall now hear. 'Tis true, said he, <hi>Hanniball</hi> is the upholder and
revenger of our Family, and therefore the performance will be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
What greater obligation can I put upon the <hi>Romans</hi> than to
ruine our Family, to maintain their Empire? Had <hi>Magius</hi> been as much
a friend as he was an enemy to our blood, design might wear the name
of revenge, and an action of publick concernment might be stil'd the effect
of a particular hatred, so that all his favours should rather invite than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
the attempt, which these circumstances will prove rather an impartial
justice than ingratitude. But remember <hi>Perolla,</hi> how thy Countrymen
branded with infamy <hi>Perpenna</hi> for having murther'd <hi>Sertorius,</hi> though an
enemy to the Commonwealth, how much more will they detest thee for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
one whose too much virtue and success are his only crimes. But
then (he continu'd) Why may not I suppose they did but counterfeit, since
States have the same arts as particular persons, and it had been an unwise
justice to commend that which they could not sufficiently reward: This
part of <hi>Perpenna</hi>'s fate I hope will attend my attempt, which is one invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taion
more, for to perform what any but the gods can reward is to sell
gallantry, besides my case will be nobler than his, for I cannot doubt the
higher Powers so much as to deny him the freedom of his Sword to defend
his life, that if he fall, he may owe it to my courage not my treacchery, and
then i'll expose my self unto his Army, since to fly were to shun Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to out-live the fact, would shew as if I desir'd to enjoy that secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I purchase onely for my Countrey. These and many other arguments
so fully confirm'd <hi>Perolla,</hi> that he onely attended an opportunity to put
his resolution in practice, and though his green age (being then but 18
years old) might have made his change from this determination ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
rather a thing incident to youth than a want of Valor, yet he so
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96335:56"/>
much ador'd virtue, that he could not be unconstant to whatsoever bore
her Character. After he had with incredible impatience expected an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
Fortune seem'd one night to furnish him with one, for having
learn'd that <hi>Hanniball</hi> had withdrawn himself into his Chamber for a few
hours, to make a dispatch to his friends at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and that all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
were upon the like employment to theirs; <hi>Perolla</hi> (who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
free access unto him) was going to execute his design, but it seems
the Fates would not let him by one generous action hinder himself from
performing many; for <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> who had some intelligence then brought
him, of a design the <hi>Capuans</hi> had to revenge <hi>Magius</hi>'s death, and to recover
the freedom which that execution sufficiently shew'd they had lost, was then
coming to acquaint <hi>Hanniball</hi> with it, and in such a conjuncture of time,
that the Father and the generous Son met each other at his Chamber
door; where <hi>Pacuvius</hi> seeing <hi>Perolla</hi> arm'd, was struck with so great an
astonishment, that nothing could increase it but the knowledge of the
cause, which <hi>Perolla</hi> acquainted him with, in such ravishing terms, that
his reason though not his inclination was converted; and finding the
happy operation which his arguments produc'd, he began to conjure
his Father, by all those motives he esteem'd most prevalent, that he would
by some high performance regain the <hi>Romans</hi> good opinion, which it
seem'd the gods invited him to perform by offering him so favourable
an opportunity to kill <hi>Hanniball;</hi> for (said he) the action is good or ill,
if the first, it has invitation enough in it self; if the latter, the people
of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot doubt your conversion, since to assure them of it, you
perform what is as contrary to your nature and practice, as your former
Crime in delivering up <hi>Capua</hi> was repugnant to their interest. I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
not (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) trouble your patience by telling how <hi>Perolla</hi> offer'd
to relinquish to his Father the glory of the attempt; nor all those other
things which you may imagine so rare a subject could furnish a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with that was so, since this design by a seeming delay receiv'd an
absolute suppression; for <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> who found that his generous sons
reasons and resolutions were not to be vanquish'd, counterfeiting to be
so himself, and promis'd him as soon as that great Conqueror was out of
his protection, he would join in the enterprize; in the mean while he
begg'd <hi>Perolla</hi> with tears and sighs to delay the execution of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and not to violate the Laws of hospitaly, which would be as
great an offence unto the gods, as the performing it might be an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> These, and many such pressing motives vanquish'd
my dear friend, especially since the design was not supprest but suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that a small deferring would take away the seeming aspersion
of breach of Trust, and so involve his Father in the execution, that he
might thereby efface his former injuries to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But <hi>Perolla</hi> was
no sooner retir'd, than <hi>Pacuvius</hi> went in to <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and inform'd him,
that the <hi>Capuans</hi> were so highly incenst at the death of <hi>Magius,</hi> that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fought
his permission to leave him his whole house, and that he would
fill it with his Guards, lest the World might lose its greatest glory, and he
his best friend. At last <hi>Hanniball</hi> consented to <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s request, who
the next morning remov'd, and whose house was immediately so throng'd
with Soldiers, that the impossibility of attempting against that famous
Captains life was as great as the destroying it had been pleasing to
<hi>Perolla,</hi> who finding how much his Father had abus'd him, resolv'd
in himself to go to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by the gallantry of his Actions
manifest, that 'twas <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> and not <hi>Pacuvius's</hi> blood which was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96335:56"/>
to their Empire, with this further hope, that his fortune in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
accidents of War might furnish him with an opportunity to assault
and destroy that Life in the fight of both Armies, which had been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
preserved by his Fathers Tears and Dissimulation. And the Fates, who
have been as much his friends in actions of Glory, as his Enemies in those
of Love, knowing what he was destin'd to perform, was too great to
delay any time, caus'd <hi>Pacuvius</hi> (who still apprehended the discovery
of his fiction, and the sad events it would inevitably produce) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his generous Son, to go into this Town, which then had been
freshly yielded to <hi>Hannibal</hi> by <hi>Pacuvius</hi> power, there to countenance his
friends; which injunction you may well conjecture was as pleasing to
<hi>Perolla,</hi> as his removal from <hi>Capua</hi> was to his Father. This journey thus
resolv'd, <hi>Pacuvius</hi> furnisht his Son with a Train fit for one of the Bloud
of <hi>Diomedes</hi> the <hi>Argian,</hi> who founded the City of <hi>Agrippa</hi> in the <hi>Bruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
from whom he was lineally descended. After he left <hi>Capua,</hi> he lay
in a Town call'd <hi>Pettely,</hi> and the morning following, was waken'd with
an Alarm, that the considerabl'st part of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, under <hi>Himil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's</hi>
Command, had surrounded the Town, which had struck so great a
terror in the <hi>Pettelines,</hi> that they had deputed some of the Inhabitants,
to Treat on conditions for a surrender: the timerousness of those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did not so much perplex him, as he was pleas'd at so large an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Glory, he could not fancy that the design of yielding, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from fear, but want of a Chief, which might employ their courages to
the best advantage, and though his green Youth had till then exempted
him from the harass and noise of Arms, yet his Genius had ever so great
a propensity to War, that he then understood as much of the Theory,
as since he has of the Practique, and thought too, that his Courage and
Aversion to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> would supply the defect of his unexperience. Whist
he was hastily putting on his Cloaths, he entertain'd himself with such
thoughts, and was hardly ready when he went towards the Gate, through
which, he was told, the Deputies of the City were to pass: where he
was no sooner come, than he perceiv'd them, accompany'd by many of
their friends. That sight (as he often told me) inspir'd him with so high
a fury, that he commanded all those of his Retinue (which were above
twenty) to draw their Swords, and let none pass through that Port,
without his express Orders, then advancing himself towards the crowd,
which accompany'd their Commissioners, he cry'd out to them; Whither
run you, O degenerate <hi>Pettelines?</hi> can you think that Slaves to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegineaus</hi>
is a more glorious Title, than Friends to the <hi>Romans?</hi> can you
so much despair of the gods protection, as to act that your selves, than
which their power cannot inflict a greater misery? is a wretched life so
pleasing, that to purchase it, you will out-live the ruine of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and which is worse, make your fears hasten it? if Gallantry and
Reason will not move you, let the example of <hi>Magius</hi>'s Bloud do it, which
was shed a Sacrifice to appease <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and since his rage must be
quencht by such oblations, 'tis more noble to let our veins be emptied
to defend our liberty, than to be a testimony of our having lost it, which
is a fate we shall too justly merit, if we do not oppose it. Many other
motives he laid open to them, with such a charming Eloquence and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that the <hi>Pettelines</hi> resolv'd to stop their Commissioners, and to own
their sufferings to their Misfortunes, rather than their Fears. You will
pardon me (Sir) said the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> if I do but briefly pass over the
affairs of this memorable Siege (though by it the Town become more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

the Governor than the Founder, who was <hi>Philoctetes</hi> the Son
of <hi>Pean,</hi> that kept the Arrows of <hi>Hercules,</hi> without which the Prophet
<hi>Calchas,</hi> declar'd <hi>Troy</hi> not be taken) since my Sex dispences me from any
knowledge in things of this nature, and because it serves but to acquaint
you with that Gallantry of which already you have (with all the
World) so just an opinion, I will therefore with your permission onely
tell you, that after <hi>Himilco</hi> had receiv'd an absolute denial of <hi>Pettely</hi>
from <hi>Perolla,</hi> a thousand affronts by bloody Sallies, and that he had
continu'd four Months of a difficult Siege: he at last, plainly sent <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
word (then beleaguering of <hi>Cassilinum</hi>) that unless he, and all his
Army came to his relief, the <hi>Pettelines</hi> were like to carry away too much
Glory for those which were Enemies to <hi>Carthage.</hi> This message made him
observe the desire of him that sent it, as much for the respect he paid so
great a Soldier, as out of an opinion it would be no small accession to
his Glory, if he could take a City which <hi>Himilco</hi> (by his own confession)
esteem'd too difficult an enterprize for him alone. <hi>Hannibal</hi> therefore left
Forces to block up <hi>Cassilinum,</hi> and came with the rest to <hi>Pettely,</hi> where
having view'd the place, and the resolute countenance and posture of the
Defendants (maugre his high Heart) he resolv'd before he came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
to practice mild ways, which if they took, would not onely free
him from those just fears the gallantry of his Enemies had created, but
augment his reputation by his presence, reducing that which a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and a greater Coumander could not effect. In order to this resolve,
he sent a Trumpet unto <hi>Pettely,</hi> who after the due ceremonies of War,
was admitted, and deliver'd <hi>Perolla</hi> a summons, which contain'd these
words.</p>

                  </hi> Bloud in
this Empire was so unsuccessfully spent, as there, and never Glory was
more nobly purchas'd, than in that fatal day (to the <hi>Cartheginians</hi>) who
lost, besides the hope of Conquest, 2000 of their best Men, and twice as
many by their wounds, were render'd unserviceable. Whilst these things
were acting, the <hi>Pettelines</hi> had sent two of their chiefest Citizens to beg
the Senates aid, whom they found, (as well by that they observ'd, as by
their own Declaration) in a posture, fitter to desire than send relief. This
proceeding of the Senate, as it was a great proof of their ingenuity, so
it was of their necessity, and therefore forced these Deputies to fling
themselves at their feet, and conjure them with all expressions of a real
grief, to make them messengers of more comfort, or else permit them to
sacrifice their lives in their sights, as being a more pleasing destiny, than
to be testimonies of the ruine of their City, which so fatal an answer,
would render unavoidable. This Gallantry was so prevalent with the
Senate, that after (through a generous sympathy) they had paid them
back their Tears, they commanded the Deputies to return to their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and tell them, that what they had done already, had been so obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that nothing could increase the score, but to save themselves by a
timely submission to the Conqueror, and thereby preserve those who had
shew'd so great a proportion of constancy and courage, that they were
more concern'd in their safeties, than in their own. The two Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
at last, to obey their Masters, came home through a world of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with that return; and truly this was a tenderness of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which
they had manifested to none of their subjects, for in all other cases they
chose rather to lose their Friends, than the reputation of their Arms, but
in this they preferr'd the former before the latter. But this was so far
from inducing them to yield, that by <hi>Perolla</hi>'s perswasion they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by a generous-resistance, or glorious ruine, to merit so high a Care,
and that which made them the more intent on this, was, the Senates having
acquainted them of their duty, which render'd their further actions, an
obligation to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who by three bloody as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
had learn'd, that Famine onely could make him Lord of <hi>Pettely,</hi>
had given over all hopes of obtaining it by storm, and lay a while blocking
of it up, with as much quiet, as his disgraces would permit, and at last
weary'd with the tedioussness of the Siege, left <hi>Himilco</hi> to strave them
out, and brought the best part of his Army, to renew the Siege of <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linum,</hi>
where <hi>Manituis</hi> a gallant <hi>Roman,</hi> commanded. <hi>Himilco,</hi> to obey
his Generals Orders, had in few weeks so straitn'd <hi>Pettely,</hi> that those in
it did more justly fear their ruine from within than without, but by the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96335:58"/>
generous example of <hi>Perolla</hi> they suffer'd with as much patience, as they
acted with resolution; and to say truth, I know not which was more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,
their active or their passive parts. In this general Calamity
there happen'd so rare an accident, that though I exceedingly long to run
through these bloudy Relations, yet I cannot pass by this memorable
Adventure, without being as unjust as the performers of it were gallant.
The Famine in <hi>Pettely</hi> was so increas'd, that the place was inevitably to
fall into the Enemies hands, were not the want of Victuals immediately
redress'd; and though, (in the beginning of the Siege) they had sent away
all their old People and Children, yet they retain'd so many Women,
that the feeding of them must of necessity hasten their ruine. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
was never mentioned by <hi>Perolla,</hi> who bare too high a
respect to our Sex, to preserve those of his own, by exposing ours to the
least hazard or suffering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But a certain Lady (whose Virtue, Beauty, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and Wealth, rendr'd her the most considerable amongst the <hi>Pette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi>)
plainly perceiv'd how great an inconveniency <hi>Perolla</hi>'s civility was
like to produce. <hi>Amazora</hi> therefore (for so she was called) having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a high and just value in that City, resolv'd to employ it to some end,
which might make her self as famous to posterity, as her perfections me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.
To effect this, she assembl'd the chiefest Women of <hi>Pettely;</hi> to those
which she thought Glory was more pleasing than Life, she acquainted
with her resolution of stealing out of the Town, and exposing her self
to the Swords of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Soldiers, and thereby free the City from the
misery of Famine, or at least from their hastening it. To others, which
she believ'd, prefer'd their safety above all other considerations, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the certain languishing death, they must unavoidably suffer by
their residence in <hi>Pettely,</hi> and the probability of avoiding that Fate,
by submitting to the <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> who could not be so merciless to a
Sex which the unreasonable creatures even by the Law of nature, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Preserve. In a word, she so fitted her perswasions to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
humours of those she courted, and at last so fully vanquish'd their fears,
and confirm'd their resolution, that two nights after (having corrupted
a Centinel, which was a menial Servant of hers, for there being no Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the Inhabitants did the duty) and by his help (her House standing
upon the Walls of the Town) about two thousand Women (with Ropes
and Baskets) got out of <hi>Pettely.</hi> The next morning before day, a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of <hi>Amazora</hi>'s, brought this Letter to <hi>Perolla,</hi> who having open'd it,
found it contain'd words to this purpose;</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>AMAZORA and the Women of Pettely,
to the gallant PEROLLA, and his
Valiant Companions.</head>
                     <p>WE had been ill Proficients, and unworthy your protection, had not the
daily demonstrations of your Gallantryes created some in us, and
though the too rigid Laws of our Sex, forbid us to employ our resolutions in
an Active, yet it exempts us from a Passive Virtue. We are therefore gone to
expose our selves to the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> Swords, and had rather they should
be employ'd for our destructions, than be indebted for our lives, to those which
are Enemies to your and our Liberties. If contrary to our hopes and desires
they save us, we have eased you of a burthen your civilities did not mention,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96335:58"/>
and which consequently had had an unfitting return any way but this. But
if we are sacrific'd to their fury, let your courages (if they are capable of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession)
be thereby so heightned, that whilst you celebrate our Deaths in Tears,
you necessitate your Enemies to do the like in Bloud.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>IT is not easy to imagine the high admiration which this Letter produc'd,
and it is as difficult to describe the sorrow, which suddenly ensu'd, as
the cruelty which was the cause of it, for as soon as the Sun had render'd
visible all objects within the reach of sight, <hi>Perolla</hi> and his companions
perceiv'd the Fields strewed with the dead Bodies of those gallant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which the barbarous <hi>Affricans</hi> had cruelly murther'd. Judge (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Spartacus</hi>) what a just fury this unequall'd impiety inspir'd <hi>Perolla,</hi>
and the <hi>Pettelines</hi> with. But their actions will better acquaint you with
their resentments, than my expressions can; For in that Sally (where they
now were led on by Revenge, as well as Honor, they kill'd above 1500
<hi>Lybians,</hi> and the execution had been far bloudier, had not they spent
the best part of their time in fetching off the Bodies of <hi>Amazora,</hi> and
those of best quality, whose Names had no cause to wander, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of their murtherers could hinder it. Never victory had less joy
in it, than this, and never Funeral was solemniz'd with more Tears, than
that of those admirable Women: and indeed, the Besieged's grief appear'd
so just, that their Reason rather continu'd than supprest them. But it is
high time to lead you out of so forlorn an entertainment, which I will do,
by acquainting you, that though <hi>Perolla</hi> now perswades me I possess his
Heart intirely, yet he cannot deny, but that I have onely the reversion
of it; neither would I pass by (though the truth of my story oblig'd me
not to it) the vertues of my Rival, which indeed merit a particular
Elogium, and were I capable of describing them as they deserve, I know
none that would have declin'd her Fate, to have had her Glory. Her Fire
was of so peculiar a quality, that when it had reduc'd her to ashes, those
very Reliques retain'd heat enough to inflame him, and perhaps there
has been seldom heard of a love so strange in the Birth, in the Life, and in
Death. For it was created by an object that was dead, the Effect remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the Cause was taken away, and having no material sustenance
to preserve it self alive, it liv'd upon speculation, and to perfect the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
'twas <hi>Izadora</hi> destroy'd it. But I tell you too much of the end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I acquaint you of the beginning, which fell out thus. <hi>Perolla</hi> returning
from that famous Burial, one of those Men which had been ordered to
take an Inventory of <hi>Amazora</hi>'s Goods, and preserve them, presented
him with a Letter he had found in her Closet, and because the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
was<q>TO THE
Gallant PEROLLA.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He open'd it, and found it contain'd these words;</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>TIS not <hi>Amazora,</hi> but her death discovers she had a passion for you, had
she lived, the impossibility of disclosing it, had been as great, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the obtaining of a reciprocal one: Do not then condemn a confidence I
wash away with my Bloud, nor slight an Affection which is as perfect as the
Object that created it, neither am I onely a friend to your Passion but your
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96335:59"/>
Glory, which I am resolv'd to raise upon my own ruine, and the ruine of all
those of my Sex within this City: our deaths shall delay (if not hinder) yours,
and give you time enough to act such additional generous things, that those
which are acquainted with them, and with my flame shall excuse the latter by
the knowledge of the former. If all this can procure your esteem, I shall think
my destiny too noble to be deplor'd, and if for the life I loose, I may live in
your memory, I shall esteem it a more happy being, than that which the gods
have promis'd in the other world to those which have been virtuous in this.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>HE had no sooner ended Reading, than he cry'd out, Yes, fair <hi>Amazora,</hi>
I will preserve you still in my memory, and were it not to obey
your Commands, the World should know, that your death is so far from
delaying mine, that it has but hasten'd it. Then folding his Arms one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
another, he stood moveless as a Statue for a while, raining from his
Eyes, whole showers of Tears; but after a world of confus'd thoughts
had past through his fancy, he cry'd out again, Would it had pleas'd the
gods (fair <hi>Amazora</hi>) to have made you as concern'd in my happiness, as
in my glory: Cruel Honor! was there no expedient to build thy Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,
but by the ruine of my Felicity? must the way to reach my Glory
ruine my contentment? Oh, too hard Fates: why did I not know my
happiness whilst I possest it? and why am I acquainted with it when 'tis
vanisht? was I to be blest onely to be curst? must the knowledge of more
joy than I could expect, create more grief than I can endure? and must
<hi>Amazora</hi>'s passion for me be so order'd, that the revealing of it must prove
my Torment? whilst <hi>Izadora</hi> was relating this sad reasoning, her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Servant was so struck with sorrow, that she, who sympathiz'd with
him in all virtuous Resentments, was constrain'd to break off her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which the company perceiving, they did manifest by a general si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
from all things but sighs, how just an opinion they had of their grief,
and how highly they approv'd the cause of it. A little time being so spent,
and <hi>Izadora</hi> having wip'd away her Tears, thus continu'd her Story. I
will not tell you all the melancholly expressions <hi>Perolla</hi> us'd, lest it might
infect you with a grief I would willingly exempt you from, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
inform you only, that he contracted a Passion for her memory, as great
as any other could have had for her Beauty, and that (whilst the Siege
continu'd) twice a day he constantly water'd her Urne with such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
weepings, that had those Tears been inwardly imploy'd, they had
doubtless extinguisht his Grief, his Flame, or his Life. At last, (gallant
<hi>Spartacus</hi>) the Famine so increast in <hi>Pettely,</hi> that 'twas impossible any
longer to maintain the place, and though <hi>Himilco</hi> offer'd him (and all
those with him) conditions fit for Soldiers, yet he scorn'd to stand indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his life, to those which had taken away <hi>Amazora</hi>'s, but rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to force his passage with his Sword, or perish in the attempt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was this only his design, but that which he infus'd into all the rest.
That day being then come, the Town was on all quarters set on fire, that
the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> might neither use nor glory in their Conquest, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
at the head of 3000 <hi>Pettelines</hi> (which were all that were left) furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
charged the <hi>Affricans,</hi> and by dint of Sword, forced his passage, and
to animate his Soldiers, he cry'd out, (nothing but) remember <hi>Amazora</hi>
and her followers. And truly I am perswaded, all the Eloquence the gods
ever bestow'd on Man, could not have been more powerful, than were
those few words. 'Twas in that great action, <hi>Perolla</hi> did miracles, and I
have been told, the slaughter was so bloudy, that all those gallant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96335:59"/>
Women, had each of them one of their dead Murtherers for a
cover of their Graves, the Fight happening in those very Fields where so
horrid a Massacre had been committed. On <hi>Perolla</hi>'s side there fell 800.
which number I believe he might have lessen'd, had he stolen, and not
made his retreat, but night coming, ended their dispute, and my gallant
friend, having rallied the reliques of his Forces, propounded, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them to force their passage into <hi>Cassilinum,</hi> which was not above
200 Furlongs off, and which was besieged then by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
being taken, the next night, by unfrequented ways, they began
their march, and the day following, towards the evening, beat up a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> and by the death of 700 <hi>Libyans,</hi> made a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
entry into the Town, presenting <hi>Manitius</hi> (the Governor and
Friend to <hi>Perolla</hi>) both with a Relief and a Victory, which so rais'd his
dejected Soldiers, that they brake off the Treaty of surrender they had
almost concluded. 'Twas in this memorable Siege that <hi>Perolla</hi> did such
glorious things, that (as little as I am concern'd in affairs of that nature)
they reacht my Ears, and I must with guilty blushes acknowledge, that
the hatred I had to his Bloud, made me look upon those actions with
Envy, which I shold have consider'd with Admiration. But after six
months Siege, the same fate which attended him at <hi>Pettely,</hi> follow'd him
at <hi>Cassilinum,</hi> and though the Famine was extream pressing, yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
notwithstanding they were under the command of <hi>Marcellus</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for his Courage, the Sword of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, by the Dictators
going to <hi>Rome</hi> to take new Auspices) yet he durst not hazard a battel for
their preservation. The Inhabitants and Soldiers of the Garrison (for
all <hi>Perolla</hi> scorn'd it) finding their sad condition, privately offer'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
upon Quarter, which would not so much as be listn'd unto by
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> for their abrupt breaking off their first Treaty, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Forces reliev'd them. At last, though they receiv'd some
Provisions which <hi>Marcellus</hi> in Barrels sent them floating down the River
<hi>Vulturnus,</hi> yet that stratagem being too soon discover'd, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to feed upon Mice, Rats, and such Roots as they could dig out of
their Counterscarfs and Meadows under their Walls, which being perceiv'd
by the <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> he caus'd all those Fields to be plow'd up, but
that was no sooner done, than <hi>Perolla</hi> and his <hi>Pettelines,</hi> by a Sally, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Seed in their Enemies labour. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being told it, only spoke
these few words. Must then that which I design to strave the <hi>Romans</hi>
with, prove their Harvest? and immediately sent <hi>Manitius</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi>
Blanks, to write their Conditions in, which they (being as invincible in
Civility as Courage) return'd, and immediately came out without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any: His usage indeed was generous, but he would not see <hi>Perolla,</hi>
lest (as he said,) his Passion might force him to that violence, which his
Reason detested. <hi>Hannibal</hi> thus became Master of <hi>Cassilinum,</hi> yet at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into it, he solemnly vowed, he was more troubl'd to have <hi>Perolla</hi> for
his Enemy, than pleas'd with his Victory. As for the Garrison, they march'd
directly to the Dictators Army, where <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Son was receiv'd both
by him (who was then return'd) and by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which relisht nothing of the hatred they paid his Father. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
too to gratify him, order'd that all his Soldiers, during their lives,
should have double pay, and though they needed such courages, yet they
gave them five years vacation, and for his own particular, they order'd his
Statue to be be erected in <hi>Preneste,</hi> which was the next considerable
Town: but he with a Modesty, great as his Merit, refus'd it himself, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96335:60"/>
had that Honour plac'd upon <hi>Manitius,</hi> thereby declining the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
increasing his Title to it. <hi>Perolla</hi> having by such memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
run through his Prentiship in Arms, was very desirous to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Father, who he was confident had buried his disobedience in those
generous Actions which had proceeded from it. <hi>Pacuvius</hi> then liv'd in
this City, (which was under the command of <hi>Hannibal</hi>) and because his
Sons Actions had been as fatal to the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> as advantageous to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> he resolv'd to perform that visit and duty with as much secrecy
as was possible, therefore he came late alone into the Town, lest a Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
might give some suspition of his quality, and discover what he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to conceal; but as he crost a Street that was not far from <hi>Blacius</hi>
his House, he perceiv'd, (by the light of a couple of Torches which lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground, by the death of two had carried them) a Gentleman, who
with much courage oppos'd himself against four that assaulted him, the
inequality of the number, and the courage of the Defendant, made <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
(who never valu'd his life in the protection of the oppressed) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to help him, that so highly needed it, and truly, had he never so
little longer delay'd his assistance, he had been onely obliging in design,
for by that time he was lighted from his Horse, and had drawn out his
Sword, one of the four Assailants had gotten the single Gentleman under
him, and was seeking out the defects of his Coat of Mail, to have taken
away his life; But <hi>Perolla</hi> by a powerful stroke, cleft the wretches Head
in two, and whilst his companions were amaz'd at so unexpected a relief,
and so fatal a blow, <hi>Perolla</hi> gave my Father (for it was he indeed) leave
to get up, and then presenting him with the Sword which he had lost by
his fall, told him, Here (Sir) the gods will defend your quarrel, which
I judge is good, because your enemies relye onely on the number for
their success: <hi>Blacius</hi> had no time to make him any return of this civility,
for the three Murtherers having resign'd their admiration to take up their
first resolution, fell so vigorously upon my Father, and his generous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that had they not been under the protection of Divinity, they had
certainly miscarried: But <hi>Perolla,</hi> who had to deal with two of the three,
received some wounds, which yet were so far from endangering his life,
that they did but hasten the loss of theirs which had bestow'd them on
him; for with a furious thrust, he dispatched the most importunate of them,
and (in a word) after he had once again saved and reliev'd <hi>Blacius,</hi> they
made an end of the other too. As soon as my Father found himself freed
from his enemies, he came to <hi>Perolla,</hi> and told him, Sir, that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to you for my life, is not a greater truth, than that I shall never
make any scruple to lose it in your service, but lest my ignorance might
(when occasion serves) render me uncapable of paying you that debt, I
shall beg to be acquainted with your name, that by my future gratitude
you may be convinc'd, the obligations you have laid upon one that was
unknown to you, were not for all mis-plac'd, <hi>Perolla,</hi> though he knew
not my Father, yet not daring to discover himself, reply'd. The service
I have paid you, is so much the duty of one Gentleman to another, that it
merits not an acknowledgement; and to assure you, this is not a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but a Truth, I am resolved to conceal my Name, least by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you with it, you might imagine I expected some further return: then
desiring to know if he had any other Commands to impose on him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to take his leave: but <hi>Blacius,</hi> who admir'd his Civility as much as
Courage, could not satisfy himself with such an answer, and therefore
told him, I must rather believe, that some secret business draws you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96335:60"/>
and that not knowing who I am, you apprehend my privacy: if
this be the true cause, I beseech you remove it, for you could not think
me worthy your defence, if after having sav'd my life, you doubted I
could disclose any thing which might be prejudicial to my Protector.
<hi>Perolla</hi> was about to reply, when (alas) on a sudden, the fresh colour
in his Cheeks, began to wear Deaths Livery, his knees too to tremble, and
at last his Spirits failing, he fell (without speech or motion) at my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Feet, this sudden change made him suspect some private hurts were
the cause of it, he therefore open'd his Doublet, and immediately disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
a Sea of Bloud, which issued from a large wound that had pierc'd
his Body through and through. My Father instantly, with what Linnen
he could tear, stop'd the bleeding as much as he could, but having in vain
attempted to bring him from the swound he was fallen into, was running
to his own House, which (as I told you) was not far off, to call for help,
but he was not many paces in the way to this Duty and Charity, when
he heard one of the four Mutherers fetch a deep groan: The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
desire he had to learn from whom he had so narrowly escap'd, made
him pluck off the Vizard of him that was yet alive (for I forgot to tell
you they were all disguis'd in Antick Cloaths and Faces) who no
sooner receiv'd the benefit of the fresh Air, than he open'd his Eyes, and
gave some small symptoms of life, which though they were false ones, yet
he lived long enough to beg my Fathers pardon, and to acquaint him,
that <hi>Pacuvius</hi> had ingag'd them by excessive rewards to undertake their
crime. <hi>Blacius</hi> having receiv'd this information, went instantly to his
own house, brought some Servants with him, and by their help, carried
the generous <hi>Perolla</hi> home, whose wounds he caus'd the Chirurgions to
dress, before he would take any care of a slight one he had receiv'd. In the
mean time, the Alarm of my Fathers danger and return was brought to
my Chamber, as I was undressing my self; which I no sooner heard, than
I came running up, just as the Chirurgeons had by strong Cordials brought
<hi>Perolla</hi> to himself. My Father when I came in, led me to his Bedside, and
told me, if my life be any way considerable to you, you are indebted to
this Gentleman for it, who by the hazard of his own, has preserv'd mine.
Sir (I reply'd) I hope you have so just an opinion of my duty and
affection, as to think that question needs no answer; but as for this
Gentlemans Gallantry, I believe he will have no cause to repent it, if
at least by the hazarding onely of one Life, he thinks himself suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
recompensed by acquiring those of a whole Family. I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any of mine (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) that ever decline what you have
spoken, and for your particular, (addressing himself to me) I command
you to be as concern'd in him, as if I were in his condition, for I shall
judge of your respect to me, by your care of my Friend. Then embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Perolla,</hi> he told him, some importunate affairs, Sir, draw me from
you for a while, for which I must beg your Pardon, but till my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
I have injoyn'd my Daughter to supply my place. Madam, (said
<hi>Perolla,</hi> interrupting the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) I shall, with your permission,
acquaint the generous <hi>Spartacus</hi> what happen'd, whil'st I continu'd in
your Fathers House, which will not only ease you of some part of your
Relation, but inform you of particulars, which, which perhaps your
Modesty might injure you by silencing. <hi>Spartacus</hi> having made her
the same request, and obtain'd her leave, <hi>Perolla</hi> thus continu'd. Your
may (Sir) justly wonder, that to those high civilities of the perfect
<hi>Izadora</hi> and her Father, she acquainted you with none of my returns,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96335:61"/>
and truly, if she had, she must have made them her self, for I was so
ravisht with her Beauty, that all I then was capable of, was of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it: for though she was not then in that advantagious dress which
<hi>Rome</hi> so much commends, yet the habit she then had on, was order'd
with such a pleasing negligence, that no Art was able to equal it, and
if her Beauty had been of a nature which could admit of addition
by Cloaths, those she then wore (one thought) would have increast
hers. I must ingeniously confess, that coming from Death into so much
brightness I fancy'd my self in those Plains, where our Learned Men
make us believe we shall dwell after this Life; and I dare boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
if we believ'd so much real felicity there, as I then resented, that
place would be better inhabited than it is. I shall beseech you, said
<hi>Izadora,</hi> (interrupting him, and speaking to <hi>Spartacus</hi>) to remember
the acknowledgement he makes of his judgement being troubl'd, that
what unmerited raptures he delivers of me, you may attribute them to
their true cause, and not to that unto which he ascribes them. Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself unto <hi>Perolla</hi> (with a little smile) she told him, If the
use you make of my permission to tell part of our Adventures, be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus to abuse your friend, I shall immediately recall it, and rather
elect to injure our Story by my relation, than suffer those blushes which
your partiality will still create. Madam (said <hi>Spartacus</hi>) you are so far
above flattery, that whilst your generous Lover praises you all he can,
you need apprehend nothing, but that he will come short of Truth. To
which <hi>Perolla</hi> answer'd, (with a look that spoke his doubts, whether,
what <hi>Spartacus</hi> had said, proceeded from his Justice, or a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Cause) you have (Sir) in this, as fully declar'd my opinion, as if
we had but one Heart, and that too inspir'd with the same beauty, which
is so accomplisht, that if <hi>Izadora</hi> will forgive me all faults which detract
too much from her, I shall not need her pardon for those of a contrary
nature. <hi>Spartacus</hi> by a little redness, testified the construction he made of
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s first words, but the apprehension of being deceiv'd in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and the resolution he had taken up, of soon suppressing all suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that quality, made him continue silent, which invited <hi>Izadora</hi>'s
Servant to prosecute what he had begun. Since (said he) my want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
for so transcendent an object, and her commands do both bind me
from giving you a character of that by words, which your Eyes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to perform; I will onely acquaint you, That though I remain'd
a while without speaking, yet it proceeded not from any new fits of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but from having all my faculties employ'd, to receive those flames
she then shot into me; and truly I found the fire so pleasing, and so just,
that I made not any excuse for introducing it in the room of that Heart,
I had till then preserv'd for the fair <hi>Amazora,</hi> the difference betwixt them
being so great, that could I have suspended my Election, I should have
concluded my Judgement, as dead as the first object of my Passion. To be
brief, never Lover made more haste to fruition, than I to divest my self
of liberty; and never Slave receiv'd his freedom with more joy than I
resign'd up mine. But whilst I was in these first extasies, <hi>Izadora,</hi> who
mis-interpreted my silence, ask'd me whether I had a mind to take any
rest, for if I had, she would withdraw her self, Madam (I reply'd) if
you have a mind I shall take any, I must derive it from your Presence,
and not from your Absence, since the latter will be so far from giving
me any ease, that it will divest me of all. Truly Sir (she answer'd) the
condition you are in, methinks, may well dispence with civilities, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96335:61"/>
your wounds are too dangerous to neglect (out of a compliment) any
thing which may conduce to their recovery. If you mean (I reply'd)
those wounds I receiv'd in the Street, they are too inconsiderable to
purchase their ease by your absence: but if you intend those which
are given me since I came into this Chamber, I must then confess, I
would decline nothing, which might any way lessen their pain, or
advance their recovery; but I find by experiment, that their nature
is to be least troublesome, when the fair Enemy that made them, is
visible. I had not ended speaking, when I perceiv'd all <hi>Izadora's</hi> face
cover'd with blushes, and her Eyes arm'd with so majestick a Fire,
that I almost repented the disclosing of what I could not possibly have
longer silenc'd; but to disguise her disorder, she told me, I hope you
have receiv'd no wounds since you came into this place, if you have,
I dare assure you they were given without design. Alas Madam (I reply'd)
I am then the more unfortunate, and that which you apply for a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening,
is an increase of my trouble, for my condition is so singular,
that whereas in other cases, to hurt without design, is hardly an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in mine the contrary, is the greatest that can befall me. But yet
I may find some satisfaction, since custom enjoyns, wheresoever any
wounds are receiv'd, without an intention of giving them, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
which gave them as a mark of innocency, should endeavour their
cure, if it lyes in the givers power; permit me then to beg this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary
Tryal of the truth of your words, which is not called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
by me, but by my happiness. I esteem (answered <hi>Izadora</hi>) the
rule you speak of so just, that were it I, which have hurt you, and
that you shew me the wound, and prove your recovery in my power,
I would oblige my self to be your Physitian. Alas Madam (I answer'd)
the wound is in my Heart, and therefore not to be seen, but with the eyes
of faith, but if my assurance will not convince you of its reality, the
knowledge you have of your own Beauties, will doubtless effect it. I am
glad (reply'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) that your hurt being in a mortal place, you are
yet so well, which gives me some hope that the pain of your last wound,
is rather in imagination than reality: but if it be internal, as you alledge,
I dare not undertake to be your Chyrurgeon, for to discover the place
where you say your wound is, I must make a greater, than I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I shall find there. Though indeed, replyes of this nature are
not very pleasing in themselves, yet it was no small satisfaction to me,
for from them I flatteringly referr'd, if she had a design of declining
my Flame, I had spoken enough to acquaint her with it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
given her a rise to have mention'd her aversion from it, but
her imposing on my Words a meaning, which indeed they could not
well bear, and the troubling her self for their mis-construction, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me some hope, that they were not absolutely unpardonable. gods!
what extasies of joy did possess me, whilst I had that belief? and how
I blest my wounds, that were the happy cause of so pleasing (though
imaginary) a Felicity? But (alas) this was onely a capriciousness of
Fortune, who gave me a taste of Happiness, that the subsequent fear
might be the more intollerable: for the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> had forgot to ask of
<hi>Blacius</hi> my Name, which she acquainted me with, and which I look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as her desire of knowing it. This made me tell her, Madam, had you
had that curiosity whilst your Father was here, he could not have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
it: some important causes ty'd me to a concealment of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can your knowing it, be any way advantageous to your service,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96335:62"/>could I imagine it were, did the discovery bring more danger on me than
cowards fancy, I would embrace them all with raptures of joy; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
my life and sword may be more fortunate than my name by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
capable of serving you, if they be, I shall esteem both of them too
gloriously employ'd: And truly (Madam) the little desire I had to be
known, or continue long in this Town made me not inquisitive of your
Fathers, but since I find my felicity or misery depends upon one that is
of his Family, I shall humbly beg to be acquainted with it, and esteem
it a high obligation if at least my curiosity may not prove prejudicial to
him. Since (reply'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) you assure me, that my informing you of
it will oblige you, I am confident the concealment cannot be of more
consequence than the disclosure; and it is but reason that you should
know who is your debtor, his name is <hi>Blacius,</hi> How Madam (I hastily
reply'd) <hi>Blacius?</hi> the mortal Enemy of <hi>Pacuvius?</hi> Yes (said <hi>Izadora</hi>)
that <hi>Blacius</hi> is my Father, and he who you so lately oblig'd? and my
name <hi>Izadora.</hi> Ah Madam (I cry'd out, fetching a deep sigh) what is it
that you have told me? The fair <hi>Izadora</hi> and I were so perplext, she
at my exclaiming, and I at her information, that for a long while we both
continu'd in silence; which at last she interrupted by desiring to know
from whence my disorder proceeded, Alas, Madam (I reply'd) The
great friendship I have contracted with <hi>Perolla (Pacuvius</hi>'s son) is the cause
of my trouble; how can I but deplore his misfortune in having you for his
enemy; where your continuing so will (I fear) prove as great an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his felicity as I apprehend the contrary will be to your extraction.
If (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) you are so intimately acquainted with <hi>Perolla,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you inform me whether all those praises that are given him proceed
from justice or partiality, Truly Madam (I reply'd) the knowing of
him perfectly makes me unfit to resolve your question, for we were so
much one, and had both so much the same Soul, that I plac'd the self same
judgement on his actions which he himself did; and therefore you might
aswell hope to be satisfied of <hi>Perolla</hi> from <hi>Perolla,</hi> as by enquiring any
thing of him from me; but this I dare affirm, that had he once the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
I now have, he would have too the same inclinations; and if my
passion possest him, after seeing so much Beauty, it would be of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature to what has been hitherto common to his Family. You must
excuse me (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) if I believe he would prefer his duty before
any other consideration, but I would not a little rejoyce at the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for since his hatred to our Family is his crime, I would have his
love to one of it prove his punishment. Ah, Madam (I reply'd) are you
then determin'd to be cruel? Must <hi>Perolla</hi> have so hard a Fate, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his birth was unhappy, his life must be so too? Shall his misfortune
in being <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s son be esteem'd his fault; and, shall a Sin he derives
from his Father be more prevalent to create your hatred, than the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he has pay'd <hi>Blacius</hi> be to produce a contrary effect? My Passion in
this discourse transported me so far, that <hi>Izadora</hi> interrupted me by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The words which you now speak (Sir) would induce me to believe
that you are <hi>Perolla</hi> rather than his friend. Yes Madam (I reply'd, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down my Eyes, and trembling all over) I do confess I am <hi>Perolla,</hi> and
though at first I design'd not to acquaint you who I was, till my actions
had in some degree qualifi'd your aversion to my blood; yet I find you
have so transcendent an influence over me, that I could no more conceal
my Name than my Passion. This overture gives you power equal to
your desire of being reveng'd on our unfortunate Family. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96335:62"/>
(fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) that 'tis cruelty not justice, to ruine one who is so far
from resisting that he yields to your mercy. Whilst I was making this
declaration, I could plainly read the trouble of her mind in her looks;
sometimes methought they inclin'd to mercy, and then instantly they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
the contrary; at last my suspence vanish'd by <hi>Izadora's</hi> saying, I could
gladly wish I had continu'd still in ignorance of your condition, since
my knowledge of it reduces me either to betray <hi>Blacius,</hi> or <hi>Perolla,</hi> by
discovering or concealing him. Madam (I reply'd) he keeping of my
name secret is not of much importance, for if you now receive my Flame
I shall embrace all dangers, and care not who knows me when I bear the
glorious title of <hi>Izadora's</hi> Servant: and if you reject it, 'twill be an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to let your Father know who I am, since I may hope from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
and hatred that cure my deplorable condition will so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
want. <hi>Izadora</hi> (as she since assur'd me) was offended that I had
the confidence in so short a time to desire an acception of my affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that she answer'd me briskly; <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s son, who is an enemy to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
must not here expect to be cur'd of any other wounds than those
he receiv'd in defending the chief of it; and though your presumption
merits my highest revenge, yet the consideration of what you have done
for <hi>Blacius.</hi> will make me preserve your life in not disclosing who you are.
She had no sooner done speaking, but she rose up, and was going out of
my Chamber, when I cry'd out to her, Stay, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> and see my
life depends not on your silence, but on your approving my passion, which
though you have so cruelly rejected, yet you shall find I have so much a
higher concernment for all your interests than my own, that I will wash
away in my Blood my presumption and unfortunate extraction; and since
you have declar'd <hi>Perolla</hi> to be your Enemy, you shall perceive I will
use him at that rate. <hi>Izadora</hi> at these passionate expressions turn'd about
again; but when she saw me pulling off my plaisters, and tearing my
wounds, she ran to my Bed-side, and falling on her knees, with a throng
of sighs and tears she begg'd me not to be my own executioner; and if
any words she had spoken were the unfortunate cause of so fatal an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
she would recall them.</p>
               <p>What need I tell you more (generous <hi>Spartacus</hi>) than that my despair
was the way to my felicity, and that my design of killing my self pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
my life by obtaining the fair <hi>Izadora's</hi> permission of making my
addresses to her. But to lessen this excess of joy, I suspected for a while,
that my apprehension of being unfortunate had like to have made me
really so; and the way I had chosen to end my misery had almost created
it; for in my despair I had so increast the danger of my wounds, by using
them as I thought my condition then requir'd, that though the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
came hastily to bind them up, yet they could not undertake for
my life, till they saw what operation that dressing would have, and to
free me from all noise, that I might take a little sleep, <hi>Izadora</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
to withdraw, which before she did, she came to my Bed-side, and
told me softly, I hope what I have already done, has divested you of
all thoughts of violence on your life, if it has not, remember that you
cannot make any attempts against it; but I shall consider them as offer'd at
mine. Madam (I reply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, kissing her hand with transports) what you
have done, and what you have spoken, shall make me cherish as much
as even now I did detest it, and since 'tis so glorious to merit your care,
you cannot suspect it shall be deny'd mine. She was not long gone out
of my Chamber, when <hi>Blacius</hi> came home; and coming to see me, he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96335:63"/>
was inform'd my condition was such, that his visit would rather prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
trouble than a civility, which made him defer his design; but he went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>Izadora's</hi> Chamber, to learn the cause of my disorder; for he
was told she had not stirr'd out of mine since his going abroad; and that
no other had been witness of my actions. His fair daughter was somewhat
perplex'd at the question; but she assur'd him, to the best of her obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
it proceeded from a sudden distemper, wherein she told him the
truth, and yet conceal'd it from him. The next morning the Chirurgions
found the wounds of my Body (which held a strict sympathy with those of
my Mind) so hopeful, that <hi>Blacius</hi> was present when they were drest, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
an infinite satisfaction; and indeed entertain'd me with such tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
care and civility, that had I ow'd my usage to his knowledge,
and not to his ignorance of me, I had been in a felicity worthy of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.
But his affairs calling him away, his place was supply'd by <hi>Izado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
who acquainted me, that those Murtherers I had kill'd, had been for
certain hir'd by <hi>Pacuvius</hi> to make away <hi>Blacius,</hi> and that one of them
(as he lay weltring in his Blood) confest it to him, which was the cause
of his going out that night so late, that the examinations might have been
taken by one of the Magistrates, but at their coming, the party was found
dead. Ah Madam (I reply'd) how I apprehend my Fathers attempts will be
as cruel to his own son as the performance would have prov'd to his Enemy,
and that what he intended for the destruction of <hi>Blacius</hi> will cause <hi>Perolla</hi>'s;
for it is but just, that the daughter should right the Father on the Son of his
mortallest Enemy, especially since she has the power, and that <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for me (as he has often declar'd) is greater than that he has for himself
and consequently to afflict <hi>Perolla</hi> is the most sensible way of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
on his Father; neither can I expect a better Fate, unless <hi>Izado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi>
Goodness be as great as my Passion. I shall always (she said) know
how to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent; and therefore
will not involve the Son in the Fathers Crime, especially since the
gallantry of the former hinder'd the acted sin of the latter. Oh Madam
(I answer'd) How great were my felicity would <hi>Blacius</hi> practice the same
goodness. You need not doubt (she reply'd) in this last action, where
your Blood testifies your innocence; but for his antient hatred, I
fear his resentments. Alass (I cry'd out) I never have those thoughts
but I tremble, and would it might please the gods as the blood I have
spent already has purchast his esteem, so that the remainder were shed to
continue it after his knowledge of my condition. For I should think
my death glorious, could it wipe away the infelicity of my Birth,
and count it a greater happiness to dye with the title of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
Friend, than to live in the contrary misfortune. The fair <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
perceiving how I afflicted my self with those sad impressions, told
me, What I have already done may in some sort repress your fears, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is despair pardonable but where impossibilities turn it into reason,
a generous courage as <hi>Perolla</hi>'s should not antedate his troubles, for
sometimes our apprehensions make us miserable when our Fates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
the contrary. Those (I reply'd) which did flatter me would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
publish I had a courage above misfortunes, and I may justly say,
in all those dangers I have yet undergone, I never resented any thing
of fear, but what disasters my hard Stars impos'd on me, I found my
consolation and security in my resolution; yet in my present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether my fears proceed from some prescience of my ruine, or from
a diffidence of so great a felicity I know not, but this I am certain of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96335:63"/>
that I find something within, which never until now I entertain'd. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
(said the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) when I think upon <hi>Blacius</hi>'s hatred to your
Family, I have some little tremblings which I can hardly suppress; but
when I consider the services you have paid him, and those eminent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
you possess, I find no other way for the questioning your content,
than by doing the like, as well to my Fathers judgement as gratitude,
Madam, (I reply'd) I have nothing in me, nor have nothing for him
which might so much raise my ambition: but since you do not onely
command me to silence my fears, but alledge I have no cause to continue
them, I will obey you, since 'tis as impossible for me to erre whilst I do
so, as not to erre whilst I do not so. 'Twas with such pleasing discourses
as these that I past some days, and 'twas well for the torment of my wounds,
for no other charm had been of sufficient force to moderate their pain.
At last, Fortune began to cloud this little Sun-shine, for <hi>Izadora</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
from a friend of hers, that a great disorder was in <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s house,
by the arrival of a servant of mine (whom I would not permit to come
into <hi>Salapia</hi> with me, but had order'd him to follow, lest I might be the
likelier discover'd.) This servant assur'd my Father, that I was come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him alone into the Town, and that crossing a street upon the break
of day, he had found my Horse, and observed much Bloud had been there
spilt, but as for his Master, he could learn no news of him. This Lady was
one which had free access into both our Families, and having then
received some high disgust in <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s, told this secret to the fair <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
in expectation that it might come to <hi>Blacius</hi>'s knowledge, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
she easily fancy'd would induce him to make it publick, which
would at least have ruin'd me, if not my Father, for entertaining and
concealing me, but she knew not, that she told this news to one that
was better acqainted with the particulars of it than her self, and who was
not a little concern'd in this unfortunate life. But <hi>Izadora,</hi> (after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture)
came, and not onely acquainted me with this intelligence, but
advis'd me to make my self known to <hi>Blacius,</hi> for since the business had
already so much vent, if he came to learn it any other way, it might
be lookt upon at a rate that would extreamly aggravate his former hatred.
I must truly confess, had this advice proceeded from any other, I should
have found a strong opposal in my obedience; but she had such an
Ascendent over me, that in all her commands, how difficult soever they
were in themselves, I did not onely find Reason, but Power to obey
them; and in this injunction of hers, I had no sooner taken up my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
than I was furnisht with an opportunity to put it in practice;
For <hi>Blacius,</hi> who was always present at the dressing of my wounds, was
so sensible of the torment I endur'd, that he could not retain some drops
from stealing out of his Eyes, and as soon as the Chirurgeons were gone,
he embrac'd me, and said, If the gods (generous stranger) would grant
a power of transferring pain upon him that is most desirous of it, you
should quickly then resent none, but what your goodness for my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
could produce. Were that priviledge (I answer'd) bestow'd upon
me, my condition would not be at all improv'd, for that rule would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the sufferings where they are already; neither could they be remov'd
as you desire, without doubling my trouble, by afflicting me in that
which I am more concern'd in, than in my self. You are (reply'd <hi>Blacius</hi>)
so obliging, both in action and expression, that there is no way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
my debt, but by acquainting how I may pay some part of it.
When you speak (I reply'd) of being indebted to me, you do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96335:64"/>
mean to my Desires, and not my Actions, but because you are pleas'd
to stile the effects of my Duty, Obligations, I will not oppose that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
since to have rais'd it, is onely my ambition, but is besides, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
necessary towards the obtaining of a request I have to make
to you; a request of so strange a property, that the denial of it once,
will make me uncapable of ever asking it again, and the granting of it,
will never let me stand in need of asking any other. If (said <hi>Blacius</hi>
with some impatiency) the granting this desire be in my power, why
do you not name it? since to confer on you a concession of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and operation, will be a greater favour to the giver, than it can be
to the Receiver. 'Tis, Sir (I reply'd) that you would pardon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
extraction, and not esteem, that my fault, which is my misfortune.
An Extraction (<hi>Blacius</hi> answered) which has produced so much gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
cannot be low or inconsiderable, or if it be so in its self, your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
will change it into the contrary, but (he continu'd) I cannot fancy
why the granting of what you ask, can work so powerful an effect, as
even now you mention'd. Alas, Sir, (I reply'd) you mistake my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for I am born in a Family that is considerable enough, both for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
Honour, and Wealth, and indeed, has no other effect or unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
but what is caus'd by your aversion to it: I fear, after this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you can no longer doubt, but 'tis <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s I intend, whose
unfortunate Son I am. Is this (said <hi>Blacius,</hi> starting) to try how far my
gratitude can extend, or else is it a real truth? 'Tis the latter (I answer'd)
and though I apprehend by what I observe, that this discovery will prove
my ruine, yet I had rather derive it from my Extraction, which is a crime
I could not avoid, than by deluding you, which is a voluntary sin, and
consequently might justly authorize your hatred. <hi>Blacius</hi> having cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me a hundred furious looks, at last told me; You are then <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s
Son. Oh unjust Fates! must I owe my life to a cause which makes me
detest it? and must my misery be so great, that to have dy'd by the
hands of murtherers, hir'd by my enemy too, had been a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Is Life left me onely to know, that not to have been kill'd, was a
misfortune? Then folding his Arms one within the other, he fetch'd, (with
great steps) four or five turns about the Chamber and on a sudden,
striking one of his Hands upon his Breast, he continu'd, No, no, I am
not so wretched as my Passion would perswade me, for <hi>Pacuvius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was not only defeated, but was defeated by his Son: and <hi>Perolla</hi>
by receiving wounds in this Quarrel, wounds his Father, who cannot
consider the means, why his ends have fail'd, but the knowledge of the
former will increase the misery of the latter, neither can I justly complain,
when my mortal'st Enemy, instead of a pleasing revenge, embraces a
double affliction: besides, after knowledge of what <hi>Perolla</hi> has done, he
must either hate or love him, if the former, the intricacy is both admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and obliging, for the self-same action makes the Son preserve an
Enemy, and loose a Friend, and the Father loose his revenge upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
and his affection to his Son: If the latter, his being in a place
which forbids his visits and assistants, will be no small trouble, and the
doubts that I will take away <hi>Perolla</hi>'s life will be <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s torment whilst
he imagines his Son is living, and the knowledge when he is not so, will
continue it after he is dead; and since he lives more in <hi>Perolla</hi> than in
himself, his unequall'd treachery will justify my killing the most of him
that I can. After many such strange reasonings as these, he drew out a
Ponyard, and came towards me, to act what he had determin'd: I must
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96335:64"/>
confess I was somewhat startled at this proceeding, but when I consider'd
the averseness of his nature was such, that probably I could never obtain
his consent of possessing his excellent Daughter, I had no more the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
than the force to resist him, and therefore, just as he came to the
Bed-side, I uncover'd my self, and shewing him my naked Breast, I told
him, Here (Sir) this is the place you aim at, and therefore it shall not
be defended by me, I am guilty, because you think me so, and since I
am so miserable as to be hated by you, that death which you threaten
me with, will be a justice as to your revenge, and a charity as to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
That action and those few words produced a strange effect, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a suddain his high disorders began to lessen, his Face to dispel
those clouds which darkn'd it; and at length fetching a sigh from the
bottom of his Breast, he declar'd some expressions to this sence: What,
shall an intentional injury from <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> be more prevalent with thee,
than a real obligation from <hi>Perolla?</hi> shall the First-fruits of that life which
thou holdest from his generosity, be to take away his, which has given
thee thine? shall he be murther'd, because he hinder'd thee from being
so? and shall the residue of his Bloud be spilt by thee, when all he has
already lost, was shed for thee? besides, thou deriv'st the advantage thou
hast now over him from his protection, for had it not been for that, thy
death had taken from thee the Will and the Power of Revenge: Yes
(he continu'd, addressing himself to me, and sheathing his Ponyard)
you shall live <hi>Perolla,</hi> not only free from any attempt of mine, but secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
also, from my acquainting <hi>Hannibal</hi> who you are, from whose resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you might expect as hard a destiny as from <hi>Blacius</hi>'s, but the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
you have done the <hi>Romans,</hi> and me in particular, bind up my
Hands. There is (I reply'd) a third way of destroying me, as certain as
those two you have exempted me from, and that (Sir) is the denial of
my first request, which to disswade you from, I may truly prosess, that
all that bloud hated you, was spilt for you, for which I bless my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that made me perform what was good by losing that which is ill.
All my new Bloud I have bred up with such firm inclinations for you,
that had it deriv'd its original from your self, it could not be more at
your devotion: I must acknowledge too the justice of the gods in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
me receive those wounds which <hi>Pacuvius</hi> intended for you, and to
divert and reclaim him from such criminal designes, I shall make it my
constant Prayers, that they may all have the fate which this had, and
that by my sufferings I might prevent all those that are intended you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Blacius</hi> at these assurances, wholly banisht those cruel looks, which made
me so much suspect my fate, and with an obliging accent, conjur'd me
to tell him, what use I could make of his condescending to my desire.
I should then (I reply'd) by a continual succession of services have some
hopes to obtain your permission of making my addresses to the fair <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora.</hi>
(This spoke unadvisedly, having flatter'd my self into a belief,
that in the temper <hi>Blacius</hi> was in, I might procure some engagement
which his generosity (though he should afterwards repent) would not
permit him to recall: but alas! I soon found my expectation deceiv'd,
for after this declaration, in an instant he arm'd himself again with that
severe countenance he so late had laid aside, and with a Tone, as cruel
as his words, he told me, Is <hi>Izadora</hi> then the object of your design? 'tis
very like indeed, I should present her to his Son that executed her
Uncle, would have murther'd his Father, and who to satisfy a private
malice has given up his Countrey to the Enemies of it. These truly are
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96335:65"/>
obligations to court a Mistriss with. Sir (I reply'd, somewhat mov'd)
you still reproach me with anothers crime, if <hi>Magins</hi> was put to death
to please <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I made use of it in <hi>Pettely</hi> to raise him enemies: If
<hi>Blacius</hi> life was attempted, I preserv'd it by the hazard of my own:
and if <hi>Capua</hi> was deliver'd up to the <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> I became (to him
that did it) from a Son, an Enemy, and so wedded my Countreys quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
that thereby <hi>Hannibal</hi> lost more Men, than perhaps the taking that
great City would have cost him. I must confess (reply'd <hi>Blacius</hi>) you
have done much for me, and for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and upon both those scores
you have receiv'd no unfruitful return, since for those services you did
our Empire, I preserve you (not without an eminent hazard) from the
knowledge of the enemies of it: and for what you have done my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I suspend those resentments which your Fathers treachery highly
invites me to execute, and because my debt to you is a Life, (as I think
nothing can be a sufficient payment, but an obligation of the same nature)
so after your receiving that satisfaction, I can be no longer esteem'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to you. Sir, (I answer'd) if you will tye your self to what your
last words now profest, I shall as highly approve of your proceeding, as
of my own happiness, but your silencing of your own resentments, and
the concealing me from the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> is no preservation, unless you
permit me also to be a servant to the fair <hi>Izadora:</hi> That is the onely
means to save my life, and without it, all the other you can mention, will
be rather miseries than favours: neither can a man say, that he preserves
his Enemies life, because he exempts him from the Sword or Poyson, if at
last he makes him dyesome other way: what you have promis'd, only
frees me from two ways of ruine, to cast me into a third, that is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and painful than either: No, no, Sir (I continu'd) if you banish me
from <hi>Izadora,</hi> the highest effects of yours or <hi>Hannibal's</hi> hatred will be
pleasing, and cut me from those languishing torments your refusal will cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.
I have already told you (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) that you must not expect <hi>Izadora,</hi>
who I will sooner marry to her Grave, than to any enemy of your
Family; but because you shall have no occasion of condemning me of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
I will truly state those obligations you pretend to have conferr'd on
me, and those I have really plac'd on you. I acknowledge you sav'd my
life, and `tis likely I deriv'd that obligation from your ignorance, but
I did preserve yours after my knowledge of you; had you the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of oppressed innocency to procure me your assistance; I had a
just revenge to disswade me from pardoning you, and yet did it; The
glory of your action was your reward, but the mercy of mine, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
prove my punishment: besides, what you did for me, was no more
favour than to draw me out of a danger, wherein you had cast me, for I
had not needed the assistance of one of your Family, had not the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of the chief of it, been the occasion; so that you can never
mention the obligation you did me, without discovering your Fathers
infamy. As you sav'd me from murthering, so you hindr'd <hi>Pacuvius</hi>
from being a murtherer. You preserv'd my life from being a sacrifice
to violence, but by it you hinder'd your Fathers from being one to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and whilst you onely defeated him of his revenge, you exempted
him both from the guilt and punishment of of it: so that you have oblig'd
<hi>Pacuvius</hi> more than me. And since you pleaded that anothers crime
ought not to be accounted yours; so your Virtues ought not to be
attributed to your Family, to which I am so irreconcileable an Enemy,
that it lies not in the power of any one of it, to reconcile me to it. No,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96335:65"/>
young man (he continu'd) after what I have done, you cannot condemn
me of ingratitude, without practising your self, what you would blame
in me. Sir (I reply'd) though I believe I could answer all your objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet the means I must take to clear those already mentioned, will
create a greater than any I shall confute, which is my disputing against
you, but if all those arguments you use, be to prove your denying me
<hi>Izadora,</hi> is not an effect of your ingratitude, but your justice, I will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
confess it, and declare, besides, if you fancy otherwise, you do
as great a wrong to me, as you do to my Felicity, in refusing my passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
desires. I had no sooner ended those words, but that <hi>Blacius</hi> calling
the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> (who had been present at all this dispute, and in whose
face you might have known the several tempers of it) told her, I am glad
<hi>Perolla</hi> acknowledges my depriving him of his happiness is an action of
Justice, I hope then no man can condemn my revenge, when Justice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
with my inclination to confer it on me; I do therefore (<hi>Izadora</hi>)
conjure thee, by whose wrongs his Family has done ours, by thy Uncle
<hi>Magius</hi> Bloud, which <hi>Pacuvius</hi> sacrific'd to his hatred, by thy Fathers life,
which he would have destroyed upon the same score, and by the glory of
so sitting a revenge, scorn his Flame, and let him find in thy hatred, the
punishment of his Fathers to all thy Family. At this cruel command
the perfect <hi>Izadora</hi> became white as innocence, and after her disorder
was a little past, casting down her eyes to the ground, she thus reply'd.
Alas (Sir) your commands are come too late, for before I knew who
he was, I gave him so large at Empire over me, that 'tis impossible to
recall it; neither when I consider him bath'd in bloud for your preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
rejoycing at his wounds, because they hinder'd you from any that
were dangerous, losing his Father to preserve his Fathers enemy, and when
you assur'd me you would judge of my affection to you by that I should
pay him, I cannot repent what I have done, my friendship for <hi>Perolla,</hi>
is deriv'd from my obedience to you, and my gratitude to him; who can
then condemn a production from such noble causes? beside, he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that's enemy to us but his name, his actions are not, for by them I
enjoy a Father. Can you then have so low an opinion of my resentments,
as to believe any consideration can make me hate the giver of so great a
blessing? if then my affection for him be a sin, you will, I hope, pardon
it by the knowledge of what occasions it. I do therefore (Sir) conjure
you, by that precious life you owe his gallantry, by the Bloud of <hi>Magius,</hi>
he has so generously reveng'd, by those services he has paid our Empire,
and by the glory you will purchase by vanquishing your Enemy (as
you term him) without revenge; permit <hi>Perolla</hi> to divest you of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
opinion you have for all his Family, or to assume a confidence
by his repeated services, to remove that high aversion you have for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
extraction. Though these words in themselves were strangely
moving, yet they were deliver'd with an action and tone so compassionate
and ravishing, that no heart, which had not been harder than cruelty it
self, could have resisted them. But alas, they were so far from produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
any good effects, that <hi>Blacius</hi> with a look, that had all things of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
in it, told her, are you then so desirous to displease me, that to effect
it, you will become a friend to your Fathers enemy, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an enemy to him? will you ruine my happiness, to create <hi>Perolla</hi>'s?
and will you shew me the way to be reveng'd on his cruel Family, and
then hinder me from acting it? must that which deprives me of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
deprive me of my Daughter too? must the cause why I do not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96335:66"/>
punish my Enemy, be as great a misfortune to me, as that is which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids?
and to increase my trouble, must your affection and duty to me
(which were my highest felicity) be the occasion of my proportionate
misery? Ah <hi>Izadora</hi> (he continu'd, for I will no longer call you Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
will you then bestow your self upon this <hi>Perolla,</hi> when even now
he declar'd, that to be deny'd you was just? do you love injustice so
well, that in one action you will be unjust to <hi>Blacius,</hi> and to his Enemies?
and will you make such haste to pay a debt that is not due, by declining
one that is? Go barbarous Maid, unworthy of my Care (as well as Bloud)
I will inflict on thee no greater punishment, than the granting thy desires,
for when thy reason, or his embraces, has banisht or quencht thy impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
flame, thou wilt know and deplore thy sin, in preferring a Lover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Father. Go then, but for ever, and mayst thou never know what
happiness is, but avoid it. Finishing these words, he went out of the
Chamber, and left us in a perplexity, as great as his disorders; But before
I could speak to the fair cause of them, he return'd again, and thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his discourse to his excellent Daughter. No no, I have thought
better on't, for to cross a desire, though it be an ill one, is a revenge,
and 'tis upon that score you shall never see <hi>Perolla</hi> more, for whom, if
you continue your passion, you shall find from my justice (in separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you) as severe an affliction, as I can resent from your want of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by your union. Do not think to divest me from this determination,
for all your Tears and Prayers, will be as fruitless for your Lover, as mine
to you were against him. (Then addressing himself to me, he said) And
thou (cruel stranger) which by saving my life, hast made it my torment,
and for my unfortunate care in bringing thee here to heal thy wounds,
hast created as much misery in my Family, as there had been joy in thine
had thy Father murthered me, remember as soon as my Chirurgeons tell
thee thou art fit to travel, that thou quit my House, for if thou stayest
a minute longer, by that quiet thou hast rob'd me of, I'll sacrifice thy life
unto my just resentments. Then thrusting the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> out before him,
he went away in a rage, almost equal to mine at that inhumane action.
I will not tell you (said <hi>Perolla to Spartacus</hi>) all those expressions my
grief and anger extorted from me, whose greatness you may in some sort
guess, when I assure you I was so blinded with rage, that I made many
criminal designs against his Life, which was so much an Enemy to mine,
and had not my weakness hindred me, I had perhaps attempted that,
which if performed, had made me worthy of all those miseries his hate
has inflicted on me. But after this first heat was qualified, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that he was <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Father, banisht those criminal resolutions,
and struck me with so deep a grief, that my repentance had like to have
proved his revenge. But (to be brief) <hi>Strato</hi> (for so was my Servant
called, that follow'd me into <hi>Salapia</hi>) never left inquiring after me, till
by his diligence, he had gotten some suspitions, that 'twas I which had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Blacius,</hi> and was carried by him into his House; therefore to satisfy
himself, by a considerable Present, he obtained leave from one of my
Chirurgeons, to attend him as his servant, where when my wounds were
next drest, he discovered what he sought, and himself to me. I was not
a little over-joyed, by the finding out so faithful a Servant, and having
acquainted him with those several accidents which had be fallen me since
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eparation, I enjoyned him to try if he could possibly learn some
way how I might see <hi>Izadora,</hi> or convey a Letter to her; but though
his industry left nothing unessay'd, yet it proved absolutely fruitless,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96335:66"/>
for <hi>Blacius</hi> had so faithful and strict a Watch about her, that 'twas impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to corrupt or deceive them. But to increase the misery I then groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under, <hi>Strato</hi> (one day) told me, <hi>Pacuvius</hi> had discovered where my
retreat was, and how I endangered my own Life to preserve his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
with which he was so inraged, that he commanded him to tell me
as I had divested my self of all duty to him, so he had done the like of all
affection to me, and that if I had any reliques of respect for him, I should
shew it, by never coming into his sight again: he further told me, that
<hi>Pacuvius</hi> had once determined to acquaint <hi>Hannibal,</hi> how <hi>Blacius</hi> conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Enemy, but that the fear of my ruine which would be involved
in <hi>Blacius</hi>'s had restrained him. You may well believe, that this was no
small accession to my trouble, and truly I think had not I so great a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
as my belief of <hi>Izadora</hi>'s affection and constancy, I had sunk under
the weight of my misfortunes. At last, through the great care <hi>Blacius</hi>
Servants had of me, whether it proceeded from his generosity, to hasten the
regaining of that health I had lost from him, or from his revenge to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
me the sooner from being near <hi>Izadora:</hi> in spight of the indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my mind, that fatal day came, wherein the Chyrurgeons told me,
I might undertake a journey without any pain or danger, O how I curst
their skill that separated me from my desires! and how much more I had
valued their Ignorance than their Art. Before I went away, I sent <hi>Strato</hi>
to <hi>Blacius,</hi> to know if he would permit me to wait on him, and make him
those retributions which his care for my recovery merited; but he sent
me word, my abesence more than my presence, would better discharge
any debt I pretended to owe him, and that I could not more oblige him,
than by a sudden departure from that House, which I had flung into so
many disorders. I obeyed this cruel Message, and that night (for I durst
not stir by day, lest I might have been discovered) I quitted <hi>Blacius</hi>'s
House, neither did I visit <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> who I was willing should see I would
disobey him in nothing, since I did it not in an injunction so opposite to
my duty and inclination. I had not retired an hour in a friends House,
when I called <hi>Strato</hi> to me, and told him, I was resolv'd before I left <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapia,</hi>
to see the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> which I fancied could not be very difficult,
since she lay (for the coolness of the Lodging, it being then Summer) in
a lower Chamber next the Garden. <hi>Strato,</hi> who consider'd my safety above
my satisfaction, earnestly (though vainly) disswaded me from it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we went silently to the Garden door, which answered on a by-lane,
then having pickt the lock, I got in, and was conducted by <hi>Strato</hi> to that
window, where he assur'd me <hi>Izadora</hi> lay, I commanded him then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and give me warning, if he should discover any thing worthy my
knowledge: he was no sooner gone, but I walkt softly to the place he
directed me to, lest some company might have been with her, but as the
gods would have it, she was all alone (having retired her self into her
Closet which was joyning to her Chamber) there looking in, I discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her by the light of a small Taper, sitting on a Chair, leaning her Cheek
upon one hand, and wiping her Tears off with the other; I was amazed
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind her in such a posture, but suddenly my wonder was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
joy (at least as much as I was capable of, when she was so drown'd in
sorrow) finding by her discourse, that I was the object of hers. Alas (she
said, accompanying her words with a heavy sigh) perhaps at this instant
that I onely but deplore <hi>Perolla</hi>'s absence, I may have cause to lament his
death, through <hi>Blacius</hi>'s cruelty, by acting himself his revenge, or by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nibal</hi> the means to do it. Wretched <hi>Izadora!</hi> must the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96335:67"/>
whether thou art miserable make thy misery? and must thy doubts of
being unfortunate, render thee really so? No, no; I fear they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bare suspitions make me thus unhappy, but that my eyes weep by
Prophecy, what they must shortly by Evidence.</p>
               <p>I must confess, said <hi>Perolla,</hi> though it were a crime thus to intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her retirement, yet I found in that fin, a more obliging joy, than I
could in the reward of Virtue; and doubtless, I had longer continued
my transgression, had I not thought it a greater to leave her in a sadness I
could so soon remove: Therefore making a little noise, I told her, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if your apprehensions for <hi>Perolla</hi> be the blest and sad cause of your
Tears, you may now silence them, since he is in a condition of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
nothing but your disdain. Never, to my remembrance, did I see
so strange a surprize as those words were to that excellent Beauty
to whom they were spoken, who, though she a long time nicely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
me, yet could she not fancy I was <hi>Perolla,</hi> for her Father (to destroy
that friendship she honour'd me with) had given her so much cause to
despair for my life, that her sense could not convince her belief I was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
but at length her disorder was so far supprest, tht coming to the
window she askt me softly, whether I was really what I pretended to be?
and if I were, what made me so evidently endanger my life, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
hers? Madam (I reply'd) I am the happy <hi>Perolla</hi> (that which
I have heard since I came to this place, makes me assume that Title) and
I am come to know how you will dispose of a life, which you are pleas'd
to be so much concern'd in. You live then, gallant <hi>Perolla</hi> (she said)
and <hi>Blacius,</hi> after all his threatenings, has preserv'd your life. No Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I (answer'd) 'tis not <hi>Blacius,</hi> but <hi>Izadora</hi> which has done it; that
glorious confession she made him in my favour, was the essential cause of
it; all that <hi>Blacius</hi> did, was, that he kill'd me not, but 'twas his unequal'd
Daughter give me my life by giving me that which makes me value it;
and I should be more unworthy the gift, had the apprehension of any
danger hindered me from acknowledging at her feet, that as I hold it
by her, so I Will only preserve and employ it for her. If, said <hi>Izadora,</hi>
you had given me so large an Empire over you, before this visit, I should
have enjoyn'd you to trust my justice, in believing your goodness, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than thus hazard your safety for the expressing of it. Madam (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
I should more endanger it by going away without assuring you of
this duty, than I do in the paying of it, for that might have ruin'd me
in your good opinion, which I more fear than all that my Enemies can
act against me. You are (she answer'd) so deeply fix'd in my esteem, that
hardly any action of yours, much less one which hinder'd you from danger,
can prejudice you in it. But fair <hi>Izadora</hi> (I reply'd) may not your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hatred, my unfortunate extraction, and my own unworthiness, raise
your justice to the suppression of your present mercy, and the ruine of
my Felicity? Ah <hi>Perolla</hi> (she answer'd with a little blush) can you then
suspect my constancy? Silence I beseech you all such doubts, for you need
not fear I will commit a fault, in the which I shall find my punishment;
neither can you believe I will prefer any other before you, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as great a wrong to my judgement as my happiness: but (she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued)
may not I (<hi>Perolla</hi>) suspect, that <hi>Blacius</hi>'s cruelty may induce
you to withdraw your Passion from his Daughter? and that your revenge
may be more predominant than your affection? Madam (I reply'd) I
attest the gods, if my words have given you the least doubt, that I fear'd
you would prove inconstant, they did not express my meaning: for if I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96335:67"/>
have any suspition, 'tis not of your Virtue, but of my Felicity; and if
I were jealous of your change, I am not so rude or partial to my self, as
to call that your inconstancy, which would be but your justice; but if I
had had any suspitions of that nature, what you have been pleas'd to
say would make me rather cherish than condem them, since they are the
cause of my receiving assurances of an affection, as far transcending my
hope as my desert. As to those doubts you mention'd of your Fathers
hatred raising any resentments in me; I attest the self-same powers I even
now invok'd, that as long as I am blest with your esteem, I can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
neither of misfortune nor change; and though I have lost <hi>Pacuvius</hi>
and <hi>Blacius,</hi> yet when I consider what I have thereby obtain'd, I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
repent the purchase. We had certainly past the night away in so
pleasing a conversation, had not <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Woman interrupted it by
knocking at the Closet-door, and telling her, That <hi>Blacius</hi> at his coming
home (for he was then abroad) would doubtless visit her, and if he found
her up at so unseasonable an hour, it might raise suspitions, which would
hardly be supprest. This fatal summons I receiv'd with extream reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
but <hi>Izadora,</hi> who knew the truth of it, and who apprehended my
discovery; told me, 'twas time to retire, and having made me a thousand
protestations of her constancy, she strictly forbad me any such hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
visits, enjoyning me to go into the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and endeavour
there to get friends strong enough to suppress her Fathers aversion for
me: Then having setled an address for our Letters, I kist her fair hands,
and resign'd the Office of my words unto my Tears, which only assur'd
her, how cruel I esteem'd that separation. 'Twas in this sort, Sir, (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
<hi>Perolla</hi>) that we contracted an affection, which has cost us so many
miseries, and which I never deplor'd, but only for that share the fair <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
had in them; and though at this sad farewel I had abundant cause
to be highly satisfied with her ambition'd friendship, yet I have always
had a Genius so apt to torment me, that I found my misfortune in my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
the knowledge of her making my departure from her the more
unsupportable.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Izadora</hi> (who feared that the Relation of her Servants Life
might endanger it) put a stop to it by remembring him, that by their
contract he was to acquaint <hi>Spartacus</hi> with no more than what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in her Fathers House. <hi>Perolla</hi> with a look full of humility, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
her care, and by his silence, gave her a rise, thus to prosecute their
History.</p>

               <p>I Cannot resemble the greatness of that grief I resented
for <hi>Perolla</hi>'s departure to any thing more aptly than
to my joy and fear before it; and though <hi>Blaciu</hi>'s fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could have inflicted no cruelty on him which I should
not at least equally have participated, yet I may
justly profess my apprehensions for him were more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
than for my self, and that you may know they
proceeded as much from my Reason as Affection, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had removed his Lodgings to those over mine, and had set such
faithful and vigilant Centinels about me, that had not his then being
abroad, and their unsual neglect both concurred for <hi>Perolla</hi>'s safety, he
might have fallen into troubles, the thoughts of which has a thousand
times created mine; and he was no sooner retir'd than <hi>Blacius</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, where, with many expressions of gladness he celebrated
his Protectors remove, and enjoin'd me the like resentments for the same
cause: but though disobedience to Parents be a Crime, yet when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
the occasion of mine, I could not give it that Name; for I esteem'd
the object of my affection so deserving, that I had no way so justly to
merit my sufferings as by not resolutely avowing so pure and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Friendship. But whilst I was thus persecuted by the Enemy of
our affections, <hi>Perolla</hi> was persecuting him of our Empire. 'Twas he,
who under <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> recovered that <hi>Cassilinum</hi> by assualt
which was lost my Famine: 'Twas he, that during <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s sickness at
<hi>Nola</hi> reconquer'd the <hi>Samnites, Lucalians,</hi> and <hi>Appulians,</hi> by the loss of
25000 of the Rebels and <hi>Affricans:</hi> In a word, 'Twas he perform'd such
sublime Actions, that had I not known the Charms of his person and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
I could not yet have resisted those of his Fame. The Winter,
which succeeded this active Summer, <hi>Hannibal</hi> made <hi>Salapia</hi> his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters,
and though he had endeavoured by a world of civilities to make
a friend of <hi>Blacius</hi> (who <hi>Perolla,</hi> intent only on those accidents which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to his Amours had omitted to acquaint you, was invited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
into this Town by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> after it was his) yet the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of his Countrey, and <hi>Magius</hi>'s Blood were so recent in his memory,
that none of <hi>Hanniballs</hi> inticements could induce him to stifle his designs
of revenge; in order to which, he made use of the <hi>Carth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but yet lived under his Power, only to destroy it. But the time of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>'s
Consulship being expired, the Senate, to testifie the value they plac'd
upon his merit, elected his son to succeed him, and the Father, either
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96335:68"/>
to manifest the goodness of their choice, or to evince he believed who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they esteem'd fit to command in chief, he thought himself not too
good to serve under, procured a Commission from the Senate, to be Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General
to his own Son. It was worthy observation when the
Father came into the Camp, and the Son rode forth to meet him: Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the 12 Lictors, which carried Rods and Axes before the Consul,
suffer'd him in respect of his Age and Relations to pass by them on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
which was positively against the custom, and, which the Son per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
commanded the last of his Lictors to note it; who, thereupon
bad the old <hi>Fabius</hi> to alight, and come to the Consul on foot, which he
cheerfully did, and told him, 'Twas not son my neglect but my design,
to make tryal whether you understood your self to be what you are.</p>
               <p>I have related (said <hi>Izadora</hi> to my Prince) a particular, which though
it has nothing of connexion to our story; yet being in that time exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discours'd of, I hope 'twill procure your excuse. <hi>Spartacus</hi> having as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
her that she had committed no fault but in thinking she had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one, begg'd her to prosecute those Adventures wherein he took so
much interest and satisfaction. This young <hi>Fabius</hi> (she continu'd) was
General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army when <hi>Blacius</hi> had brought a design of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<hi>Salapia</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> into the Senates Power, to so much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that there wanted onely as much time as the acting it would
take up; The day which preceded that night, in which this Plot was
to be executed, my Father, who had covertly drawn the Consul with some
Forces near this Town, sent a Confident of his to advertise him, that at any
hour he should appoint, he had so many Partizans at his devotion, as he
could secure for him either the <hi>Samnite</hi> or the <hi>Brutian</hi> Gate, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
to know which of them would be most commodious for his attempt.</p>
               <p>This Agent returning about the dusk of the evening, unfortunately
met with a Commander of the <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> whose gate and habit was so
resembling unto <hi>Blacius</hi>'s that blinded with that, belief, he took him aside,
and told him, The Consul would not fail at midnight, and that the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
Gate would be most commodious. You may easily believe these
words did as much surprize the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> as the knowledge of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
error did afterwards him that had committed it: But the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
had too long follow'd the trade of War, not to conclude by what
had been said what was to have been done; which made him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
seize upon the unfortunate Agent, and carry him to <hi>Hanniball;</hi>
who, by exquisite Torments, forc'd him to reveal the whole Conspiracy.
This discovery was as pleasing to <hi>Pacuvius</hi> (who then was present) as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
for <hi>Blacius,</hi> who, with exceeding diligence, was by a strong Guard
violently carry'd into a Prison, which in the greatness of its horror
had this of advantageous, that it made Death a Comparative Good. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
for all sustain'd no loss but that of his hopes, for though he were in
Arms all night, yet by my Fathers committal, the Signal not being given,
(which was a lighted Torch our of a Turret Window) he conceiv'd the
design had vent, and so leisurely a little before day retreated to his
Camp. But alass, I was no sooner inform'd of <hi>Blacius</hi>'s sad Fate, then I
lamented him as dead, the knowledge of <hi>Hanniball</hi>'s vindicative Nature
justifying that prophetical way of grieving: but after I had moderated which
those tears my Sex and Relation render'd unavoidable, and that thereby my
Reason was less hinder'd from acting, I resolv'd to write unto <hi>Perolla,</hi> who
I knew was in the Consuls Army. The Letter I sent by a trusty Messenger, and
was to this purpose.</p>

to make his revenge appear rather the effect of justice than of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
proceeded against <hi>Blacius</hi> in the ordinary forms of Law; by which
he was condemn'd to lose his Head, and to have his four Quarters fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

this fatal Sentence came to my hearing, what did not I utter against <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s
Cruelty, and <hi>Blacius</hi>'s ill Fortune: But whilst I was in the midst of

                        <hi>BLacius,</hi> as he is a Friend to the <hi>Romans,</hi> cannot without a high Injustice
apprehend my not being his; But as he is <hi>Izador's</hi> Father he cannot
without a higher doubt of my exposing all that is most precious for him; and
though his severity has been somewhat great, yet his admirable Daughter by
a contrary extreme has so over-repair'd all his injuries, that the service I intend
to render him will relish as much of gratitude as obedience. <hi>Fabius,</hi> Madam, will
embrace your Fathers deliverance as he ought; and if his endeavors prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful,
I will either free him from so sad a destiny, or my self from the

               <p>Oh! How pleasing and forlorn at once was this Letter, I saw my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deliverance promis'd, but the way which conduc'd unto it was almost
as great a misfortune as it exempted me from: for I found I must hazard
all my felicity in attempting to save but a large part of it. Whilst I was thus
perplext, I was inform'd that the Consul had sent a Trumpet to <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
with an offer of all his <hi>Libian</hi> Prisoners for the redemption of <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and a deep protestation in case he executed him, that he would give
no Quarter to those he had already, nor any others in the future. To
the first of which, the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> reply'd, That he valu'd the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Justice more than the <hi>Romans</hi> could the saving a Traytor, and
upon that score he would not pardon <hi>Blacius</hi>'s life for a few Prisoners,
who being so merited to continue so: And as to his latter threatning, he
believ'd it was sent when he remembred not <hi>Cannes, Trebia, Tissinum,</hi> and
<hi>Thrassimene:</hi> and though <hi>Fabius</hi> by executing those he had then in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
would sooner free him from a trouble than give him any; yet he would
consider that action as 'twas intended, and vindicate himself at that rate.
In a word, he sent him a positive answer, That all the offers or threatnings
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96335:69"/>
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> no not the saving his dear Brother <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s life (were it
in their power) should tye up his hands from so just and necessary a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
I was further acquainted, that <hi>Hanniball</hi> had given order before
the Trumpet was withdrawn, to have a Scaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old erected in the Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
and had sworn by the glory of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and his Fathers Memory,
(Oaths which he held in greatest veneration) That before two days were
ended, <hi>Blacius</hi> should receive the reward of his Infidelity. I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
too impertinent, did I acquaint you what sad operations this cruel
Sentence produc'd in me: it shall suffice to tell you, that my weeping in
the apprehensions of my Fathers death had well-near caus'd my own, and
that I had shed so many antedated tears for it, that had the cruel <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
seen them, they would doubtless have quench'd his rage. But whilst
I abandon'd my self to a grief, that was as just as great, the Night arriv'd
which was the Eve to that fatal Day; and as the horror of darkness is
always apt to raise in us dismal imaginations; I fancy'd the unfortunate
<hi>Blacius</hi> all pale and bloody coming to my Bed-side, and after he had
view'd me, with a look which had almost reduc'd me to the condition he
was in, he told me, Behold <hi>Izadora,</hi> behold these several wounds (which he
open'd so wide, that his Soul, had it yet inhabited his Body, might have
come entire out of the least of them) though they are full of torment,
yet I have forc'd my self to travel from the <hi>Elizium:</hi> where I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the reward of my fidelity to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of my Martyrdom
under <hi>Hanniball,</hi> to come and conjure thee by the duty thou owedst me
before I was a Ghost; by the joy I have left, and the pain I shall suffer
till thou grantest my request: now thou art at thy own dispose, never
shew thou hast that power by giving thy self to <hi>Perolla;</hi> but as thou art
Heir to our Blood, be so also to our generous resentments, and let him
find that revenge in thy beauty and disdain which he thought he had
avoided by the extinction of our Family: if thou grantest me this, the
blessed Plains cannot afford me equal satisfaction; but if thou deny'st it,
all the felicity of that place will lose its quality; and where others find
their happiness, I shall torment. These words methought were spoken
with Eyes swell'd with Tears, and with an accent so moving, that in my
life I never was in a higher perplexity: I began a thousand times to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
those learned Men which taught us, that the felicity of the other
life is so perfect an extasie of joy, that it needs no foyl to set it off;
and that they in it are no more sensible of any concern for us here than
we are capable of conceiving their felicity there; when alass to my cost
I found one there not only retain'd an unjust desire of Revenge, which
poyson'd all other delights, but also prosecuted a virtue here which was
to possess the highest Empire there: and I esteem'd it one great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the other World, that those in it were confin'd to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but by having a liberty of going from their own, they could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ruine, or at least interrupt ours. Oh, How I did also inwardly exclaim
against my Fathers Tyranny, who pretended a power over me after that by
death the Bond was cancel'd, that that he would be so much an Enemy
to my felicity, as to deprive me of mine he would involve himself
in the like Fate. But whil'st I was preparing such an answer for this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ghost as might render my disobedience a justice, I was diverted by
a noise so confused and loud, that that death it seem'd to threaten had been
rather to be elected than avoided, since therein I had been exempted from
hearing so much horror. After half an hours suspence and fear, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of my Fathers came into my Chamber with a lighted Torch,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96335:70"/>
and to remove my doubts, told me, he believ'd that 'twas some false alarum,
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had given to try the readiness of his Soldiers; for there
was no Enemy near enough to give him a true one; and whil'st he was
fortifying this conjecture by some other allegations, we heard a noise in
the Garden; and suddenly after I perceiv'd a Gentlemen all arm'd and
cover'd with blood coming towards me, and leading another, whose hands
were loaden with Irons. As soon as the first was come to my Beds-side,
he kneel'd down and told me, Your commands, Madam, have not onely
given me the desire, but the power to serve you; and since my hazarding
a life that I fear is but indifferent, to you I have preserv'd one that you
highly value, I shall find in the action the Reward. Then rising and
turning towards the Prisouer, he continu'd, You are at liberty, Sir, and if
I had had the power to free you from your Chains as well as from your
Prison, you had long ere now been eas'd of that burthen; but that office
I must leave to some happier hand, lest by my continuance here the joy
of your freedom might be extinguish'd by your knowledg of him that gave
it you. Then faluting us with a humility as great as his obligation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staying for any answer, he went out of the house the same way he
came in; and left us in so deep an astonishment, that for a long while we
could not get out of it. The first thing I perceiv'd after my amazement
vanisht, was, that the fetter'd Prisoner was <hi>Blacius;</hi> ah! How pleasing
was that surprize? and how I detested my disorder, which had so long
suspended and separated me from my joy, which wrought so powerfully
on me, that forgetting the posture I was in, I flung my self out of my
Bed, and at my Fathers feet, by a thousand irregular actions testified the
greatness of my satisfaction; which the more I reflected on, the less cause
I found to suppress any effects which proceeded from or illustrated it;
neither can my amazement for the greatness and suddeness of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be attributed to the weakness of my Sex, since <hi>Blacius,</hi> whose
courage had out-brav'd many dangers, resented a resembling one: And
'twas a long while and by many extravagancies that I withdrew him from
his; which when I perceiv'd entirely vanisht, I embrac'd his knees and
cry'd out, You are then alive, Sir, and the gods have heard my reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
prayers and tears for your deliverance. Yes, <hi>Izadora</hi> (he reply'd) I
am once again at liberty, and doubtless owe that blessing immediately to
those powers to whom thou hast address thy weepings; for certainly those
prodigies of valor acted for my relief were too much transcending a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
strength: But alass (he continu'd, turning about, and perceiving
none in the Chamber but his unfortunate Daughter) What is become of
my Protector? He is gone Sir (I answer'd) and his departure has left as
high a testimony of his modesty here, as even now he did of his valor
in the Prison. His modesty (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) is as injurions as his courage
was obliging; for in acquainting me with a new Gallantry, he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
me of expressing my gratitude for the old. If (I reply'd) he could
but hear your resentments in his favour, I am so well acquainted with
his disposition, that I dare assure you he would esteem not only too plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
a reward for what he has already done, but for those services he
hopes to pay you in the future; but the apprehension he had that the
same fate which attended <hi>Perolla</hi> might wait on him, and that what his
valor did create, your knowledge of his condition might destroy, made
him so suddenly vanish, and rather elect to leave you a good opinion of
him by not knowing his Name, than hazard the contrary by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96335:70"/>I am then (he reply'd) still so unhappy, that to know, and not to
know to whom I am indebted for my life must prove an equal misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
No, no, <hi>Izadora</hi> (he continu'd) I conjure you by all the gods,
if you are acquainted with my Deliverer, and would have me relish
what he has given me, inform me who he is, and where he resides, for
rather than leave him so ill a character of my resentments, I will repeat
greater dangers than he has freed me from; and to assure him of my
Gratitude, I will undertake (it may be to perform) actions of as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
a quality as those which created it: This I command you as a
duty, and this I beg of you as a charity; neither can you suspect in this
discovery the same destiny which attended <hi>Perolla,</hi> the difference of the
action justly silencing those apprehensions, For though it be true, that
the ends are the same, yet the ways are extremely different: <hi>Perolla</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
was surpriz'd into his gallantry. This acted it with premeditation,
that freed me onely from the hands of an apparent violence, but this
from a seeming Justice: That did but the duty of every man in suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Murtherers, who are the destroyers of humane Society; and who
knows whether his seeing my distress did not put him in mind of what
his own might be as soon as my death had given those that were acting
it in the liberty and the power, and so, that which you term his giving
me life, might be in order to preserve his own; But this generous Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had no motive to invite his assistance but his gallantry, which makes him
attempt an action, where the undertaking of it is as great a wonder as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
and has thereby so bound me to gratitude, that I believe were
it <hi>Perolla</hi> that had thus obliged me, I should almost suppress my just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
for his Family, and that performance which gave me my life and
liberty, might give him my affection and friendship. Sir (I reply'd)
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s actions are of too high a quality to need any commendations
but what they carry in themselves, but were not my duty more prevalent
with me than truth, I should perhaps aver that your comments can no
more diminish their natural luster than mine can add unto it; but since
you are pleas'd to place so right an esteem upon this Strangers services,
and express as earnest a desire of knowing as of being grateful to him,
I will no longer conceal him: 'Tis <hi>Perolla,</hi> Sir, That same <hi>Perolla,</hi> whose
former obligations you have lessen'd but to increase the present; 'Tis he
whose gallantry, were it capable of being supprest, had doubtless been
so by your ingratitude; (Pardon me if dare say what you did act:)
But he from your cruelty deduces arguments to convince you of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and friendship, by not declining your preservation, when dangers
as great as your hatred threatned whosoever should attempt it: 'Tis then,
that he with an unimitable virtue exposes his own life to redeem yours,
which by a sad experiment he knew was the chiefest obstruction in his
felicity. Give me leave Sir too, a little to repine that you could fancy
any other could undertake and act so much for you; and certainly were
not your judgment clouded with a prejudicated opinion of him, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of the performance, and the modesty and humility of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
would have been a certainer information than my words that it was
<hi>Perolla;</hi> in whose behalf I beg you to practice (now you know him)
what you promis'd when you only knew his services; for all returns but
that of your affection and friendship will be as short of his merit as both
those will abundantly reward it. <hi>Blacius,</hi> when I had ended speaking,
after having fetcht two or three turns about the room with an angry
look, reply'd, I should have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooner known 'twas <hi>Perolla</hi> by the great
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96335:71"/>
rate you set upon his services than by the services themselves; and if I
plac'd a higher Character on them than they merited, 'twas only to draw
a confession from you, which I thought nothing else could perform: My
design has succeeded; and in those very expressions which you intended
should create my affection for your lover, I perceive the continuation of
yours to him, and in so high a disobedience to my commands, that that
death I am freed from, turns to a misfortune, and forces me to tell you,
if you persevere in this criminal passion, I shall embrace <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
rather as a cure than a punishment. Alas Sir (I answer'd, exceedingly
surpriz'd) Must then <hi>Perolla</hi>'s saving your life, and my gratitude for it
be look'd upon as Crimes? And must an obligation from an enemy, which
should raise the greatness of it, turn it to an offence? Since these are the
constructions you make of his actions, 'tis high time for him to despair:
since 'tis as impossible for him not to offend you (if obligations be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
as for you with justice to give his performances that name. If
what he has done for me (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) be an obligation, from thence
you may derive a proof of my affection to you, which had rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the name of ungrateful, than by giving you away free my self
from that aspersion. But do not proceed in this disputing against my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
which may force me to hate what I desire to love. You are too
just (I reply'd) to hate without a cause, and 'tis on that assurance I dare
become <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Advocate, since his fear of offending you makes him
decline being his own: do not then, Sir, employ that breath he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to destroy him that gave it you; his service merits an esteem, if
not a reward; and it may be, others will say you do as high an injustice
in thus using your Deliverer, as he did that put you in a condition to
need his help. To which <hi>Blacius</hi> told me, That Life which is now (I
hope) out of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s power, and which you say I owe <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to me, was rather an argument of his own to himself; he knew
the justice of those resentments I had for his could not be silenc'd but
by actions as great as those which created them, and that whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd,
he could no more obtain my permission of possessing you, than you
without it; so that my deliverance being the best way to that end, he
perform'd it, and thereby no more oblig'd me than a Passenger does the
Commander of a Ship, by saving what could not perish without invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him in the common ruine, so that his being a friend to himself only
made him a friend to me. Sir (I reply'd) he that sav'd your life once,
and could not by that obligation suppress your hatred, had no reason, by
a repetition of that favour, to expect a better return; so that his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
convincing him your aversion was not to be taken away, he might
have sufffer'd your life to have been so by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had both the
power and will to do it; especially, that being the onely obstacle to his
desires, had not his affection to one of your family inclin'd him upon that
score to love all of it; This gallantry shews so handsomly, that I hope
'twill invite yours to an imitation, especially too, since by the effects of it
you receive a benefit whose greatness cannot be equall'd, but by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
which makes you endeavor his ruine that conferr'd it on you. He
that by saving my life (said <hi>Blacius</hi> extremely mov'd) found in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a gratitude so extraordinary as to suppress a revenge (where my
power to perform it was not greater than the justice which invited me to
it) might reasonably hope that by a succession of services of that nature
I might in time be induc'd as well to silence my hatred as I had my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
so that what you attribute to my Enemies gallantry, might be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96335:71"/>
better ascrib'd to his reason and judgement: My death too had been so far
from freeing all his obstructions, that it had but created greater, for I had so
order'd it in my Will, that if you had married him, you should have
broke those Tyes and Conjurations which had render'd you unworthy of
his Bed; or if his Passion had attributed your want of duty to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be a higher argument of your affection to your Lover,
yet you should have brought him nothing but the bare <hi>Izadora;</hi>
for apprehending by what you have done, what you might do, I had
(upon so transcendent a violation of those commands, which I would have
seal'd with my last breath) given to another all my estate, which I believe
(whatever advantageous and partial opinion you have of your self) makes
<hi>Perolla</hi> as much your Servant as your Beauty. If no one (I reply'd) had
a greater value of me than I have of my self, <hi>Perolla</hi> would soon have as
low an opinion of me, as you have of his Services; and truly when I
consider the largeness of your Fortune, and the little Title I have to any
perfections which are capable of inviting so transcendent a happiness as
his Affection, I am apt enough to believe I derive that felicity from the
first of those motives; but on the other side, when I reflect upon those
sacred protestations he has made me, that his passion was created, and is
nourish'd by my Beauty and Vertue and from no secondary causes, I am
inclin'd to believe any thing, rather than that he dissembles; especially,
since in not crediting his vows, I cannot injure him more than I do my
own felicity. At this reply, <hi>Blacius</hi> could no longer suppress his Choler,
but with Eyes and Looks, which had terrified me in a Cause, less just than
I now defended, he told me, You are not then only contented to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a criminal Flame in your Heart, but you must publish it too; and
to raise your insolence to an inaccessional height, you voluntarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that you find your contentment in that which divests me of
mine; but since by your disobedience you will force me to use my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
power, I will make you e'r long not only know, but practise your
duty. Finishing these words, he went out of my Chamber, and left me
in as great a trouble at his rigor, as he could resent for my constancy:
I must confess, that my Affection made me say things which I should have
condemn'd upon any other score, and which after my resentment was a
little over, I endeavoured to wash away with Tears: But no passions of
Love or Repentance were hardly more predominant in me, than those of
Rage and Fury were in <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who could not reflect upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done his Authority and Revenge, by forcing a Prison in his Head-Quarters,
and taking thence his capital Enemy, upon the Eve of the
Execution, which <hi>Perolla</hi> had done by surprize, and by the assistance of a
few resolute friends he had in <hi>Salapia,</hi> who were all disguis'd as well as he,
without abandoning himself to an excess of choller, which made him
utter things unworthy his Place and Reputation: neither for two days
together could those which had most intimacy and power with him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of him to appear in publick, or so much as to take sufficient nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
to preserve Nature; nor had his despair been so soon vanquisht,
had not his Officers engag'd themselves, not only to find out the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but the Prisoner too, if he would publish a Proclamation, which
might promise large Rewards to those which should effect either; upon
which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> set forth a <hi>Manifest</hi> of this Tenor.</p>

can be of a higher than to pardon it, that same clemency which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
us heretofore, not only to forgive <hi>Blacius,</hi> but restore him
to his Estate, might have now again extended it self to him: But our above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specified
Principle, and his unparallel'd Treachery, makes him so unfit for a

involv'd others in his offences, that he has (in having forc'd our Prisons by

               <p>I Know not whether the promise of so unlimited Rewards, or the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the gods (who would not let <hi>Blacius</hi> enjoy that liberty he
had been so unthankful for to the Bestower of it) was the cause of his
discovery; but two days after he had relisht the blessing of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he lost it again by a Squadron of Soldiers, who violently breaking
open the doors, went so directly to a secret Vault, where he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
himself, that it manifested their search for him proceeded from their
knowledge, and not from their suspitions; from thence they conveyed
him bound in Irons (and with words as ill to be digested as their usage)
to <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s own Lodgings, where a Guard of barbarous <hi>Affricans</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come from <hi>Carthage,</hi> were set over him, who no more understood the
<hi>Roman</hi> Language, than what belong'd to Humanity. For <hi>Hannibal,</hi> you
may (in some sort) guess at his joy by what his trouble had been; but
for my part I was so drown'd in sorrow, that when you can imagine the
highest operation of grief, I can truly affirm mine did make that good.
And indeed, when I considered my unfortunate Father in the hands of
those whose fury would not be quencht but with with his Bloud; and
that <hi>Perolla</hi>'s usage made me esteem it as high a sin to engage him in any
further attempt for <hi>Blacius</hi>'s relief, as my ignorance where he was, made
it impossible to send to him; I found in my Judgement and Duty, such
strong arguments for sorrow, that I had no way better merited the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
than not to have deplored it in the sublimest degree.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the cruel <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> to avoid all accidents,
and to hasten the satisfaction of his Revenge, caused my Father the
next day, to be brought with ignominious cruelty, to a Scaffold he had
erected in the Allarm-place, and as well to avoid those tumults which
the <hi>Salapians</hi> affection to <hi>Blacius</hi> might raise, as to satiate his Eyes
with his Enemies Bloud, he had raised another Scaffold near the first,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96335:72"/>
and there waited on by his Guards, be intended to become a Spectator
of that execution, of which he had been the Judge. Whilst these things
were performing in publique, an antient friend of <hi>Blacius</hi>'s came to visit
me, and to give me that consolation my duty and affection so abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wanted. After some discourses of a nature fit for the subject, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inquisitive, whether the Revealer of my Fathers retirement was not
yet found out? To which he answered me, that though he had declin'd
no ways imaginable for that discovery; yet his endeavours had been
fruitless, but (he continued) though I cannot tell you the offender, yet
I can (I am confident) shew you the cause of the offence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
pull'd out the Copy of that Proclamation, I even now acquaint
you wit. Though my grief were of a quality which hardly permitted my
Eyes to do any thing but weep, yet (as the gods would have it) I
stopped a while their employment, to read that fatal Proclamation, which
as soon as I had ended, I reflected upon some words in it, that I thought
might prove of great advantage to me, and immediately after, asked
this charitable friend, whether he thought the execution were yet done?
To which he answered, he was confident it was not, for just then he
came from the place where it was to be performed (his antient friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
rendring him uncapable of seeing such a Spectacle) where some of
the assistants had told him, the usual Ceremonies that are practised in such
Cases, would take up at least an hour, which was not yet half expir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this assurance with exceeding joy, and immediately conjur'd him
him to conduct me to the cruel <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who he had told me, was an
assistant at <hi>Blacius</hi> Tragedy. The good old man would have disswaded
me from seeing an object which would but augment my grief, but I
begg'd that favour of him with such earnest words and expressions, that
at last he yielded to me, but it was so long e're I could vanquish him,
that what he designed for a proof of his care, had like to have produced
a strange and contrary effect. For just as I came under the Scaffold, I
perceived my poor Father preparing himself for the fatal stroak with a
courage which render'd him unworthy of it; so sad a spectacle made
me hasten to <hi>Hannibal's</hi> seat, where at last I came, and with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
more suitable to my resentment than condition, I presented my
self unto him, and told him, Sir, I beseech you, command a suspension
of <hi>Blacius</hi>'s death, till I have acquainted you with some things, that may
perhaps induce you to pardon him. The <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> (who then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
nothing but my Sex and motion) with a look as barbarous as his
Countrey, reply'd, Woman, the offences of that Traytor are too tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
to expect a pardon for any thing thou canst reveal, thou mayst
well therefore spare thy self a labour which will proveal together fruitless,
Then turning about, he commanded some of his Guards to carry me
down again. At that cruel order I flung my self at his Feet, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his Knees, I thus continued; I am (Sir) come to invoke that justice
which has hitherto made you as famous as your success, and will not stir
from this posture, till you assure me, I shall not be denyed it. Those
few words I spoke so loud, and so distinctly, that most of those <hi>Salapians</hi>
which were near the Scaffold, heard them, which putting them in hopes
that it might be something that would conduce to <hi>Blacius</hi> advantage,
(whom I told you they extreamly loved) they cryed out to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Hear
her, hear her, which voices (as is common in the croud) were seconded
by those that neither understood the cause, nor the approvers of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> finding the City so pressing and unanimous, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96335:73"/>
his Guards to meddle with me, who were already beginning to force
my Hold, and not only enjoyn'd the suspension of the execution, till I
had done speaking, but told me, I might be as consident of his doing me
right, as of <hi>Blacius</hi>'s death, than which nothing the Oracles did tell, could
be more certain.</p>
               <p>Sir (I continu'd) you will soon find how great a confidence I have of
your Justice, since my relyance on it, makes me offer my Life into your
Power, who am the unfortunate Daughter of this <hi>Blacius,</hi> that it seems
has offended you in such a degree, as nothing but his Bloud can be your
reparation; in pursuance of which resolve you were pleas'd under sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Oaths, when his Prison was forc'd (and thereby your revenge fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated)
to publish, That whosoever would reveal unto you who were
the Contrivers, Causers, or Actors of his liberty, should have granted any
one thing the said party could ask that was in your power: this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
which I here present you is my witness, and the assurance you are
inviolate in your engagements, has brought me to discover unto you
who is the offender that has so exceedingly transgrest your Laws; but
before I disclose this secret, I must beg a reiteration of that assurance,
which to induce you to with the less reluctancy, be pleas'd to receive
mine, that the same minute you confirm your first engagement, I will put
into your power the crimital person which procur'd my unfortunate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his short liberty, so that the same action which makes you satisfy
your word, will give you the power to satisfy your revenge too. All those
which could hear my request, gave their approbation to it by a loud shout,
for they car'd not upon whose ruines they built <hi>Blacius</hi>'s deliverance, and
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was always as ambitious of Glory as of Revenge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and confirm'd the Oaths and Promises of his Proclamation, which
being finisht, I thus continued: Since by a generosity which I ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from so great a Prince, you have silenc'd all those doubts my own
constant unhappiness, and not any suspitions of your Virtue, did create,
I shall boldly acquaint you, that your justice receiv'd that affront from
<hi>Izadora,</hi> and though my Sex exempted me from actions of that nature,
yet by my Prayers and Letters to a young <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, I rais'd
that power which cast you into so great disorders, and for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which you have made such unlimited promises. Thus, Sir, I have
satisfied my engagement, not only by acquainting you who committed
the offence, but by putting the offender into your hands: And now I
shall expect as punctual a performance from you. Then, as I was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to make my request, the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> who suspected by my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
that it would be <hi>Blacius</hi>'s Life (wherein he was not deceiv'd) sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
started up, and with a furious look told me; If thou art so mad as
to beg thy Fathers Life for this discovery, in expectation afterwards that
thy Sex will induce me to pitty thee; know that thy Crime will make me
pass by all considerations, and raise a fury which by all the gods, nothing
but thy destruction will appease; this I acquaint thee with, that thou
mayst owe thy death to thy wilfulness, and not to my resentments, which
I tell thee once more will prove so severe, thou wilt soon repent thou e'r
didst raise them; but if thou wilt yet decline that request, thy Sex and
Relations will invite me to pardon what I know I ought to punish. Sir
(I reply'd nothing terrify'd at these threatenings) I desire not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to your Mercy, but your Justice, neither can I lose my life more
gloriously than for him that gave it me: My duty in this case is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
and I know nothing can make me more worthy of death, than
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96335:73"/>
how to avoid it; therefore (Sir) I conjure you by those gods you have

too strong to leave me any suspition that you will not perform your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to him that shall reveal who was <hi>Blacius</hi>'s Deliverer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall make no scruple to acknowledge that it was I, and the reward

thoughts you have taken up against the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> who through an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of duty condemns her self to free her Father. You that have been
just, Sir, to your Enemies, will not now I hope be the contrary to your
self, especially when the subject you are to employ your virtue on, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
adoration sooner than Pardon, and whose only crime is her Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Instead then of so unfit a victim to appease your fury, I offer that
<hi>Perolla,</hi> who had at <hi>Capua</hi> depriv'd you of life, if his Sword had prov'd
the more fortunate, and had not his Fathers Tears and Dissimulation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
you: Who at <hi>Pettely</hi> rais'd his reputation by the destruction of
10000 <hi>Affricans;</hi> who at <hi>Cassilinum</hi> made you send Blanks where you had
denyed any conditions; Who by the destroying of 25000 of Allies and
Soldiers forc'd from you the <hi>Samnites, Lucanians,</hi> and <hi>Appulians;</hi> who
took that <hi>Cassilinum</hi> by storm, which you only won by Famine: in a
word, I present you that <hi>Perolla,</hi> who was not only content to offend
you in all these particulars, but came even into your Head-Quarters, and
in the Center of your Army, broke open your Prisons, kill'd your Guards,
restor'd your Capital Enemy to his freedom, and was now come to have
stopt the progress of your revenge upon him, by owning the action, and
by tying you (unless you would violate your Faith) to give me his life
for the reward of this discovery, which I had too effected, had not his
generous Daughter by her own confession, necessitated me to imploy that
Petition for her safety, which I had designed for her Fathers.</p>
               <p>Gods! into what confusions did this resolute acknowledgement cast me
into? That death which I was prepared to suffer, appeared far more sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
than this action of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s, for it reduced me either to imploy
my request for my Fathers, and so lose my friends Life; or if I preserv'd
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s, I must lose <hi>Blacius</hi>'s, and that which was an aggravation to this
misery, was, that by what was done already, I was necessitated to survive
the loss of one of them, unless I would prove my own executioner;
Alas, how sad a conflict had I betwixt my Duty and my Affection? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
pleading for the one, and Gratitude for the other. What, (said I
to my self) wilt thou destroy thy Father to save his Enemy? wilt thou
not preserve that Life that gave thee thine? wilt thou satisfy thy debts
with thy Fathers Bloud, and shall the tyes of Friendship be more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than those of Nature? But on the other side, shall the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make thee act that which will render thee unworthy that relation?
shall that breath which even now <hi>Perolla</hi> gave thee, be employed to save
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96335:74"/>
anothers life by the ruine of his? Unfortunate <hi>Izadora!</hi> hast thou no way
to perform thy duty but by a murther? and hast thou no no way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
thy gratitude, but by a Paricide? must the satisfaction of thy gratitude
be the ruine of thy Father? and must the satisfaction of thy duty be
the loss of thy Friend? must to be grateful and ungrateful prove an equal
crime? and must the paying of one debt, render thee uncapable of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other? I take the gods to witness that I would joyfully put an
end to this fatal dispute but that of my life, and have embrac'd that fate
with a satisfaction equal to that of Martyrs, who know their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is but the way unto their Glory: but the time was so pressing, that
I was necessitated to spend what remained, not in complaints, but reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
therefore I thus continu'd. <hi>Perolla</hi> came to preserve <hi>Blacius,</hi>
though my unfortunate duty made him change his design: and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
which once made my Father to esteem his life his misfortune, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Enemy conferr'd it on him, though only by his courage, will
make a repetition of that favour, create a higher trouble in him, when
the purchase of his safety, is his Enemies voluntary death; his Virtue,
doubtless, will make him decline an obligation, where what makes him
receive it, deprives him of all power to express his resentments for it: 'Tis
but just too, that that life which has so often preserv'd <hi>Blacius</hi>'s, should
now be preserv'd by his; Yes, yes <hi>Izadora,</hi> let <hi>Perolla</hi> find his safety from
one of that Family, in which he hath hitherto found his misery; act
now thy Fathers part, and upon the score of his Virtue perform that for
<hi>Perolla,</hi> whose effects may demonstrate their cause, and let him find, now
thou art in <hi>Blacius</hi>'s room, that that cruelty thou didst condemn in him,
thou wilt not practise for him, and in this one action show what thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
resentments should be, and what thine own are: Then when this
debt is discharged, satisfy thy own as generously, and by ending thy life
with his that gave it thee, convince him and the World, that as thou
valu'st thy life short of thy duty, which shouldst thou any longer enjoy
would bring that truth in question, and make that relish of self-interest
which is of a contrary quality. But alas (I continued) how will <hi>Perolla</hi>
resent this proceeding? he'll alledge, that what thou termest Gratitude,
is Cruelty, that the way thou tak'st to save his life, is the certainst means
to lose it, and that instead of repairing <hi>Blacius</hi>'s injuries, thou art more
injurious far than he. These, and a world of such, thy Friend will object
against thee, to which thou hast no reply, but that thy Fate having invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
thee with excess of miseries, thou electest those that to thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are the least, and that thou hadst rather dye by acting what may
merit his esteem, than live in a contrary unhappiness. Whilst I was thus
debating, and had fixt upon this resolution, <hi>Perolla</hi> was all the while
conjuring <hi>Hannibal</hi> to observe his Promise, and to make him the object of
his Cruelty, so he made me that of his Justice, and in order to this told
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> such reasons, that I apprehended nothing more than he
would find his destruction in his Eloquence, and so raise his enemies fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that he would sacrifice the violation of his Oaths and Faith to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
In this fear I interrupted him from proceeding by addressing my
self in these terms to the <hi>Carthaginian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, If I have been thus long silent, you will, I hope pardon it when
you know, that a dispute betwixt Gratitude and Nature was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the end, the first has been victorious, but to make it so, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to act my Fathers part, who I know is too generous to let <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
suffer for him, when by his own sufferings he may hinder his, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96335:74"/>
'twere too much wrong to the generosity of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s action, not to let it
instruct my Fathers to an imitation of it. These words too fully inform'd
my friend of my intentions, to let him permit my proceedings any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which he hinder'd by leaving <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and by prostrating himself
before me, where as soon as his disorder would permit him, he cry'd out,
Ah Madam, do not, I beseech you, by so unjust a Victory, blemish your
Virtue, nor make me so wretched, as to find my misery, in that which
perhaps you intend as an argument of your Affection, to preserve your
Fathers and your Life, nay your Fame too, are cause too glorious to
deplore any effects which may proceed from them: do not then envy
me a death, by which I shall always live, and by losing only an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Being, obtain an Eternal one. If I had not (I reply'd) taken up
this resolution, that which you do to suppress, would have created it, and
in this fresh proof of your Virtue, I find a greater invitaion to continue,
than alter my intentions: <hi>Blacius</hi> would live more miserable with such a
debt, than he can dye by paying it, and I cannot deplore his destiny
which makes that Life (which even now was to be an oblation only to
<hi>Hannibals</hi> fury) to prove a sacrifice to Gratitude. If (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) the
payment of that Gratitude be addrest to me, I take all that's holy to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I shall find in the design only a larger, and more pleasing payment,
than in the action: Alas Madam, consider too, I beseech you, what all
Mankind will say of you, they will (doubtless) condemn that Virtue
which has been hitherto their admiration, and that which you think will
raise their esteem, will absolutely suppress it; besides, if you proceed in
your design, 'twill be so far from hindering, that it will but hasten my
death; do not then, I beseech you, force me through despair, to spill
that bloud, which now may be shed for a Subject that out-weighs the loss.
I shall find (I reply'd) in your silence, a stronger inducement to obey
you, than in your words, espicially if they be of this nature, and for your
apprehension of my prejudicing in this action, that little Virtue I possess,
I have fixt upon a resolve, shall still preserve, if not increase it, and I
have so order'd all things, that your last Declaration is now my only
trouble, which forces me to make use of that power you have so often
assur'd me I have over you, to beg, and if that be not sufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you by our passions, which have been as pure as great, and by all
other conjurations that are most powerful, whatsoever happens to me,
use no violence upon your self, nor leave this life till the gods do call
you to a better; this I implore with the more earnestness, because po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
shall judge of your love by your obedience. Then without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his answer, (whose quality I read in his amazement) I went to
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> and having laid open all the most pressing terms I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to illustrate the unworthiness of a violated engagemeut, I conjur'd
him as a recompence of what I had reveal'd, to give <hi>Perolla</hi> his life and
liberty; who having followed me, and hearing my request, detesting to
derive his safety from the cause he esteem'd in me, so unnatural, thus spoke
to the <hi>Carthaginian.</hi> By a true confession (Sir) how <hi>Blacius</hi> was reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I am confident you find no other had a hand in it but I, at least <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
had not, who was so far from either contriving or knowing it, that
when I presented him to her she was weeping him for dead, and admir'd
as much at his deliverance as he himself did. As for that Letter she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges,
which was the cause of his Liberty, I protest by all the gods,
it commanded me only to make use of the Consuls favour for <hi>Blacius</hi>'s
redemption, by offering some <hi>Lybian</hi> prisoners, or for a suspension of his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96335:75"/>
death, by threatening all those he had to follow his destiny, so that she
was no more the cause then the effect of her Fathers freedom, neither
can she pretend any title to the benefit of your Proclamation, by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
who was the Actor, for when I brought <hi>Blacius</hi> to her, I was so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Armor, that she could not possibly know me, and as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of this truth, she call'd me <hi>Roman,</hi> when as yet I never saw <hi>Rome</hi>
and had my birth in this City; therefore (Sir) none but I has any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in your manifest, which obliges you no less to preserve inviolate your
vows and promises, than to punish those which have offended you. Ah
Sir (said I, flinging my self at his feet) I hope you are too judicious not
to distinguish betwixt an accusation which proceeds from Generosity, and
one which proceeds from guilt, and consequently not to impute this of
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s, to one of the first quality, but yet, lest you should want light
to see so much Virtue, I beseech you reflect upon whose Son he is, and
you will find in his extraction, cause to invite him, rather to destroy
<hi>Blacius</hi> by the hazard of his own life, than to save him by a certain loss
of it. Yes (Sir) I blush in his behalf to acknowledge that the little Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Virtue which the gods have given me, converted his inclinations,
and made him cherish what he would otherwise have destroyed, so that
I am apparently the cause of that freedom, which created your resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
besides, I have a title to my request, discovering who was the
Actor; For as to that allegation, that I was weeping my Fathers loss,
when he presented him to me, I may truly answer, my affection had as
large a share in those Tears, as my Duty; for I could not reflect upon <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
danger and <hi>Perolla</hi>'s courage, but it was impossible to retain them,
and though indeed, at his coming into my Chamber, he was covered
with Arms and Bloud, yet his Gallantry discover'd what his unkind Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
would have conceal'd, and in his actions I found as great an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that it was <hi>Perolla,</hi> as I could have had in seeing his Face; so that
my calling him <hi>Roman,</hi> proceeded not from my ignorance but fears; for I
was informed after my Fathers rescue, such strict Guards were plac'd about
the City, that I apprehended my generous friend was not gotten out of it,
so that if by any misfortune he fell into your power, I would not (by
precisely acquainting you who he was) have given you so great an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to that hatred you had already contracted for him; besides, I might
aptly enough, call him a <hi>Roman,</hi> his inclinations and actions having always
been for that Empire. Thus (Sir) have I clearly demonstrated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
I have in your engagement, which gives me the confidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you by these Tears, and by that word which you have hitherto so
religiously observed, give <hi>Perolla</hi> that Life and Liberty, he would so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously
have lost, which is the Petition I humbly make for my disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
neither can you satisfy that request he has already made you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
yielding to mine too; for that life he has begg'd, is so united to his,
that it cannot admit of a different Fate. To which <hi>Hannibal</hi> reply'd,
Madam, <hi>Perolla</hi> may with reason be credited, since 'tis not likely he would
disclaim a Truth which would save his life; and therefore as I have been
just to him in granting his desires for you; so permit me now to be just
to my self, by sacrificing an offender, who is not only contented to be
so, but glories in it, and out-braves my Justice. Yes Sir (said <hi>Perolla</hi>)
since you have saved the fair <hi>Izadora:</hi> inflict on me all the torments your
Revenge and Fury can inspire you with, and I will embrace them with
more joy than they are imposed, nay, commend that justice which by
my sufferings, exempts the perfectest creature from induring any. This
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96335:75"/>
generous reply so incen'sd the barbarous <hi>Hannibal;</hi> that he commanded
his Guards to bind <hi>Perolla,</hi> and carry him to receive a death; whose
torments might be as great as his crime. The Guards at those barbarous
Orders advanc'd to seize upon <hi>Perolla,</hi> who perceiving their intentions,
went half way to meet them, and holding out his Arms, told them. Here,
here Soldiers, obey your General; and bind up those Arms which when
they were at liberty were as much his fear, as now they are his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and which yet, (were I disposed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell my life) might make him
tremble in the midst of you; but I will not impose that in which I find
my Glory. Those words he spoke with so furious a look, that though
unarmed, and invironed with his Enemies, yet it struck such a damp into
their Hearts, that their trembling was the greatest proof they were alive.
But <hi>Perolla</hi> instantly disarming himself of all his fury, with an Humility
great as my grief, kneel'd at my feet and told me, The gods shall be my
witness (Madam) that the onely thing which made me cherish my life,
was out of a hope that it might prove serviceable to you, and now it is
so fortunate, not only to save you, but pardon me if I say so, to keep you
too from a stain which might blemish all your other Virtues, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
it with more joy than I kept it; but yet I must confess, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon our separation, I find a strong aversion to it, and am forc'd
to run for my Consolation to the necessary causes of it. Must then (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
interrupting him with a shower of Tears) must then the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd
<hi>Perolla</hi> have so hard a fate, that he finds his Consolation in the
destruction of my Felicity? unjust Heaven! who will ever adore friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
when it turns to be the ruine of him that possest it in the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Ah Madam, said he, call me rather your Votary than your
Friend, and then you need not fear this President will prejudice Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for Men sooner adore, than decline a Deity, by the example of a
Martyrdom. But Madam, you may convert my trouble into my felicity,
by permitting this voluntary death to preserve me alive in your esteem,
which will be a nobler existence, and render me an object fitter for your
Joy than Tears. You shall not only have my esteem (I reply'd) but my
company, since 'tis a greater misery to out-live the loss of so much Virtue,
than to dye with it. But Sir (said <hi>Izadora,</hi> speaking to <hi>Spartacus</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I make the relation only of these accidents as tedious and troublesom
to you, as they themselves were to us: but I will repair that fault, by
contracting the sequel of our Adventures. To which my Prince reply'd,
Madam, if I am in any trouble, it only proceeds from sympathizing in
those disasters you were fallen into, and the difficulties I find in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered out of them, of which I am so impatient, and concern'd,
that I shall beg you henceforward to believe, that as long as you prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
your Story, you will as much oblige me, as by interrupting it you
will do the contrary. <hi>Izadora,</hi> with an action which testified her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, thus continued her Relation. I will obey you, Sir, and
it may be in my following discourse, you will find that our perplexities
were cur'd by as strange an accident, as that which created them: For
<hi>Hannibal</hi> all this while continu'd in a deep silence, which I attributed to
his being a Judge, rather than a Lover; but the gods, who magnify their
power by producing great Effects from small Causes, made us find in this
poor Beauty, the redress of those disorders which it had occasioned; for
at the first, when I presented my self unto the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> I was (as my
condition required) all vail'd, and continu'd so, till <hi>Perolla</hi>'s cruel Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
forc'd me to uncover my Face, in which <hi>Hannibal</hi> fancy'd as many
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96335:76"/>
charms as it wanted, and by the help of his own imagination, so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
supply'd the unkindness of nature to me, that in his wounds we
found our remedy. And truly, for it to vanquish any Heart was strange,
but to captivate <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s, who hated our Sex as much as he did the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and to divest him too, of his fury and revenge, appear'd so great
a Miracle, that had not some visible effects been the witness of that Truth,
I had found in my imperfections, too many Arguments to have doubted
it; and without question, 'twas such Passion as his, that made Love be
painted blind; but many that stood by, and were not so ingaged as I
was, observ'd at first, that which I no way suspected or perceiv'd, till
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> who found <hi>Perolla</hi> was as much his Rival in Love as in Glory,
after having laid down all those motives he esteemed most prevalent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
me rather to employ my request for my Father, than my Friend, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
me so unshaken in my resolves, and so pressing in my Tears, and
Prayers, and guessing at my disposition by his own, which hardened it
self by opposition, at last when the Guards were carrying away the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Perolla,</hi> he told me; Madam, If I have labour'd to prove you had
no Title to my Proclamation, 'twas only to shew you, that you had a
power over me from yourself, greater than you can derive from thence,
and that you may command upon the score of your Beauty, that which
you only beg by virtue of my manifest. Alas Sir (I reply'd) I am too
well acquainted with this unfortunate Beauty, to believe it can have so
high an influence on so great a Conqueror, pardon me then, if I dare tell
you, I shall be diffident of its power, unless I am convinc'd of it by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration?
If you suspect (said he) that which carries its authority
with it, and if you can doubt that Truth which <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Captivity
does witness; command me any other tryal, and you shall find in my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
how great a wrong you have done the fair <hi>Izadora:</hi> So high a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
I answered, merits a proportionate return, and therefore I shall
employ that power you give me, for your own advantage, and only
beg you to be just unto your vows, by giving <hi>Perolla</hi> his life, Madam,
(said <hi>Hannibal</hi>) though in saving him I shall preserve (by what I have
observed) as great an opposer of my Felicity, as of my Conquests: and
thereby too, create as many Enemies as Soldiers in my Army, yet I will
observe your Orders. Yes Madam, I give <hi>Perolla</hi>'s life to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and I give you <hi>Blacius</hi>'s without them, who for having bestowed
so great a perfection on the World, merits rather my esteem than revenge.
My zeal to your service, stays not in that dull method of only obeying
what you command, it lays hold on that which it thinks is your Will
without the revealing it. I could not have the patience to let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
his Words and Actions were too generous to delay my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
for them, which I exprest, prostrate at his feet, in the most
moving and humble manner I was capable of. I will not, Sir, said <hi>Izadora,</hi>
trouble you with the repetition of them, though they were so satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to him, to whom they were addrest, that as an acknowledgement of
it, he went immediately himself, unbound both <hi>Blacius</hi> and <hi>Perolla,</hi> and
presented them to me, with an humility so far beyond his practise, that
the standers by admir'd as much, as I was pleas'd at it. But to obscure this
joy, some of <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s friends seeing the danger his generous Son had been
in, went to his House to inform him of it, (for he, out of gallantry,
would not be present at his Enemies death, though he had <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
example to authorize that action.) As soon as he had notice of it, he went
with so great haste to the place of Execution that those which saw it,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96335:76"/>
thought that his affection and not his hatred was the cause of it. The
croud about the Scaffold was so great, that it was with much difficulty
and with an often repeating of his name (to which all paid a deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect)
that he got at last to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and it was just at that instant, that
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had unbound <hi>Perolla,</hi> and given him to me. <hi>Pacuvius</hi> was
suddenly informed of all that happened, which every one assured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would render him a large sharer in the general joy: but alas he soon
put them out of that belief by thus speaking to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> I were (Sir)
unworthy the friendship of so great a Conqueror did I value any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
above it; 'tis upon that principle that I have detested <hi>Perolla,</hi> who
hates as much your Person as your Glory, and if I hitherto conceal'd
that horrid attempt against you, which he himself has now publisht, 'twas
not Because he was my Son, but out of a belief that I might convert
him: for I knew, a courage which was capable in so green an age to
attempt so bold and high a design, which was more advantageous to you to
be gained, than destroyed; but since that valour, the gods have given
him, has been imployed to ruine what it should have advanc'd, I am
come to implore your justice against one who is as much an Enemy to
nature, as to <hi>Carthage;</hi> punish him for intending your destruction, in a
place where not to have sacrific'd himself for you, had been as great a
sin. Yes (Sir) punish him for designing your death, and punish me in
him, not onely for concealing, but likewise for not revenging it, and
let one execution repair both our crimes; you see, generous <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nnibal,</hi>
how I contemn my own interest, when yours comes in competition with
it, which I imbrace with such a concern, that I had rather extinguish my
Family, than continue it, by leaving so great a stain upon your Justice,
and danger to your person, as the saving of <hi>Perolla</hi> will amount unto.
Besides Sir, shall that courage, which hitherto found nothing so easie as
to conquer, leave the blemish behind it of having been vanquisht by the
eyes only of one of our enemies? shall the <hi>Romans</hi> derive their Triumph
from a Sex which never merited higher than your pitty? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> such a plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Desire as Revenge, and such a Virtue as Justice be supprest by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
passion, which like madness, none believe they ever were possest
with when they'r cur'd of it? Let not (Sir) I beseech you the cause of
your disorders be worse than the effects, but by a generous Conquest over
your self, shew you are capable to vanquish all obstacles, and let your
enemies in that very action which they esteemed would prove your shame,
find an argument that you are invincible, so he that can overcome <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
cannot but be thought to do the like to <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the World.
The <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> who knew no other cause of <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s hatred to his
Son, than what he had alledged, not only upon that account excus'd his
passion, and expressions, but replyed, had I not already given <hi>Perolla</hi>'s
life to the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>'s commands, I now had bestowed it on <hi>Pacuius</hi>'s
generosity, and find in what he alledges more cause to suppress, than to
creat my Revenge; He that could sacrifice the hopes of his posterity for
my interest, had too much misplac'd his friendship, if for a return to it I
would not silence a Revenge, especially when the acting it will prove
the destruction of so generous a Family, in which my misfortune is the
onely fault of any one of it; for <hi>Perolla</hi> wants not Virtue, but I the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to merit it, and though (he continued with a smile) you upbraid me
with being vanquisht; yet I cannot but acknowledge I am more pleased
in this defeat, than with all my former victories; I have too, this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that I was never conquered but by a Sex which the gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96335:77"/>
could not resist, who, if they can, for their subjection, produce
thus much beauty, they carry their justification in the cause of their fault,
(if it be one) so that I commit none unless it be one to imitate those
we adore. I will not particularize all the dispute betwixt them, since it
serves but to acquaint you, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> remained unshaken in what he
had done, and then came to me, and told me; I should Madam, with
the lives of <hi>Blacius</hi> and <hi>Perolla,</hi> have given you too their liberties, were
it not that the grant of the first of these has been too great an exasperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my Army, to increase it at the same time by the last: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hope for your pardon, if I obey you but by degrees, since other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I might hazard the losing of a power which is not so dear to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any score, as out of a confidence it may serve you; yet still for your
sake, they shall have no other Prisons but their Lodgings, and as soon as
I have fashioned my Officers to approve of their liberty, I shall restore
it to them with as much joy as I have lost my own. Though this hard
Declaration (however moderated both by reasons and civilities) did
extreamly perplex me, yet I only begg'd him to shorten their sufferings
as much as might be, and to perfect what he had so generously begun, for
I durst not be too earnest on so tender a subject, lest it might create his
suspitions, that my love as much as duty occasioned my solicitations. 'Twas
in this sort, (continued <hi>Izadora</hi>) that we were preserved, and truly when
you consider all the accidents of this Adventure, you will acknowledge it
to be a strange one: For that life I came to sacrifice to preserve <hi>Blacius</hi>'s
had been preserved by the sacrificing of his, and where I thought to have
found my death, I found my safety, but by a way which made it odious
to me: <hi>Perolla</hi> too, who came with the same design, found the same fate,
and that sympathy, which till then we both gloried in, in that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was converted to our misfortune: what we singly might have effected,
we joyntly destroyed; and my Father by having more friends than one,
found he had never a one, and which was more intricate, we both came
to lose our selves to save him, and we both saved our selves to
lose him, and yet we ruine our selves all three, for <hi>Perolla</hi> by begging
my life and I his, we leave <hi>Blacius</hi> to the execution, which made me
resolve having so satisfied my gratitude, to dye with my Father, as a
vindication of my duty, and as my generous friend has often since
vowed unto me, he was determined to have born me company: On
the other side, <hi>Hannibal</hi> to be more certain of his revenge, publishes
a-Proclamation which debars him of it, and to end this miraculous day
with a greater wonder than any which had happened in it, <hi>Izadora</hi>'s
Beauty, by ingendring as great a passion in the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as he had
till then a detestation for our Sex, dissolves all our fears, and makes
us return in triumph, where we thought never to have returned again.
For <hi>Hannibal</hi> with all his Guards, and with the acclamations of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
confluence of people accompanied me to my Fathers House. But
alas (Sir) as soon as <hi>Blacius</hi> was informed how I had declined his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
to purchase <hi>Perolla</hi>'s, and knowing what I had done, but not
what I had resolved to do, he contracted so violent a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>atred against
me, that doubtless I had in the effects of it, found my ruine, had not the
apprehension of offending <hi>Hannibal</hi> silenc'd his fury, who every day
gave me such fresh and high proofs of his passion, that had my felicity
depended on his affection, I had been then as happy, as since I have
been miserable. But in that which most of my Sex would have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
I found my Affliction, for I had given too visible proofs of my
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96335:77"/>
affection to <hi>Perolla</hi> to doubt the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> was ignorant of it, and
consequently, I left my Fathers unlikelihood of liberty in the loss of his
Rivals, whose actions too soon inform'd me, that his denying to give me
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s freedom, proceeded more from his jealousie than any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of distasting his Army, over which he had so great an Ascendent,
that though it were compos'd of sundry Nations, and that they often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
miseries as great as their succesles, yet they never mutiny'd, but
thought their sufferings too meritoriously recompenc'd, if in them their
General might find his Glory, But Sir (continu'd the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my engagement and perhaps you in it, I will pass over all those addresses
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> made me, and only inform you, his Passion grew to such a
height, that he declin'd the Conquest of the World to conquer the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Izadora;</hi> and that Glory which he had hitherto so exceedingly ador'd,
he now as much undervalu'd, delivering up the conduct of all Martial
Affairs unto the generous <hi>Maherbal;</hi> and those Days and Nights which
he esteem'd misemploy'd, if not projecting some new Conquest, visiting
and regulating his Troops, provoking and improving their natural fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by Orations, and in performing all the functions of an expert Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
he now had the same opinion of, if not spent at my feet; in which
dejected posture he often vow'd he took more satisfaction than in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Triumphs. But for my particular, I may justly profess, if I deriv'd
any contentment from his expressions and submissions, 'twas only in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by so strong an experiment, that my constancy was immoveable; I say,
so strong an experiment, for <hi>Hannibal</hi> was a Prince capable to infuse a
flame into the coldest heart; for he had a look so spiritual and full of viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
that no effeminate Beauty was comparable to it; his person and shape
were nothing dissonant to his Face (which had not then receiv'd the
blemish of being depriv'd of that Eye which soon after he lost in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
of <hi>Ancona</hi>) his fashion was majestick and without constraint, and he
was endu'd with so singular an Eloquence, that you would have thought
him an <hi>Athenian</hi> sooner than an <hi>Affrican,</hi> and rather bred up in those
famous Schools than in a barbarous Camp. And though <hi>Hannibal</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
when he saw his fortune was expir'd, did alledge in open Senate when
he pull'd down <hi>Gisgo</hi> out of the Pulpit of Orations for enveighing against
a Peace then offer'd them by <hi>Scipio</hi> (whose succeeding Conquests gave
him the sir-name of <hi>Affrican</hi>) that he never knew any way but force to
suppress Offenders, yet in a subsequent Speech he unfolded such pregnant
arguments in so transcending expressions and method, that the Senate soon
perceiv'd he wrong'd his Eloquence to excuse his Passion: His Fortune
also was proportionate to his other qualities, being, at four and twenty
years old after the death of <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> his Father and Uncle
elected: General by the unanimous concurrence both of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nate and
Army: His Conquests too were as early as his preferment, and he never
apprehended a defeat, for his Victories had always so little of Fortune
in them, that they could hardly proveinconstant. But I fear (said <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>)
that by my confidence of undertaking to give you this Character, I
give you an ill one of him: I will therefore conclude, that he had no
fault but an unconfin'd ambition, which made him embrace any means
that conduc'd to his desires, and to conquer whatsoever oppos'd him,
he never scrupl'd to sacrifice his virtue to his ends. This truly makes me
believe, 'twas more upon the score of his wilfulness than his judgement
that he persever'd in his passion for me. But after a long time in both
our computations, he for his sufferings (as he term'd them) and I for his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96335:78"/>
importunities, he came one evening to my Chamber as I had newly done reading
a Letter of <hi>Perolla's,</hi> which contained such passionate expression for our
cruel separation, that they infus'd into me a grief equal to his that writ
them; the impression thereof was so evident at his coming in, that he soon
perceiv'd it, and after a melancholly silence, to shew the interest he had
in my sadness, he at last begg'd me to pardon him if he presum'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the cause of it. You may easily Sir (I reply'd) find it out, when
you remember that <hi>Blacius</hi> is yet a prisoner. If that (he answer'd) be
the occasion, I shall find my satisfaction in your disorders, having power to
redress them; and to confirm you in this truth, from this instant I declare
him free: But Madam (he continu'd) interrupting that return I was about
to make him for so transcendent an obligation) may not I fear your Love
has as great a share in your melancholly as your Duty? That friendship
(I reply'd) which I pay <hi>Perolla,</hi> is too pure to be deny'd, and he has
done so many things for the preservation of him to whom I owe my duty,
that without an offence to it, I may give him (as an acknowledgement)
a share in my sadness. Call you that Madam (said <hi>Hannibal</hi>) but an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
which made you on the Scaffold prefer his life before your
Fathers? I did not (I reply'd) prefer him, but Gratitude before my
Father. Ah Madam (he answer'd) take heed what you say, for if you
so much undervalue yourself, as to believe any services can deserve your
Gratitude; you will perhaps give me a title to that by Justice, which I
never could expect but from your Mercy: For <hi>Perolla</hi> when he sav'd
<hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
the first time, knew not who he was, and the second time did it to obey
his Mistris, and offend his Enemy; But I not only knew, that in preserving
him I preserv'd my mortall'st Enemy; and did it without any inducement,
except a belief that it might be pleasing to you, but also sav'd that <hi>Perolla</hi>
too, for whom you would have sacrific'd not only your Father, but your
self, and by which I found I cherisht my own destruction: but my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was too perfect to stand upon Reason, or if it did, it found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which more deserv'd that name than to obey you, Yes Madam, I
consider'd my destruction too glorious to deplore it, if thereby I might
settle your Contentment: Judge then (fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) if I have not cause
to say, that there is some desparity between our Services, and whether
I may not upon that belief expect, that you will at least commiserate
the captivity of my Mind as much as of his Body, who certainly is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
his felicity, if he can find room to entertain a grief, having the
highest preservative from it, the blessing of your affection Sir (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
those obligations you have conferr'd on me are of so transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a nature, that to think to define, is to injure them; and if they have
any defect, it proceeds only from their greatness, which by a necessity of
gratitude casts me into as high a misery as they took me out of: Yes,
generous <hi>Hanniball,</hi> I can truly say, that when I reflect upon your obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and find not only a want of power, but of hope to make them
of proportionate return, I am struck with a melancholly equal to the joy
I resented when you conferr'd them on me; and perhaps I should not
lye if I profest that these thoughts are as large a cause of my sadness as
any other. Would to the Gods Madam (said he) that your will to
oblige me were but equal to your power, I could soon then exchange
my fears for joys, in very contemplation whereof I quickly lose my self:
Yes, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> those that gave you the power to command, have given
you too the power to reward, and I find should in an <hi>Hymeneal</hi> Crown an
bundant recompence for my services and sufferings; this union should
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96335:78"/>
give the World Peace, or you the World, which is a far easier
Conquest than that of <hi>Izadora,</hi> whom I durst promise to make Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
of that by Arms, which by virtue she has so just a title to; for if
only if only to obey the <hi>Carthagineans</hi> and to satisfie my own inclinati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I have already so far proceeded, she cannot doubt but to justifie her
choice, and merit the glorious title of her Souldier, I would perform
miracles almost as great as the cause of them. Though the words of
this Declaration were very confident, yet the Declaration it self was not,
for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> maugre his high Courage, was all the while it lasted as pale
as guilt, and made it with so great a trembling and constraint, that he
had as much of my pity, as of my anger; but after a little si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which rather shew'd my resentment than irresolution, I told him,
My apprehensions of being ungrateful, were now I perceive too well
grounded, for that you do me the honour to mention, is not in my power
to grant; I know this confession to a Prince less generous, might produce
a contrary effect than I am confident 'twill in you, from whom I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd
such memorable obligations, hat I had rather have your disesteem by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
a Truth, than continue your favour by a dissimulation which
would render me unworthy of it: That Heart which is below the great
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> is so given to another, that were it revocable, 'twere upon that
score, if not on any other, unfit for your acceptance; for I must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
to be kind, and I know you have a greater Passion for Virtue
than for Beauty. Alas Madam (he eply'd) fetching a deep sigh) Why
did you make such haste to give your self away, knowing the influence
of your Eyes, which would create as many Servants as Beholders? Why
did you prove unjust to one of them, to be the like to all the rest? for
to give all to the happy <hi>Perolla</hi> is as great an injustice in one extream, as
to reserve none for the residue of your Adorers is in the other. Sir (said
I) you may easily perceive the great distinction I place between your
and <hi>Perolla</hi>'s actions, for by undertaking to reward his, I shew at how
low a rate I value them; and by acknowledging that the impossibility
of my satisfying what I owe you, is as great as my desires to pay it; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with the largeness of my resentments, and do perhaps in my
very ingratitude it self in some degree prove grateful. Ah Madam (he
answer'd) do not lessen your power to the increase of your cruelty; nor
render my services uncapable of reward, by esteeming them above any:
No, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> let me not find my ruine in that which was my duty,
and shall be my ambition, let not my performances like bubbles encrease
to nothing. But at last <hi>Hannibal</hi> (who perceiv'd that his replies did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirm than lessen my constancy, and that he had unfortunately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a time which my melancholly made unfit for his addresses) told
me; I should be too partial to my self, Madam, did I expect to suppress
one flame in you, and create another any way but by perseverance; I
will therefore no more importune you with my Passion, nor make use of
any other Orators than my services and sufferings; neither shall I despair,
but by their help to vanquish your disdain, for I find in my very fear an
ample cause of hope, since the impressions of nature are as firm as those of
our own acquisition, and <hi>Perolla</hi> by his services and glory having vanquisht
your aversion to his blood, it gives me a confidence by the same ways to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
as high effects, the disproportion being at worst but equally great. I
will go then Madam, and peform things of such Virtue, that you shall
be as unjust as I am miserable if you decline my Passion, and the world
shall see, if <hi>Perolla</hi> exceeds me in any thing 'tis in happiness not in merit.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96335:79"/>
Then without staying for any reply, he saluted me with an humility as
great as he would have perswaded me his Passion was, and went directly
to his own house, where immediately he gave orders to have the next
morning his Army ready to move, for he would act some exploit, which
should abundantly repair his unaccustomed idleness. This promise gave
the generous <hi>Maherbal</hi> as high a contentment as the Effects of it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Romans;</hi> but after he had distributed those orders which
were necessary for hasting his march, he began to reflect upon the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of success in his passion, as long as I had so just and advantageous
an opinion of <hi>Perolla;</hi> he therefore fancied, that if he could but create
any suspitions in him of my con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tancy, it might furnish him with a means
to destroy his, whose perfections he esteem'd its fault, because it was
his own misfortune. But after he had projected a Million of ways to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
this design, he seem'd none so probable as by corrupting <hi>Oristes,</hi>
a <hi>Salapian</hi> of quality, in whose house <hi>Perolla</hi> was a Prisoner, and who by
his exceeding civility, and the interest he took in all his troubles, had
gotten a great share in my generous Friend.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Oristes, Hannibal</hi> sent for that Night, and having brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Cabinet, disclosed to him there his condition and desires, but in
such pressing words and actions, that he easily perceiv'd how infinitely
the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> was concern'd in the accomplishing of them; The <hi>Salapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
who had some weak principles of virtue, did a long time resist both <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s
prayers and rewards; yet in the end, that little generosity he had
shew'd, serv'd but to aggravate his offence, for he was vanquisht, and
evidenc'd thereby he knew his duty, but would not practise it, for he
promis'd the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> not only to undertake, but succeed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
which fill'd him with so much satisfaction, that the effect of it were
visible next morning when he past under my Window: for out of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
he made his Army march through <hi>Salapia,</hi> and in a military civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
saluted me with all those victorious Ensigns, which never before or since
pay'd that homage to any but their General; and because those trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Troops appeared that day by his expresscommands in all their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
I shall not think it impertinent to mention their orders and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which though it be a thing out of my Sex's element, yet I took so
particular notice of it then, that I am confident I shall in my relation
abuse nothing but your patience. The first division consisted of 8000
<hi>Numidian</hi> Horse, led by the gallant <hi>Maherbal,</hi> whose Men was as full
of virtue as courage, and whose actions sufficiently justified their Phisiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy:
These Troops methought relisht something of their Commander,
and were generally so well Armed and Horst, that they seem'd rather go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Triumph than a Battel. After these <hi>Hannibal</hi> appeared environ'd
by a thousand young <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> which he had elected for his Guards,
and followed by 4000 Foot, (all <hi>Affricans.</hi>) I must do him the right to
acknowledge, that he had so noble a fierceness in his Armour, that
though I had never seen him I should yet have taken him for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
and certainly he was no friend to his good Meene, when he shew'd
himself out of an Army. These <hi>Affricans</hi> resigned their places to Three
and thirty great Elephants (all that then were left) which had towers
of Wood upon their Backs, and so not onely carried but fortified their
Riders. After these follow'd 4000 Mules and Horses, the most of
them loaden with so many several Engines of Battery, that I admir'd
as much at the wickedness as at the ingenuity of Men, which could find
such several ways to destroy one another. These were no sooner past
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96335:79"/>
but their appear'd 10000 <hi>Guiles, 6000 Lygurians,</hi> and 4000 <hi>Grecians,</hi>
all lead by Commanders of their own Nations, and fighting under
<hi>Carthaginean</hi> Colours, more for <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Fame than his pay; These
Squadrons had so warlike and haughty a march, that it shew'd how eager
and ambitious they were of Battel. The last divisions consisted of 8000
Horse, 4000 of which were Men at Arms, and all <hi>Gaules,</hi> led by the
valiant <hi>Britogentrix,</hi> and the other 4000 were <hi>Iberians,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of <hi>Mircal</hi> and <hi>Barmocal,</hi> who brought up the Rear of this great
Army, which was compos'd almost of all Nations but those it was going
to conquer. I must confess, this sight made me excuse that haughtiness
of which <hi>Hannibal</hi> was esteem'd guilty, for who could have been so much
a Philosopher, as not to be proud of having so many thousand gallant
Men ready to sacrifice themselves at his commnad? but my admiration
as it was not greater than my fear for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that reflection
at last lead me to a joy which I shall not scruple to reveal, since if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a want of courage, it did not from a want of love: 'Twas
Sir (<hi>Izadora</hi> continu'd) occasioned at <hi>Perolla</hi>'s being a Prisoner; for I
could not consider his valor and the endless subjects it was to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against, but I found my satisfaction in that which had been my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and was more pleased that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had deny'd me his liberty than
I should have been in his obedience; for I could no more deplore my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Friends sufferings, since it procur'd his safety, than I could any
mans condition who took Physick but to be well. I must not omit to tell
you, that every common Soldier of this vast Body carry'd a branch of
Lawrel, their confidence being so great, that they wore the reward of
victory before they obtain'd it. 'Twas with this Army that <hi>Hannibal</hi>
march'd first to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> where though he found a vigorous resistance,
yet the valor of the Defendants serv'd only to set off his own the better,
for he carry'd it by storm, and in that action perform'd so much of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
as well as of the General, that he deriv'd his success as much from
his courage as his conduct. I know (continu'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) the <hi>Romans</hi>
affirm that <hi>Nico</hi> and <hi>Philomenes</hi> betray'd that great City to him, but
I know too, that both of them being kill'd not long after in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
of <hi>Capua,</hi> they sealed their innocency with their last breath, and
vow'd that the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> civility in curing these wounds he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in being made their Prisoners, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ingratitude in
terming their misfortune their treachery, made them in revenge aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Eagles, and serve under <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Ensigns, who though he had
taken the Town, yet the Castle which stood upon the point of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
did resolutely defend it self: and well it might, for the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginean</hi>
having no Ships to hinder their relief, every Easterly Wind the
<hi>Grecians</hi> supply'd it with Men and Victuals; but at last, when all <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
Engineers could not find a way to block it up, he himself did;
for having taken good store of Gallies, in the Key of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and not
being able by Sea to bring them out of Harbor, because the Castle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all the streights and passages, he caus'd the Gallies with an
admirable celerity and art to be put upon Carts, and so carried them by
Land into the Sea, and in that miraculous manner besieged them round,
which the <hi>Romans</hi> discerning, not long after yielded. I have told you
(said <hi>Izadora</hi>) this particular, since it never had a president, or an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and because it dejected the Senate more than the loss of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
by finding they had to deal with an Enemy whose industry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the very order of nature, making one Element bear the burthen
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96335:80"/>
and do the office of another. From thence he went into <hi>Lucania,</hi> where i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
a bloody of Battel, he defeated <hi>Marcus Centineus,</hi> who publishing aloud,
that he loved the Senate and his Honour too well to bring them news that
his Army was lost, resolutely thrusting himself into the midst of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
where he found upon the points of a thousand Swords
the cure of that days misfortune. From this fatal Field, he carried his
victorious Troops into <hi>Apulia,</hi> where by a stratagem too intricate and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to be related he reduc'd Praetor <hi>Fabius</hi>'s Army, from Twenty to
Two thousand: But to qualifie these high successes he receiv'd advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that both the Consuls were set down before <hi>Capua,</hi> and by the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their approaches, had already so straitned it, that unless he brought
the place an immediate relief, it would be past any. These pressing
Letters made him carry the War into <hi>Campania,</hi> where after he had a little
refresh'd himself, he offer'd the Consuls Battel, who as readily accepted
it, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then in too desperate a sickness to try a
desperate Cure. That day much of those fertile Plains were moystned
with Blood; and though <hi>Hannibal</hi> perfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d all the parts of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
General, and of a valiant Soldier, yet it was darkness and not victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which ended the dispute. The next morning as soon as it was light, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
again drew his Army in Battalia, but the Consuls, who had not (by
the precedent days loss) Men enough to keep the Field and Trenchestoo,
contented themselves to continue in the latter; so that thereby they
made his fortune the more admirable; for he was Conqueror without
fighting, because he won the Battel the day after it was fought. But
after he had by many attempts endeavor'd to relieve his Confederates,
and found, that though he besieg'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet that they did the like
to the <hi>Capuans,</hi> the Consuls having both victuall'd and fortify'd themselves
sufficiently, he resolv'd to effect that by diversion which he could not
by force, and therefore past silently the River <hi>Vulturnus,</hi> and crossing
with wonderful expedition the Countreys of the <hi>Sidicinians, Artifanians,
Cassinians</hi> and <hi>Fregellans,</hi> he in seven days presented himself before the
magnificent Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had done it much sooner, had not the
<hi>Fregillans</hi> pull'd down the Bridge at the River <hi>Lyris,</hi> and thereby much
retarded his march; and though this was meerly a stratagem of War,
yet he attributed it to a gallantry of his Passion; for in a Letter he sent
me, it relisht more of <hi>Izadora's</hi> Soldier to take <hi>Rome</hi> than relieve <hi>Capua.</hi>
It is not difficult to believe that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who did fear to hear of
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> did much more so to see him at their Gates, especially being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by a triumphant Army; But for all his using such unimaginable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
the Senate receiv'd secret advice of his designs. Never <hi>Rome</hi>
was fill'd with so universal a Terror as then, no not when the <hi>Gaules</hi>
under the valiant <hi>Breunus,</hi> conquer'd all of it but the Capitol, and when
the <hi>Forum</hi> ran with streams of the Senates and <hi>Patricians</hi> Blood. This
great consternation had no influence upon any but the people, the Senate
still maintaining that gravity and courage which was their nature as much
as practice; but at the length the common fear was well silenc'd by the
arrival of <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> (one of the Consuls that had besieg'd <hi>Capua</hi>)
who being sent for to defend <hi>Rome,</hi> was come almost as soon as <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
and brought with him 15000 of the select Legionaries, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
choice Men at Arms. That which gave him the happiness of coming
so opportunely, was, not only the timely intelligence was sent him,
but also passing through Countries that were his friends, he receiv'd none
of those impediments which the <hi>Carthaginean</hi> met with. The Senate sent
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96335:80"/>
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> met with. The Senate sent for one of the Consuls to
please the People, and but for one, not to please <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who might
have too much glory'd to have made them neglect their Conquests for
their safeties. The Consul <hi>Flaccus</hi> being inform'd, that the next morning
the enemy intended to storm <hi>Rome,</hi> resolv'd (with the permission of
the Senate) to make a Battel, <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s only way to the assault, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
generously, that 'twas not fit the Empire of the World should fall
like a common City, but if the expiration of it were now arriv'd, 'twere
requisite its ruine should shew its greatness, and that those which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it should dye with it. The day therefore no sooner began to appear,
but the valiant Consul drew out his Army, which with those he brought,
and those <hi>Romans</hi> that voluntarily came under his Ensigns, consisted of
50000 Men. <hi>Hannibal</hi> on the other side about the same instant, drew
his Soldiers out of their Camp, but he admir'd when instead of seeing the
Walls cover'd with his Enemies, he perceiv'd the Fields were so; but his
wonder was soon converted into joy, to observe that <hi>Rome</hi> would fall
like her self, and that he should have to deal with those upon even terms,
who he had suspected would give him more trouble to joyn with, than
to conquer them; and to lose no time, he commanded the Trumpets,
the Clairons, and all the other Musick of War, to give the signal of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
which no sooner was heard, than both these great Bodies began to
move with resolution worthy their Quarrel, the one fighting to win the
Empire of the World, and the other to keep it. But just as they were
about to begin that fatal Tragedy, the Sun (which till then had shone
very bright) began to hide it self, as perhaps detesting to look upon so
many intended Murders; the whole face of the Heaven was in an instant
obscur'd with a thick darkness; the Thunder did hideously grumble; the
winds made a noise, as if they had all broken loose out of their Caves,
and the Clouds melted so fast, that many thought the Lightnings had
dissolv'd them, and as many admir'd how so much fire could avoid
quenching in so much water: I cannot better describe the horror of
this day, then by the effects it produced, which were, that it constrain'd
the Consul and <hi>Hannibal</hi> to return with their Armies into their several
Camps; for <hi>Flaccus</hi> too had pitch'd his Tents in a great field some two
furlongs from the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> lest <hi>Hannibals</hi> being before <hi>Rome</hi>
should look like besieging it, which none could truly say he did, whilst
there was a <hi>Roman</hi> betwixt him and the City. But that which afflicted
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> as much as this miraculous separation, which he then termed
but a suspension of his victory, was an advertisement he received by his
Spies, that the Senate had not only since his coming sent certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
with flying Ensigns to the recruit of their Legions in <hi>Spain,</hi> but
also had sold those very fields on which he Campt, at a higher rate,
thau they were valu'd at before his being possest of them; In revenge
whereof, he caus'd all the rich Shops in the <hi>Forum,</hi> to be sold by a
publique Cryer. But sir, (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) that which made the precedent
storm so absolutely a wonder, was, that as soon as <hi>Flaccus</hi> and <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
were returned into their Camps, the day prov'd so very fair, and
the night too, that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> was proud with a belief, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

next visit of the Sun, would unavoidably decide his Fate; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
also he was deluded, for the succeeding day, was but a perfect repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the preceding, as well for the Miracle, as for the separation of
the two Armies, onely the <hi>Tyber</hi> was with those Cataracts of Rain, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly

reveng'd all the <hi>Romans</hi> losses by the ruine of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Army; but
he by a timely care remov'd his Tents to a higher ground, and thereby
avoided an Enemy, which he could not resist. I remember, I have been
told, that several private persons in <hi>Rome</hi> (for the Senate detested to
seem to derive any advantage, but from their Arms) perform'd many
sacrifices to the Nymphs and Nayades of <hi>Tyber</hi> for endeavouring their
revenge, and for making <hi>Hannibal</hi> fly out of his Camp, which never any
<hi>Romans</hi> thitherto had done.</p>
               <p>I must now, generous <hi>Spartacus,</hi> acquaint you with a particular which
few have heard, and fewer have believ'd, in which last number, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

that story you seem so much concern'd in: <hi>Blacius,</hi> (according to <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s

capable of, to carry his Arms to any other place, rather than to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of that City, where I had my Birth, with this hope, that if my
Prayers were successful, it would free <hi>Rome</hi> from an imminent ruine, and
if they were not, 'twould prove a good rise to free me from his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses:
for he abhorr'd an allyance with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as highly as with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi> and detested the Enemy of his Countrey as much as of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I immediately obey'd <hi>Blacius,</hi> as much by inclination as by duty,
and sent a post away with a Letter to the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> which because
'twas my own, I did not think it worthy the remembring: my Express
came to him in the midst of his fury for these two unfortunate separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of his Resolves the next morning, if his Souldiers could not
march, they should swim to a Victory; but as soon as he had read my
Letter, he divested himself of all his rage, and gave immediate Orders
to have his Army the next day ready to march away, contenting himself
(as he gave it out) that he had made <hi>Rome</hi> tremble, and necessitated the
gods to a double miracle for her safety (that of the Inundations, and
that of his not taking her:) But yet to satisfy the Avarice and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

they assembled the Senate, where after a serious debate, <hi>Vibius</hi>
(Uncle to <hi>Perolla</hi>) perceiving that the major part inclin'd to submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Mercy, in an excellent Oration befought them, rather to dye
by their own hands, and so rob their Enemies of the Glory of full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
by contributing to their own ruine, and make <hi>Hannibal</hi> know by
so noble a fall, that the preserving of such generous friends, had been
more worthy his Arms, than the taking of that which he but attempted;
that it was more resembling the antient splendor of <hi>Capua,</hi> to perform
what might rather create the <hi>Romans</hi> admiration than their pity, that
for his own particular, he esteem'd no Fate so bad, as to make up a part
of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Flaccus</hi>'s Triumph, which was the best condition they
could expect by a surrender; therefore all those who were gallant enough
to expire with their liberty, he invited to go with him, and take their
share of a Cup, which should exempt them for ever from the cruelties
and vicissitudes of Fortune. After he had finished these words, he saluted
the Senate with an admirable constancy, and being follow'd by seven
and twenty Senators, he went directly home, where they all hasted to
pledge that fatal health which he began, having no fears in their deaths,
but that the <hi>Romans</hi> should possess <hi>Capua</hi> before they were acted. I have
told you (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) this Tragedy, not only because it was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and admiration of the whole World, but also because the chief
Actor of it had so near a relation to my generous Friend, the rest of the
Senate immediately submitted to the Consuls, and found from <hi>Flaccus,</hi> that
death with ignominy, which they might have given themselves with
Glory. <hi>Hannibal</hi> to revenge his dead Friends, perform'd many great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
in the Countreys of the <hi>Brutians</hi> and <hi>Lucanians,</hi> where he sacrific'd
to appease their <hi>Manes</hi> above ten thousand <hi>Romans,</hi> and then the season
being unfit for action, he return'd to this City, and in a Complement to
me, declin'd a Triumphant Entry, because the chiefest ornaments of it,
were to have been compos'd of the spoils of my Countrey.</p>

his Superior, that the Sacrifices which are usually offer'd to appease
the incens'd Deity, and to break the Oracles unaccustom'd silence, onely
expected his presence to be performed. He immediately obey'd the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, though he had much rather employ'd his time in hearing of <hi>Syman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
whose Relations so charm'd him, that it almost darkened his Piety;

was well pleased with their Devotions, but that he
could not as yet discover any Maxim in Divination,
which might afford a certainty, that within few
days, the Oracle should be restored to the liberty
of speaking. <hi>Artabanes</hi> was extreamly troubled
with this belief, and the better to entertain those thoughts it created,
he withdrew himself into a solitude which that morning he had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and which was indeed a place fit to cherish so deep a melancholly
as his: it was in a Valley all over-hung with lofty Trees, whose tops
were so interwoven by the help of Nature onely, that they rather form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an obscurity than a shade; it was watred too with many clear Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
whose sad murmur seemed to bear our unfortunate Lover compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

so far from the Temple, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> (whose natural strength was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much impaired by an internal grief which by degrees consumed him)
was constrained to make use of his Horse to return thither, where he was

the grass, and after a serious reflexion on his past misfortunes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

that you enjoyn me to live after a loss, which makes my life my torment?
or are you ignorant that it lies not in your power (in this life) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the miseries you have cast upon me in it? if not one of these, why
did you command me to live, when I had almost found in my resolution
my cure? and enjoyn me to receive my Fate from this Oracle, on which
at the same instant, you impos'd an extraordinary silence; if you intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

so great a Heart? and if you meant the latter, why did you give me so
great a Constancy? Shall I find Courage is as high a Curse to me, as it is
a Blessing to others? and shall I find in Virtue a greater torment than
ever you inflicted for the punishment of Vice? Great gods! (he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

undertook, and having begged <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s pardon, for dwelling so

                  <p>YOU may be pleased (said <hi>Izadora</hi> to my Prince) to excuse me,
if I have too much particularized <hi>Hannibals</hi> success and actions,
on which I should not have so long insisted, had he not vowed to me,
they were performed more upon the score of Love than Glory, in which
last he was ambitious to our Rival <hi>Perolla,</hi> as much as <hi>Perolla</hi> had him
in the first. I believe too, you have not forgot, that when he did leave
this City, he did not either his hopes or his passion, the first of which
was cherish'd by <hi>Oristes's</hi> undertaking and promises, who to avoid being as
false to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as he had been to Virtue, entirely bent himself to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
the perfectest flame that ever any Lovers were capable of, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Vice, is never so powerful as when it assumes the habit of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
he resolved to take up the name, and (for a while too) the actions
of a friend, in which hypocrisie he was so successful, that he made <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
his, as sincerely as he was seemingly so to him; and truly he prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so excellent a Conterfeit, that his misfortune had been as great if he
had not reacht his ends, as his fault was in attaining them. In brief, he
so engaged himself in all my generous friends concerns, and so deeply sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathized
in his joys, his fears, and all his other passions, that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the work of time, to disclose the fallacy: but at last, hearing of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi>
return, and knowing that delay in designs of Love and Glory, are
equally intollerable, he began to sow the seed of jealousie betwixt us,
which he was confident would bring him so plentiful a return; and
indeed it was a great misfortune that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had elected an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
so perfect, both in dissimulation, and in wickedness; for if the
former had been less, his power to do ill had resembled it, and if the
latter had been so, his Will had been the like; but both concurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
was a danger whose greatness can hardly be equalled, but to the
goodness of those powers which hindered its effect. I told you, Sir,
though <hi>Oristes</hi> knew well, what <hi>Hannibals</hi> impatience would be, yet he
declined his attempt, till a good while after his return, not doubting but
to satisfy him for the delay, by the certainty of the advantage it would
produce. In order to this, the same night he entred <hi>Salapia, Oristes</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him, of whom he immediately inquired with an earnestness, which
demonstrated an accession, rather than a Diminution of his passion, what
progress he had made towards the settlement of his felicity: to which
the false Agent replyed, that as yet he had been but preparing, what he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96335:83"/>
shortly intended to act, and thereupon informed him, how that he had
got so great an interest in <hi>Perolla,</hi> that he doubted not but to employ it
for his certain ruine, if at least, <hi>Hannibal</hi> redoubled his assiduity towards
me, and whatsoever my usage were, that he would not only put on a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
which might relish of satisfaction, but cast out words, which
might make all the <hi>Salapians</hi> believe, and talk of the change, which when
once divulged, and none permitted to visit <hi>Perolla,</hi> but such as would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and relate what they heard, he would so Husband that report, that
if <hi>Perolla's</hi> constancy were not his nature, it must inevitably be ruined.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> exceedingly approv'd of this advice, and so admirably acted
his part, that not only most of the <hi>Salapians</hi> believ'd I had a real passion
for him, but also <hi>Blacius</hi> did so. This great alteration soon flew like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through the City, and at last came to <hi>Perolla,</hi> whose amazement
as it proceeded rather from his finding so many were mistaken in me, than
that he himself was so. But <hi>Oristes</hi> who attributed his to the cause he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
and not to the true one, came one day to <hi>Perolla's</hi> Chamber, where
after having with great vehemency, protested to him an unequall'd friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
he conjur'd him by it, to cast off a melancholly which would rather
increase my Triumph, than make me repent my crime; and that if he were
so unfortunate as yet to have a passion for one which was so unworthy
of it, and desired to reclaim me, he should rather, than constantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
seemingly divest himself of his Flame, and contemn me; for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like
Kings were more concerned to subdue a Rebel, than to make
a new Conquest. I am sorry (<hi>Perolla</hi> coldly reply'd) that I have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to place so high a justice upon the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>'s constancy, as
not to suspect it when <hi>Oristes</hi> does: But (he continued) is it possible,
that a perfection more apparent than this Calumny can be so unhappy as
to be doubted by Men of judgement and honesty? Ah! unjust Heaven,
why did you establish the Throne of Virtue in the Heart, and not in some
conspicuous place, where to be virtuous, and to be known so, had been
the same thing? but perhaps the highest proof of virtue is undisturbedly
to endure the reproaches of Vice, and if goodness were visible, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Interests,
and not our Inclinations might make us embrace it, whereas when
it has no witness but the possessor, it is a nobler invitation to it. But
<hi>Oristes,</hi> lest your should persevere in your crime, know, that constancy
is <hi>Izadora</hi>'s nature as well as practise, and I having no Title to her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but her goodness, I should be as foolish to doubt the foundation
of my felicity, as miserable if it fail'd. I wish (reply'd <hi>Oristes) Izadora</hi>
had a constancy worthy so noble a Flame, and if this be not the object
of my belief, it shall be at least of my Prayers. You speak (said <hi>Perolla</hi>)
as if you had still some doubts of her Passion for me. Would to the gods
(he coldly replyed, folding his Arms, and casting down his eyes) that
mine were but doubts: (and then unfolding them, and looking up cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
again) but I am too blame (he continued) to make you misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before your time, and to let my words be so unfortunate, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with what her actions will. Ah <hi>Oristes (Perolla</hi> cryed out) I
conjure you by all the gods, inform me of your suspitions, and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
if I receive any trouble from them, it can proceed onely from the
knowledge that my friend has injured what he should admire; for in what
concerns my particular, I am as far from believing she can be criminal, as
she is from being so; No, no, <hi>Oristes,</hi> I beseech you, tell me your suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that I may remove them, and that for your good opinion of her, I
may be oblig'd as mch to your Reason, as your Faith; and the sooner
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96335:83"/>
to induce you to this; I must tell you plainly, that to be my friend, and
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s Enemy is inconsistent. The wicked <hi>Oristes</hi> perceived by these
generous replies, that he had undertaken a task as difficult, as dishonest, but
knowing himself too far engaged to retire, he told <hi>Perolla</hi> (with a deep
sigh) I had rather renounce all things, than the blessing of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and therefore what I thought to have acquainted you with, as an
effect of my care, I will silence as an argument of my respect; but perhaps
<hi>Izadora's</hi> flame for <hi>Hannibal</hi> may tell you a truth, which the excess of your
passion makes me decline to do: neither would I have so much as mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this, did I not know, it is already as publique as true, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that you have heard it. That I have heard it (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) is not more
certain, than that I do not believe it; but alas (he continued) is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that <hi>Oristes</hi> does? If I did not apprehend (he replyed) to offend you,
by acquainting you with my belief, I should inform you of it, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it with such pregnant reasons, as perhaps it might turn to be yours
too. I conjure you (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> hastily) to impart it to me, for I find, 'tis
as impossible to remove your jealousies, till I know them,, as 'twere for
you to have any of <hi>Izadora,</hi> if you knew her. I will then (said <hi>Oristes</hi> (tell you freely, that not only I believe she has gas given her self to the
<hi>Carthaginian,</hi> but also wonder you do not: consider (I beseech you)
that Inconstancy and Ambition are the Hereditary Vices of her Sex; that
you are a forlorn Prisoner, that your Rival is a Triumphant Conqueror,
which are two extreams that can hardly avoid creating those two others in
your Mistriss: Reflect, I beseech you, upon the difference between the
imaginary Crown of Constancy, and the real one of Empire; For though
<hi>Hannibal</hi> be not born of a King, yet his Virtue makes him the disturber of
Kingdoms, which is a more glorious power, than any that can be deriv'd
from Succession or Birth; Remember also that a Woman is more pleas'd
with the Power, than with the Merit of her Lover, the first being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which she participates in, but the last, one, which he wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosses
to himself.</p>
                  <p>This (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> interrupting him) is the character of some of her Sex,
but 'tis not of <hi>Izadora,</hi> whose Reason as much as Nature, detests so black
a crime; I say, her Reason, for the cannot decline a Crown of Vertue
for one of Gold, but the reflection on the purchase, will deprive her of
all the joy of it; and though a Crown of Empire be more glittering than
one of Constancy, yet the just gods, by conferring many real advantages
on the latter, have abundantly repair'd the seeming ones of the former;
for the first being material, is subject to the inconstancies of Fortune,
but the last being a speculative Blessing, is exempted from the power of
that blind goddess: yes, doubtless, a Crown of Constancy is the noblest,
as well as safest, for it produces Admiration, where the other does Envy.
Alas (said <hi>Oristes</hi>) how ingenuous you are to invent Arguments to cousen
your self, and as if <hi>Izadora</hi> deluded you not fast enongh, you contribute
to her design. Take heed (reply'd <hi>Perolla</hi>) of what you say, for I can
hardly believe him virtuous, that thinks she is not. This made <hi>Oristes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that to destroy my generous Friends good opinion of me, he must
decline arguments, and employ demonstrations, which made him say,
Though I find I shall create your anger, by acquainting you with what
I lately discover'd; yet I had rather hazard the losing of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by an action which will render me worthy of it, than continue
it by a silence which my own Couscience will more severely punish,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96335:84"/>
than you can. Yes, yes, <hi>Perolla,</hi> I am determin'd since to cure your disease
I must shew you the deformity of it, to instruct you with a truth, that had
not my sight been a witness of, I should never have credited; in a word;
'tis that with these Eyes I lately saw her give such large proofs of her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that not only I suspect her Constancy but her Vertue.
At these barbarous words, all <hi>Perolla</hi>'s temper abandon'd him, and in its
room he entertain'd a rage so unresistable, that forgetting all the former<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties
of friendship, he flung himself upon the false <hi>Oristes,</hi> and having cast
him at his feet, and there drawn out the wretches own Ponyard, he held
it to his breast, and cry'd out to him, Traytor, that under the habit of a
friend, thinkst to shrowd thy self from the punishment of an Enemy, and
from a crime the Devils would tremble but to hear; know, that in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s Virtue, thou hast justify'd her, and by undertaking to make
her guilty, hast prov'd thy self so: Do not think, that because I have lost
my Liberty, I have lost my Courage, nor that the apprehension of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
resentments shall hinder me from acting mine; no, no, could he inflict on
me torments as great as those thou merit'st, I would endure them all,
rather than thy impiety should escape them unreveng'd; for that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice, which has made me from a Prisoner, a Judge, and hast fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
me with Power as well as Will to punish thee, would not have so
arm'd my Hand, if it had not ordain'd, thy death should appease that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Virtue, thy life has so highly injur'd. Whilst <hi>Perolla</hi> wai thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the falfe <hi>Oristes</hi> lay as if he had already receiv'd the reward of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
but when he perceiv'd his resolution, and that he was going to
act it, he cry'd out, Hold, generous <hi>Perolla,</hi> and if I beg this small sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of Life, 'tis only to let you know, who 'tis you destroy, 'tis
your faithful'st Friend; and now I have told you that Truth, act your
resentments, for since you have withdrawn your friendship, they will
be rather effects of your goodness, than your revenge, and the gods who
know my innocency, are so just as to render that which makes my life my
misfortune, the cure of the latter, by the ending of the former. Though
I know well (reply'd <hi>Perolla</hi>) all thou now say'st, is but a continuation
of thy wickedness, and that these words are spoken, because thou hast
found I am sooner vanquish'd with dissembling, than resistance, yet I give
thee thy Life, not as a mercy but a punishment, for the horror of having
injur'd so fair an Innocence, will be a greater torment, than that death from
which I now exempt thee: Rise then (he continu'd) and be gone, but if
ever again thou present'st thy self before me, thou wilt kindle a fire,
which nothing but thy bloud can extinguish. I will obey you (said the
perfiduous <hi>Oristes</hi>) in hope that by so painful an obedience, you will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
a friendship and innocency, which your passion hinders you now
from seeing, and if by my sufferings I can shew you your error, I shall never
deplore them. Then saluting <hi>Perolla</hi> with a great humility, he went from
him with a greater joy, 'having escap'd a Death which he could not
think he had more strangely avoided, than he had justly deserved it. I
know (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) that 'twere but just to decline a while the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the rest of my Story, to declaim upon this generous part of it;
but I know too, <hi>Perolla</hi>'s virtue would be as much offended with such a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
as I was pleas'd with the cause of it. <hi>Perolla,</hi> who for so obliging a
Civility esteem'd it necessary to make his fair Mistriss a return, told her,
If you had a design, Madam, to have made this performance pass in the
generous <hi>Spartacus</hi> opinion for an action of Merit, you should not then
have shew'd him the perfect <hi>Izadora;</hi> for in her Beauty she carries her
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96335:84"/>
Justification, and to suspect that Vice can dwell in so much brightness, is
to be ignorant of its Nature, and to commit a folly as high as <hi>Oristes</hi>
wickedness. <hi>Izadora</hi> by a reply of the same quality, repaid her Lovers
Compliment, and thus reassum'd her discourse.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the false Agent was gone from <hi>Perolla,</hi> he went and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> with his ill success, from whose rage he had like to
have receiv'd an usage as ill, as that which <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Justice had near impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on him, for he had rais'd his expectation to such a height, that it made
the fall the more insupportable: but at last <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiving that
<hi>Oristes</hi> was unfortunate, and not faulty, (at least as to him) he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to tell him, that he must not expect his favour, till he had gain'd
him mine; that it was too the sensiblest way of obliging him, as well as
of revenging that so fresh and high affront: that their Interest being now
joyn'd, he would not despair, but that he wou'd project some new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
for the obtaining of his desires, which if it succeeded, should make
him acknowledge, that whosoever made <hi>Hannibal</hi> happy, could not doubt
the being made so by him. Thereupon <hi>Oristes</hi> having first assur'd him that
no particular interest of his own could bring any accession to that zeal,
he had already for his satisfaction, and that he would employ all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to the settlement of it, withdrew himself to meditate on what he
determin'd to practice. But it is high time to inform you, that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian,</hi>
(though he constantly visited me) had yet (in reliance on <hi>Oristes</hi> promises) declin'd making any overtures of his passion, lest my replies might
have provok'd him beyond his temper, and made him disclose a fallacy,
which with admirable patience and sagacity, he had so long continu'd;
but now, seeing those hopes were vanisht, he resolv'd to renew his addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and to that end came to see me, where finding me alone (which my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and condition, made me often elect) he, without any of those ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities which he usually practis'd, told me; That long silence, Madam,
which your Commands have made me observe, the violence of my Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
makes me break, which is arriv'd to such a height, that it must now be
the occasion of my Felicity or my Ruine, for it can admit of nothing but
extreams, and I must now become the object of your hate or of your Love;
the gods shall be my witnesses, that I have declin'd this declaration, till ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
constrain'd me to it, and I believe you cannot doubt, but it must be
a strange violence, which forces me to what I apprehend is a trouble to
you; Yes, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> I say, forces me unto it; for, in what depended
on my Will, when 'twas to acquaint you with my respect, I declin'd my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
I declin'd my Ambition, two of the most pleasing passions, and not
to offend you, I elected to offend the gods, chusing to reward my Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers valors
with sacred things, rather than with the spoils of <hi>Rome.</hi> But in
what relates to my Flame, I am not master of my own motions, I have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
my self, not to do the like to you, I have endeavour'd to establish
your felicity, by ruining my own, and I have represented to my self, that
I ought not to have a higher contentment than the setling of yours; but
Madam, all my endeavours therein are fruitless; for I find the passion of
Love is most predominant, and that the extinguishing of my flame is as
impossible, as I believe the performing it would be pleasing to you; but
your Beauty that makes my crime, must be my excuse, for it has charms to
print a Passion, as well as Majesty to enjoyn Obedience. This (fair <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>)
is my condition, and 'tis at the last extremity, and after all Essays,
that I am come to implore your Affection, when I know I should rather
beg your pardon. I must confess (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) so violent a beginning
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96335:85"/>
gave me strange apprehensions what the conclusion of this visit would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;
but (lest my fears might increase his considence) I instantly reply'd;
If you have had any great conflicts with your self, for the setling of my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
I believe those I have had for the acquainting you with my gratitude,
have not been inferior to them; but that same Will which forces you to a
perseverance in your affection, necessitates me to the like in mine; and
since by an experiment you find we have something within us, which is the
god over our inclinations, I hope you will pardon my not accepting
your affection, upon the same score that I excuse the continuation of yours.
If (said <hi>Hannibal</hi> extreamly mov'd) our Wills were wholly created by
our Fancies, which are the most often deprav'd irregularities, there might
be some appearance in what you alledge; but since amongst reasonable
Creatures, reason commonly forms them, I must look upon that which
you do term a constraint resembling mine, rather as a design'd cruelty for
my destruction; for if <hi>Perolla</hi> has purchas'd any glory, I believe my stock
is not less than his; if he have a high a passion for you, mine is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or;
if he have paid you any services, I have not been deficient in those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and if he has received any gifts from nature, perhaps I have not been
unbeholding to her: therefore Madam, you cannot be so unjust to use that
argument, for the continuing of your flame, which I did for your pardon
for persevering in mine, the difference betwixt you and <hi>Perolla</hi> being so
vast, that none which is not as blind as Love, can imagine the same effects
have an equal cause.</p>
                  <p>I must acknowledge (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) I was so sensible of hearing him
make his own Elogy, so much too, to the prejudice of <hi>Perolla,</hi> that I had
not apprehended what I should have said for his justification, might have
turn'd (through <hi>Hannibals</hi> fury) to his prejudice, I had made him know
how much (in truth, and in my judgement) he was his own flatterer;
but that consideration made me only tell him, If either our Wills be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our Fancy or Reason, or composed of both, I find in <hi>Perolla</hi> a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
subject for the continuance of my affection, than you can do in me, for
a perseverance in yours; 'tis not that I give him any precedency over the
great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who it may be (had I known him first) might have had
that heart, which now it is impossible for any but <hi>Perolla</hi> to possess; but
the Stars have tyed me to him, 'tis not in my power, nor in my inclination,
to change their influence: therefore, Sir, I conjure you, let your genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
act what your judgement should, give me cause to admire what I am
unworthy to love, and consider 'tis something of divine to make others hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
If (said the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> with a Face all inflam'd with fury) it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for <hi>Hannibal</hi> to possess your heart, I will render it as impossible for
<hi>Perolla,</hi> who shall find I have a power to make others miserable, if I my
self am made so; and since you esteem the possession of <hi>Izadora</hi> too great
a felicity for me, I must think it is so for any other; Your cruelty (Madam)
constrains me to this declaration, which whatsoever influence it has on me,
it shall have the like on <hi>Perolla:</hi> and if at last you reduce me to despair, I
will accompany my ruine with ones, whose loss you will deplore, as much
as you would rejoyce at mine, Great gods! what a trembling did these
barbarous threatenings put me into? they were a thousand times fuller of
horror, than if they had been made against my own life, but amongst
all those fears, the reflection on <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Power, and Inclination, and
consequently on <hi>Perolla</hi>'s danger, arm'd me with such a resolution, that
had had I follow'd the dictates of it, I might have rendred that rage a
justice, which was a cruelty: but my good Genius gave me power to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96335:85"/>
it, and finding the Tyrant was the fiercer by opposition, I replyed,
The virtues of the great <hi>Hannibal</hi> are too well known unto me, to suspect,
any passions can be more predominate over him, than they: those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailties can only do like clouds, hinder the Sun from shining,, but
not extinguish his light; 'tis his anger, and not he which threatens me. No,
no, Madam (the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> hastily replyed, interrupting me) do not
flatter your self, nor me, in believing I am capable of milder resolutions,
than I have acquainted you with, and receive this as an unalterable Truth,
that the same hour in which you absolutely take away my hopes, I will <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla's</hi>
life. With those cruel words he went out of the room, and left
me alone to breath out those complaints, which I disdain'd to utter in
his presence, But, Sir, my astonishment at this proceeeding, was far short
of what it was raised unto, by that I am now going to tell you. Some
four or five days after, <hi>Hannibal</hi> came to visit me again, where having
found by oblique questions, that his assaults had rather confirm'd, than
mov'd my resolutions, he immediately made me such submissive r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for what was past, that I believed they were as real as humble; then
he assured me, that having always loved me above himself, he was come
to evidence that truth, by an undeniable experiment; that the respect
he paid the happy <hi>Perolla,</hi> as being the object of my love, was greate than
his aversion to him, for being the obstructer of his; and since he thought
no evincement of the reality of those professions could be both so great and
pleasing, as the ruining of his own felicity, for the establishing of mine,
he was determined to settle it, at that rate, that his former threatenings
were but as a last Essay, and that having found our flames were too Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
to admit of extinction, he was inviolably fixt to admire what he
could not destroy; and to obtain a pardon for those persecutions his
passion, and not he had raised us, he would immediately restore <hi>Perolla</hi>
to his liberty, and employ all his authority with <hi>Blacius</hi> to unite, what
was a sin any longer to divide. At these generous words, I cast my self
at the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> feet, and by too many expressions for a repetition
acquainted him with my joy and acknowledgements. Immediately after
he went to <hi>Perolla,</hi> where in civilities of a resembling quality, he implor'd
his forgiveness, and begg'd him always when he consider'd his persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he would too, consider the occasion of them, that so the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on the cause, might apologize for the effect; he besought him
further, to remember the obligation was greater to lay down a passion
for <hi>Izadora,</hi> than the injury was to have assumed one: since having seen
her, not to be his Rival, could not prove a greater miracle, than having
been it, ever to decline that name. After some other expressions, and
embraces, <hi>Hannibal</hi> assured <hi>Perolla,</hi> that as an argument of his conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that he had silenc'd (if not suppress'd) his passion from that
instant he restored him to so perfect a liberty, that he might either return
to <hi>Rome,</hi> or continue in <hi>Salapia,</hi> My generous friend with an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of wonder and joy, received these transcendent civilities from
the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and having made him some retributions proportionate to
their cause, he was invited by him to his own House, where by fresh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of the like quality, he induc'd all the <hi>Salapians,</hi> not only to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at, but believe the change. But (continu'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) least your asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
should prove as great at the hearing, as ours at the performance
of these mutations, I must acquaint you, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was seemingly
gallant, but to become the more securely the contrary; and though he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96335:86"/>
were a Prince, who in affairs of craft and ingenuity, had hardly any equal,
yea, his Genius had a greater propensity to those stratagems, which were
for the winning of a Battel, or a Kingdom, than a Mistriss; This Truth I
believe you will not question by the sequel of this discourse, which I
must continue, by informing you, that the same night after his fatal decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which he made me, concerning <hi>Perolla,</hi> he sent for <hi>Oristes,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lockt themselves up in his Closet, he informed him particularly of
what had past betwixt us, and conjured him to find out an expedient for
his relief, which if any longer delay'd, would immediately prove his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
To this his wicked Counsellor reply'd, We have already (Sir)
by our attempts on <hi>Perolla,</hi> observed that his constancy finds in them rather
arguments of Triumph, than Suppression; we must therefore now assault
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s, for it imports not whether you reach your desires by <hi>Perolla</hi>'s
declining her; or by <hi>Izadora</hi>'s deserting him; and I am confident, had not
your resentments forc'd you to threaten your Rivals life, I had found
out a way which would have made it his torment, and whose success could
not have fail'd, without the gods declaring themselves as much enemies to
your Love, as they have been friends to your Glory. 'Twas (he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd)
that I would have had you in your next visit to <hi>Izadora</hi> (in case
you found your threatenings had not produced the effects you desired)
not only alter your words, but your looks, and by a countenance alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
penitent, acquaint her, that you are resolv'd to give her a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your Passion, by suppressing the effects of it; that since the only
way to manifest how much you valu'd her contentment, is to deprive
your self of your own, you are come to divest your self of it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
your hopes, and resigning them to <hi>Perolla,</hi> who you must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
is more worthy of the Felicity, by her esteeming him so; that
since you could not conquer her, you have vanquish'd your self, and
that imitation in of her, you valu'd him above your self.</p>
                  <p>'Tis (said <hi>Oristes</hi>) with such professions as these I would infuse in her a
firm belief, that you would attempt against your own, rather than <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>'s
life, and the better to disguise the fallacy, I am absolutely of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that not only your words, but your actions speak your change, I
mean by giving him his liberty, and inviting him to continue near his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss;
for I can assure you, <hi>Blacius</hi> is so vigilant of his Daughter, that your
Rival can derive no advantage by his freedom, and so detests any alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Bloud, that he had rather marry <hi>Izadora</hi> to her grave,
than to <hi>Perolla;</hi> whose Father I would have you send on some employment
of so long a continuance, that in his absence we may act our intention;
having then by such pregnant testimonies of your conversion, rais'd a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in your Mistriss, that you have no designs for her, but to see her
married to <hi>Perolla</hi> (which I would always press to <hi>Blacius,</hi> and as his
aversions for it increas'd, so should your sollicitations) I would then
one night privately seize upon <hi>Perolla,</hi> and by bribing two or three Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
(amongst which, <hi>Blacius</hi>'s should be one, who is my intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and whose aversion to all <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Family, and affection to
Gold, will induce him to say any thing we shall put in his mouth) make
them give out, that he dy'd of an Apoplexy, or some such suddain disease,
and then celebrate his Funeral with such mourning and pomp, that the
World may believe the reality of your Friendship is as great, as that of
his Death. This being artificially perform'd, you must a while mingle your
Tears with <hi>Izadora</hi>'s, as for your common loss, and so steal into her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96335:86"/>
by sympathizing in her friendship and her grief: For I cannot fancy,
but if your Rival were remov'd, all obstructins were so too, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of her flame being dead, she will (since 'tis without injuring her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or Felicity) bestow her self upon a Conqueror, whose Fame
only is able to dissolve the most frozen Breast. As for <hi>Perolla</hi> (if this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed)
you may either send him to another World in earnest, or after you
are marry'd, the more sensibly to revenge his having been so dangerous a
Rival, both in Love and Glory, permit him to continue in this; but the
first is the more secure, for his Presence may receive those Fires which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extinguish'd but her belief, that his Life was so; and thus whil'st you
possess <hi>Izadora,</hi> he may her Affection. That which induces me, not to have
<hi>Perolla</hi> kill'd, before you see the event of this design, is, lest if by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
she should resent his loss to such an extremity, as it may prove her
own; you may have still your remedy in your power, and thereby be in
no worse a condition, than that which you are in at present. The malicious
<hi>Oristes</hi> having done speaking, <hi>Hennibal</hi> continu'd a while weighing the
probability of this design, and having at last absolutely approv'd it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
(with much impatiency) of <hi>Oristes,</hi> whether yet it might not be
acted? To which his Agent reply'd, that those menaces made against <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla,</hi>
would make that relish of design, which should be esteem'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
since all the hope of the Plot, was the managing it with such dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
that <hi>Izadora</hi> should rather believe you deplor'd, than acted her
loss. I am (said the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>) perfectly convinc'd of what you alledge,
but those threatenings I made against my Rivals life, were spoken when
I was in so visible a distemper, that I am confident she ascribes them soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to my choller, than design: neither were they positive, but conditional,
and therefore probably, all the prejudice they will bring, will be only to
me, and not to what you propose, for it will tye me to act my part with
more dissimulation, and protract the time of my sufferings. Thus (said
<hi>Izadora) Hannibal</hi> took up a design, whose beginning I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
you of, and whose success was so proportionate to his desires, that
not only <hi>Izadora,</hi> but <hi>Perolla</hi> believ'd his conversion was as real, as 'twas
well acted. And <hi>Blacius</hi> (on the other side) so perfectly made good <hi>Oristes</hi>
assurance to the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> that in half a year, (in which <hi>Perolla</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
his liberty, and the priviledge of living in <hi>Salapia</hi>) I could never
have the happiness of seeing, or the satisfaction of hearing from him, and
when so intollerable a separation made the effects of it visible in my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
the artificious <hi>Hannibal</hi> offer'd, and conjur'd me to make use of his
power for our union, which had formerly been employ'd for our separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that what had injur'd, might relieve us: But he too well knew, I had
rather intrench'd upon my Felicity than Duty, and 'twas upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
he had made me that overture. To abbreviate my Relation I shall
tell you, that all which <hi>Oristes</hi> advis'd, was perform'd, and that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the better executing what related to <hi>Perolla</hi>'s sudden death,
was, that <hi>Pacuvius</hi> and all his were remov'd to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
(who only had <hi>Strato</hi> to wait on him) had employ'd him to <hi>Rome</hi>
about some private affairs. Oh gods! what my suffering was at that fatal
news you only know, but those effects of it which were visible, prov'd
so dangerous, that <hi>Blacius</hi> Physician was immediately sent for, to hinder
my death from accompanying <hi>Perola</hi>'s: and that Traitor detesting my alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with any of <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Family, and being corrupted by <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
after he had prescrib'd those things which he held needful for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
told me, That he was apprehensive the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had murther'd
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96335:87"/>
my Friend, to build his own felicity on his ruines; that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
counterfeited, than extinguisht his Flame, and therefore he would go
and visit <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Body, which if it had receiv'd any violence, he would as
certainly discover, as the gods punish it. This proposition suited with my
jealousies, and though the knowledge of what he suspected, would have
added to my grief (if at least it had been capable of any accession) by a
manifestation, that his Passion for me was the occasion of his death, yet I
embrac'd his motion, resolving if any Symptomes should evince so black a
Truth, that I would with one stroke revenge his Murther, and with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
follow him. The Physitian some little time after being return'd,
with many false Tears, protested, that <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Body had not the least
mark of an unnatural death, and that he ask'd the gods forgiveness, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
suspected so clear an Innocency as <hi>Hannibals.</hi> He then too began to
play the Physitian of the Mind, and besought me not to afflict my self, since
'twas not Man that had sent <hi>Perolla</hi> to the gods, but that they themselves
had call'd him: But alas, my afflictions had too just an object ever to cease
but with my life, which every day so exceedingly impair'd, that I was in
hopes by a speedy dissolution to make the end of torments in this world,
to be the beginning of joys in the other. In the mean time <hi>Hannibal</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s Funerals, with so many counterfeit weepings, and with
so much solemnity, that all <hi>Salapia</hi> believ'd 'twas he, and not <hi>Pacuvius</hi>
which had lost a Son. Two months together, he was so far from consoling
me by his visits, that by them he encreas'd my grief, which, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'d
me to a condition fitter to create his pitty than his affection, yet the
last had taken so deep a root, that no diminution of my little Beauty could
bring any to his passion, which indeed he could no longer silence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one evening he came to visit me, and though I was fitter for a Priest
than a Lover, yet he declar'd himself the latter, and begg'd me with the
perfect'st imporunities to receive and cherish a flame which he had silenc'd,
whilst he held it a crime; but now, that the higher Powers contributed so
much to reward its Purity, as to take him to them, which had hinder'd
me from justly receiving it, he flatter'd himself with a hope, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
his respect and passion, and to obey what the gods themselves
had so evidently approv'd, I would accept of a heart that yielded nothing
in the zeal of adoring me, to that of my last Servant and his Friend. I know
he spoke many things of this quality, which because I detested to hear,
I cannot repeat; for I so justly disrelisht this motion, that I had a strong
conflict with my self, to silence my resentments for it, but at length I
told him, Ah (Sir) how can you call your self <hi>Perolla</hi>'s friend? and
yet endeavour to disturb his Ashes? and how can you have a Passion
for one, who you have hopes to make unworthy your affection, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
hers on you? No Sir, I beseech you let me follow my resolution,
which is, to dye <hi>Perolla</hi>'s, since I could not live his; for my heart (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
such a loss) is not capable of any passion, but grief; or if it be, that
passion I had for his Virtues, I must now continue to his memory. To
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> answer'd, Will you then confer a Blessing upon one
which is not capable of it, to deny it to another, who is, and perhaps
deserves it too? Ah Madam, if it is your affection for <hi>Perilla,</hi> and not
your hatred for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which produces this resolve, you will evince
that truth sooner by granting, than declining my request; for if in the
other life we are not ignorant of what is done in this, <hi>Perolla</hi> will be
more satisfy'd to know by your giving your self now to me, that he only

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96335:87"/>
since that may appear rather an effect of your aversion for me, than your
respect to him. I am, Sir, (I reply'd) of a contrary opinion, for my
passion and my resentments for his loss will be much more legible in
their taking from me the ambition of being the object of so great a
Conqueror's Love, and in abandoning, not only the pleasures of life,
but the desire of it too. I conjure you therefore by the quiet of <hi>Perolla,</hi>
which you endeavour to distu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

which if you persevere in, 'twill induce me rather to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the respect I pay you, than to create that affection you solicite,
and for me to believe that <hi>Hannibal</hi> (and not the god's) have taken
away his Rival. It may be (continu'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) you will believe so great
a Prince merited a proportionate respect, but I must acknowledge, that
I was not in an humour to afford it him, neither do I believe I could
give him a worse opinion of me, by my replies, than he seem'd to have
of me by his desires; but after by his looks he had exprest what his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
would be, he told me, You think, Madam, to silence my passion
with reproaches, to avoid ingratitude by becoming unjust, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
my innocency to decline being a debtor to my Flame; but know,
that your cruelty may induce me to revenge what I cannot obtain; and
though you have avoided any impressions of my Love, some that you
are concern'd in, may not those of my resentments. Tyrant (I reply'd)
while <hi>Perolla</hi> was alive, I consider'd thy threatenings because I fear'd
them, but now the subject of my apprehensions is remov'd, I desire
them; for in becoming my Executioner, thou wilt be more kind, than in
continuing my Lover. Oh gods! (<hi>Hannibal</hi> cry'd out, interrupting me)
Why do you give me so much Choller, and so much Love together?
and why did you not give me a heart capable of enduring injuries,
when you give me a Mistriss apt to confer them on me: then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
flinging himself on his knees by my Bed-side (for my weakness
made me unable to receive his visits in another condition) he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd,
Madam, though my rage hath made me sin, by menacing in a place
where I should only adore, yet do not so much mis-interpret my crime,
as to think my threatenings had you for their object; You, I say, for
whose safety had I as many Lives, as you have Beauties, I would sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
them all, rather than employ one minute of them to a contrary
thought: No, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> if my resentments at your cruelty, forc'd my
Passion to what my Reason condemns, believe me, 'twas only against <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
who for his injuries to you, as well as Relations, appear'd in my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the fittest object for it. Alas, Sir (I reply'd, interrupting him) you
are more cruel in your interpretation, than in your threatenings, and are
more injurious in having those designs against my Father, then if against
me: for if they were onely intended against <hi>Izadora,</hi> if my grief deceive
me not, 'twill be so charitable, as to exempt me from them, or if it does
not, your resentments will prove an obligation, (for I consider every
thing at that rate, which hastens my union with <hi>Perolla</hi>) but if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my sorrow for my loss, nor your fury for your furitless passion, will
prove my cure, know that I will act it my self, and to punish my cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and reward my flame for his Rival, I will untye my
Soul from that Cley which invirons it, and thereby also secure <hi>Blacius</hi>
against your revenge, by rendring the acting it an injustice. Thereupon
turning from him, I fell so bitterly a weeping, that though <hi>Hannibal</hi>
made me a long answer to what I spoke, yet I did not so much as listen
to him, being wholly intent in summoning all those thoughts which I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96335:88"/>
would soonest make me perform, what I told the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed:
and indeed those sad resentments finding a body extreamly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
and a mind as apt to receive their impressions, were in one day
so kind, as to give me the hopes of not living another; neither was
this only my conjecture, but the positive opinion of my Fathers Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
who in a trembling haste, acquainted <hi>Hannibal</hi> with it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
him since by so evidencing a demonstration, it was impossible to
separate us, that he would contribute to what he law he could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>I will not tell you all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> disputes with himself, which
could not on so plentiful a subject but be excellent, let it be sufficient
you learn, that though the cause which was to create his pity, might
as justly his revenge (I mean, the sad extremity my Passion for his Rival,
had reduced me to) yet he got the victory over the latter, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
told the Doctor: Come, let us shew <hi>Lzadora</hi> her <hi>Perolla,</hi> for I had
rather lose my hopes, than the object of them; but if this fresh experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Passion, create none in her, it may reduce me to act what I
have but hitherto counterfeited. Thereupon, immediately he sent the
Captain of the Guards for <hi>Perolla</hi> (who had till then, been kept in the
Dungeon of a little Castle, some two miles from <hi>Salapia</hi>) who was no
sooner come (though it was very late) but the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> (who had
access into <hi>Blacius</hi>'s house at his pleasure) came with him into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where all those that watcht with me, were weeping a death, which
according to their belief and my desire, was not many hours distant:
But all of them no sooner saw my generous friend, whose Funerals had
been solemnized above a quarter of a year before, than with horrid skreeks
they fled out of the room. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not displeased at their absence;
and <hi>Perolla</hi> (who till then, thought he was drawn out of a Prison to end
his life) began now to fear a more transcend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt misfortune, for being
ignorant of his own death, the sad posture he found my Women in, and
those strange extravagancies of theirs, made him attribute the first to my
death, and the last to their charity, for that horror they knew would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
him, as his seeing me dead; which absolutely he was confirmed in,
by my not (at so great a clamour) looking out to discover or enquire
the cause of it; and he further believed, that his Tyrant had only brought
him thither, to shew him so melancholly a Spectacle, as a Revenge for
being his Rival both in Love and Glory. But then on the other side, he
could hardly believe the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> durst shew him so inraging an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and trust him unty'd to act his resentments. Whilst the poor <hi>Perolla</hi>
was in this labyrinth, he was led out of it by <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s opening my Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a little, and telling me; See Madam, my power, and my infelicity,
that can perform miracles for others, and not for my self, that can raise
the dead to bring you to life, and perhaps my self to death, that can do
all things indeed, but what I most desire. Here fair <hi>Izadora</hi> (he continued)
drawing <hi>Perolla</hi> towards me, dry up your Tears, which else may hinder
you from seeing your happiness, and remember, he which to save your
life, has run so hazardous a course to his own, merits (at least) that you
never give your self to another, if you will not bestow your self on him.
These strange words, and the as strange noise which somewhat preceded
them, made me turn about to understand their meaning; but O gods!
what was my surprize when I saw <hi>Perolla</hi> in this world, who I was, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such haste to find out in the other? truly 'twas so transcendent, that
I fell into a deep swound, and thereby those powers, which have ever
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96335:88"/>
took delight to afflict me, continued that practise, for whilst I believed
<hi>Perolla</hi> dead, they kept me alive, and now they shewed him me alive,
they flung me into a seeming death, which too had like to have caused a
real one in my generous friend? <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose concern for me was not
so great as his, permitted his care to be greater, who ran out to call my
Women to my assistance, and to whom he was constrained to make many
oaths, that it was really <hi>Perolla,</hi> and not his Ghost, before he could
perswade them to come in to me; but <hi>Callione,</hi> the chiefest of them, bo h
in her extraction, and my esteem, knew so well the interest I had in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla,</hi> that whilst others took up their employment about me, she made
him the object of hers; and was so unhappily successful in it, that she
brought him out of his fainting, before I was recovered of mine, which
raised in him so high despair, that had not all those which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
assured him, my disease and his were of the same quality, and that
only mine, meeting with a Body disabled by a deep sickness, was the
cause of its longer continuance, I believe he would have acted some such
violence on himself, as had made my recovery my highest misfortune;
but at length, about an hour after, by the help of strong Cordials, my
swounding abandoned me, and I no sooner opened my Eyes, than the
first objects they saw, were <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Perolla,</hi> who were both kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by my bed-side, but the joy of beholding the latter, made me nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consider nor care how much the expressions of it would offend the
form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>; to confirm this truth, I told the other: Are the Gods then so
just (<hi>Perolla</hi>) as to reward by this sight, the fidelity of my Eyes, which
abhorr'd all objects but you, and which having lost you, have endeavour'd
to weep themselves out as useless things? or else is it an illusion and a
mockery of Fate, by making me, (in resenting the joy of your Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
the more exactly sensible of your real death? Tell me, I conjure
you, which of them 'tis? for if it be the latter, I will deceive her cruelty,
and convert what she intends for one, into a summons to follow you, which
I thank the gods, my weakness (for you supposed a real Death) makes
me as able, as my passion willing to perform.</p>
                  <p>Madam (he reply'd, kissing my hands) I am really alive, but 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your joy at it, which makes me esteem my being so a happiness; for
how can I consider the persecutions I have rais'd you, in being alive, and
those afflictions I have cast you into, in not being thought so by you, but
I must be struck with a grief as great as my flame, and perpetually deplore
an experiment which convinces me, that both my Life and my Death must
be a trouble to you. All this I heard <hi>Perolla</hi> speak, yet I was so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
at his first words, which were an assurance of what I only desired,
that not answering his last, I raised my self up the best I could, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him that spoke them, I did that which on any other occasion, and
in that posture, I should not have perform'd; but the subject of my sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
was so legitimate, that I could not suppress any extravagancy it
produced. It is true, Madam (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> interupting his fair Mistriss)
your joy was obliging to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as well as to me, for in your acting
(as he aftewards confest to <hi>Cristes</hi>) he discovered Beauties which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
sufficiently payd his Charity in preserving your life. <hi>Izadora</hi> at
these words, was all covered with blushes, and her servant perceiving it,
(to repair her disorder) told her; But Madam, as it was but just that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
should receive a reward for his cure, so it was as just, his Eyes
should receive the punishment of their presumption, which were both
perform'd; for as their seeing those perfections, effected the former, so
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96335:89"/>
his seeing the little share he had in them, did the latter. <hi>Izadora</hi> (said
<hi>Simander</hi>) was so confus'd in the remembrance of these particulars, that
without taking notice of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s words, she made haste to pass over the
subject of them, by thus re-assuming her relation. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was so inrag'd,
that in my joy I had forgot my gratitude to him, which furnisht me with
the cause of it, that rising up he told me; Is then all the reward (Madam)
you give my Love, but a demonstration that you have given all yours
to my Rival, and is your flame so great, that you cannot conceal it, when
the disclosure is both unwise and ungrateful? Ah <hi>Izadora!</hi> how much
do you rely on the power you have over me, when you care to offend
mine, by so sensible a provocation? These words drew me from that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
my excess of joy had ingag'd me in, and finding the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
was as just in his reproaches, as I esteem'd I was in what caus'd them,
I thought fit to tell him: You do place (Sir) a wrong construction on
my actions, since that which you term my ingratitude, is rather an effect
of my confidence in your Virtue; for did I think you a Tyrant, I would
not add a Provocation to the Power of your Revenge, but knowing
you to be just, I dare even in your presence, manifest a flame, whose vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
renders me confident, rather of your protection, than resentments.
Ah Madam, (said <hi>Hannibal</hi>) why do you make me just, to make me mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?
and if what I have seen you act, be in reliance on my Virtue,
I beseech you ascribe none unto me, for mine will then be my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and make me rather implore the Gods, to take from me that little I
possess, than to let it thus torment me. We were in discourses of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
when <hi>Blacius</hi> being inform'd of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s visit (and of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>'s
Resurrection) came into my Chamber, where in terms as sharp as
the remembrance of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>'s power permitted him to use, he
murmur'd at his bringing his mortal Enemy into his House, and restoring
his Daughter to a certainty of his being alive: And though <hi>Hannibal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
that that was the only way to continue me so; yet my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
never lessen'd his repining, but added, that since I was of so degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a disposition, he had rather have lost than preserv'd me at so high a
rate. Then he besought <hi>Hannibal</hi> to permit him to make use of his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and domestick power over his Daughter, and in his own House;
which the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> granted, that we might be separated, and yet not
derive that misfortune from him; but though it was not immediately his
act, yet it was an effect of his permission, which I so resented, that seeing
my Father going to send out <hi>Perolla,</hi> with somewhat a less civility than I
expected, I made haste to tell him; Since, generous <hi>Perolla,</hi> I know not
whether we shall ever meet again, I esteem it fit to give you an assurance
before such memorable witnesses, that the gods shall be mine, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be any's but yours, that nothing but death shall dissolve this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and if yours happen before mine, I will, by the help of my grief, or
my resolution, immediately follow you. <hi>Perolla</hi> at this profession, turn'd
about (though <hi>Blacius</hi> was leading him forth) and told me, And I Madam,
do beseech the same god's, if ever I cherish my life, but for your sake, if
ever I decline my passion, or if ever I survive your loss a minute, after I
know it, to make me the object of their fury, and to throw on me as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miseries, as they have bestowed perfections on the fair <hi>Izadora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This profession I made him, as well to reward his flame, asto take from
<hi>Blacius</hi> all the hopes of changing mine, as also to punish <hi>Hannibal</hi> for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my Father a power which he denyed him in all things but to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
me; and truly the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> was in such a rage at this just and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96335:89"/>
mutual ingagement, that he commanded some of his Guards (which wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the door) to take <hi>Perolla</hi> and keep him as their lives, till his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
were known. Then coming to my Bed-side, he told me; I see, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that you trample on the goodness of my disposition, and that you
believe, because I have not, that I dare not revenge my self on my Rival;
but know, if you persevere in that belief, I will convince you of the
contrary, by so bloudy an experiment, that you will find I am capable
of as high a proportion of Revenge, as Love; and that by not reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the latter, you will necessitate me to act the former. He had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
done speaking, than without staying for a reply, he left me, and at
<hi>Oristes</hi> importunate intreaties, he commited <hi>Perolla</hi> to his charge, with
horrid vows, that he should answer for him with his life; To which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the Traitor condescended; and having received his Charge, he
brought him to his House, lodged him in a Chamber with grated Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and placed at the coming in to it, a strong Guard of <hi>Affricans,</hi> which
<hi>Hannibal</hi> furnisht him with, who, every day visited me, and as his
discourse, so his reception was; sometimes returning with hopes, for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <hi>Perolla</hi> was in his power; sometimes without any, lest he might
think him his only obstacle, and so remove him. But I omitted to tell you,
that the certainty of my generous Friends being alive, made me court as
much my recovery, as formerly I had my death; and with my health, my
little (and unfortunate) beauty being returned, it increast so much the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> fire, that under the pretence of the greatness of it, one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he became so indiscreet, that I was not capable any longer to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but gave him so just and sharp a reprehension, that in the fury it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
upon his return to his own house, he sent for <hi>Oristes,</hi> and led him
into his own Bed-chamber, where having shut the door, he acquainted
that Traitor, that he was able no longer to contain his resentments, and
that he could not bear two such powerful Passions, as Revenge, and Love.
The false <hi>Oristes,</hi> readily laid hold of the motion, and to satisfy his own
revenge on <hi>Perolla,</hi> (whom he highly apprehended) so husbanded <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s
fury, that he inclined him at last, really to make away his Rival,
concluding, that his respect had been too long his torment, that it was but
just to take away so considerable an Enemy, both to him and to <hi>Carthage,</hi>
and that if he could not thereby obtain his desires, yet he should his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
This Resolve being assumed, <hi>Oristes,</hi> as he had procured <hi>Perol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s
death, so he offered himself to act it, and propounded for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
to give him a lingering poyson, which should be so slow in
operation, that the world should rather believe he dyed by his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
than by <hi>Hannibals</hi> resentments. This the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> having
approved, he and <hi>Oristes</hi> separated themselves, the former to make some
publick dispatches, and the latter with a design instantly to execute the
result of that meeting. But the gods which detested so dark a sin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it by a way as strange, as was the intended design it self; for the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<hi>Maharbal,</hi> General of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse, who all the preceding
night, had been putting things in a posture for the Armies march, came
to <hi>Hannibals</hi> house, the self-same evening and time in which he was visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, where learning, that his General was in an employment, which
commonly was of no small continuance, and being somewhat sleepy, flung
himself upon <hi>Hannibals</hi> Bed, which was not strange, because of that great
familiarity that was always betwixt them, where he slept till the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
and <hi>Oristes</hi> coming in, did wake him, and before that he had time
to rise, they had lock'd the door, and began this horrid consultation.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96335:90"/>
                     <hi>Maharbal,</hi> whose <hi>Genius</hi> was only inclined to War, detested the contrary
humour in his General, which by experiment he found, had been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
so destructive to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Common-wealth; This made him
listen attentively, in hope to discover some of those contrivances which
<hi>Hannibal</hi> kept so private, and which by his knowledge of them, might
furnish him with a means to wean him from a passion he so much underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
and detested; but at length hearing so black a Resolve, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to prevent what he condemned, but did not think the best way
to effect it, was to discover what he knew, which he believed, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make his General ashamed, than penitent; therefore, as soon as he
and <hi>Oristes</hi> were gone, he himself retired to his own house, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how soon that Traitor would execute his resolution, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called for one of his own Liveries, which being brought him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
enjoyn'd the bringer of it an inviolable secrecy, he went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(as his custom was) to visit <hi>Perolla,</hi> being attended by twenty of his
Domesticks all in one Livery, (as is the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> fashion,) where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Perolla</hi> alone, he generously acquainted him with his danger, and
presenting him with his Livery, advis'd him to put it on, and at his going
out, to shuffle himself amongst his Servants, which none of the Guards
durst examine, or would suspect.</p>
                  <p>For this transcendent favour <hi>Perolla</hi> made him as many returns, as his
gratitude could inspire him withal, and the time permit; and indeed he
was so eloquent in his retributions, that not only <hi>Maharbal</hi> ingag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to acquaint me with his escape, but also to make <hi>Oristes</hi> receive from
<hi>Hannibal</hi> himself, the punishment of his Treachery and Wickedness, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
therefore, (as soon as <hi>Perolla</hi> was drest) <hi>Maharbal</hi> (whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
attended him at the door) went out of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Chamber, and
amongst the rest, was lighted down by him, who no sooner got out of
<hi>Oristes</hi> house (who all this while was at a Physitians, preparing his fatal
poyson) then with the help of the word <hi>Maharbal</hi> gave him, he got too
out of the <hi>Samnite</hi> Gate; and his generous deliverer, not only by a visit
next day, assur'd me of his escape, but also so incens'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> against
<hi>Oristes</hi> at it, (whose jealousie of his connivance at his flight, he so increas'd,
by putting him in mind of his pressing importunities, to have him his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner)
that in the heighth of that rage, he gave order to put <hi>Oristes</hi> to
death, which he knowing was both unavoidable and just, as being an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that contract which had past betwixt <hi>Hannibal</hi> and him, when
<hi>Perolla</hi> was committed to his charge, to disburden his Conscience, he sent
me privately in writing, a large relation of all those particulars which I was ignorant of, and then receiv'd the stroke of death in his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
by his Command, for whom he had so wickedly employ'd his life.
'Twas in this sort that <hi>Perolla</hi> 'scap'd a treachery, which fill'd him with
so legitimate and high a resentment against him, which had at least allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, that from that time he contracted an implacable aversion for him, and
resolv'd the first Battel the <hi>Romans</hi> fought, to tye himself so particularly
to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that nothing but his own death should prevent his Rivals.
In order to this determination, he went directly to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> from whose
active courage, he expected an earlier opportunity to put his resolution
in practice, than from <hi>Crispinus</hi> (his Colleague;) I need not tell you the
great satisfaction the gallant <hi>Marcellus</hi> receiv'd at <hi>Perolla</hi>'s arrival, you
may in some degree imagine it by his saying, he esteem'd his single cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and conduct, a greater re-inforcement to his Army, than the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the best <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, and he was confident, <hi>Hannibal</hi> valu'd
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96335:90"/>
it at no less a rate. After these Civilities, the Consul offer'd him any
preferment in his Army, and conjur'd him not to decline the Command
of General of his Horse, (which then was vacant by the death of <hi>Marcus Aulius,</hi>) but my generous friend, who was more ambitious of revenge
than preferment, and who suspected that Office would confine him to a
certain Duty, and thereby frustrate his design upon <hi>Hannibal,</hi> absolutely
declin'd <hi>Marcellus</hi> offer, by assuring him, that he had better proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
his ambition to his desert, and consequently desir'd no greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
than to serve under him as a Volunteer. The Consul was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
griev'd at this refusal, for he would gladly have bound to him a person
he justly admir'd; but yet he us'd <hi>Perolla</hi> with the same respect, as if he
had taken so considerable an employment; for in all attempts, and in all
counsels, he would do nothing without his advice and assistance, and if
in things of action he was abundantly satisfied with his Courage, in those
of Counsel he was no less with his Judgement. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> (whose
rage at <hi>Perolla</hi>'s escape is fitter for imagination than description) hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had retir'd himself to <hi>Marcellus</hi> Army, immediately put his
into a posture to attempt the ruine of his publique and particular Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but before he quitted <hi>Salapia,</hi> he came to visit me, and perceiving
my joy in my face, it inflam'd his to such a degree, that for a good while
his choller was unlegible in any thing else; but at length he told me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I see with what satisfaction you consider my trouble, and that my
misery is the subject of your contentment, but I hope my patience at it,
will instruct yours, or at least induce you not to condemn in another,
what you practise your self; For know, I am going to sacrifice a person
which my Respect and your Tears hinder'd me hitherto from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and which by his flight you think has escap'd for ever; but you shall
find, if my ambition only inspir'd me with a resolution that has near sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; my Revenge and my Passion will give me
strength enough to destroy a Subject of it, which being perform'd, I
will enjoy you legitimately, or if your perverseness decline that honor,
I will satisfy my Flame by an easier, though not so pleasing a way; and
believe me, did not your coldness render my Revenge a greater Passion
than my Love, I would suspend the former to satisfy the latter; besides,
having taken you first from <hi>Perolla,</hi> to kill him, would rather appear an
obligation, than a punishment. These words deliver'd with an accent as
barbarous as themselves were, banish'd all my patience, and made me tell
him: Thou Monster (greater than thy Countrey <hi>Africk</hi> did ever yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce)
know, that the same gods which preserved <hi>Perolla</hi> from thy rage,
when thou hadst the power to act it, will do the like now thou hast only
the design: he never feared any thing of thee but thy Treachery, and
if thou makest use but of thy own Arm to perform thy revenge, thou
wilt sooner furnish him with the means to effect his, than create my fear
of thine. For my particular be assured, that I will cast my self into the
Arms of death, far rather than into <hi>Hannibals;</hi> that I have as great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
for being thy Wife, as thou hast for Virtue, and that the same
minute in which thou attempst my chastity, if nothing else will preserve
me, I will free my self from life, to do the like from thee.</p>
                  <p>You shall see (the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> replyed) that 'tis easier for <hi>Hannibal</hi> to
act than to threaten, and at his return he will make you know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Passion, by his resentments for your neglecting it. He left me,
(saying these words) and the same day <hi>Salapia,</hi> but in it, a select Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Lybians,</hi> rather to keep me than it. Their Commander was one of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96335:91"/>
his trustiest Captains, who he inviolably protested, should answer for me
in torments and death. This Tyrant was no sooner on his march, than
some of my Servants having informed <hi>Blacius</hi> I was fallen into such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
weepings, that unless they were stopt, they might extinguish my
life; his goodness for a while suppressing his aversion, he came to visit me,
and being acquainted with those threatenings the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had made
against my chastity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he only told me, that he would prevent or not see
my wrongs. I knew not what interpretation to give that profession, till
not long after, I heard one night a horrid noise in all the streets, and
the next morning saw them paved with the dead Carkasses of <hi>Hannibals</hi>
Garrison; my Father then coming again to see me, all hideous with Bloud,
assured me, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> now might threaten, but had not the power to
act his impiety, and that he expected, since for my preservation he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
so great a hazard, that my duty would be resembling his care.
I too well knew those words related to my passion for <hi>Perolla,</hi> which
since the impossibility of declining, was as great as the injustice; I
thought, that as my silence was the best way of expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing my resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for his affection, so it was the civilest of assuring him of my legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
obedience: I know not whether he imputed it to my respect, or my
wilfulness, for he went away without speaking one word, which might
be as pertinently attributed to his satisfaction, as his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ger. Four days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Senate sent a solemn Embassy to him, to congratulate his success,
and to furnish him with a Garrison to secure it. Though this soon came
to <hi>Hannibals</hi> knowledge, yet he was necessitated by the <hi>Pretor Cneius
Fulvius,</hi> besieging the City <hi>Herdonea,</hi> to suspend a while his design upon
<hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Perolla;</hi> but to appease so many <hi>Lybian</hi> Ghosts as were lost
in <hi>Salapia;</hi> and perhaps, the loss of <hi>Izadora</hi> had some share in that fury,
he offered the unfortunate <hi>Pretor</hi> Battel, whose courage being greater
than his judgement, accepted it, and by that fault, was rendred uncapable
of ever committing any other, being killed by Twelve of his Tribunes,
and the most of his Army. That unhappy Plain near <hi>Herdon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a,</hi> proved
an unfortunate Theatre for the <hi>Fluvius</hi>'s, two of them in one year, both
<hi>Pretors,</hi> and both Generals, received the same fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the same place, by
the <hi>Carthaginian;</hi> who raised by this accession of Glory, march'd directly
to <hi>Venusia,</hi> where <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Crispinus</hi> were joyned, the better to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their common Enemy. But because I have not undertaken <hi>Hannibal's</hi>
but <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Story, I will pass over all those memorable accidents which
happened that active Summer, by telling you that <hi>Hannibal</hi> knowing <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drabal</hi>
his Brother (as well in Glory as in Bloud) had crost <hi>France,</hi> and
was coming to him with neer 100000 men, as a Torrent to throw down
all opposition, declined a Battel, though often provok'd to it by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
who being not ignorant of the danger of two such Men and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
joyning, thought himself always too far from his Enemy, if not fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, resolved to remove his Camp to a Hill covered with Wood,
which lay betwixt his and <hi>Hannibals,</hi> and not suspecting his Fate, took
<hi>Crispinus</hi> (his fellow Consul) with him, 200 <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Horse, for their
Guard, and went to view the commodiousness of the place, where (alas)
there lay in ambush above 1500 <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse, who invironing those
unfortunate Generals, charged them with so much fury, that all those
false or timerous <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> fled, and left the two Consuls no hope, but
by a glorious death, to justify how unworthy they were of so private a
one, and that <hi>Rome</hi> without losing a Battel, might resent as high a grief,
as such a loss could inspire. <hi>Perolla</hi> (as the gods would have it) had been
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96335:91"/>
that night upon a Party, and was not returned when the Consuls went
to perform so fatal a curiosity; but he was no sooner come into his Tent,
than the Alarm of their danger was given by a timerous <hi>Hetrurean,</hi> which
<hi>Perolla</hi> understanding, took the first horse he met with, and ran full speed
to the Theatre, where this Tragedy was acting, and where the first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
he saw was a <hi>Numidian</hi> Officer, that coming behind <hi>Marcellus,</hi> ran that
great Man through with his Launce; but though my generous friend
could not prevent, yet he reveng'd his Death, and by a furious blow sent
that <hi>Affrican</hi> into the other world, to see how great his Virtues were, whom
he had so treacherously kill'd in this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perolla</hi> having thus sacrific'd his Generals Murtherer to his <hi>Manes,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued
first the young <hi>Marcellus</hi> (his Son) and then perceiving that <hi>Cris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus</hi> was pierc'd with two Darts, and thereby render'd uncapable any
longer to defend himself, he abandon'd his own Horse, and vaulting up
behind the Consuls, upheld his tottering Body with one Arm, and with
the other forc'd his passage through a hundred <hi>Numidian</hi> Swords, and
brought him into the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, where their fears had so far clouded
their judgements, that they only remembred, but did not relieve their
Consuls danger: Never <hi>Rome</hi> had at once a resembling misfortune, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was that Empire in worse condition to sustain it; and though <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
was more satisfied at <hi>Marcellus</hi> death, than he could have been at the
cutting in pieces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army without it, yet he was so generous
as to be content with the joy, without giving any open demonstration
of it: For he first wept the fall of so eminent a person, then in a military
pomp burnt his Body, and having put the Ashes in a Silver Urn, and on
it a Crown of Gold, he sent it in great state, with a condoling Letter, to the
young <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and executed some <hi>Numidians</hi> for offering (by the way)
to rob <hi>Marcellus</hi> Reliques of a Crown, which his noble Life, and valiant
Death so justly merited. <hi>Spartacus</hi> was extreamly satisfied to observe that
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s resentments did not silence her justice, and that though she
were an Enemy to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> yet that she was not so to his Fame and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But (she continu'd) though <hi>Crispinus</hi> was mortally wounded, yet
his care for the publique was as great, as if he had been to live and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the effects of it. As an evincement of this Truth, he sent certain
Spies into the <hi>Affrican</hi> Camp, to learn what advantage the Enemy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to himself by his success: these perform'd their employment so
happily, that they brought the Consul word, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> having an
unextinguishable desire to be reveng'd on the <hi>Salapians,</hi> and having too,
by the possession of <hi>Marcellus</hi> Seal, which with his body remain'd in the
Victors power, found an expedient to effect it. He had sent false Letters
with the true Signet to <hi>Blacius,</hi> in the dead Consuls name, to let him
know, that that night he would come to <hi>Salapia,</hi> and commanded all the
Garrison to be in Arms without the <hi>Samnite</hi> Gate, for some exploit he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to employ them in. <hi>Crispinus</hi> no sooner receiv'd this intelligence,
than he sent for <hi>Perolla</hi> to communicate it to him, and knowing those
concerns he had for the preservation of this place, gave him Commission
to command the Garrison, till <hi>Hannibal</hi> had lost the hopes of taking it.
<hi>Perolla</hi> declin'd it, because <hi>Blacius</hi> was Governor, but the Consul told him,
that it was not to intrench on my Fathers authority, but to strengthen
him in it; for he was confident, <hi>Hannibals</hi> assault would be so vigorous,
that <hi>Blacius</hi> could not but think so powerful an assistant, a blessing rather
than an affront, and that he was no true friend to <hi>Rome,</hi> if for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
suspension of his power, he hazarded so important a place. <hi>Perolla</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:96335:92"/>
finding <hi>Crispinus</hi> was unalterable, took Horse, and with that speed which
Love and Revenge inspires, came to <hi>Salapia,</hi> where he soon found the
truth of the Consuls intelligence, and that all the Garrison were drawing
out of the <hi>Samnite</hi> Gate, which was the opposite one to that which <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
intended to enter at, and though by his authority he might have
hinder'd the Soldiers march, yet he bore so great a respect to <hi>Blacius,</hi>
that he declin'd it, and rather elected to hazard the ruine of <hi>Salapia,</hi> by not
stopping them, than prevent it by intrenching on the seeming right my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had, who (he was inform'd) was at his own house, where he lighted,
and coming in, found him with some of his intimate friends (and his
unfortunate Daughter) discoursing what might be the subject of <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
design. But O gods! what was my astonishment at the sight of <hi>Perolla?</hi>
truly it was so transcending, that I observ'd neither <hi>Blacius</hi>'s nor his, but
the latter being a little supprest, he addrest himself to my Father, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with the fatal news, the cause of his coming, and then presented
him his Commission, which whilst <hi>Blacius</hi> was viewing, <hi>Perolla</hi> and I were
doing the like to each other, for we durst not express our thoughts, but
by our Eyes; yet that silent language was as significant and legible, as
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s Commission, which <hi>Blacius</hi> had no sooner read, than he whose it
was, told him, Sir, the Consul shall bear me witness, that I declin'd this
Authority when 'twas offer'd me, and all <hi>Salapia</hi> shall do the like, now I
have receiv'd it; and if I expect to derive any advantage from it, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to shew you, that I esteem it a greater justice to obey than command
you; thereupon, without staying for <hi>Blacius</hi>'s answer, in all our
sights he tore his Commission in pieces. I cannot tell you how great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
this generosity had on all of us: But my Father (who a good
while ballanc'd betwixt his natural aversion, and present cause for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it) told <hi>Perolla,</hi> your generosity is not only greater than I could
expect, but than I could desire from an Enemy, and you had more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me, in using your Authority, than in thus declining it; but though
you esteem it just, that I should command in my own Government, yet
since the Consul does not, I am rather inclined to conform my self to his
opinion than yours.</p>
                  <p>Alas Sir (<hi>Perolla</hi> reply'd) must I be still so miserable, as to bear a Name
which I have no title to? and which I detest; and will you attribute that to
your place, which I pay to you? No no, Sir, all the World shall be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapia</hi>
to me, and the Senate cannot give you so absolute a power over me,
as my inclination does. You are more civil to me, (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) than the
Consul is, and I think 'tis my Fate to be obliged, where I desire it not,
and to be injured where I expect the contrary; but since you are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to Command in Chief, I will imitate your example; let us
therefore divide our selves and the Garrison, and each of us take his half
of <hi>Salapia</hi> to defend. I had rather (<hi>Perolla</hi> reply'd) be near your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that you might see with how little fear (to preserve your life) I
will expose mine own, which I take the gods to witness, is not dearer to
me upon any score, than out of a belief that it may be serviceable to
you. To convince you (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) that the tearing of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
has not taken away its power, you shall (as an effect of it) chuse
where, and how you will fight; but if my honor were not now engaged
to defend this place, the <hi>Romans</hi> should know, that the same instant in
which they thought me unfit to command <hi>Salapia,</hi> that I esteemed my self
so, to live in it. If the <hi>Romans,</hi> (answered <hi>Perolla</hi>) are so unjust to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and you, as to think you unworthy to govern, what you so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96335:92"/>
have conquered, I shall think them so of my service, and will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
your interest with so just a passion, that if the Senate send any to
usurp upon your Valour's Conquest, I will oppose every <hi>Roman,</hi> as if
he were an <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and either preserve you in your Command, or not
live to see you out of it. Come (said <hi>Blacius,</hi> without seeming to hear
this last civility) let us go, and make <hi>Hannibal</hi> know, that at <hi>Salapia</hi> he
shall have as little progress in glory, as in love. <hi>Blacius</hi> had no sooner said
these words, than he went away, and <hi>Perolla</hi> (who durst not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him) was necessitated to signify his discontent for not daring to
speak to me by a deep sigh, which was the language too I exprest mine
in; but as soon as my Father was informed, that all the Garrison was
without the <hi>Samnite</hi> Gate, and that though <hi>Perolla</hi> had met them, yet
he had so dangerously declined making use of his authority, he turned
about to a familiar friend of his, and told him softly; I fear <hi>Pacuvius</hi> Son
will force me to be an enemy to Virtue, if I prove any longer so to him.
I need not tell you all the preparatives that were made to receive <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who about an hour before day, came to the <hi>Brutian</hi> Gate, (which
was <hi>Blacius</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Post) where the Forlorn-Hope of his Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of six hundred Runnagate <hi>Romans,</hi> (the better to disguise the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
were admitted int the Gate, and some three hundred <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
Horse after them, who were all no sooner enter'd, than the Percullis was
let down, and my Father with <hi>Perolla,</hi> breaking out of those Houses and
Courts, they had lodg'd themselves in, gave the Enemy so brisk and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
a charge, that above half of them were cut in pieces, before the
residue could put themselves in a posture to dispute their own lives, or
revenge their companions deaths. I will not amuse my self to tell you
the particulars of this action, 'tis sufficient you know that <hi>Crastinus,</hi> who
commanded the revolted <hi>Romans,</hi> knew his crime was uncapable of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and therefore resolved to render his death famous enough, to excuse
the faults of his life: This made him conjure his Companions so generously
to dispute the business, as to make the <hi>Salapians</hi> never mention their
defeat, but in as many Tears, as if they themselves had dy'd what they
were born. This Traitor acted without his Companions what he desired
of them, by killing with his own hand, five of the most considerable <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapians,</hi>
and then by assaulting <hi>Blacius,</hi> where Fortune seconding <hi>Crasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
despair, he had certainly ended my Fathers life, had not <hi>Perolla</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it by putting a period to that Traitors; but yet <hi>Blacius</hi> received
so deep a wound, that fainting, he was carried by <hi>Perolla,</hi> and his other
friends, unto his own house, where, lest he might think the generous <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
would take any advantage of visiting me, (by his weakness) he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
withdrew him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf to the <hi>Brutian</hi> Gate, and there found the
Combat renewed by a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Commander, who performed exploits,
as far above belief, as description: This Enemy <hi>Perolla</hi> had the honour
singly to fight with, for most of the Garrison were searching those houses
where any of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Soldiers had taken Sanctuary, and others took
upon them the same employment, that it might be thought the following
execution (and not their fear) hinder'd their assaulting so valiant an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who by this time had so over-haras'd himself, that <hi>Perolla</hi> who had
more inclination to preserve, than destroy so admirable a valour, took
occasion (by hearing a division of Horse came trampling up the Street)
to offer him Quarter; for he thought his Enemy was too gallant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
his liberty to a single Sword, having still his own in his hand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it; neither was he deceived in his conjecture, for the other was so far
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96335:93"/>
from listening to a surrender, or being terrified at that Troop, which was
coming towards him, that he replyed; Whosoever thou art, that to give
me a good opinion of thy civility, assurest me, thou hast an ill one of my
courage; know, that I shall be more pleased to receive death, than safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from my Enemies; and have more cause to be joyed, than troubled
at this assistance which is near thee, for I would not have <hi>Maharbal</hi> curst
with so low a Fate as to fall by one Enemy, which the arrival of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
will I hope, prevent. Oh gods! (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> extreamly surpriz'd)
are you then the generous <hi>Maharbal?</hi> I am what I told thee (he reply'd)
but lest my being so ill-accompanied, might induce thee to suspect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or that by naming my self thou shouldst think I intend my preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I will by a generous death, hinder thee from justly assuming that
thought; but whilst those I elect for my Executioners are coming, let me
know (I be seech thee) who thou art that giv'st me so advantagious a Title?
Alas (Sir) said my generous friend, my Name is much fitter to be conceal'd
than known; it may wound you more than my Sword has done, and
perhaps I shall be less injurious in declining than obeying your Commands;
but yet, that you may learn 'twas my ignorance made my offence, and
that I persevere not willingly in the former, to continue the latter; know
I am called <hi>Perolla,</hi> that same <hi>Perolla,</hi> whom you so generously reveng'd
on the false <hi>Oristes,</hi> who would lose his life for you, as he ows it to you,
and who now thinks your preserving him a misfortune, since thereby he
has lift up his prophane Arm against his generous Deliverer; but that you
may see I am unfortunate, and not ungrateful, Here, Sir (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
him his Sword) this cannot make reparation for what it has acted,
but by becoming the Sword of Justice, and by spilling some criminal
Bloud, for having shed so much innocent. <hi>Mabarbal</hi> was as surpriz'd at
this Gallantry, as at the knowledge of him that performed it; and being
a Prince, as great in Virtue as in Title, and as loath to be vanquish'd in
civility, as fight, having passionately embrac'd <hi>Perolla,</hi> and as absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declin'd his Present, told him, If I had been kill'd as well as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by your Sword, and that you had known who 'twas you destroyed,
your injustice (yet) had been as great as your courage; For my attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to surprize a place for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> where your <hi>Izadora</hi> is, deserves that
Fate: But if you will credit to profession which my actions seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict,
I do protest before those gods which punish perjury, that when
I could not obtain <hi>Hannibals</hi> permission to decline this attempt, I
put my self at the head of our first Troops, that if we had been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
I might have conveyed your Mistriss from his passion, or revenge,
for both now seem so equally powerful, that 'tis difficult to know which
of them is the most. But it seems, the gods would have <hi>Izadora</hi> derive her
safety, only from him, from whom she does her felicity, and I attest those
Powers, that I am more pleased with our defeat, than I could have been
at our victory, and if I resent any trouble at it, it is to be found in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
wherein I must be wholly bound to your goodness, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
your Enemy as much as I am your Prisoner, which is a Fate I
willingly embrace, for I count it as little a dishonour to be vanquisht by
<hi>Perolla,</hi> as 'tis a great one, to be so by any other.</p>
                  <p>I should be (<hi>Perolla</hi> hastily replyed, because those Horse were so neer)
as much an Enemy to my contentment in believing you were so to me,
as to Virtue, did I accept of my Protector for my Prisoner; (No gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Maharbal</hi>) I assure you you are free, and if you will be pleased to take
off the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and put on <hi>Roman</hi> Colours, till I have disposed of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96335:93"/>
this Troop, you shall find I will turn my promises into action, and that
where I have any power, it shall be still employed to evidence a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which cannot be greater than what creates it. The <hi>Salapians</hi> were
by this so near, that <hi>Maharbal</hi> wanted time to answer this civility, and had
scarce pulled off his own Scarfe, and taken his friends, before they were
come up; <hi>Perolla</hi> immediately commanded them to follow him out of the
<hi>Brutian</hi> Gate, to discover whether any of the Enemy were yet about the
Walls, which they were no sooner out of, than he desired <hi>Maharbal</hi> in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
proportionate to the favour, to make use of that occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army. <hi>Maharbal</hi> embrac'd the opportunity and
him that gave it him, to whom he said, I am sorry (generous <hi>Perolla</hi>)
that I must receive an obligation from you, which I must not publish, but
be sure, though I am silent I am not ungrateful, and that I shall remember
what I dare not speak of, nor hope to requite. That (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) which
is the subject of your sorrow, is of my contentment, since it lets you see
I ambition no other glory in serving you, than that of doing so. 'Twas in
as many expressions of this quality, as the time would permit, that <hi>Mahar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
and <hi>Perolla</hi> took leave of one another, the first immediately over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army, which he discovered by the help of the day,
that then began to dawn, and the last seemed to have received satisfaction
in what he never doubted, returned into <hi>Salapia</hi> by the contrary Port,
to that through which he went out of it, and then not staying to dress
so much as some slight hurts, he received in the Combat, and from <hi>Mahar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
he came to visit <hi>Blacius,</hi> where having given him an exact account
of all things but his own gallantry against his Enemies; and to his friend he
desired to receive his Commands, if he had any to impose on him, for he
was determined immediately to return to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, lest a longer
stay might raise in him a suspition that he came for some other intent, than
the honor of his service. This fresh evincement of affection, wrought so
powerfully on a heart which was already ballancing, that it intirely dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
that aversion, which till then my Father had contracted for him;
and to publish a change, which he thought too just to be conceal'd, he
told <hi>Perolla;</hi> You have made your Virtue too well known, to let your
professions need a demonstration to prove their truth; No, generous
<hi>Perolla,</hi> I do acknowledge you have vanquisht me, and by such noble
Arms, that I am as well satisfied with my defeat, as you can be with your
victory; whose reward shall be <hi>Izadora,</hi> as soon as you get <hi>Pacuvius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to be hers; for whom I have upon your score, banisht all my hatred,
and whose friendship I will meet with open Arms: go then and perswade
him to confer it on me, but before your departure, let your <hi>Izadora</hi> know
of that conversion which her Tears, and your Virtue have produc'd.
Oh gods! who can tell those raptures this declaration cast <hi>Perolla</hi> into?
you may in some measure guess at their greatness, when so excellent a wit
found silence the best way of expressing them; but though his Tongue
was unimployed, yet he was not, for he flung himself upon his knees by
<hi>Blacius</hi> bed-side, kist, and washt his hands with Tears of joy, and by a
thousand such extravagancies, was more eloquent and grateful, than he
could possibly have been in words, which I beleeve you cannot doubt,
when I assure you that thereby he so moved my Father, that he answered
him in weepings of the same quality. I will not tell you those few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<hi>Perolla</hi> made after his first irregularities were ended, for they
were so dis-joynted, that had not my Father been perfectly acquainted
with his excellent Judgement, he might have believed he had oblig'd a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96335:94"/>
mad, and not a grateful man. At last the Physitians pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ceiving how ill
an influence his concernment and joy might have upon his distemper'd
Body, desir'd <hi>Perolla</hi> to take his leave, which he immediately did, and
to whom my Father again repeated his engaements, and having embrac'd
him, and kist his Cheek (a high mark of friendship amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>)
he commanded one of his Servants to conduct him to my Chamber:
when he was come to the door, he sent in, to know whether his visit
might not prove an offence? I must acknowledge I was infinitely surpriz'd
at this Message, and that which contributed most unto it, was, that he
which deliver'd it, was one of my Fathers exactest observers of my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but he perceiving my astonishment, and not willing any should
suppress it but <hi>Perolla,</hi> ask'd me (smiling) if I would permit him to come in.
This indeed, made me suspect his insolency (not his joy) was the cause
of it, and that he was employ'd by <hi>Blacius,</hi> to learn, whether during his
weakness I would admit of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s visits, and in this belief I was upon
the point of seeming to decline what I so passionately desir'd, and of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one dissimulation with another: but at last <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Messenger, who
fancied the subject of my disorder, told me, That since I was silent to his
proposal, he would take it for my yielding to it, and immediately brought
him in, who soon prostrated himself on his knees, and did nothing for a
time but embrace mine: this brought a great accession to my first astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which yet was rais'd higher by his saying, Madam, I shall hardly
any more exclaim against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> since he has now more oblig'd, than
ever injur'd me, for he has furnisht me with an occasion to conquer an
Enemy I much more apprehend than himself; yes Madam, <hi>Blacius</hi> has
been so generous as to consider my desires, as if they had been actions,
for the rewards he has given mine, are too disproportionate a return for
any thing else: I believe, Madam, you cannot doubt after this declaration,
but 'tis you I intend, a gift as far above my hopes, as merit. Thereupon
he acquainted me with all that my Father had promis'd him, and then
continu'd;) But, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> may I not fear the knowledge you have
of your self, and of <hi>Perolla,</hi> may induce you to condemn his injustice,
and my ambition, or that you created these hopes in me, only out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that it would never be in your power to convert them into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities?</p>
                  <p>No, no (said I, interrupting him) be not injurious to your self, to be
the like unto me, for I nere gave you expectations out of an opinion that
they would never change that name; for believe me, my Fathers consent
can only render legitimate, not increase my flame, which was uncapable
of addition since I knew you, and shall be of diminution while you are
of inconstancy. Ah Madam (he reply'd) why did not the gods, when
they destin'd me this felicity, furnish me with Vertue to deserve it? but
since my defects are but indearings of my joy, by making me derive my
contentment from your inclinations (a nobler cause than merit can be)
I will silence my Complaints, and fix all my endeavours to enthrone my
self in a condition of being uncapable of any desires, by being so of any
wants; Yes Madam, I will use such means to <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> that he shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
his Honor and my Happiness, or if he does, the same minute in which
heprives me of my hope, I will him of his Son: for my condition admits
of nothing but extreams, and I am destin'd (since you have permitted it
to my ambition) by possessing <hi>Izadora</hi> to relish no misery, or by death,
to feel none. If (said I) this be your resolve, I shall think your obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Blacius</hi> consent a misfortune, since thereby he has put in your Fathers
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96335:94"/>
power that hates, to ruine you: Ah <hi>Perolla,</hi> you shall not leave me with
such cruel and irrational intentions: <hi>Pacuvius</hi> by denying your content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will declare himself your Enemy, so that your destroying one which
bears that Title, is rather to please, than to be revenged on him: Will you
punish <hi>Izadora</hi> for your Fathers Crime? and will you make me miserable,
because he makes himself unjust? No <hi>Perolla,</hi> rather live, and shew him
by an undisturb'd serenity, thatsince he has divested himself of the nature
of a Father, you have suspended the relations of a Son, and till he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
the former, that you can la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> aside the latter; for the gods expect
not we should pay obedience to the name of a Father, where he banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the relation and care of one, and from a preserver, becomes a destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his Son. I conjure you therefore, before our separation, promise me
inviolably, that whatsoever <hi>Pacuvius</hi> usage be, you dispose not without
my consent, of a life which cannot cease, but by <hi>Izadora</hi>'s bearing it
company, to whom you have a thousand times given it, and from whom
you cannot take it, without an equal injustice to the highest that your
Father is capable of; besides, I believe, that <hi>Blacius</hi> (who now looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Virtues and Actions, with an unprejudicate opinion) will give
that to them singly, which yet he seems to desire, might be accompanied
with <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s consent. Madam (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) if the apprehensions of
his cruelty, made me pretend to any right over a Life which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you, and of which I again confirm the gift, I do acknowledge it
an usurpation, which you rather reward than punish, when you declare
'tis yours, and that you have so transcendent a care of it: yes, fair <hi>Izadora,</hi>
I will obey your Commands with as much willingness as justice, and beg
you to believe, that whilst my life is dear unto you, it shall be so to me,
and that I will never undertake to dispose of it, as long as it bears the
glorious Title of yours. I know (continu'd <hi>Izadora</hi>) that had not <hi>Perolla</hi>'s
nature been of an admirable temper, my Fathers former proceedings might
have rais'd some jealousies in him, that what he would have had taken
for an effect of his Gratitude, was one of his Malice, and that turning
him over to <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s consent, here mov'd his hopes to as great a distance
as ever, and did it too to make <hi>Perolla</hi> contract a higher hatred for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by declining what his very Enemy seem'd to confer upon him; but
his generosity was so perfect, that he has often protested those imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were as little on his Heart as his Tongue. To hasten to a conclusion,
that morning, after I had inform'd <hi>Perolla</hi> of all things which had arriv'd
me since our separation, and of those barbarous threatenings <hi>Hannibal</hi>
made against my Honor (which inflam'd him with an unextinguishable
revenge) he left me, and having again kist my Fathers hands, he return'd
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, in expectation to obtain from the Consul a Pardon
for <hi>Pacuvius</hi> revolt, and an Order to enjoy his Estate in <hi>Salapia</hi> and <hi>Capua,</hi>
which might give his generous Son a safe, opportunity to implore his
consent. For he being then at <hi>Tarentum</hi> (a Garrison of the Enemies)
he durst not trust himself to <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s and his Fathers resentments, but
at his coming to <hi>Crispinus,</hi> he found him on the point of yielding up the
Ghost, which he did some few hours after, having first writ to the Senate
an ample and just Letter in his praise, which did no little contribute to
the immediate chusing of <hi>Clodius Nero,</hi> Consul, who had married <hi>Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>'s Sister, the other Consul was <hi>Marcus Livius,</hi> whom the People had
formerly banisht, and whose Service they now implor'd, (a Fate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to ungrateful States and Princes,) who not learning Gratitude
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96335:95"/>
rom Virtue, must be taught it from Necessity. The first thing which
<hi>Nero</hi> perform'd was an unfortunate justice to <hi>Porolla</hi>'s Gallantry, which
has been the source of our second Miseries; for he so truly and so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extoll'd the whole <hi>series</hi> of his Nephews actions, and particularly that
last, of preserving <hi>Salapia,</hi> (which came to his knowledge by Fame, and
not by the Actor) that he procur'd a congratulatory Letter to him from
the Senate, which was a favour he declin'd for <hi>Blacius,</hi> though his wounds
spake his fidelity and courage, which he would not permit his words to
do, lest the world might believe, he esteem'd his Eloquence greater than
his performances. This action of the Consuls, whether it proceeded from
his embracing the interest of his Family, above that of the State, or the
design he had thereby to break that new contracted Friendship betwixt
<hi>Perolla</hi> and <hi>Blacius,</hi> or his ignorance of the latters generosity in that
action, I cannot certainly determine; but this (alas) I too well know,
that my Father receiv'd such deep impressions of his slighting, which his
own friends perswaded him was an effect of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s being more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of Glory, than of his Daughter, and which <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s on the other
side fomented and concurr'd in, to break an union, which their heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
malice made them detest, that <hi>Blacius,</hi> who was not so perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of his aversion for <hi>Perolla,</hi> as to be uncapable of a relapse, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
tore from his Heart a Friendship, which began but to take root:
for his spirit was too high to preserve a good opinion for one, which both
his Friends and his Enemies acknowledg'd, was greedier of a little Fame,
than of Justice, his esteem or alliance. O gods! (said <hi>Izadora,</hi> raising her
voice) could you find out nothing but <hi>Perolla</hi>'s virtue, to be the cause
of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s destruction? a misery so much the greater, by how much since
that provok'd you, it was impossible for him ever to do othewise. But Sir
(she continu'd, addressing still her discourse to <hi>Spartacus</hi>) Pardon (I
beseech you) a digression, which the sense of our succeeding misfortunes
extorted from me, which began by <hi>Blacius,</hi> commanding me to banish
from my Heart a Flame that was not to be extinguisht, but with my
life. That cruel Injunction had like to have effected both, but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the latter, because it was inseparable from the former, and though
I represented <hi>Perolla</hi>'s innocency, as clear as it was, yet <hi>Blacius</hi> passion
had so clouded his judgement, that like a false Optick, it represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all objects to be of the same colour of the Glass which was lookt
through; and indeed I deriv'd nothing from my attempts, but the rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his hatred for me, instead of suppressing his for <hi>Perolla;</hi> whose
trouble I judg'd by my own, and therefore was almost as much perplext
to let him know my Fathers change, as I was at it: at length I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by my silence, to preserve him as long (as might be) from the
knowledge of his misfortunes, in expectation that some favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
might intervene, which would restore <hi>Blacius</hi> to his justice, and
so <hi>Perolla</hi> might avoid knowing he had been unfortunate, till he were
so no longer; but (alas) out of an apprehension of creating his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I continued it, for by not letting him know my Fathers suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I denied him the means of suppressing them; and <hi>Blacius</hi> not
ascribing his silence to his ignorance of his displeasure, but to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
cause, so confirmed himself in his jealousies, that the aversion
they produced, has been ever since unremoveable.</p>
                  <p>But in this proceeding I could not be more faulty to <hi>Perolla,</hi> than
I was obliging to <hi>Rome,</hi> which by his continuing ignorant of what was past,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96335:95"/>
received a benefit from his Valor, that perhaps it had fail'd of, had I
acquainted him with his misfortunes; for I believe they would have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
him to have made use of all that courage to struggle with him,
which ignoring he employed against <hi>Hannibal;</hi> for 'twas he that under
<hi>Nero</hi> drave him from the <hi>Salentines,</hi> and <hi>Apulians,</hi> into the Country of the
<hi>Brutians;</hi> 'twas he which was the chief Actor in those famous exploits at
<hi>Grumentum,</hi> and <hi>Venusia;</hi> and 'twas he that rendred it impossible for <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
to march any further than <hi>Canusium,</hi> to join with his Brother <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
who having left the Government of <hi>Spain</hi> to his Brother <hi>Mago,</hi> and
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> the son of <hi>Gesco,</hi> had already crost the <hi>Perenean</hi> Mountains, all
<hi>Gaul,</hi> and the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and had with a powerful recruit of <hi>Lygurians</hi> laid
siege to <hi>Placentia:</hi> The Consuls on this intelligence, drew lots who should
oppose this Torrent, and it fell to <hi>Livius,</hi> who with near 50000 Horse and
Foot, went to meet so redoubted an Enemy. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> informed of it,
raises his siege, to shorten the Consuls march; who having thereby reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Friends, was very wary how he dealt with his Enemies; and though
he left <hi>Rome</hi> to take possession of his Command, he told the great <hi>Fabius,</hi>
(who advised him to protract the War) that he was resolved to fight the
very first day, being impatient till he recoverd his honour by a Victory;
or by seeing the ruine of his unjust Countreymen, satisfie himself with the
joy of a great (though not of an honest) Revenge; yet his intention
was better than his words, for at a place of advantage, called <hi>Scaena-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
near the River of <hi>Metaurus,</hi> he pitcht his Camp, and by winning the
Pass, hindred <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s progress, who by Letters advertised his Brother of
it, that then lay on the Banks of <hi>Aufidus,</hi> near the same Plain of <hi>Cannes,</hi>
(in which he had won his highest glory) and that in few dayes he would
storm the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals Camp, rather than not join with him; but these
being intercepted by <hi>Nero</hi>'s Scouts, that Consul, by the advice of <hi>Perolla</hi> to
relieve <hi>Livius</hi>'s danger, took 6000 select Foot, and 1000 Horse, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left the charge of his Army (which Camp'd within 10 Furlongs of
<hi>Hannibals</hi>) to <hi>Veturius Philo</hi> (his Lieutenant-General;) in six dayes, by
tedious Marches, and with exceeding secresie, he came to his Collegue, and
was received into his Camp by night, without enlarging it, or any loud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of joy; where, in a Council of War, it was resolved next
day to give <hi>Asdrubal</hi> Battel, which <hi>Livius</hi> (though provok'd unto) had
thitherto declined: The next morning therefore, a purple Coat was hung
up over <hi>Livius</hi>'s Pavilion, and <hi>Perolla,</hi> the better to delude <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the General that a Trumpet might sound in <hi>Nero</hi>'s quarters, as well
as in <hi>Portius</hi> the <hi>Pretors,</hi> to make the Enemy believe, that either <hi>Hannibal</hi>
was defeated by the Consuls being joined, or that it was done in policy to
supply the defects of their numbers; the first (if credited) would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
them immediately to a Battel, which (next to a Victory) was most
in their desires. This was much approved, and readily practised, and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi>
who was perfectly acquainted with the <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
surprized at it; but yet attributing it to the latter, and perceiving
(by the Signal) the Consuls resolution, he joyfully drew his Army in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,
but then perceiving <hi>Livius</hi>'s numbers to be increast, and that some
of his Enemies Horses look'd as if they had performed a long march, (this
being an accident above his expectation) he esteemed it rather a policy,
than a dishonour, to defer an Engagement, till he could discover the truth
of that mystery; and in order to this, spent that day in slight skirmishes,
and by night retreated with all his Army towards the River of <hi>Metaurus,</hi>
from which the succeeding Battel took its name: but he was followed by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96335:96"/>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi> with all the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, and so vigorously prest, that
he resolved next morning to decide the difference by a pitch'd Battel, lest
if he gained any advantage by retiring, it might be said a Victory was
forc'd upon, and not obtained by him; and if he were defeated, that at
least he dyed like <hi>Amilcar</hi>'s Son, and <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Brother. The day no sooner
dawn'd (which was the last that so many thousands were to see) than
those two great Bodies, which consisted of about 150000 effective men,
were drawn up in a posture to determine all disputes: The <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
having the advantage of number, and the <hi>Roman</hi> of resolution, which was
sufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vinc'd by their Enemies attending the Battel by necessity, and
not election. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> placed his <hi>Gauls</hi> (in whom he least rely'd) in the
Left Wing, upon a Hill of impossible access; in the Right, were his <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
and <hi>Africans,</hi> and himself at the Head of them; his <hi>Lygurians</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Battel, and his Elephants he bestowed in the Front of his several
Divisions. The Right Wing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was led by <hi>Nero,</hi> (who
was accompanied by <hi>Perolla,</hi> that commanded those Thousand Horse his
Uncle had brought with him) the Left by <hi>Livius,</hi> and the Battel by <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus.</hi>
You cannot doubt the dispute was bloody, if either you reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the courage of the Soldiers, the resolution and conduct of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
or the glory and advantages which were to attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Livius</hi> found a generous resistance from the <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;
Porticus</hi> from the <hi>Lygurians;</hi> but <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi> found more difficulty
to come to fight, than I believe they would after it, have found in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Victory; but whil'st they were disputing against a Precipice, the sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of which was not much less difficult, than to scale the Clouds, the last
of them perceiving what disorder <hi>Livius</hi> and <hi>Porticus</hi> were in, besought
<hi>Nero</hi> to leave those <hi>Gauls</hi> to a security which Nature, and not their Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
had plac'd them in; and who by the strange height they were upon,
were as uncapable of doing, as receiving harm, and that he would go to
relieve the Consul and the Pretor. <hi>Nero</hi> soon found the justness of this
motion, and imagining by the Precipice the <hi>Gauls</hi> were upon, that <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
had plac'd them there, rather to amuse, than oppose him, yielded to his
Nephews request, and leaving some 3000 Foot and Horse to keep the <hi>Gauls</hi>
at gaze, followed him with all the rest; but <hi>Perolla,</hi> with admirable celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
having fetcht a compass behind all the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, fell upon the Right
Flank of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> so opportunely, that 'twas when <hi>Livius</hi> was
brought to the last exigency, and so vigorously, that by it he courted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
so handsomly, that though she were declaring for <hi>Carthage,</hi> yet he
won her absolutely for <hi>Rome.</hi> The execution after the rout was excessive
bloody, the <hi>Romans</hi> remembring how freely the <hi>Africans</hi> had opened their
veins, were not ungrateful in their return. The <hi>Gauls</hi> too, found they
had been more securely fortified by nature, than by 80000 of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
and though the <hi>Roman</hi> Swords were almost dull'd with blood
before they came to them, yet they 'scapt not absolutely that dayes Fate;
but that which brought a large accession to the honour of this success, was
the noble <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s fall, who perceiving his glory fled, resolv'd his life
should accompany it, and seeking some gallant Enemy to end his, he found
none which gave greater marks of that title than <hi>Perolla;</hi> 'twas therefore
upon his Sword he resolv'd to receive it, and 'twas upon his Sword indeed
that he found it. I know (continued <hi>Izadora</hi>) that some alledge he
had his death from many an Enemy, and not from a single one, but I know
withall that that report had its rise from <hi>Perolla</hi>'s modesty, who learning
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96335:96"/>
afterwards, how great a virtue he had kill'd, rather deplored, than gloried
in the Action. This Battel of <hi>Metaurus</hi> equal'd that of <hi>Cannes,</hi> for in it
were left 56000 upon the place, 5400 taken Prisoners, and 4000 Captive
<hi>Romans</hi> releas'd. But if in a Relation which my Sex renders me ignorant
in, I have failed in the former, I have not in the truth, for my concern in
<hi>Perolla</hi> made me exactly learn it; neither would I have so particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
you of it, had it not so great a connexion to my generous Friends
Story, that in declining it, I must have injured his Adventures, as much as
his Glory.</p>
                  <p>The day after this famous Battel, <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi> march'd towards their
Camp, observing the same silence and diligence in their return to it, that
they had in their leaving of it, for they serv'd <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as we were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
you did <hi>Varinus;</hi> and though he were a Captain as celebrated for his
Policy, as his Conquests, yet in this expedition he never discover'd any light
of <hi>Nero</hi>'s march nor success, till he sent two <hi>Numidian</hi> Prisoners to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with it; and lest that Testimony might not be authentick, he
flung his Brothers (the gallant <hi>Asdrubals</hi>) head over his Trenches: which
Barbarism <hi>Perolla</hi> so much resented, that not being able to hinder it, he
abandon'd his Uncle, to manifest he detested the Action; and indeed it
was the blacker, because <hi>Hannibal</hi> had alwayes given the bodies of his
dead Enemies a Sepulture, and usage proportionate to their qualities and
virtue whil'st they were alive. Yes (Sir) <hi>Perolla</hi> was so justly transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at this inhumanity, that though the Consuls in their Triumph for this
Victory, besought him (who they acknowledg'd, under the Gods, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
it) to bear a share in his own Acquisitions; yet he absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
it, protesting that he was more asham'd at the use they had made of
their Victory, than pleas'd at the glory of it; and that he declin'd parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
in their Triumph, lest it might be thought he did the like in their
Crime. After this generosity he came to <hi>Salapia,</hi> where he vow'd, had not
the Consuls cruelty (for <hi>Livius</hi> approv'd of what <hi>Nero</hi> had done to <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>'s
Head) render'd it an injustice to have shar'd in their glorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into <hi>Rome;</hi> yet he had rather have declin'd the honour of it, than
purchas'd it at the price of a longer absence. I must confess, I never, till
that time, thought it was possible for <hi>Perolla</hi>'s visits to become my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but my hard Fate then rendred his so; and I believe my disclosing to
him that which I could no longer conceal, was the more sensible by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unprepared to receive the stroke, and by his belief that his new acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of glory, would have rendred his company the more acceptable to
<hi>Blacius.</hi> Alas! I cannot tell you his extravagancies at so fatal and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
an intelligence, but I remember they were so exorbitant, that I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
awhile the reflection on my own griefs, that I might the more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deplore his. <hi>Blacius,</hi> being ignorant of his being with me, came to visit
me, when my generous Friends resentments were in their highest operation;
and though my Father, upon so unlookt for an Accident, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
yet <hi>Perolla</hi> hindred him, by casting himself on his knees, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of <hi>Blacius</hi>'s. His sorrows for awhile were silent, which was no
small proof of their vastness and reality; but when they got a passage,
they were so eloquent, that had he been guilty, he had done enough to
obtain his pardon; and being innocent, he did enough to evince he was
so. Yet (alas!) my Father had so exquisitely fortified his heart against
all assaults of this quality, that what should have vanquish'd him, turned
to a testimony of his cruelty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:96335:97"/>In brief, <hi>Perolla</hi> observing that <hi>Blacius</hi> relisht no reasons for his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
resolved to convince him of it by a demonstration, and in the rage
and grief of so unexpected a misery, he rose up, and with eyes (in which
death were evidently painted) he cryed out, Farewel fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> I will
go expect you in another world, for I see 'tis impossible to possess you in
this; and since there is nothing but the loss of this unfortunate life, which
can either appease your Fathers hatred, or clear my innocency, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
at that rate to satisfie both. At the end of these fatal words, he
drew out his Sword, and turning the Pomel to the ground, he had cast his
Body upon the point of it, had not I struck the Hilt away time enough to
prevent it; and he not suspecting anything of that nature, by falling all
along, gave me time to take up his Sword before he rose, and to protest
that if he abjur'd not all designs of so black a nature, I would immediately
make use of that Weapon for my own destruction, which he had designed
for his. Twas thus I preserved a Virtue so pure, that if the higher Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s do
not reward it in this world, 'tis certainly because they reserve their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for a place where all things are of a resembling quality; and because
I so sav'd <hi>Perolla</hi>'s life, <hi>Blacius</hi> considered that which was an evincement of
his integrity, as a premeditated design to palliate and disguise his guilt;
and though his words did not declare what I tell you, yet his actions did,
for he instantly commanded my generous Friend to abandon his house, or
he would act what I had prevented. <hi>Perolla,</hi> at this cruel and barbarous
command, cryed out, O Gods! why do you render sufferings so necessary
to my condition, and make me uncapable to bear them? (then turning
to me, he continued) But, Madam, if you are not of your Fathers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as well as of his blood, I shall contemn as much his threatnings, as he
does my affection and alliance; and shall find in the virtue of one of the
Family, charms enough to defend me from he cruelties of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Alas! (I replied, interrupting him) ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we come to that again, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fresh assurances of constancy? And will you so highly injure the
merit of my passion, as to render it as much an effect of my promise, as my
inclination? Ah <hi>Perolla,</hi> be not so cruel, as to think my Fathers change is
contagious, nor divest me of the consolation I have had in my past suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that they were undergone with resolution and patience enough, to
suppress all jealousies in you, that I was capable of sinking in the future un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any burden of that nature. O Madam, (he replyed) why do you
so infinitely injure my intentions? for my asking that question, was not to
resolve my doubts, but to hear my joy repeated; neither can you condemn
my imploring so strong a Preservative, when you see what misfortunes I am
to struggle with. <hi>Blacius,</hi> who perceived what our entertainment was,
having repeated his threatnings to <hi>Perolla,</hi> commanded me immediately to
leave him; which, before I obeyed, I told <hi>Perolla,</hi> since your question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from that cause, I shall as willingly satisfie it, as I should have been
troubled to have done so on any other account; Know then, that if my
Passion for you be a Preservative against your miseries, you shall be for ever
uncapable of any; for your desires can give you so large a possession in
my heart, as my affection does; and this justice is so far from being suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of change, that the Gods, while they give me life and reason, are not
able to alter it. My Father, at this assurance, thrust me out of the Room,
but he to whom it was addrest, observing he could not have time enough
to make me in words a retribution of my engagement, by lifting up his
eyes and hands to those Powers I had mentioned, sufficiently confirmed me
that his resolutions and flame were resembling unto mine. But (alas!)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96335:97"/>
my love for <hi>Perolla,</hi> had not that power he ascribed unto it; for though
I had given him pregnant testimonies of the greatness and reality of it, yet
<hi>Blacius</hi>'s cruelty had so fatal an influence on him, which cast him into so
dangerous and long a sickness, that for above half a year he was unable to
leave his Chamber. I must acknowledge, during that time, I was obliged
to my Fathers rigor; for 'twas by the strictness of his watches, that I was
preserved from knowing so sensible a misfortune. But at last he recovered,
and with his health assumed a resolution, that he would act such gallant
things, as all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire should make his particular satisfaction, or
death, a publick concernment, but his design was a while suspended; for
after the Battel of <hi>Metaurus,</hi> the Plague so violently raged both in the <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Armies, that we hardly knew who commanded the
former; and the General of the latter spent that whole Summer near the
Temple of <hi>Iuno Lucinia,</hi> in erecting a magnificent Altar, with a large Title
of all his Actions in Punick and Greek Characters. But the same year was
not unactive in <hi>Spain,</hi> where <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio</hi> (who justly acquired
by his glorious Victories in <hi>Africk,</hi> the Sirname of <hi>African</hi>) beat <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
the son of <hi>Gesgo,</hi> out of the Continent, into the Isle of <hi>Gades,</hi> where
he pillaged all things as well sacred as prophane, and then retired to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conqueror, after having deliver'd up his Province to those the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had appointed his Successors, return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he made suit
for the honour of Triumph; this was deny'd him, having never been
granted to a Proconsul, except to such as had received that dignity after a
Consulship, as it were by prorogation, which (continued <hi>Izadora</hi>) in
my opinion, was some injustice, and evinced, the Reward was not to the
Merit, but the Title. But to repair this Repulse, <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Publius Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
were chosen Consuls; the last being High Priest of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was
confined, by the quality of his office, to a near residence to <hi>Rome;</hi> but
the first beg'd the Senate to permit him to carry the War to the Gates of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> which was the most probable expedient to draw <hi>Hannibal</hi> out
of <hi>Italy.</hi> This motion had more reason in it, than success; for some that
were envious, and others that were fearful, opposed it: yet at last he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<hi>Sicily</hi> for his Province, with liberty (if he thought fit) to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the War into <hi>Asrick. Perolla,</hi> a Friend to the fame and virtue of this
great Man, put himself under his Ensigns, and partly by stratagem, but
more largely by his Valor, took the inexpugnable Town of <hi>Locry,</hi> with
the two famous Cittadels, as it were in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s sight. <hi>Scipio</hi> highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
his Courage and Conduct in this performance, and pressingly invited
him to his <hi>African</hi> journey, which to the wonder of all the Empire he was
admirably provided for, though he had received neither encouragement by
words nor actions from the Senate. <hi>Perolla</hi> (whose Love and Revenge
confin'd him to <hi>Italy</hi>) declin'd <hi>Scipio</hi>'s request, but with inviolable prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations,
that if his success drew <hi>Hannibal</hi> (on whose ruine he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
bent) into <hi>Africk,</hi> he would not fail there to offer the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
his Sword and Life. <hi>Scipio</hi> with this assurance set Sail for <hi>Africk,</hi> and
<hi>Perolla</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where in open Senate he received ample expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of their Gratitude for the Blood he had lost, and the Victories he
had won for their Empire; neither was he long out of a probability of
obliging them at a resembling rate: For <hi>Mago,</hi> a true son of <hi>Amilcars,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received orders from <hi>Carthage,</hi> to abandon the Isle of <hi>Gades,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to raise an Army of <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Ligurians,</hi> to help his Brother in <hi>Italy,</hi>
first whipt and crucified the <hi>Gadentine</hi> Magistrates, for holding a secret
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96335:98"/>
Correspondency with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and then taking an eternal leave of
<hi>Spain,</hi> by his industry and wealth raised so vast an Army of those two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the Senate began to tremble, and some to move that <hi>Scipio</hi> might
be recalled, which in such an exigency had been performed, if his Successes
in <hi>Africk</hi> had not been more prevalent for him, than his Friends in <hi>Rome.</hi>
But though his Actions were of a peculiar quality and merit, yet having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
so much usurpt upon your patience, and having only undertaken
our own Story, I will pass by <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. Madam, (said my Prince, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
her) if I durst in any thing have the confidence to instruct my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
at so uncivil a rate as the lengthening of your trouble, it should be in
his Story; for though the Fame of that great man has in generals diffus'd
itself over the whole world, yet I must confess, I have only heard of his
glory, but not of those particular Trophies which compos'd and form'd it.
Sir (replied <hi>Izadora</hi>) since you seem to decline the being informed of
his generous Adventures, only out of a belief that the telling them may
prove my trouble, I would by experiment convince you, nothing can bear
that name, or have that operation with me, which proves a satisfaction to
the gallant <hi>Spariacus;</hi> but that I believe the Relation will be more exact by
<hi>Perolla</hi>'s making it, than by mine, whose willingness to obey you, I dare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for by my own, since the sympathy betwixt us hath been so great and
constant, that I alwayes knew his heart by mine. My Prince (continued
<hi>Symander</hi>) by his silence, seem'd to impose that task on the generous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who observing it, and having by a handsom expression acknowledg'd
the advantagious character <hi>Izadora</hi> had given <hi>Spartacus</hi> of his heart, by
comparing it to hers, and protested that he undertook the Story to ease
her, and not to improve it: In these terms continued <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Adventures,
and ended his own.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Vblius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> after his subduing of <hi>Spain,</hi>
went with two <hi>Quinquereme</hi> Gallies privately into
<hi>Africk,</hi> to <hi>Syphax</hi> that great <hi>Numidian</hi> King, who
being a Neighbour to his new, and to his intended
Conquests, he Courted to declare for the <hi>Romans,</hi>
whose Victories were so recent, that though at the
same instant <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was sent from <hi>Carthage</hi> to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
his friendship for their Empire, yet he at last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
for the <hi>Roman,</hi> and protested to their General, that upon his arrival
there, he would join Interest and Armies with him. <hi>Scipio</hi> on this assurance
being chosen Consul, hastens into <hi>Africk;</hi> but as he was in <hi>Sicily,</hi> ready for
his intended Expedition, he receives Ambassadors from <hi>Syphax,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him, though not in positive terms, yet obliquely of his change. The
Consul not only kept this disaster secret, lest if it had been divulg'd, the
Senate, and his Soldiers fears, might have put a period to his Voyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it began, but gave out that <hi>Syphax</hi> had sent purposely to accelerate
his Landing, and to acquaint him, if he protracted the time, he was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the War, that he would upon his own score begin it. With
this joyful Declaration, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army set Sail from <hi>Lilibeum:</hi> But while
they are crossing the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, it will not be amiss to tell you the
cause of this barbarous Kings inconstancy. The same <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> to whom
lately he had refus'd his friendship, had a Daughter of such excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that <hi>Syphax</hi> (who was not unapt to receive the flames of Love) so
abundantly admitted those which the fair <hi>Sophonisba</hi>'s eyes inspir'd, that it
made him not only abandon his Faith, but his Interest too; and to purchase
her (for she was bought) he offer'd to decline the <hi>Romans,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself <hi>Carthaginian.</hi> This motion on so emergent a necessity
was greedily embrac'd, and <hi>Sophonisba</hi> deliver'd up a Sacrifice for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
advantage. For it is certain, the <hi>Numidian</hi> King had nothing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
but his Crown; and she by that fatal Marriage declin'd <hi>Massanissa,</hi>
to whom she was contracted; a Prince of so much virtue, and so perfectly
bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with the gifts of Nature, that I may truly say <hi>Sophonisba</hi>'s preferment
was her ruine. This <hi>Massanissa,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Gala,</hi> (Surnamed <hi>the
Good</hi>) King of the <hi>Massesily;</hi> and though he were very young, yet by his
great courage and wisdom he recover'd his Fathers Kingdom, (involv'd
in a dangerous and intricate Rebellion) and by wayes which made all the
world acknowledge him as worthy of it, as by his Title. His next care
was to secure his Right, (both by Succession and Conquest:) To effect
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96335:100"/>
which, and for the satisfying his inclination, he made his Addresses to the
fair <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> whose Father (<hi>Asdrubal</hi>) had so large an interest in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
that whosoever obtain'd his Alliance, might be said thereby to be
Ally'd to that Empire. The Title of a Queen, and the Felicity of such a
Husband, so pleas'd the Father and the Daughter, that the Marriage was as
soon agreed upon as motion'd; and the more to endear it to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
it was resolv'd that a Contract should be perfected, but before the
consummation of the Nuptials, <hi>Massanissa</hi> should go in person with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into <hi>Spain,</hi> under his design'd Father-in-law, which the young Prince
(more troubled to abandon his Mistriss, than his Kingdom) perform'd, and
in that Expedition acted things of so transcendent virtue, that <hi>Carthage</hi>
judg'd his Merit, without his Title, worthy the admirable <hi>Sophonisba;</hi> but
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> having undertaken that fatal Expedition, (being himself no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Captain) met with disasters and oppositions, which would have
render'd his being otherwise of no great advantage; for he began to
move presently after the famous Battel of <hi>Metaurus,</hi> in which I may say
<hi>Spain</hi> was conquer'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> for there all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Hostages were taken,
that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the Son of <hi>Amilcar</hi> had brought with him out of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and by which he kept that Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>like Nation in more awe, than by his
Garisons or Army. This success, made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> consider the <hi>Romans</hi>
as the Rising Sun, and consequently adore the, so that his Levying an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
prov'd more advantageous to his Enemies, than his Friends; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day they abandon'd his Ensigns in whole Troops, and put themselves
under <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, who was a General, that in Courage, Patience, and Conduct,
was hardly to be equal'd. In a word, in one Summer <hi>Asdrubal</hi> lost all
<hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Massanissa</hi> (perhaps glad of any subject which might return him
to <hi>Sophonisba</hi>) joyfully abandon'd a great Kingdom to his Enemies, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in her embraces to lose all thoughts of misfortune; but he too soon
found his error, for in his absence <hi>Syphax</hi> (as I told you) had seen <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisba,</hi>
and so passionately admir'd her, that upon his promise to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
not only of relinquishing <hi>Scipio,</hi> (who was preparing to invade
their Countrey) but to bring them an Army of 100000 Men; they made
of a particular Alliance, a publick Concernment, and in spite of <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
and <hi>Massanissa,</hi> (who was as much his Rivals Superior in Virtue, as he was
his in Power) gave that barbarous King the fair <hi>Sophonisba;</hi> and <hi>Syphax</hi>
no sooner was in possession of his felicity, than proportioning <hi>Massanissa</hi>'s
resentments by the greatness of his loss, resolv'd to take from him the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of acting them. This particular Malice he made pass at <hi>Carthage</hi> for
an Act of publick Security, it being a folly (as great as the injustice) to
trust an offended Enemy with a Kingdom; therefore the Senate not only
approv'd of their new Allies design, but furnish'd him with additional For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to expel the unfortunate <hi>Massanissa</hi> out of his Countrey, which <hi>Syphax</hi>
soon effected, his Rivals virtue yielding to his numbers: But though <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanissa</hi>
lost his Crown, yet did he not either his Courage or Judgement;
the first was too great to sit down with such an affront to his Passion, and
his Right; and the latter lead him to offer his service to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found how considerable an Enemy he had been, doubted not but he
would prove a resembling Friend: wherein he was not deceiv'd; for the
Consul having acquainted him from <hi>Lilibeum,</hi> (where he shipt his Army)
that he would Land at the Promontory of <hi>Apollo,</hi> he found <hi>Massanissa</hi>
there with a gallant Body of Horse ready to join with him. Their first
Action was to cut off 500 Horse, sent out of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to interrupt the
<hi>Romans</hi> descent, which <hi>Massanissa</hi> perform'd as an earnest of his future Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96335:100"/>
The next was against <hi>Hanno,</hi> a young <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Gentleman, of
as little experience as years, who with 4000 select Horse, lay at a Town
of importance, call'd <hi>Salera.</hi> This hasty Commander <hi>Massanissa</hi> (by bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him at his very Gates) toll'd out into an Ambush, then cut him
(with his small Army) in pieces, and in the heat of the pursuit, enter'd
the Town, with some few Run-aways, which presently he became Master
of. This shews that <hi>Scipio</hi> gain'd by the loss of <hi>Syphax,</hi> for by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
he sent him a friend, whose gallantry was more considerable than
the others Forces. From <hi>Salera</hi> they march'd to besiege <hi>Vtica,</hi> a place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
for its strength and scituation, but much more for the virtue of
the Defenders, which indeed was such, that though it were the first Town
attempted, yet it was the last taken; and the Consul would have given
his hopes of winning it, to avoid the disgrace he apprehended of having
sate down before it; but <hi>Syphax</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> (whom the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
had made their General) by approaching with two Armies, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of near 80000 Foot, and 13000 Horse, gave him an honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of abandoning <hi>Vtica,</hi> which he readily embrac'd, but the Winter
was so far advanc'd, that the three Generals did nothing in it, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
their several Camps, which were not seven miles assunder; that of
the <hi>Romans</hi> being excellently provided for, by the providence and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of <hi>Massanissa,</hi> who Reigned in his Subjects, though not over them:
but the Spring being come, <hi>Scipio,</hi> who believ'd the natural inconstancy
of the <hi>Affricans,</hi> the tediousness of a winter Camp, the hazard of a War,
whose <hi>Prologue</hi> had been unsuccessful, and perhaps the society of a Wife,
might be plentiful motives to induce <hi>Syphax</hi> to decline <hi>Carthage,</hi> by sitting
a Neuter, sent Ambassadors to him for that effect, with hope, that if
they succeeded not, yet at least the Treaty would draw him into a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
with his new friends. The <hi>Numidian</hi> King receiv'd the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
with a magnificence that evinc'd they were not unwelcome, and
sent them back to <hi>Scipio</hi> with this motion: That if the <hi>Romans</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
out of <hi>Affrick,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should do the like out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
But the Consul receiv'd a more pleasing and advantagious intelligence
than this, though brought by the same persons, which was, that both the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Numidian</hi> Camp were so ill intrencht, and their Hutts
cover'd with such combustible stuff, that it were a thing of as much ease,
as glory, to end the War in one night; in brief, <hi>Scipio</hi> held on the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
till such time as he had perfectly instructed himself in the truth of this
information, and the facility of performing it, both which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of, one morning he commanded his Ambassadors to return, and
sent <hi>Syphax</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> word, that 'twas in vain any longer to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Treaty, since he found all his Army unanimously bent to make
them yield to their Mercy, or their Swords; This message blasted the two
Generals like Lightning, for they had so fed themselves with the assurance
of Peace, that the loss of that hope appear'd as great a misfortune to them,
as if they had lost a certainty; but at last making Virtue of Necessity, they
consol'd one another with mutual assurances, that as <hi>Scipio</hi> follow'd the
steps of <hi>Marcus Atilius,</hi> so he would his Fate; but the same night,
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who built their confidence upon a firmer foundation than
Hope and Prophecies divided their Army, one halfe <hi>Massanissa</hi> and
<hi>Lelius,</hi> the General of their Horse commanded; these were sent against
<hi>Syphax</hi>'s Camp, to whom <hi>Massanissa</hi> was an Enemy by the two most
enflaming provocations, of a successful Rival, both in Love and Empire;
the other, <hi>Scipio</hi> himself led; The first had orders to assault the <hi>Numidians,</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:96335:101"/>
who lay a Mile behind the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> lest if <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s Camp were first
on fire, it might be thought a design, and not a mischance. <hi>Massanissa</hi> and
<hi>Lelius</hi> march'd two hours before the Consul, and before day, so exactly
executed their instructions, that all <hi>Syphax</hi>'s Camp was in a general Flame
in the sight of <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s, who attributing it to some disaster (for they could
not fancy the <hi>Romans</hi> would attempt the remotest, and so engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
between two Armies) ran without Arms or Order, to the relief
of their friends; but their Charity was their ruine, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse
of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Division, cut off all those which ran out of the Camp, and
the Legions assaulting those in it, soon kindled as great fire there, as that
they were deploring, and going to extinguish. The confusion, horror,
and execution was transcendent, and though in both places the flame
diffus'd it self above four miles, yet 'tis thought there was bloud enough
spilt to have quencht it; for there we killed and destroyed (what by the
Flame, what by the Sword) above 80000, and about 8000 were taken
prisoners; 2000 Foot, and 500 Horse were all the serviceable Forces that
escaped, in which number were the two unfortunate Generals, Never did
<hi>Affrick</hi> receive a resembling misfortune, neither did all their <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
Victories inspire them with a joy proportionate to the vastness of their
grief, and astonishment for this loss. But in this high Misery, the <hi>Barcinian</hi>
Faction shew'd a spirit unworthy of it, and not only absolutely oppos'd
the sending for <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy;</hi> (which they said would be a greater
victory to the <hi>Romans,</hi> than that they had so lately won) but undertook
in few days (if one of their Family might be General) to raise an Army,
that at least should not be kill'd like Sacrifices (without resistance) that
perhaps, might make the <hi>Romans</hi> acknowledge a succession of victories,
was as well the way to <hi>Carthage</hi> as to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that none must present
themselves before her Walls, but they must be loaden with Lawrels as much
as Arms. This motion joy'd, and confounded the Senate; but the result
of their dispute was, that not to discontent the <hi>Barcinian</hi> faction, lest
they might lose <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they resolv'd not to recal him; and not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> lest they might lose <hi>Syphax,</hi> they gave <hi>Asdrubal</hi> again
the Command of the <hi>Affrican</hi> War, sent <hi>Sophonisba</hi> as Embassadress from
her Countrey, to her Husband, to implore him not to abandon them,
when their condition render'd his friendship an action of Charity, as well
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nterest; and besought the <hi>Barcinian</hi> Princes, by joyning their power
and affections with <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> to manifest, that they lov'd the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
more than they hated their Enemy. In brief, <hi>Syphax</hi> vanquish'd
with the abundant Prayers and Tears of the fair <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> and the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
mov'd with the intreaties and danger of <hi>Carthage,</hi> so well improv'd
the time, that in 30 days, they rais'd 30000 Men for <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to repair or repeat his disgrace, march'd directly towards <hi>Vtica,</hi>
which <hi>Scipio,</hi> (more intent to vindicate his Honour, than increase his
Conquest) had again besieg'd, which the second time he was necessitated
to leave, and in a bloudy Battel, overcame <hi>Syphax</hi> and his Father-in-law,
as absolutely by Courage, as he had formerly by Policy; the last flying
to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the other (follow'd soon after by his Queen) into his
own Kingdom. The Consul to husband this victory better than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
resolv'd himself to attempt <hi>Carthage,</hi> (the <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Affrick</hi> sent a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
number to continue the Siege of <hi>Vtica,</hi> and enjoyn'd <hi>Massanissa,</hi> with
all his <hi>Numidians,</hi> and some of the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Lelius,</hi> to prosecute <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax.
Scipio</hi> with his Division, took many Towns by his Name, and by
his Arms, and at last presented himself before that stately City, which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96335:101"/>
had so long been a dangerous Rival unto his: <hi>Tunis,</hi> a great Town in the
prospect of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he took by Assault; but as he was going to try his
fortune upon her Neighbor and Mistriss, he was forc'd to alter his design,
by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> sending out their Fleet to destroy his, that lay ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mann'd
before <hi>Vtica.</hi> By hasty marches therefore he came thither, and
so well animated his Soldiers, and secur'd his Gallies, that his Enemies
only return'd to <hi>Carthage</hi> with six of his Ships, where their Triumph was
much greater than their Victory. In the mean while <hi>Massanissa,</hi> carry'd by
the wings of Love, Empire, and Revenge, came with his Army into <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi>
where the <hi>Masesilii,</hi> who had never been but his Subjects, now
publickly declar'd themselves so, and joyning their Arms to their Prince's,
march'd resolutely against <hi>Syphax,</hi> who with 50000 Foot, and 10000
Horse, was coming to dispute his Queen and his Kingdom: <hi>Massanissa</hi>
and <hi>Lelius</hi> joyfully accepted the Battel, especially the first, who thought
the ways to Empire, and fruition, were but the same. <hi>Syphax</hi> taught his
Men to fight in the <hi>Roman</hi> order, but not being able to give them <hi>Roman</hi>
Hearts, he lost his Army and his Liberty, to those that practis'd the former,
and possess'd the latter. <hi>Massanissa</hi> justly pleas'd with this purchase, and
being one who knew as well how to prosecute, as win a Victory, desir'd
<hi>Lelius</hi> to follow to <hi>Cirta,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Numidia,</hi> whether he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with all the Horse, and his great Prisoner: The Citizens upon the
Conqueror's approach (who perhaps, hated the King, as much as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful
Cause) open'd their Gates, where the first object that saluted his
Eyes, was the fair <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> not as a Tryumphant Mistris, but an implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Prisoner: <hi>Massanissa,</hi> who consider'd her, and not her condition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
from his Horse, and imitating her posture, desir'd her to believe,
her Empire was as great where he commanded, as where <hi>Syphax</hi> did, and
begg'd her, if she doubted so perfect a Truth, to evince it by some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
She told him, that her inconstancy made her as little merit as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
obligations from him, that had she not thought it a crime to have
destroyed her self, by any thing, but by the sentence of his offended Love,
she had, by becoming her own Executioner, punisht her inconstancy and
misfortune (the former being the latter) and not liv'd to be so publique
a spectacle of Fortune's mutability; that since he was pleas'd to pardon a
sin that was its own punishment, she besought him, till her repentance for
her fault, had created in him desires of affection, or the greatness of it,
desires of Revenge, that he would preserve her from the <hi>Romans</hi> power.
Her Youth and admirable Beauty, made so deep an impression in <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>'s
heart; that not only he granted her request, but pardon'd her past
inconstancy, and to take from the <hi>Romans</hi> all hopes of such a Prisoner, he
seemingly, or really at that instant marry'd her.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lelius</hi> upon his arrival, was in so great a fury, that he had like to
have been the destruction of the Nuptials, by being the destroyer of
the Bride; but <hi>Massanissa</hi> knew so well how to humble himself before
that proud <hi>Roman,</hi> and to represent, that she had always been his Wife,
though married to <hi>Syphax;</hi> that he was content to suspend all things,
till they return'd to the Consul, which (after the setling that great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
they soon did; There was no common joy in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp at
the arrival of so great a friend a Conqueror, and so great an Enemy a
Prisoner; the first having by <hi>Scipio</hi> receiv'd in publique a just and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
commendation, and acknowledgement for his transcendent obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on this Empire; the last was strictly examined, what had induc'd
him to embrace the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Quarrel, having so professedly engag'd
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96335:102"/>
himself in the <hi>Roman;</hi> to which he resolutely answer'd, 'twas the charms
of his Wife, which truth he was confident e're long, a resembling operation
on <hi>Massanissa,</hi> would abundantly confirm. Whether <hi>Syphax</hi> spoke this
really, or in revenge, I cannot tell, but his assertion had so powerful an
influence on the Consul: that taking <hi>Massanissa</hi> aside, he told him inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously,
the <hi>Romans</hi> had an undeniable Title to <hi>Sophonisba</hi>'s Life, whom
he consider'd as the efficient cause of these Wars, and therefore conjur'd
him, not to ruine the reward of so great services, by committing as great
a Crime, which his detention of his new Wife, did, and would appear,
in his, and the Senates judgement. <hi>Massanissa</hi> blusht and wept, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
begg'd some time to work on his inclination, to submit unto his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
this civil request had the desir'd return, and <hi>Massanissa</hi> being retir'd
into his Tent, spent an hour in an Agony, whose torments nothing but
an unfortunate Lover is capable to imagine: but at length, after a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reflection, that by denying her, he should deliver both himself and
<hi>Sophonisba,</hi> into the <hi>Roman</hi> hands, and perhaps believing, if she had a
real passion for him, that her own Fate would be the less bitter, by his not
being involv'd in it, and if she had not, the loss was the more tollerable;
he determin'd to preserve her in his memory, that he could not in his
embraces, and sending for an exquisite poison, he commanded one of
his Domesticks to present it from him to <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> as the only way he
had left to keep his word, and her from the <hi>Romans.</hi> The fair Queen
undauntedly taking the fatal Cup, bid the Messenger to tell his Lord,
that to manifest, nothing which came from him was unwelcome, she
would receive from him the present of her Fate; which having drank,
she further enjoyn'd him to beg <hi>Massanissa,</hi> that if the actions of her life,
had impair'd her in his first affection; that the resoluteness of her
death, might restore it to its former luster, and that she might live in,
though not with him: then casting her self upon her Bed, an eternal
darkness soon clos'd up the fairest Lights which ever shin'd in <hi>Affrick,</hi>
to which barbarous Countrey I had not confin'd my similitude, had the
fair <hi>Sophonisba</hi> been as constant in her Love, as in her Death. This Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
and the sad influence it had on <hi>Massanissa,</hi> no sooner reacht the
Consuls knowledge, than he sent for him, and having drawn all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Battalia, in their sight, to repair the having taken from him <hi>Syphax</hi>'s
Wife, he gave him <hi>Syphax</hi>'s Kingdom, saluted him by the name of <hi>King,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him with a Crown of Gold, and by large Elogies on his noble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
dry'd up his Tears. This truly was the best Cordial, and those
clouds of grief, by so admirable a Sun-shine of prosperity, were soon
dissipated, and he with the <hi>Romans</hi> march'd to the Siege of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
from whence, they having heard of <hi>Syphax</hi>'s defeat, instead of sending armed
Troops to meet them, they sent out old <hi>Hanno</hi> with the Princes of his
Faction, who prostrating themselves on the ground, not only kist <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
feet, but the feet of those that sate in Counsel with him, to whom they
acknowledg'd they had unjustly broken the Peace betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
which they besought might continue as a monument of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and in a resembling series of baseness, begg'd Peace on terms, though
as low as those Spirits that implor'd it. <hi>Scipio,</hi> who knew <hi>Rome</hi> to be
poor, though victorious, and <hi>Carthage</hi> rich, though subdu'd, willing to
relieve the necessities of the former, by the abundance of the latter, and
perhaps, fearful that dispair might make them continue the War longer
than his Consulship, and so his victories might prove but the foundation
of anothers Glory; or else believing so prostrate an Enemy unworthy his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96335:102"/>
Sword, or esteeming it more generous to be known a Conqueror by the
confession, than the ruine of his Enemies, granted them Peace, but upon
terms, as long as their submission, and permitted them to send unto the
<hi>Roman</hi> Senate for their Ratification. In the mean time, <hi>Mago</hi> had rais'd
so considerable an Army of <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Lygurians,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
he would kindle as great a flame in <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Scipio</hi> had in <hi>Affrick.</hi>
They therefore sent against him <hi>Marcus Cornelius,</hi> the Pro-Consul, and
<hi>Quintilius Vartus,</hi> one of their Pretors, with whom I associated my self.
In short, <hi>Mago</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, met in the Countrey of the <hi>Insub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
where was fought a Battel, of as much variety and resolution, as any
since <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Carthage</hi> were founded: twice the <hi>Romans,</hi> and twice their
Enemies were embracing Victory, but at length <hi>Quintilius,</hi> and I, having
rally'd the reliques of our scatter'd Horse, and <hi>Mago</hi> of his, we resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanc'd to determine this bloudy dispute; <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Brother, who
suspected his Men needed some high encouragement, advanc'd about an
hundred paces before them, and invited the Pro-Consul by a single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
to shew they were as prodigal of their own Bloud, as of their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
He not being present, and the Pretor (perhaps) more concern'd
in the publique Safety, than in his particular Honor, declining it, (with
his permission) I gallop'd up to <hi>Mago,</hi> told him, the Pro-Consul was on
an employment which render'd him uncapable of hearing, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answering his Challenge, and that therefore I was come (naming my
self) to supply his place, that so generous an invitation might not fall to
the ground. As soon as <hi>Mago</hi> heard the Name of <hi>Perolla,</hi> his Eyes were
all inflam'd, and he was so transported with Passion, he had scarce the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to tell me, that had he known of my being in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army,
he had addrest his words to me sooner than to the Pro-Consul, and that
the time was now come, I must answer for <hi>Asdrubals</hi> bloud, or shed more
of it: then not giving me the leasure of a reply, we began a Combat of
so peculiar a quality, that it produc'd a resembling effect, for both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were so concern'd in the dispute of their Combatants, that forgetting
their own, as if it had been by mutual consent, they became spectators of
their Fates, which they thought would be legible in that of their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.
But why do I so long protract my relation? let it suffice I tell you,
that though <hi>Mago</hi>'s Virtue relish'd of his Family, yet his success was <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian,</hi>
for I having receiv'd a wound on my Bridle-hand, gave my
Enemy so large an one in his Thigh, that he fell from his Horse, and had
there lost his life, had not I thought it more handsome to give, than take
it. At this Victory, the <hi>Romans</hi> gave so loud a shout, that most of the
<hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Lygurians</hi> were hardly able to abide it, much less their victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Arms; but the Battel had so long continu'd, that the approach of
night hinder'd the Conquerors from making any considerable advantage
by winning it, and the vanquish'd during the obscurity, made so long a
march with their wounded General, that in two days after they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Lyguria,</hi> where he receiv'd the sad Commands of <hi>Carthage,</hi> without
delay to return thither, and rather employ his Bloud to preserve his own
Countrey, than to Conquer his Enemies. This fatal Summons he obey'd
in part, but his wound open'd so large a way for his Soul, that it flew out
at that passage, as he was as far as <hi>Sardinia</hi> in his return. This loss, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> resented at a higher rate, than that Battel which was the
cause of it: To contract my discourse, I will pass over those Civilities,
not only the Pro-Consul and the Pretor, but also the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Senate
made me to let you know, that those low submissions <hi>Carthage</hi> had made
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96335:103"/>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> (which indeed were too humble to be real) were only to protract
the time, till those two famous Sons of <hi>Amilcar</hi> were come out of <hi>Italy</hi> for
their deliverance; the fate of the youngest, and his Army, Sir, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you, that of <hi>Hannibal</hi> I am now going to relate, and it shall be
in as little a Volume, as I can possibly contract so much Truth, and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in. I will therefore in pursuance of this assurance, pass by all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
since that famous Battel of <hi>Metaurus,</hi> and therein be no Enemy to his
Glory, which would be more obscur'd by saying he did little, than that
he did nothing, and come to his receiving from <hi>Carthage</hi> the Orders for
his return; which though they were the same, had been sent his great Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet he did not consider them with so Philosophical a temper; for
whereas <hi>Mago</hi> at their reception, obey'd them, with an absolute resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>Hannibal</hi> by a thousand extravagancies exprest his rage, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
but after his fury, gave him leave to speak, he cry'd out to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
yet at least this is plain dealing, and more handsome to let their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
than their not supplying my necessities recall me; besides, (he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd)
<hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Scipio</hi> cannot now glory, they have sent <hi>Hannibal</hi> out
of <hi>Italy,</hi> no, 'tis <hi>Hanno</hi> and his Faction, who not able any other way to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the destruction of the <hi>Barcinians,</hi> act it by that of <hi>Carthage.</hi> But this
great Captain, whose providence extended over all events, had in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
a Fleet for so sad a Navigation, in which he embark'd his Army, but
all such <hi>Italians</hi> as were not willing to follow his fortune, nor able to fly
his Power and Fury, and had taken sanctuary in that sacred one of <hi>Iuno
Lucinia,</hi> he forc'd from thence, and by putting them to several ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deaths, did that for them, which they merited of their Countrey: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so bloudy a Sacrifice to the <hi>Manes</hi> of those friends he had left behind, he
took Ship himself, more troubled at his abandoning <hi>Italy,</hi> than at the cause
of it, cursing both the gods and his own stupidity, that after the Battel of
<hi>Cannes,</hi> he had not led his Army all hot and bloudy to the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But whilist he is at Sea, it will not be amiss to let you know, what is done on
Land. The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to ratify that Peace
made with <hi>Scipio,</hi> appear'd so ignorant in what they were sent to conclude,
and so uncertain in their desires, and answers, that the Senate easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
their hearts, and found what there presented to be their simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
was their treachery: whereupon that great Assembly return'd them
back to <hi>Scipio,</hi> by <hi>Lelius,</hi> who had been sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Syphax. Lelius</hi> in
a swift Gally, accompanied with his false Ambassadors, soon came to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
standing Camp, where he learnt that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heard of that great Army (following too the famous Name of <hi>Hannibal</hi>)
which was coming out of <hi>Italy,</hi> asham'd of their tame submission, and that
they had despair'd of their fate, whilst so fear'd a General was to dispute it,
and coming powerfully to their deliverance, had not only broke the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but by <hi>Asdrubal</hi> their Admiral had taken 200 Ships sent from <hi>Sicily</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, they being by extremity of weather, cast into the
Bay of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and that <hi>Scipio</hi> having sent Ambassadors to complain of so
barbarous a violation, contrary to the Laws of Nations, they had like to
have been murther'd, declaring their Ambassy; but having strangely escap'd
that misfortune, returning by Sea to the Consul, who then encamp'd not far
from the River <hi>Bagradas,</hi> they were encounter'd by the same <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who
lay behind a Promontory to intercept them, which doubtless he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
had not the Ambassadors in a swift <hi>Quinquereme</hi>-Gally, avoided his
stemming, and run ashore to some <hi>Roman</hi> Companies, which were sent for
their rescue, where though they sav'd themselves, yet they lost many of their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96335:103"/>
attendants &amp; followers, which <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rican</hi> proceeding had so incens'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
that he was gone to vindicate it with his Army, which now breath'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but blood and fury. <hi>Lelius,</hi> surpriz'd at this strange &amp; true information,
went to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who he found acting a Revenge proportionate to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those Crimes that made it just: but the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors
he left in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, which then was commanded by <hi>Bebius,</hi> one of
those that had so narrowly scap'd in his late Embassy; and though by <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> he beg'd the Consul by the death of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors, to
let his Enemies know, and suffer for their fault; yet the generous <hi>Scipio</hi>
commanded him not only to spare their Lives, but immediately to give
them their liberty: For he esteem'd it a nobler way so to reprove their
sin, than to imitate it. This great Conquest over himself, was but a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of that over his Enemies, which now was not far off; for their great
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> about this time, landed at <hi>Leptis,</hi> an hundred miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi>
which he did, to refresh his men after their Navigation, and to get some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Forces, especially of Horse, in which he was most defective. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
and <hi>Mezetullus,</hi> two <hi>African</hi> Princes, brought him 3000, with which
reinforcement, having received positive orders from <hi>Carthage,</hi> without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
to determine their destiny by Battel, he march'd directly to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
not far from the place where the Consul lay, from whence he sent out
Spies, to discover the <hi>Romans</hi> countenance and strength; some of them
being taken, were brought to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who, instead of crucitying them,
(which was then the general practice) commanded an Officer to carry
them about the Camp, and punctually to shew them whatever they desir'd:
this done, he sent them back to their General, who admir'd at the bravery
of his Enemy, and concluded his Army was deficient in nothing, since he
was so ready to shew the posture it was in. <hi>Hannibal</hi> immediately after,
(but I cannot tell from which of those two causes it proceeded) sent to
desire a Parly with <hi>Scipio,</hi> who assur'd him shortly to satisfie his request. The
next day after <hi>Massanissa</hi> (who upon that false Peace was sent into his own
Kingdom) came to the Camp, at the Consuls reiterated requests, with 4000
Horse, and 6000 Foot, and the same day I arriv'd there, to satisfie my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
and Revenge. Those additional Forces gave the Consul so great
a certainty of Victory, that the next morning with all his Army he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to <hi>Nadagara,</hi> where mindful of his Engagement to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he sent
him word he was then ready to discharge it. The time and place was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
appointed, and those two great Men went out of their Camps
to meet one another, each of them with 1000 Horse for their Guard; and
I being desirous to see my Rival, had the command of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. No sooner
were they come to a convenient distance, then all the rest making a stand,
the two Generals advanc'd, and for a while did nothing but view one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with mutual admiration, perhaps to find out where that virtue lay,
which had render'd them so equally famous over all the world. At length,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> saluting <hi>Scipio,</hi> first told him, It had been (generous Enemy)
more advantageous both for <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> if they had confin'd their
Ambitions within the shores of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> about which our Fathers and we have so obstinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
are not a sufficient recompence for that blood and treasure they
have exhausted; but though things past are irrevocable, yet they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us for the future, and induce us (by a serious reflection on those
dangers we have expos'd our own Countries unto, to conquer others) to
believe it necessary and just, rather with safety to possess our own, than run
a hazard of that, for an uncertainty of more: To this temper, my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96335:104"/>
of the World, and of Fortune, has reduced me: But I apprehend
thy youth and heat will decline these thoughts, till thou hast learn'd them
in the same School; but, methinks, thou may'st, by my example, be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of a truth, which if now unregarded, thou may '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t learn at a more
troublesom rate: For I am that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which, after many bloody Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
brought my victorious Arms to the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and now behold
here I come to offer Peace unto thee, that thou may'st not do the like to
<hi>Carthage.</hi> Consider too the Fate of <hi>Marcus Atilius,</hi> who, for declining so
advantageous an overture, received a ruine from the gods, which perhaps
attends all those that delight in shedding humane blood: Canst thou be
content <hi>Scipio</hi> that <hi>Spain, Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and whatever other Islands lie
between <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> be eternally abandoned by the <hi>Carthaginians?</hi>
'Tis a glorious bargain for the <hi>Romans;</hi> and for our parts, our future quiet
shall be our satisfaction; and the contentment which from thence we shall
derive, will be an abundant obligation to tye us faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ully to observe the
Peace that gives it: But if thou esteemest all this too little, reflect (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee) how great a hazard thou undergoest, for the obtaining of a
little more than thou may'st enjoy without any. 'Tis now in thy power
to make thy Fate, but if thou stayest till to morrow Night, the gods will
make it for thee; let us therefore conclude on this universal blessing, and
reproach me not the late treachery of some false-hearted Citizens of ours;
it is <hi>Hannibal</hi> that now desires Peace, which he would never do, did he
not find it expedient for his Countrey, and knowing it so, he will always
maintain it, as he did the War he began, 'till the gods and Men did envy
him. (To which <hi>Scipio</hi> reply'd) 'Twas not (generous <hi>Hannibal</hi>) the
ambition of <hi>Rome</hi> which made them take up Arms, but the defence of the
<hi>Memertines,</hi> and <hi>Saguntines,</hi> their Confederates; which action of theirs,
the gods, by the issue of the War, have, and will declare was just: For the
mutability of Fortune, I am not ignorant of it, the condition which thou
once didst reduce <hi>Rome</hi> unto, and that which I have since <hi>Carthage,</hi> does
sufficiently evince it, and therefore I would as willingly give Peace, as
thou des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>est it, if it were upon terms which might convince the world, 'tis
the <hi>Roman</hi> magnanimity, and not the <hi>Roman</hi> fear, that grants it; but by
what thou offerest, thou only givest what their Swords have given them
already; and whereas I expected, that in recompence of thy Citizens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness,
thou wouldst enlarge the Articles of their late violated Peace,
thou dost exceedingly contract them, and thereby wouldst have them gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by their treachery. No, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> those that will have <hi>Rome</hi> their
friend, must not do actions unworthy of that end; and if the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
break an Agreement, as soon as they see a probability of building
their Fortune, by the ruine of their Faith, they do thereby instruct the
<hi>Romans,</hi> to reduce them to a condition of not being able to violate a
Peace before they grant them one. But (continued <hi>Scipio</hi>) all this I
speak to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and not to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to whose desires I will give, what I
will deny my own judgment, and that is Peace, provided that my first
Concessions be the Articles of it, and that an equal satisfaction be made for
those injuries we have sustained by their Infidelity. I am not come (<hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
reply'd) to cheapen a Peace, I come to offer what I esteem just; and
as I have done it at first word, so I will not recede from my first overture;
if thou esteemest it unreasonable, the god of Battels must be our Judge.
'Tis to him then (<hi>Scipio</hi> briskly reply'd) I refer our difference, who, I
believe, thou wilt find more untractable than I am; for he cannot be a
god, if he favor an Army which comes more loaden with In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96335:104"/>
Arms; and from whom Victory will flie, lest she be thought as blind as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Then the Consul, laying by his serious looks, told the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
smiling, But if at my return to my Army, every one be as well satisfied
with this conclusion, as a Gentleman that commands those Horse (pointing
to his Guards) I shall find as general a joy at the assurance of a Battel, as
at the possession of a Victory; and if every Soldier had his resolution and
design, <hi>Hannibal</hi> would not avoid his particular Fate, whatever the Gods
determined of the publick. Who is this, said the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> that is so
great an Enemy to Peace, and to <hi>Hannibal?</hi> 'Tis <hi>Perolla</hi> (said the Consul)
Oh Gods (the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rican</hi> reply'd) what strange accident makes him abandon
his <hi>Izadora?</hi> But may I not (generous <hi>Scipio</hi>) by your favor, be satisfied
from his own mouth? Yes (said the Consul) I will send him to you, but first
I must exactan engagement from you, and then the like from him, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your discourses be, you shall pass no farther. I do (<hi>Hannibal</hi> answer'd)
faithfully promise it; for since I am certain in so short a time, to have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousand witnesses of my revenge, I would not confine the sight of it
to so few. This confidence (said <hi>Scipio</hi>) I will leave <hi>Perolla</hi> to answer, who
immediately shall meet you: then taking leave of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he told him,
Remember <hi>Carthage</hi> pulls down her own destiny, by decliming a Peace,
which she implor'd with tears; and when I ask no other satisfaction for
their treachery, but to restore what they took from us by it. Remember
(said the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>) 'twas Citizens not Soldiers which beg'd made, and
broke the Peace, and 'tis <hi>Hannibal</hi> you have now to deal with, who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to keep his bargain, will make it accordingly, and has offered you what
before next Sun does set, you will repent you have declin'd. The Consul
would not hear this reply, but came immediately where I waited for him,
and there told me the publick transactions, and my Rivals desire, which he
gave me leave to satisfie, but first engaged me to the same conditions <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
had submitted unto; which having faithfully promis'd, I gallopt to the
place where he attended me, and where truly I was receiv'd by that great
man, with a civility and countenance which had nothing of an Enemy and
Rival; I salu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed him with an high respect, and with an humility proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the difference of our qualities; but I could not suspend that just
hatred I had contracted against his barbarous usage, to a perfection greater
than that sin; which the seeing him so infinitely increast, that had I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
my engagement to <hi>Scipio,</hi> I had then either ended our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or my life; but whil'st I was in those thoughts, they were interrupted, by
<hi>Hannibals</hi> telling me, Is then (<hi>Perolla</hi>) your Hate greater than your Love,
that you abandon your Mistriss, to prosecute your Rival? Or has that high
justice of <hi>Izadora</hi>'s, which esteem'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> unworthy of her, taken up the
same belief of you? Sir (I reply'd) that affection which I confess is an injustice
for the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> to confer on any man, forces me to seek out the high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupter
of it, which yet is no argument that my desire of revenge is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than my flame; for the cause being alwayes more noble than the effect, my
passion, which makes me endeavor to vindicate the object of it, cannot be
esteem'd less great, than that which it forces me unto: neither could I by any
one action render my self more unworthy the beatitude of <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Love,
than in not declining my joys, to revenge her wrongs; which to effect, I will
fling my self into dangers, as high as those pleasures I have lately abandon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d.
Ah young man (said <hi>Hannibal</hi>) thou art as little sensible of, as worthy thy
felicity: Canst thou possess <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Love, and think of any thing besides?
Were I in thy blest condition, nor Revenge, Empire, or Glory, should one
minute separate me from a felicity which I could not render my self more
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96335:105"/>
unworthy of, than by abandoning: nay, I would quarrel with any thought
which should interpose, much more remove me from it: but since thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast
left all to follow thy Revenge, if thou hast the courage to act it, to morrow
I'll present thee the occasion. Oh Gods! I cry'd out, if I have the courage
to act it? Alas! he that did not want it to vindicate an injur'd Empire, will
not certainly, when 'tis to right a perfection as far above an Empire, as she
is any thing else that's mortal. Yes, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> thou shalt find, a heart that's
fill'd with so divine an image, cannot be capable of so low a sin as Fear; but
on the contrary, 'twill inspire me with resolution enough to seek thee out,
even in the center of thy Troops. I will (said <hi>Hannibal</hi>) spare thee that
pains, thou shalt find me at the head of them, where I will more handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punish those miseries thy better stars have cast upon me, and by thy death,
before 200000 witnesses, evince, thou hadst more Fortune than Merit in
thy Love; and by destroying the object of <hi>Izadora</hi>'s flame, punish her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
to mine. Do but (I reply'd) assault my life in so generous a
way, I will excuse thy attempt upon it by <hi>Oristes,</hi> and never implore a
greater certainty for the punishment of thy Crimes, than to have thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them with thy Sword. The apprehension I had (continu'd <hi>Perolla</hi>)
that my passion might transport me beyond my promise, made me (after
having again summon'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> of his engagement) gallop away to the
Consul, who I found (by an excess of civility) was become the Captain of
my Guards, as I had been of his; he made me too, that generous Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and after I had by an humility resembling the cause of it, exprest my
gratitude, I inform'd him (as we were returning to the Camp) what had
past betwixt my Rival and me, whilst he was doing so great an injury to
his quality. As soon as we were come within sight of it, <hi>Massanissa, Lelius,</hi>
and all the most considerable Officers, came to meet <hi>Scipio,</hi> who told them
with a look which relisht of Victory, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would force
the <hi>Romans</hi> to become their Lords; and by denying them a part of their
Empire, give them a title to the whole, which the next Sun should absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decide. The <hi>Numidian</hi> King, and all the rest, were exceedingly satisfi'd
with this News; for they were confident, their Swords would give them
more, than the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The day therefore no sooner appear'd, than
the large Plains of <hi>Nadagara</hi> were cover'd with Soldiers, from which place
the ensuing Battel took its name, though many (but ignorantly) term'd it
that of <hi>Zama;</hi> and though I had the honour to have been in most of the
signal actions of my time, yet there were none of them to beequal'd with
this, whether you reflect upon the Generals, the Armies, or the dispute, which
in effect was to decide the quarrel betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage. Scipio</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Horse in two wings, the right <hi>Massanissa</hi> had with his <hi>Numidians,</hi>
under whom I elected to serve, because their manner of Fight gave me a
greater probability of meeting with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> though the Consul offer'd
me the command of the flying Regiment, which consisted of 1000 <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Sicilian</hi> Gentlemen; the left <hi>Lelius</hi> commanded, which was composed
of the <hi>Italian</hi> Cavalry: The first <hi>Maniples</hi> were the <hi>Hastati,</hi> the next the
<hi>Principes,</hi> the third the <hi>Triarii,</hi> who were mutually seconds to each other,
and only in this the Consul differ'd from the usual <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline; for
he plac'd not the <hi>Maniples</hi> of his <hi>Principes,</hi> opposite to the Intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Hastati,</hi> that so (as was usual) they might fall back between the
<hi>Principes,</hi> but plac'd them directly one behind the other, as it were in File,
which was of singular advantage; for those Elephants that charged the
<hi>Romans,</hi> finding a free passage through the Intervals, never broke upon the
Soldiers, which it seem'd was rather their constraint, than their choice. The
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96335:105"/>
Consul having thus drawn up his Army, made them this short Speech: If
Glory, Revenge, and the Empire of the world, are capable (generous
Companions) to bring any accession to your Valors, in this Battel, as in
their centre they all meet, you safeties too are included in it, for in this
barbarous Climate you have no retreat; so that were there any Cowards
amongst you, they must find their security in their hands, not in their feet:
For my own particular, I bless the Gods that have made it my Fate, to be
after this day uncapable of misery, for Death or Victory equally secures me
from it; and this Battel ended, you may quietly possess the fruits of it, since
if your Swords conquer this Nation, your Fame will all the others. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your Enemies last action in <hi>Italy,</hi> was the violating of Sanctuaries, and
their first in <hi>Africk</hi> was the violating of Peace: so that their Crimes weigh
down their Arms; and by destroying them, you sacrifice as well to the
Gods, as to your Revenge. Let us then begin the Charge, and let it be
vigorous enough, to make them acknowledge, that their sin was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of transcending their punishment; that by flying from that Peace
which we granted them, they have as much injur'd their interest, as their
honesty; and force the Survivors to shed as many tears for having declin'd
honesty; and force the Survivors to shed as many tears for having declin'd
our mercy, as they did to obtain it. <hi>Hannibal</hi> too was not unimploy'd, for
he knew this day was to perfect, or ruine his glory. His Elephants (which
were above Fourscore) he plac'd in the Front of his Battalions, behind
these was his Vanguard (all Mercenaries) and compos'd of <hi>Lygurians,
Gaules, Baleares</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> his Battel then follow'd, consisting of <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
and other <hi>Africans,</hi> more concern'd in the quarrel, but not so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
maintainers of it. To these were added 4000 <hi>Macedonians,</hi> under
the command of <hi>Sopater</hi> their Captain, lately sent him by <hi>Philip,</hi> King of
that Warlike people. More than a Furlong behind these last Divisions,
came his Rearguard, consisting of those brave Soldiers which had serv'd
him in his <hi>Italian</hi> Wars, in whose virtue only he was confident of victory.
His right wing of Horse (all <hi>Carthaginians</hi>) was led by <hi>Mircall,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocall</hi>
(for the generous <hi>Maharball</hi> was dead.) Two famous Captains,
<hi>Tycheus</hi> and <hi>Mezetullus,</hi> commanded the left, which was formed of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. Hannibal</hi> having thus order'd the Fate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> endeavour'd by
few, but powerful words, to elevate and increase his Soldiers courages; to
the Mercenaries he promis'd rewards, as great as the quarrel that Battel was
to decide. To the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> perpetual slavery and chains, if by death
or victory, they did not avoid those misfortunes. But to his old Army, he
put them in mind of all that Glory they had won, when their Courages
effected greater wonders, than would be necessary that day: 'Tis not (he
continu'd) your General alone that now incites your Valors, 'tis <hi>Carthage,</hi>
liberty, glory, your wives, children, and friends, that speak by my mouth;
they will think you valu'd <hi>Italy</hi> above all these, if you had courage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
that, and want it to preserve them: no, generous Companions, shew
the Senate, by the defeat of these <hi>Romans,</hi> what you had done to all the
rest, had your Supplies been equal to your Merit; and convince them by
so noble an Argument, of your virtue, and of their neglect of it. Then
turning towards our Army, he told them, Observe whether these numbers
equal those at <hi>Cannes, Trebia, Tecinum,</hi> or <hi>Thracimene;</hi> alas! these are so
far from opposing you, that their ruine will hardly bring any accession to
your Glories. Remember this <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Father was the first Captain we beat
in <hi>Europe,</hi> let his Son be the first we beat in <hi>Africk,</hi> make your Successes
run in a blood, his Soldiers will contribute to this design; for they are the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96335:106"/>
Sons of those Cowards you have so often vanquisht, that you have entail'd
fear upon their Posterity.</p>
               <p>No sooner had <hi>Hannibal</hi> done speaking, then he commanded his <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Horse to begin the Battel, whereunto they were invited by a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Trumpets, Clairons, and other Warlike Musick: The Elephants too
were commanded to Charge the <hi>Romans,</hi> but those irrational Creatures
seem'd to reprove the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with their violation of Faith; for the
greatest part of them turn'd head, and extremely disorder'd their own left
wing; <hi>Massanissa</hi> so well improv'd so unexpected an advantage, that he
perfected what they had but begun. The rest of the Elephants (which
were faithful to their own side) made a horrid execution on the <hi>Roman
Velites,</hi> whom they Chased through the Intervals of the <hi>Maniples;</hi> yet did
the Battalions no prejudice, by that excellent prevention of the Consuls,
which I formerly mention'd: but divers of those moving Castles being at
length much wounded, turn'd head, and ran furiously upon their own
right wing, and thereby gave <hi>Lelius</hi> the same advantage which they had
presented <hi>Massanissa,</hi> and which he as well improv'd as the <hi>Numidian</hi> King.
In the mean time the Battalions of Foot of either Army advanc'd, with a
slow and confident march, till they came within shot, but then giving a
shout which made the Neighbouring hills to tremble, they ran against each
other with a fury worthy their dispute; at first, the barbarous strength of
the Mercenaries prevail'd over the <hi>Roman</hi> virtue, but at length the <hi>Roman</hi>
discipline, and resolution, wrought its accustomed effect; for the <hi>Principes</hi>
by sustaining the <hi>Hastati,</hi> reliev'd their fear, and disorder; but as soon as
the Mercenaries retreated, the new-rais'd <hi>Africans</hi> had not the courage to
second them, which the other sattributing as much to their treachery, as
fear, began to flie; but not being able to run away but through the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ricans,</hi> those either to punish, or hinder their Cowardize,
would not permit them that way of safety. On the other side, the <hi>Gaules,</hi>
and <hi>Lygurians,</hi> by not being seconded, and by then being oppos'd, thought
themselves betray'd; and esteeming it a more pleasing Revenge to destroy
their false Friends, than their valiant Enemies, made use of those Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which they had taken up for them; which disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Romans</hi> soon ended, by involving both Parties almost in a general
ruine. I have (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) the more insisted on this part of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
to vindicate the justice of the Gods: for these Forces were those only
which had broke their Faith, and Peace; and they only were those against
whom Fortune so visibly fought, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were convinc'd Victory
was on their side, because Justice was; and indeed they acted their success
with so much ease, that it appear'd the work of the gods, and not of men.
But all this while <hi>Hannibal</hi> with his <hi>Italian</hi> Army stood firm, and charged his
Pikes and Launces against those Cowards which sought their safety in their
feet, so that they were necessitated to seek their deliverance in that, by
which they had thitherto found it. <hi>Scipio</hi> perceiving those gallant Troops,
with as little fear in their looks, as hearts, <hi>Hannibal</hi> too at the head of them,
and the ground over which he was to march, slippery with blood, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd
with dead carcasses, was in a great apprehension, whether march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such an obstructed way, his Battalions might not be disorder'd before
he came, where he was confident they would most stand in need of their
discipline and virtue; but after a short debate with himself, (for he was
blest with an excellent presence of mind) not to lose the victorious heat
his Soldiers were in, he commanded the <hi>Hastati</hi> to wade slowly through
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96335:106"/>
that Sea of blood, and (as I may say) as soon as they were Landed, to
draw up all in Front, and if <hi>Hannibal</hi> offer'd to assault them before the
<hi>Principes,</hi> and the <hi>Triarii</hi> were come up, immediately to retreat into that
purple flood they had made, where the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> might share the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of the ground, and where the dead <hi>Africans</hi> would assume
the quarrel of the gods, and hinder the living. But these directions,
though they abundantly manifested the Consuls Soldiery, yet there was no
use of them; for <hi>Hannibal</hi> either disdaining all advantages from those
dead, that when living had afforded him none, the better to set off the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his old Army, or the distance being too great to advance and charge
the <hi>Hastati,</hi> before their companions came, made that great man decline it,
and so <hi>Scipio</hi> had time to draw his <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> on the right and
left Flank of his <hi>Hastati;</hi> which was no sooner effected, than he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
advanc'd to charge an Army, who never saw any defeats but those

the precedent fight against the <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> appear not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
that name; for the <hi>Romans,</hi> encouraged with their numbers and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and their Enemies inflam'd with the loss of their companions, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their Empire, and perhaps with the glory of having the general
safety left to their Swords, so mutually fill'd all places with blood and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
that I may truly say, the World was well disputed, and Victory was so
equally and generously courted, that she knew not which side to elect;
whereby you may in some sort conjecture, what hazard the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
was reduc'd unto, by the too violent pursuit of <hi>Massanissa</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi> which
I may truly say, I first discover'd, and first made them sensible of; for whilst
we were following those whose low resistance made them unworthy our
Arms, we abandon'd those, whose resolutions merited our assistance, and
whose condition needed it. <hi>Massanissa</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi> were so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
my confidence, that they acknowledg'd their fault, and after the
Battel, confest unto the Consul, that he deriv'd his relief from my care,
(this I tell you, not to acquaint you with my virtue, but to shew you how
secure they were in their own.) I will omit (generous <hi>Spartacus</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
you, how that day I kill'd two <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Hannibal,</hi> by deluding me into a false Revenge, deluded themselves
into a real death.</p>
               <p>It is time to return to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who, perhaps, we have too long abandon'd
in our Story, as well as in the Battel; that great man, at our arrival with
all our Horse, was upon the point of losing a Victory, by our having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
one too far. To be brief, our return was most happy, and in a
needful time; for the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had so well continu'd his practice, that
he had left Forces enough to prosecute his dawning success, and drew a
considerable Body (as well for their number, as virtue) to oppose <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanissa</hi>
and <hi>Lelius;</hi> and that which made this little Army the more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
was, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself lead them: the gallantry of the charge
was proportionate to the Soldiers and Generals, and we were no sooner
mingled, then I sought him amongst the press, who had promis'd to be
found at the head of his Troops; but I was soon reliev'd from that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
by a voice which I heard often repeat my name, I ran with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
joy to the place where I was call'd, in hope that it might be <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal;</hi>
I soon found 'twas no third counterfeit, as well by that majestick
grace he had under his arms, as by the fury of his blows, which I imagined
could not be inspir'd but from Revenge and Jealousie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:96335:107"/>Our Javelins working no effect (mine glancing upon his shield, flew
between his right Arm and his Body, and his past hissing by my ears) we
soon made use of our Swords, and were so equally animated, that our rage
for awhile hinder'd the actings of it; but not to hold you long in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
which did not last so, after we had almost cut in pieces those Armors,
whose goodness we mutually curst, and that we had by light wounds drawn
of each others blood, <hi>Hannibal</hi> who apprehended, that by playing too
much the part of a Soldier, he should as much neglect that of the General,
determin'd by a powerful reverse to end both the dispute, and his life, that
was the cause of it; but what he design'd for that effect, might have had a
contrary one, for the blow was so vigorous, that by chance lighting upon a
piece of my Helmet, it broke the Sword that struck it, and left nothing in
<hi>Hannibal</hi>'s hand but the Hilt: Though a piece of the Sword gave me a
deep wound in my left shoulder, yet I no sooner saw my Enemy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
than my Anger was so too; but the object of it perceiving his misfortune,
was so far from being terrified with it, that observing I declin'd prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my advantage, he told me, Why dost thou not (<hi>Perolla</hi>) embrace an
opportunity which Fortune has offer'd thee, since thou canst never expect
an advantage over me, but on such a score? Those words mov'd me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but not so much as his condition; so that laying aside <hi>Izadora</hi>'s wrongs,
my Countries, and my own, I reply'd, 'Tis not (<hi>Hannibal</hi>) from Fortune,
but from Justice, that I will derive my Revenge; for since I undertake to
vindicate an injur'd Innocency, I must make use of no wayes, but those as
virtuous as the Subject of my quarrel: Thy attempt on my life by <hi>Oristes,</hi>
when I could make no resistance, I condemned and therefore will not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
a resembling Crime; since to imitate so low a sin, were rather to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize,
than punish it: Go then, and at our next meeting get a better
Cause, as well as Sword; for if the first be the same, the latter will be the
like. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nnibal</hi> made me some Reply, which by the tone I imagin'd was
very civil, but I gallopt away from him, ending those words, (lest he
might conjecture I obliged him, to make him my Friend, and lest some <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
might have made a more fatal use of my advantage) and joined my
self with <hi>Massanissa,</hi> who had perform'd miracles that day, which (in a
word) concluded with an entire defeat of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> 22000 being
left dead upon the place, and almost half as many Prisoners taken. <hi>Scipio</hi>
in the midst of his Troops, (upon <hi>Lelius</hi> and the <hi>Numidian</hi> Kings infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation)
came and embrac'd me with transports which were too great ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be related, or believed, and then ask'd me, whether I had met with
my own and our Empires greatest Enemy? I told him I had, and exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
some blows with him, but that we were soon separated. This I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
but durst not acquaint him with the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e truth, lest he might
have esteemed that an offence to <hi>Rome,</hi> which I was certain was not one to
Gallantry; and on the other side, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> either not to own his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
or out of an apprehension, that the discovering of his safety, might
endanger him that gave it, ever kept it private, which was the cause that
so great a truth was not a publick one. In this great Battel of <hi>Nadagara,</hi>
or (as some called it) of <hi>Zama,</hi> was determined the fate of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
though <hi>Hannibal</hi> avoided that dayes ruine, having performed all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of a General and Soldier; and where to speak the truth, 'twas (as
he said) more the gods, than the <hi>Romans,</hi> that won it, for his two wings
of Horse were routed by his own Elephants; and had he been blest with
their return, as <hi>Scipio</hi> was with <hi>Massanissa</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi>'s, he had probably
prosecuted that advantage over the Consul, which their arrival forc'd from
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96335:107"/>
him; Many who knew his temper, admir'd, and ask'd him, why he
out-liv'd that loss? to which he reply'd, That the <hi>Romans</hi> might not
too-much glory in it, for to destroy <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> in one
day, would have made them proud with more justice, than they could
be condemn'd for being so; that to deprive his Countrey of himself,
was to doe more against them than <hi>Scipio</hi> had, who might lay too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
a Peace upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> if they had lost <hi>Hannibal</hi> and their Army;
that it would have made his Countreys condition appear more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
than it was, if he had lost the courage of not seeing it, and that
perhaps, the pride of <hi>Carthage</hi> might be her ruine, in not making a Peace,
when the gods had abandon'd her, which he knew she would embrace,
when <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself advis'd her to it. These reasons were as true as
lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty, and to evince they were not excuses but realities, he went to
<hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>age</hi> with a celerity that manifested his concernment, which place
he had not seen from his Childhood, and where he was receiv'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Virtue, not Success. There he besought them to
leave off their Tryumphs, since the gods had left off giving them the
occasions; and that immediately they would conclude a Peace with
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and so preserve something by a capitulation, lest they lost all by
declining one. A Senator call'd <hi>Gesco,</hi> who thought it a manifestation
of Courage indeed, to shew some, in a season when <hi>Hannibal</hi> had lost it,
began to incite the Senate to a new War, by the example of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
had lost her Empire, had she lost her resolution, and that they wanted
only a <hi>Roman</hi> success, by wanting a <hi>Roman</hi> Magnanimity. But <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
inrag'd to hear those discourse of War, who were as ignorant of,
as unfit for so dangerous a profession; and were only like Trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that set Men by the Ears by their breath, but never fight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
arose from his Seat, and pull'd down <hi>Gesco</hi> out of his; which the
Senate resenting, <hi>Hannibal</hi> (as the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> has told you) so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
excus'd himself by his zeal for his Countreys safety, and so Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
declaim'd upon the making of a Peace, that he obtain'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for the former, and invited them to embrace the latter; This was
the cause that the Consul sailing towards <hi>Carthage,</hi> was met by a Gally
loaden with <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors, who bearing up with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
and using the gesture of Suppliants, were commanded to wait
for an answer at <hi>Tunis,</hi> where the Consul arriv'd (after having brav'd
the proudest City of the world with his Fleet) and where he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd
that <hi>Vermina,</hi> the Son of <hi>Syphax</hi> was advancing towards <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
with a good body of Horse, either to bring the fate of that City
to a new Tryal, and Field, or protract her ruine, by flinging himself
within her Walls. This Allarm the Consul receiv'd as the means of an
infallible accession to his Glory; and because he had employ'd <hi>Lelius</hi> to
<hi>Rome,</hi> with the news of his Victory, and that <hi>Massanissa</hi> in the gaining
of it, had receiv'd some wounds, which might have render'd his march
against <hi>Vermina,</hi> more dangerous than the Combate, <hi>Scipio</hi> sent for me,
and though I believe he elected me, because of those two great Mens
being uncapable of then acting; yet with a flattering Complement he
assur'd me, his choice was the effect of his judgement, and not his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that he commanded me to go against this <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince,
who by his largest intelligence, was not above 8000; that he had select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me 4000 choice Horse for this Expedition, suplying the defects of
their numbers, by the Gallantry which compos'd them, and that he gave
me so few, that my courage might be the more conspicuous. I will not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96335:108"/>
tell you in what words I cloath'd my Gratitude, I rather was covetous to
express it by my actions, which the sooner to perform, I went to the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous,
where I found my little Army ready to march: I would not loose
that good disposition they were in, but having assur'd them, I was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
of the Consuls injustice in putting me at their head, as any of them
could be, and that I knew them so perfectly, that I would make less scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Serve under, than Command over them: I immediately sent out my
Forlorn-Hope, which had not march'd Ten miles, e're they return'd me
word, that they had discover'd the Enemy, which could not be less than
15000 Horse. I told the Messenger, that sure they had seen with multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eyes, but yet the greater the number was, the greater the Glory,
and then desir'd my Body to continue their march a Foot-pace,
and with twenty Horse I gallop'd to the place where my Adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers
were, where again they confirm'd their first intelligence, but
<hi>Vermina</hi> had so cover'd his Army, that I could not possibly satisfy my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity,
by my Eyes, without beating in a Body of 500 <hi>Numidians,</hi> which
I elected with my 250, and perform'd. The fruits of that little success, was
the discovery of our Enemies Army, which I found, was rather contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than multiplied by my first Intelligences, this had startl'd me, but that I
perceiv'd in my little Troop, an augmentation of Courage, by that of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and in them I found the pattern of the residue, to whom I retreated
all the way in view of the Enemy, that prest us in all things well, but in
success. By that time we came in sight of our Body, the Sun was sett, and
<hi>Vermina</hi> perceiving so many Horse, took them for the Van of the Consuls
Army, (that too, which fortify'd his belief, was, his own strength, and
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s care of Intelligence:) in this faith he makes a stand, and judging of
the Cause of it, I resolv'd, whilst he was in so terrifying a belief to improve
it to the best advantage, in order to which I sent a Soldier of mine, (as if
he had fled from me) to let <hi>Vermina</hi> know, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was defeated,
and shut up within the Walls of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and that all the <hi>Roman</hi> Army
was ready to make him a companion of his Fortune, as well as of his Cause;
this advertisement was given just as I fell on, which was an hour before day,
for I would not give it him sooner, lest he might have retir'd, and had the
benefit of the whole night to favour his retreat; I sent also advertisement
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> of what I had discover'd, and that he might think 'twas my
Duty, and not my Fear produc'd it, before I had any return or additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Forces, I began the Battel. The obscurity, the news of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
and the belief, that we were all the victorious <hi>Roman</hi> Army, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
contributed to our advantage, though the <hi>Numidians</hi> so resolutely
disputed the difference, that above 14300 found their Graves, where they
thought to have found their success, but <hi>Vermina</hi> himself was none of that
number; my loss was about 900, and I receiv'd a slight hurt in the self same
place that <hi>Hannibals</hi> Sword had made one, which was in effect, but opening
a little wider, that which was not yet well clos'd up, and consolidated.
But the Allarm of the <hi>Numidian</hi> strength no sooner came to the Consul (who
was then visiting <hi>Massanissa</hi>) than that valiant Prince, who merited a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from <hi>Rome,</hi> though he had had no Title to one, caus'd himself to be led
to his Horse, and though <hi>Scipio</hi> earnestly disswaded him from so dangerous
a Gallantry, yet with all the rest of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, and some Foot, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to my assistance. I know not whether their appearance was any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to my little Army, (for they came in sight assoon as we could see) but I am
sure their actions were not, for they saw us Conquerors asson as they
perceiv'd us: and their generous Commander, to give those entirely the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96335:108"/>
glory that had won it, would not so much as permit his Soldiers to follow
the Execution, or to share in that spoil, which had been purchas'd at the
expence of our Bloud. Indeed the Pillage was great, and their civility
too which had got it, for they brought me a proportion, that might have
as much satisfy'd my avarice, as the cause of their being so liberal, did my
honor; and though I accepted their Present, it was only to deny them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for immediately I had it all divided amongst those Soldiers, whose
wounds disenabled them to seize upon what they had purchas'd by them;
This just distribution wrought so powerfully on all the rest, that they
thought I had only perform'd that action, to shew them what they had
omitted, and in that belief, they made amongst themselves new Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of as great a value as the former, which they begg'd me passionately
to accept, for (as they alledg'd) 'twas unjust I should devest my self
of what was my due, to repair their fault; This Gallantry from common
Men was extraordinary, and if I have insisted so long upon't, 'twas to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with theirs, not my own. To conclude this business, I declin'd
the repetition of their Civility, and though it were in terms, as obliging
as I was capable of, yet I found to have left them rich, was to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
them. <hi>Massanissa,</hi> after we had ended the Execution, came to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
me, and to be civil, he was so unjust as to protest, that though
<hi>Rome</hi> had made him a King, and <hi>Scipio</hi> gave him the Crown, yet 'twas
I (by <hi>Vermina</hi>'s defeat) that had given him the Kingdom. I did not answer
this Complement, lest he might believe I was so vain as to think I had a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to it. I cannot tell you (generous <hi>Spartacus,</hi>) all the Tryumphs an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Joys at the Armies return, since alas, I was torn from them by a storm,
greater than the reception the Consul prepar'd for us; for as I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two miles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, a Stranger (having drawn me aside as I
was riding with the <hi>Numidian</hi> King) told me, if I were at leasure to hear
him, he had something of high concernment for me from <hi>Izadora,</hi> who
had expresly sent him. That fair Name surpriz'd me, and made me use the
Ambassador from such a perfection, with Civilities, that manifested the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
I paid her: after a thousand embraces I told him, Yes my dear Friend
if you come from the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> I am not only at leasure to hear you,
but to desert all the Glory of the Earth for that of obeying her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
You will (said the Messenger) somewhat confounded with those
Civilities, at the head of the Army) receive them in this Paper, which I
took with a transcendent greediness and devotion, and having open'd it,
found it contain'd these words:</p>

or to Death, if the former will have me, he must return suddainly, or
he will find I am in the possession of the latter, lose no time then (generous
Friend) since the least dealy will leave you nothing to love of <hi>Izadora,</hi> but
her Memory and her Constancy.</p>

               <p>No no (I cry'd out) fair <hi>Izadora</hi> (having twice read this Letter) I will
lose no time, but go and relieve you from your Fathers Tyranny, or by
my death, remove the cause of it; then turning to the Messenger, I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96335:109"/>
told him, come (my Friend) I am ready to obey you, and <hi>Izadora</hi>'s
Commands, and the gods knowing the justice of my obedience, will
doubtless contribute to so necessary a duty. Sir (he reply'd) methink,
as yet they do not favour your desires, for they have ty'd you to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
a Tryumph, and confin'd you to <hi>Affrick,</hi> by an opposite wind.
Alas (said I, interrupting him) how ill thou understandest me, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Triumphs or the Empire of the World, can one minute suspend
my serving the fair <hi>Izadora:</hi> Nor those, nor the Winds shall stop me a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I'll force the Sea to be my Friend or Ruine, by perishing, in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Duty. Let us go then; (reply'd <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Servant) That Gally
which transported me, is now at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and expects but our return; she
has a gallant Ginge, and nothing but a storm great enough to swallow us,
shall hinder our arrival in <hi>Italy.</hi> Thou rejoycest me (I reply'd) for the
best fortune next to our intended Harbor, is a wrack: go then and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
all things, that we may set to Sea within this hour, for before that
time be expir'd, I'll be aboard. The faithful Messenger without reply, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop'd
away, and in an instant, in a cloud of Dust we lost sight of him. But
my Passion for her that merited a higher, was so great, that till the fair
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s Servant was gone, I took no notice that <hi>Massanissa</hi> and all the
Army had made a stand, whilst I was receiving so fatal an intelligence;
to repair their rudeness (which nothing could excuse but the cause of it)
I rid up to the <hi>Numidian</hi> King, besought him, and who had known the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Love, from the fair <hi>Sophonisba</hi>'s Eyes, to pardon those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a resembling perfection. That generous Prince, at the name
of <hi>Sophonisba</hi> look'd pale, and sigh'd, and then told me, he was sadly skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough in the operation of Beauty, not only to excuse what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
but was bound by his knowledge of those effects, to offer all his
assistance to them; and therefore he begg'd me to make use of five excellent
Gallies of his, which lay ready behind the Promontory of <hi>Carthage,</hi> well
mann'd, both for the Oar and the Sword; that if <hi>Blacius</hi> continu'd his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
I might have wherewithal to disingage <hi>Izadora</hi> from it, and that
I should find a plentiful Sanctuary in his Kingdom, which was at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
by my having reduc'd it to his. This transcendent Civility I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd,
with all the submission I was capable of, and assur'd him, that it was
by more humble Arms than those he had so generously offer'd me, that I
would vanquish <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Father; but since by what he had mention'd, he
gave me the confidence to implore something of him, I would make use
of those humble Prayers, to beseech him to Apologize for me to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
for my i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stant departure, since an hours delay might be the Eternal
ruine of a Virtue, greater than ever yet had shin'd on earth; that my crime
was the more extenuated by my resigning those Forces he trusted me with,
to the great <hi>Massanissa</hi>'s care, and after they had obey'd his Commands.
That virtuous Prince undertook what I implor'd, and bid me not doubt
but <hi>Scipio</hi> would listen to all excuses of Love from him, but to those which
concern'd himself: he spoke these last words in high disorders, which the
Consuls sad Commands concerning the fair <hi>Sophonisba</hi> had created. From
<hi>Massanissa</hi> I went to make my excuse to those Troops I had commanded,
who exprest as much sadness for the cause of my departure, as for my aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
them. Some of them were so gallant, as to offer me their Swords
and Lives, (which they might dispose of, being all Voluntiers.) I would not
make use of so obliging a proffer, but having declin'd it upon the same score
I had <hi>Massanissa</hi>'s, I immediately took leave, and only follow'd by <hi>Strato,</hi> I
soon lost sight of the Army, and recover'd <hi>Tunis,</hi> where I found my Gally
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96335:109"/>
had weigh'd Anchor, and stay'd upon her Oars for my arrival. As soon
as I came aboard, I animated the Slaves by Gifts, and Promises of exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
rewards, and in the joy of those hopes, they chearfully began the
voyage; but we had not crost half the Sea, which separates <hi>Carthage</hi> from
<hi>Naples,</hi> when a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urious Northern wind began to whistle so hollow, and so
loud, that though it rais'd a storm of it self, yet we knew it was but the
fore-runner of a greater, which soon follow'd, with such extremity, that
the Mariners, and Slaves, were as much troubled as the Sea, and as deaf
to all my Prayers, of continuing their Navigation, as the Wind. But at
length, finding the Pilot had put the Gally before the Wind, and was
steering for <hi>Tunis,</hi> I ran to him, and presenting my Sword to his Breast,
I vow'd by many horrid Oaths, that if he did not change his Course,
whatever become of the Gally, he should immediately receive his Fate.
That which too increast the horror, was an Ecclipse of the Moon, which
those Superstitious ignorant Souls, attributed to a divine forewarning of
their wrack, and not to a natural Cause; but I had (whilst study was my
employment) so great propensity to Astronomy, and made some such
progress in it, that I knew perfectly the cause and duration of Eclipses, and
having by a former calculation found out how long this would continue,
what with my threatenings, what with my engagements to them, that if
the Moon did not recover her former Luster (which I said she had only
lost, in horror, and detestation of their fear) within three hours, I would
be content to return with them: I made the trembling Pilot tack about,
and the gods of the Wind, and Sea, with the Queen of Love, who sprung
from that Element, so favour'd my resolution (which had for end, the
relieving of a Beauty as fair as she, and which presented her more votaries
than all the residue of her Sex) that after the Moon within the time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
had assum'd her former light, by a friendly South Wind, we safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arriv'd in two days at <hi>Naples;</hi> where leaving <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Servant, next
night I came Post to this City, but in disguise, lest the rumour of my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
might prejudice the intention of it. Immediatly after I lighted, I
went towards <hi>Blacius</hi>'s House, to learn by what intelligence I could get,
how to form my resolutions; and though there was no light in the streets,
but what the Lamps of the Shops and Windows did afford, yet as I was
passing by that House <hi>Pacuvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> us'd to dwell in; I heard a Gentleman
that stood at the door, tell his Companion, either I am infinitely mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or that is <hi>Perolla</hi> which is going by; t'other being of his opinion, they
immediately follow'd, and overtook me, and so confidently call'd me by
my name, that I could not well deny it; neither indeed would I at any
time have deny'd it to them for they were two of those intimate Friends,
which had helpt me to force <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Prisons, when <hi>Blacius</hi> was in them.
I was as much astonisht at the weakness of my disguise, as to find my friends
without any, in a place where <hi>Blacius</hi> commanded, but they silenc'd that
wonder by a greater; their assurance that my Father was too in <hi>Salapia;</hi>
That the Senate, (after <hi>Hannibals</hi> abandoning <hi>Italy</hi>) had sent him a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for his Estate and Life, and were so generous, as to attribute that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to those services (they said) his Son had done their Empire: That
the Garison of <hi>Salapia</hi> was disbanded, and things were in the same posture
they had been in, before the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> crost the <hi>Alps.</hi> All this I heard
with astonishment, but being uncapable of any concern, but my greatest,
I conjur'd my Friends to preserve me unknown, to provide me a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Lodging in one of their Houses, and to permit me awhile to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
an intended design. All this (but the last) they promis'd, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96335:110"/>
to know the scope of that, they begg'd me passionately to be sharers
(and serve me) in it: this I as passionately declin'd, and having taken a
hasty leave of them, I went alone directly to <hi>Blaciu</hi>'s House, which find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open, (guided by my Ear) I came into a large room, almost fill'd
with company, that then were Dancing a Ball, and where the croud of
Lookers on was so thick, that for a good while I could not come to see
those particulars that compos'd it; but as soon as I did, the first object I
saw, was <hi>Izadora,</hi> drest in all the shinings of a Bride, and with a Face as
full of content, as 'twas of Charms. Judge (Sir) continu'd <hi>Perolla,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my Prince) what a perplexity this sight did cast me into, but after
the first disorders of it was lessen'd, imagining what I knew to be a reality,
was an illusion, I enquir'd of a Gentleman that stood by me, what was the
occasion of so celebrated a meeting: He (without considering any thing
but my Cloaths) answer'd me briskly; of what Countrey art thou Friend,
that art ignorant of it? I told him I was one that dwelt not far off, and
that passing along the Street, having heard excellent Musick, I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
my Ear to guide me, and was come to hear it, but finding some
things that pleas'd my Eyes as well, I was desirous to satisfy them too, and
by his favour to learn their Names that did it. Since thou art a Stranger
indeed (he reply'd) I will, to the best of my knowledge, inform thy cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
assoon as thou acquaintest me with it. I would then (said I) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you to tell me, who that Gentleman is which goes so richly drest,
and that becomes his Cloaths so well? 'Tis (he reply'd) <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who
is this night to possess that Beauty (pointing at <hi>Izadora</hi>) which cannot
be greater than his merit. Oh gods (said <hi>Perolla,</hi> interupting himself) you
only know my disorders at so fatal an intelligence, but lest the Gentleman
should, the better to conceal them, I begg'd him to let me know that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Name? 'Tis <hi>Izadora</hi> (he reply'd) I have heard (said I) that <hi>Izadora,</hi>
(if this be the same) was so engag'd to <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Son, both by Inclination
and Services, that he only should have married her. 'Twas, the Gentleman
answer'd, generally believ'd so, and I am sure her Father has been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
oblig'd to him, to make the gift of his Daughter the evincement
of his Gratitude; but either her Inconstancy, or <hi>Blacius</hi>'s hatred, is the
cause of these Nuptials, though for my part, I attribute them to the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for methinks her Face is too full of joy, to believe her Heart is possest
with a contrary passion; yet believe me, Friend (he continu'd) this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
will end in Tears, for I know <hi>Perolla</hi>'s courage too well, to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what his resentments will be in such an affront, and therefore I
could gladly wish the gallant <hi>Flaminius</hi> had plac'd his Passion on an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as fit for that honour in all things, as this is in Beauty. I could not
hear these sad words, without some sighs stealing from my Breast, which
he that caus'd them, observing, ask'd me the occasion. I told him coldly,
'twas to find that the god's bestow'd the blessing of Beauty, without that
of Constancy, which was in effect to lay snares for Mens destruction; but
to take him off from considering me, and to learn whether there were any
suspitions, or belief of my being in <hi>Salapia,</hi> I besought him to tell me
where <hi>Parolla</hi> was, for I could not but think it strange, if her were a Man
of Courage, that he did not employ his, to vindicate such a wrong Alas
(he reply'd) the poor Gentleman I believe, is so happy, as to be ignorant
of his misfortune: He is now in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>frick,</hi> where he has obtain'd within these
few days, a great Victory against <hi>Vermina</hi> (the Son of <hi>Syphax</hi>) who it
seems, is successor to his Fathers misfortunes, and consequently not to his
Kingdom: this I was even now told by a Gentleman that came from the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96335:110"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Camp before <hi>Perolla</hi> was return'd unto it, who I believe when he
hears <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Inconstancy, will curse his Fate, that he did not find his
Death, where he found his Victory; but I am still of opinion, that he
which takes <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Mirtles, whilst he is gathering Laurel, will shortly find
them turn'd to Cyprus, unless the forsaken Lover will esteem <hi>Flaminius</hi>
possessing a Woman of as much Inconstancy, as Beauty, a sufficient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
I cannot tell you the disorders I was in at these strange discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but I can perfectly tell you, that had not he which made them, been
more intent in considering the company, than to whom they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest,
he had certainly discover'd me; but as I was about to retire to form
my resolutions, (which I could not do whilst I saw <hi>Izadora,</hi> and <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>)
I heard a fresh Consort of Musick, which presently usher'd in a
Youth in a Saffron Coat, a Crown of Roses on his Head, and an unlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Torch of Pine in his Hand. This I knew was a representation of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who is the Deity of our <hi>Italian</hi> Nuptials, and his appearing made
me soon learn, that the intended Marriage was suddainly to be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.
I withdrew my self in the horror of such a sight, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
<hi>Callione (Izadora</hi>'s Confident) was not amongst the other Ladies,
being perfectly knowing in the passages of <hi>Blacius</hi> House, I stole up to her
Chamber, to be inform'd of my destiny; for though I saw her fair Mistriss
(as it were) in my Rivals Arms and Embraces, yet I attributed my mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all Causes, rather than to her Infidelity; which if by a miracle I
should learn from <hi>Callione,</hi> she was capable of, I was determin'd to change
the Marriage into a Funeral, by killing the Bridegroom first, and then his
Murtherer at <hi>Izadora</hi>'s feet. But Madam (continu'd <hi>Perolla,</hi> with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gesture, and accent) though I have as often begg'd and obtain'd your
pardon for this Crime, as I have mention'd it, yet I must still continue
that practice; for to think 'twas in the power of a miracle for you to be
one, in any thing but Perfection, is a sin greater than all things, but the
Mercy which has forgiven it: In confidence that you have so again, which
I implore with an humility as transcendent as my offence, I will prosecute
my Relation, which was so necessarily interrupted at my going to <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>'s
Chamber, where finding the Door shut, but not lock'd, I gently
open'd it, and looking in, perceiv'd there was no Light in the Chamber,
but that there was some in a Closset contiguous to it; thither I softly went
and looking through a Crevice of the Door, I saw <hi>Callione</hi> leaning upon
the Table, with a Bole befor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her, over which she wept Tears enough to
have fill'd it: so high a melancholly in a House where nothing (any where
else) was visible but joy, extreamly surpriz'd me; but I was much more
when I heard her say to her self; What <hi>Callione,</hi> canst thou then be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to <hi>Izadora,</hi> when thy Fidelity is a Crime? and when she makes use of
thy affection for so fatal an end, as to become her Murtherer? No, no,
<hi>Perolla</hi> doubtless will be more satisfied to find her in the Arms of <hi>Flammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
than in those of Death; especially since her being the former, was her
misfortune, not her design: He will too console himself in the knowledge
of my Treachery, and pardon it, since 'twas to preserve, what his delay
only ruin'd: but (alas, she continu'd, after a small silence) thou speak'st
<hi>Callione,</hi> as if hind'ring her Fate in this Nuptial Bole, would hinder it till
the hand of Age impos'd it: No, she that has resolution enough to receive
Poison into her Breast, will not want it to plant a Ponyard there, when
the first has fail'd: What wilt thou do then, unfortunate <hi>Callione?</hi> to
obey thy Mistriss is to become her Executioner, and not to do it, is to
make her become her own, after the gods too (by a Holy tye) has left
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96335:111"/>
her no disposal of her self, and thereby must act her murther, by almost
as high a Sin; she must dye too, <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s and not <hi>Perolla</hi>'s, and must
detest thee as much as she will Life. Oh gods (<hi>Callione</hi> continu'd) you
that have brought me into this Labyrinth, lead me out of it, and do not
destroy a perfection, which suppresses Atheism, for nothing can create, but
must be more perfect than what it creates, and to be more perfect than <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
is to be without doubt a Deity. The fair <hi>Calliones</hi>'s Tears for a while,
interrupted her words, but the confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion they wrought in me (I attest, the
same gods she invok'd) was so great, that I was in hope, what betwixt
that and grief, I should never more have been capable of any: but those
that form our Destinies, made not mine so favourable, for they render'd
my Heart stronger than my Misery, and by that time they had perfectly
restor'd me my Senses, I heard <hi>Callione</hi> thus assume her discourse. Yes fair
<hi>Izadora,</hi> I will obey your Commands, the Nuptial Cup shall be poison'd,
but you shall not take it, for I will go and acquaint <hi>Blacius</hi> with your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves,
who shall hinder them in such way, that you will attribute his care,
rather to his doubts, than knowledge; perhaps your despair may more
work on him, than your Tears have done, and when he finds you elect
Death before <hi>Flamminius,</hi> he may let <hi>Perolla</hi> supply his place. No <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>
(I reply'd, knocking at the door) <hi>Perolla</hi> knows the gods, and <hi>Izadora</hi>
too well, to believe the former have ordain'd me the latter; if I am come,
'tis to contribute to, not interrupt the Marriage. Yes, yes, I am resolv'd to
give <hi>Izadora</hi> up all her vows, they have been too much her torment, for
me to continue their possession; but if she be too generous to receive them
by a resignation, I will present them to her by my death. <hi>Callione</hi> hearing
my voice, (after a little trembling,) open'd the Door, and her Eyes had
no sooner confirm'd the Intelligence of her Ears, than she cry'd out; Is it
you indeed <hi>Perolla,</hi> alas, what Tears has your absence cost us? you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
guess them, but by the joy of your return, which revives my hopes,
for the gods are not so cruel to send you to be a spectator, but a reliever
of our Miseries. Thereupon, after some other discourses of this quality, to
satisfy my intreaties, she told me; That <hi>Flamminius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman,
who had no fault, but too transcendent a Passion for <hi>Izadora,</hi> had seen her
one day in the Temple, where from adoring an invisible Deity, he ador'd a
mortal of as much perfection; and being as great in the Riches of Fortune,
as of Nature, had by some Senators (expresly come from <hi>Rome</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
his alliance to <hi>Blacius,</hi> who meeting in him all things worthy it,
and your absence contributing a favourable opportunity, greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
the motion, and <hi>Flamminius</hi> began his addresses, with so charming
a Grace, and Humility, that nothing transcended both, but <hi>Izadora</hi>'s
Constancy, which is not to be extinguish'd, but with her Life. I cannot
tell you how diligent she was to discover an imperfection in her Servant,
that might have render'd her declining him, an action of as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to her Father, as it was to her: 'tis too much you know, that though
she had you for her pattern, I tell you, said <hi>Perolla,</hi> her flattering expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
yet she could find no fault in him, but that in which he resembl'd you
most; I mean the greatness, and unmoveableness of his Love; in this
misfortune, to declare the good opinion she had of his Virtue, and to be
convinc'd of the reality of it by an experiment, one day she freely acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with all your Loves, and how fully he might be satisfi'd of the fixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Passion, since he could not remove it; that therefore she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd
him to render that an effect of his Generosity, which else would be
one of her Constancy; and that he would turn his Love into Friendship,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96335:111"/>
since she was as ambitious of that, as uncapable of the other. These words
so mov'd the generous <hi>Flamminius,</hi> that his Bloud ran all to preserve the
seat of Life, his Eyes were fix'd in his Head, his Tongue was moveless, and
suddainly he fell so at <hi>Izador</hi>'s feet, who in a fright, ran out, and call'd
me in to her assistance; both ours prov'd so powerful, that after a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour, <hi>Flamminius</hi> came to himself, and having immediately
begg'd <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Pardon for the incivility of his indisposition, he only
told her; That either He or Death would obey her Commands; and then
retir'd to his Lodging, where, what reasons he rais'd against his Passion, I
am ignorant of, though not of the strange effects they produc'd, for two
or three days after, he came to visit <hi>Izadora,</hi> where he was hardly known,
and where constantly afterwards, if she were alone, he never mention'd
any thing of his Passion, but would only look fix'dly upon her, fold his
Arms, and groan, and say he was not yet Conqueror. But if <hi>Blacius</hi> were
there, he would court <hi>Izadora</hi> with a countenance as full of joy, as his
heart was empty of it, and if he admir'd at <hi>Flamminius</hi> pining away, he
protested 'twas an inward disease, but not one of the mind, nor of <hi>Izado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
neglect. This was his practice for twenty days, the Night of the last,
he came again to visit <hi>Izadora,</hi> and in Sighs, and some Tears, implor'd
his Pardon for his Passion, Importunities, and so long disobedience; and
protested that he would shortly so vindicate her, on himself, that she
should acknowledge her Interests, and satisfaction, were much dearer to him,
than his own. <hi>Flamminius</hi> after those assurances without any more words,
immediately withdrew himself, and the next intelligence we had of him,
was, that he kept his Bed, of a disease, whose nature the Physitians were
as ignorant of, as of the cure; and that though <hi>Blacius,</hi> by many reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and passionate conjurations, begg'd again to know, whether <hi>Izadora</hi>'s
coldness were not the efficient cause of his sickness, yet he could never
receive any other answer, but that she was not, at least if the gods impos'd
not that affliction on him, for so aspiring a Passion. Six days <hi>Flamminius</hi>
Feaver was so violent, that he despair'd not the Seventh (which in that
disease was the first critical day) but to be able to obey <hi>Izadora.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
calling to him a Page of his, who was his Confident, he commanded
him to bring him some Paper, on which, (though with much difficulty)
he writes these few lines;</p>

in Death, since 'tis the effect of my obedience, than I can in life, having lost the

               <p>THis Letter being seal'd, he commanded the faithful Youth, by all
the strictest tyes he could invent, to deliver it with his own hands,
and without any witness, to her to whom it was addrest; For if <hi>Blacius,</hi>
or any other, discover'd what it contain'd, he should spend those few hours
he had to live, inso much despair, and horror, that those torments would
almost equal <hi>Izadora</hi>'s hate. Judge (<hi>Perolla</hi>) if ever Gallantry was rais'd
to a greater height, than to have so particular a care for the preservation of
one's own destruction, and whether you have not cause to glory in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Beauty, which could produce such rare effects, and in a Constancy that
was not mov'd with them; at least, no further than Pity could extend. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96335:112"/>
(continu'd <hi>Perolla) Callione</hi>'s words only with a deep sigh, that the
reflection of having been cursed with one Rival, too full of Power, and
another too full of Virtue, drew from me, which made her thus continue.
But though the circumspection of the Master, and the Servant was great
yet it was fruitless, for having deliver'd <hi>Izadora</hi> the Letter, as privately
as he was directed, <hi>Blacius,</hi> who always suspected <hi>Flamminius</hi> denials, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
rather from his goodness, than his Truth, and who observ'd an
admirable vigilancy over <hi>Izadoras</hi> actions, was no sooner advertis'd of the
Pages coming to his House, than he stole to his Daughters Chamber,
who had scarcely read her Lovers fatal generosity, but she fell a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with Tears, and in so great disorders, that in the heighth of them,
<hi>Blacius</hi> surpriz'd her with the cause in her hands, which he violently snatcht
from hers, and having perus'd it, contracted so transcendent a rage for her
to whom it was sent, that his Ponyard was twice out to have quench'd it
in her Bloud; but perhaps, believing to kill her, would be rather an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
than a revenge, he resolv'd as the most sensible one he
could invent, to carry her to <hi>Flamminius,</hi> and force her to give him some
such pregnant evincements of her conversion, that he should not doubt
it; and which, if afterwards she broke, might render her as unworthy his
Affections, as Resentments. <hi>Blacius</hi> being thus fixt, commanded a Charriot
to be made ready, in which he took <hi>Izadora</hi> with him to <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s, to
whom he commanded her to be askind, as she had been cruel, or as he
merited; which if she declin d, he protested by Oaths (that to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
would give one horror, much more to have broken them) that if he
could hire no murtherers to destroy you, he would do it with his own hand,
and that then he would force her to marry <hi>Flamminius,</hi> or <hi>Diana's</hi> Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery.
The fear (as she vow'd to me) she had for you, the pitty of <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
sufferings, and virtue, and the duty to a Father, made her more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to obedience than her own safety, which the gods by the condition
they had reduc'd her to, had render'd the least of her cares. As soon as they
were come into <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s Chamber, the poor Gentleman seeing <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
with <hi>Izadora,</hi> began to exclaim against the Fates cruelty, and not hers,
that had given him no obstacle but want of health, to enjoy a Felicity as
transcendent as her Beauty, This discourse the generous Lover held, for
he was ignorant that <hi>Blacius</hi> knew the cause of his danger, his Page not
daring to acquaint him with it, lest what was his misfortune, might have
been esteem'd his fault; but he was soon put out of that Faith by <hi>Blacius,</hi>
shewing him his own Letter. Oh gods! who can tell you those sad words
<hi>Flamminius</hi> utter'd at that discovery (they were such, that I as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
as commended <hi>Izadoras</hi> Constancy not to have been shaken by them.
But her Father who had solemnly sworn, that nothing but <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
should convince him of his Daughters change, withdrew himself
to a window, lest the dying Lover might attribute <hi>Izadora</hi>'s kindness, to
his presence, and not her conversion. <hi>Flamminius</hi> perceiving 'twas with
design, instead of employing so kind an opportunity, to implore his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in receiving, and cherishing so pure, and bright a flame, made use of
it only to invoke her pardon, that the assurance he had sent of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
had prov'd so unfortunate a Duty, and then protested (with
Eyes and Hands, elevated to Heaven) that if her justice would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
her to believe, he intended not to make use of <hi>Blacius</hi> authority, her
reason should be convinc'd of it, by the demonstration of his death;
and lest that might be consider'd as her act, he would by a Letter, and
before witnesses, seal with his last breath, 'twas not her disdain that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96335:112"/>
so sad an effect, but the joy of her alteration, meeting with a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
too much weakn'd, to receive so transcendent a blessing. This new,
and perhaps unexpected Gallantry, more troubl'd <hi>Izadora,</hi> than had he
made use of that power, <hi>Blacius</hi> was so willing to furnish him with; for
she found it far more difficult to oppose Virtue, than persecution; and
indeed her perplexity was such, that for a while she answer'd him in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but weepings; which the generous <hi>Flamminius</hi> observing, and
perhaps fancying the cause of her disorders, begg'd her to believe he was
more sensible at her Tears, than she could be for their subject; that all he
said, or hoped for, was but to obtain a pardon for what his Passion, and
Misfortune had cast upon her; that she would not so much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to his Torment, as to manifest she was sensible of it; nor to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
as shewing him a Beauty, which was capable of greater miracles.
This discourse confounded <hi>Izadora,</hi> on the one side to destroy so perfect
a Virtue, and on the other, to preserve so dangerous a Ryval for <hi>Perolla,</hi>
was a strange perplexity: besides, to give him hopes, was to cast herself
into as great a danger as she exempted him from; and to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
was, (by <hi>Blacius</hi>'s vows) against your Life) to involve you in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
misfortune; but at length, considering that he had virtue enough,
to give her a confidence that by it, he might in time suppress his Passion;
or if that which was so strong in all other occasions, should prove so weak
in this, that yet her, and your condition would be but as desperate, as
without that Essay, she resolv'd to save a life, that the gods (but by <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>)
had not the power to preserve. In this relation she told <hi>Flamminius</hi>
(blushing, and trembling) I will pardon you all things, so to dye, be not
one of them. O Madam (hereply'd) are my Crimes so great, that you
deny me too that way of avoiding farther punishments? No (said <hi>Izadora</hi>)
your Virtues are so, that I can better suffer your passion, than your ruine.
I could not but sigh at those words (said <hi>Perolla</hi>) but <hi>Callione</hi> did not,
or would not hear me. Ah Madam (she continu'd, <hi>Flamminius</hi> reply'd)
do not you think me past recovery, and in that faith, do like Physitians
to Patients, which are so, permit them any thing? or may not I fear I owe
this preservation to your duty, not your mercy? But I carry my fears too
far, and make them perhaps as injurious, as my hopes, which have no
greater ambition, than to have the Divine <hi>Izadora</hi> for the object of their
adoration, and that she will promise me, in the same moment she forbids
me that felicity, I may (as by her Commands) end my life with what gives
the relish to it? This (said <hi>Izadora,</hi> hastily, and in disorder) I promise
you. And this promise (said <hi>Flamminius,</hi> kissing her hand) I do more
joyfully receive, than that health and life it will restore me to, <hi>Izadora</hi>
gave <hi>Flamminius</hi> that engagement, because it was nothing conclusive to
your prejudice, and because <hi>Blacius</hi> (who was impatient to learn the
event of their discourse) was coming towards them, who might have
forc'd his fair Daughter to a more binding one, or to as great a danger by
her declining it. To shorten my relation, <hi>Blacius,</hi> though he had many
protestations from <hi>Flamminius,</hi> that his Truth, and not his complyance,
publish'd that <hi>Izadora</hi> (as far above his hopes, as merit) had made him
happy, and that his health should be suddainly a visible effect, and evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what he profest; yet upon his return, he confin'd <hi>Izadora</hi> to her
Chamber, till by <hi>Flamminius</hi> recovery, he was convinc'd of his Daughters
obedience, which yet he durst not manifest to be his intention before <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi>
who he knew would revenge any Tyranny upon himself, that was
impos'd on his Mistriss, But upon his first visit, which was not long after (so
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96335:113"/>
powerful a charm were <hi>Izadora</hi>'s words) she was restor'd to that freedom,
her Servant never knew she had lost; but it was upon condition, that she
should receive <hi>Flamminius</hi> addresses, and the same minute she manifested
any aversion for them, to be one of the vestal Nuns of <hi>Diana,</hi> which you
know is a society, that admits of no return to the world, to any that are
once ingag'd in it. If it had not been for <hi>Perolla,</hi> this threatening had lost
that quality, and the pennance had invited her to the Sin: but she knew
to be in the World, and not his, was as inconsistent with her inclination,
as Vows; and that the way was easier for him to follow her to <hi>Elizium,</hi>
than to the Nunnery; but yet the hope she had in his Fortune, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
made her look, as at a distance, though as at a certainty upon the
latter, and dispatch an express to acquaint him with her resolution, if his
arrival prevented it not. But whether <hi>Blacius</hi> has heard of this messenger,
or whether his apprehension, that your now accession of Glory, (which
came to his knowledge last night by a Spye he kept about you) would
make the Senate consider your particular, as a publick Concernment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated
the Nuptials, I cannot tell; but this I can, that there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of them so suddenly, and that <hi>Flamminius</hi> had never the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to ask <hi>Izadora</hi>'s consent, but contents himself with not learning her
aversion for them, and in observing in her countenance, a joy, which has
not only deluded him, but all those that have consider'd it; but alas, it was
but the better to palliate her fatal resolution; which is in the Nuptial
Bole that is offer'd to <hi>Venus,</hi> to drown her life; or else, perhaps she does
not counterfeit: but her exterior satisfaction proceeds from an eternal one,
that she dyes a Martyr for <hi>Perolla,</hi> and for Constancy, which I hope his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
will prevent, and convert our fears into nobler passions. For my
part, I shall not tell you, either the Office <hi>Izadora</hi> impos'd on me, or the
resolution I form'd on it; since I am confident you have heard both. Yes
(said I) fair <hi>Callione</hi>) I have, and you must practice neither; I will act
a part, that will exempt you from acting any. Then lifting up my Eyes and
Hands, I thank' the gods for having communicated so much Divinity to a
Creature, and implor'd them to direct my actions, for her satisfaction,
though to my own ruine. This short ejaculation finish'd, I begg'd <hi>Callione,</hi>
that I might have the felicity to see (and talk one minute with) <hi>Izadora,</hi>
which she promis'd, and was no further on her way towards the satisfying
her engagement, than her Closet door, but <hi>Izadora</hi> came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
waited on by <hi>Flamminius,</hi> Great gods! what tremblings did that
sight cast me into, which I saw through the crevice of the door? I was
once going to have made him no more my Rival, or to have been his no
longer; but the presence of <hi>Izadora</hi> (and <hi>Flamminius</hi> virtue) ty'd up
my Arm; neither though my reason had not supprest my disorders, had I
enjoy'd the opportunity of acting my despair: for the cause of it, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
withdrew himself, with so much Grace and Humility, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
against Fate, which had render'd my being his Friend and <hi>Izadora</hi>'s
Servant inconsistent. <hi>Flamminius</hi> was no sooner gone, than she having shut
the Chamber door, told her Confident; Now <hi>Callione,</hi> I perceive the gods
are determin'd to furnish me by <hi>Perolla</hi>'s absence with what shall evince,
that my passion for him, is as perfect, as unfortunate; I must dye (<hi>Callione</hi>)
and (beseech the gods to make me as unfortunate in the other World, as I
have been in this, if I resent any trouble for my Death, but what I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it may create in him; and that by this one argument of my
Flame, I am render'd for ever uncapable of giving him any other; but it
may be the cause of my death, may extinguish, or lessen the effects of it. On
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96335:113"/>
the contrary, Madam (<hi>Callione</hi> reply'd) 'twill augment them, not only
by the loss of the highest perfection that ever was, but by his knowledge
that that loss was his, and for him. Let us speak no more of it (said <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>)
my resolution is too just, and too setl'd, to be remov'd; for, either
'twill make him love my memory, or follow me; and in this one perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
I satisfy my Duty, and my Love: the first being cancell'd by the
hand of death, the last by going to a place where the object of mine may
be assured to find and possess me; and I have stoln this minute to let him
know so much under my hand. For thy particular (<hi>Callione</hi>) the trust I
have impos'd on thee, is of a quality which manifests the greatness of it,
and this is all I have to enjoyn thee, that thou wilt deliver my last desires
to <hi>Perolla</hi>'s hands, and that thou wilt, with as much resolution, see me
take the Poison, as I will drink it. Come Madam (said <hi>Callione</hi>) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe Miracles are ceas'd, since I see your constancy: retire yourself
into this Closet, where you may deliver me your Commands, with more
secrecy, which I beseech you to believe I shall faithfully obey, though I
would not any of them with so much passion, as that of pledging you.
Alas <hi>Callione</hi> (said <hi>Izadora</hi>) thou hast no griefs, which death alone can ease.
I shall have (Madam (she reply'd) when yours are cur'd by that reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
At the end of these words, the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> open'd the Closet Door,
and perceiving a Man there, for my disguise hinder'd her from knowing
me) she cryed out, oh <hi>Callione,</hi> thou hast betray'd, thou hast betray'd
me, but death hath more doors than one, and I will try them all, but I
will find a passage. No Madam (said <hi>Callione,</hi> perceiving her error) your
suspitions wrong me more, than you believe my treachery does you: 'Tis
<hi>Perolla</hi> you see, and unless my presenting him unto you be a treachery, I
am guilty of none. <hi>Izadora</hi> at that assurance, consider'd me more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
and then continu'd; oh gods, 'tis not <hi>Perolla,</hi> but his Ghost which
comes to invite me to a place, where Merit and Love have no Enemies,
and where a virtuous and a happy Flame are the same thing. No, fair
<hi>Izadora</hi> (I reply'd, prostrating my self at her Feet, (for till then my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
were too violent to let me speak) I am <hi>Perolla,</hi> not his Ghost,
and am come to implore your continuance in this life, not to invite you
to another; the gods will not so much tempt us to doubt their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as to decline rewarding your Virtue, on the same Theatre, where
it has so conspicuously shined: for that were to make Sin Reason <hi>Callione</hi>
(Madam) has told me such a story of <hi>Flamminius,</hi> that you must be the
unjustest Woman in the World, if you make me not the miserablest Man:
and that hatred of your Fathers, which I thought was the gods cruelty; I
now find was their care, since it has reserv'd you to a blessing, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can transcend, but my misfortune which builds it. I had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
this discourse, had not <hi>Izadora</hi> interrupted it first, by going two
steps back, and then by saying; This is sure <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Ghost, not he: for
nothing but a Spirit, divested of Flesh, could entertain so high a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;
but can you esteem <hi>Flamminius</hi> Virtues great, that never but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
his life to please his Mistriss, when at the same instant you make
yours your misery, to reward your Rival? his performance carried its ease
with it, but <hi>Perolla</hi>'s it's torment; had I been curst with any doubts of
your transcending him; this action had clear'd them, and what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the disclosing of his Virtues, do but the better manifest your own:
neither can you think, but that his embracing your Offer, will render him
unworthy of it; for the receiving a resign'd up Mistriss, is like losing a life
for a Friend, where that act which makes the obligation, imposes an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96335:114"/>
of gratitude. Ah Madam (said I, interrupting her) he that could
dye to please <hi>Izadora,</hi> merits to live for her. Observe (she reply'd) the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Gods, which furnishes me with Arguments out of your own
Mouth; for you will acknowledge, to live in Torment is a greater un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness,
than death, and since you assure me by becoming <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s,
I must make the first of those your Fate, must not a higher Martyrdom,
have a proportionate reward? will you make <hi>Izadora</hi> unfortunate, because
the gods have made <hi>Flamminius</hi> generous? and will you give away what
you have given yourself to? have you not rewarded a gallant intention,
by a gallanter? and have you nothing to pay <hi>Izadora's</hi> debts with, but
<hi>Izadora</hi> herself? Alas Madam (I reply'd) they are my debts, as well as
yours, and I beseech you, judge of the value I place upon those that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge
you, when I submit to such a payment. Great gods! (said <hi>Izadora,</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>fting up her hands) what have I committed, that <hi>Perolla</hi> against Reason,
against my Tears, and against my Prayers, will part with me? cruel <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
(she continu'd) fixing her Eyes upon me, after a short silence and
weeping, you shall but extend your power over your self; you can but
deny <hi>Izadora</hi> to be yours, and recall those vows you have made her: you
cannot make her cancel hers, which were to be yours or Deaths; the first
you willingly exempt her from, and the last she therefore as willingly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.
When she had done speaking, she came again to the place where
I kneeled, and after having wet my Face with her Tears, she dry'd her Eyes,
and with a look as cold, as temperate, and as far above misfortune, as she
was unworthy any, she told me: farewell <hi>Perolla,</hi> farewell for ever, but
before I execute what your cruelty, and my religion renders necessary, I
will satisfy you, and <hi>Flamminius</hi> by my Nuptials; and after in that <hi>Bole,</hi>
(pointing to the poison) or in as certain a remedy, if that be deny'd me,
I will satisfy my duty to the gods. At the finishing of these words she left
me, as if Life had done so, but observing her Fatal resolution, and that to
be just to my Rival, was to be unjust and cruel to <hi>Izadora,</hi> before she was
gone out of the Chamber, I cry'd out to her, Stay, Stay, (fair <hi>Izadora</hi>)
your Life is dearer unto me than Justice, Gratitude, or all other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
and upon better thoughts, I have plac'd too high a value upon
<hi>Flamminius</hi>'s performances, that could think they merited <hi>Izadora</hi> for their
reward, who can find none worthy of her, but he that she raises to that
height, by her esteeming him so; and since she has created <hi>Perolla</hi> to, not
found him in that blest condition, let her impose what Commands she will
on the work of her creation, he will either act them, or not survive his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and disobedience. All that I have (said <hi>Izadora</hi> returning) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
you, is, that you leave no means un-essay'd (I will not so much wrong
you, as to limit them no further than honor shall direct) to free me from
<hi>Flamminius,</hi> and if those fail, to give me leave to do it. Farewell <hi>Perolla,</hi>
though I dare embrace death, yet I dare not stay to see the event of your
designes. <hi>Izadora</hi> was no sooner gone, than I begg'd <hi>Callione</hi> to let me know,
whether there were a private room, in which I might by her favour enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Flamminius</hi> without witnesses, whose virtue she had given me so large
a Carracter of, that I despair'd not to perswade him to abandon a blessing,
he could not purchase, but by as great a Tyranny. I believe (said <hi>Callione</hi>)
I might bring him into the lower Hall, which is kept empty for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
the Nuptials; but allow I did, and that his Flame prove greater
than his Virtue? Ah <hi>Callione</hi> (I reply'd) do not do the latter so much
wrong, nor me, as to ask what my resentments will be, at so high an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
I will not (said <hi>Callione</hi>) do my innocence so much, for if I know
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96335:114"/>
your intentions, perhaps I might not contribute towards them, but being
ignorant what they are, I may serve you without a Sin: Go then <hi>Perolla</hi>
into the great room, pav'd with Marble, whereas certainly I will send him,
as that my Prayers shall attend you. Her going away immediately, left me
no time to answer, and that little I had left, was too precious to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployed:
I therefore stole down to the place I was assign'd, where I had
not long continu'd, but <hi>Flamminius</hi> came alone unto me; I besought him
first to permit me to lock the doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for my intelligence was to be without
witnesses, or interruption. This he consented to, and this being perform'd
I took off my disguise, and told him; The gods shall bear me witness, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Flamminius,</hi> that I almost esteem my not unfruitful Passion to
<hi>Izadora</hi> a misfortune, since I fear it may deny me a friendship, which is a
blessing next to hers I should be most ambitious of, and most cherish; For
you have been my Rival in so handsom a way, that I must acknowledge
her declining, the giving you yet a more advantageous Name, is as great a
demonstration of her partiality, as of my happiness; I have too, been so
bold, as to tell her this truth in your behalf, and some things more as hard
to be credited, as perhaps they were to be spoken. Yes <hi>Flamminius,</hi> I have
been your Advocate against my selfe, and have passionately pleaded your
Cause, with hope of success, though I know I could not obtain it, but by
my eternal ruine; neither should I now have alter'd that practice, were
not <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Life the cause of it, who more constant to her Vows than
her Felicity, prefers <hi>Perolla,</hi> or Death before <hi>Flamminius;</hi> so that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cannot attempt to be her Husband, but he will necessitate her to be her
own Executioner, and by so fatal a perseverance, not only extinguish the
fairest light that ever shin'd, but make your self so guilty to your self, that
should <hi>Izadora</hi> want friends to revenge your cruelty, your Conscience
would assume that part, and act it with as much certainty, as horror. There
is glory <hi>Flamminius</hi> as well as Reason in declining one Blessing, for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and of two evils you choose the least, when you elect your own ruine,
before <hi>Izadora</hi>'s; neither should I ever have had the confidence to beg
this of you, had I not begg'd more for you, and were I only to receive the
fruit of your Virtue, I would never have implor'd it: For <hi>Blacius</hi> being as
constant in his Hate, as I am in my Love, I shall remove no obstacle by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
my Rival; but remain at as great a distance from my happiness,
though you decline possessing it, as I shall be if you act the contrary. I will
not tell you (Sir) what were <hi>Flamminius</hi> astonishments, both at learning
who I was, and my requests; for they were indeed of a quality fitter to
be imagin'd than related: but his answer (after a little silence) was this.
Though I only know <hi>Perolla</hi> by report, yet I believe him such as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
but had I been as ignorant of his actions, as his Person, I must
have concluded them both excellent (I tell you said <hi>Perolla</hi>) true, though
not the truth) since they had charms sufficient to captivate <hi>Izadora,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her own perfections to try others by, evinces his to be great, since
they were esteem'd so by her. This faith (when I first saw <hi>Izadora</hi>) made
me esteem my engaging my self in her service, and becoming your Rival,
an action of as little justice, as hope: but that Beauty which is the cause
of my Flame, must be the Apology of it, which would need none to any
but <hi>Perolla;</hi> and lest he might believe the distance betwixt him and <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
did create my expectations of a nearness betwixt his admirable Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and me, I declin'd all Arms to conquer her with, but those you made
use of, and would be oblig'd to <hi>Blacius</hi> for nothing, but his wishes,
and the opportunity of making my addresses. What their successes have
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96335:115"/>
been by the mercy of her to whom they were paid, is visible in this
nights preparations, and in <hi>Izadora:</hi> neither by her commands, nor by
her looks opposing them. So that though I should credit <hi>Perolla</hi> in all
things as an Oracle, yet I must look upon what he now alledges, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sooner from his Despair, than Truth, and believe since art in
Love, is rather a Virtue, than a Crime, that he considering of it in that
quality, does make use of it to destroy what <hi>Izadora's</hi> Mercy and Duty, have
elected to conferr on <hi>Flamminius,</hi> to the prejudice (perhaps) of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and of her Reason. If (I reply'd) I am troubl'd at your not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
me, it is only by knowing what prejudice it may involve <hi>Izadora</hi>
in; to whom you have hitherto been so civil, that I am upon that score
uncapable of resenting any thing from you, as an injury to me, which
does not absolutely prove one to her, and if there be any Art in speaking
Truth, what I have alledg'd, is abundantly replenish'd with it, for by <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
(an oath I hold in too much veneration to violate) what I have told
you is a real truth, and, is only in design, to preserve you from a sin, the
very thought whereof doth make me tremble. You must pardon me <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolla</hi>
(said <hi>Flamminius,</hi> interrupting me) if I cannot raise my Faith so far
above my reason. Alas (I reply'd) I must of necessity be oblig'd only to
your Faith, for your doubts are of so sad a nature, that if reason and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
only must remove them, the very performance which does it,
will render you uncapable of making any advantage by their suppression,
and the knowledge of your mistake. No <hi>Perolla</hi> (said <hi>Flamminius</hi>) I have
not been so rude an admirer of <hi>Izadora,</hi> as not before now to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
her, that I prefer my obedience before my death, and when to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that reality, I had almost made use of a demonstration, I would
not again return to life, (left her enjoyning me, it might have proceeded
from her Duty, or her present pity) till she had faithfully engag'd her
self, to permit my death, when she would no longer my Passion; so that
having given her the power, when she has the will to be free from my
Flame, I cannot consider you now, but as your own, and not <hi>Izador</hi>'s
Agent. Alas <hi>Flamminius</hi> (I answer'd) that which you build upon the
Cause of your Confidence, will be of our Misery, and her ruine; for the
engagement <hi>Izadora</hi> gave you, the invitation to which was your virtue,
with the condition you were in, when she gave it you, and her fear of what
you may do, by what you have done, makes her elect her own Death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than avoid it by yours; so that what you chose to evince your respect
by, turns to a Tyranny; but let her generosity instruct yours, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it can be but virtuous to imitate <hi>Izadora.</hi> You make me (said <hi>Flammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>)
happy whether I do, or do not credit you: for if the latter by my
choice, there is nothing since I spoke with you that troubles me, and
con-sequently I am in joyes of hopes, till those of fruition converts
them into greater: and if the former, I must be convinc'd that <hi>Izadora</hi>
loves <hi>Flamminius</hi> better than her self; but yet (he continu'd) were
I assur'd so fatal a proof, must certify that Truth, I should be less unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
in her hate, than her esteem; besides (he continu'd preparing himself
to leave me) <hi>Izadora</hi> knowing her death, will be so far from preventing,
that it will but accellerate mine. I must again (<hi>Perolla</hi>) beg your pardon,
for not crediting your vows, which you may grant with the less reluctancy,
since my unbelief is with reason and against my self. Then (I reply'd) staying
him, and drawing my Ponyard, which was all the Arms I had then about me,
you must either oblige me so much, as not to let me live to see you restor'd
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96335:115"/>
to a better opinion of me by so black an Experiment, or you must not live
to be <hi>Izadora</hi>'s death; which, were I not certain your intended Nuptials
would prove, I had rather make use of my hand against my self, than <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius.</hi>
Since (said he, unsheathing his Ponyard, which was a Weapon
all Gentlemen constantly wore in those times) you will force me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<hi>Izadora</hi> by my Arms, as well as by my Services, I make no question
but to prove as successful in the first, as I have been in the last. We had
no more words after those, but ran furiously at each other; my thrust was
more fortunate than <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s, for though his entered my right side,
yet meeting with a Rib, and glauncing on it, it gave me but a large flesh
wound, whereas mine past through and through his body, a little above
his heart; and our Weapons being not long, we were constrain'd to close,
in which I had the fortune to fling him down, and disarm him; but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by the great Spring of blood which issu'd from his wound, that I had
at least for awhile hinder'd his Marriage, presenting him his Ponyard, I
implor'd his forgiveness for what I had done, beg'd him to be satisfi'd by my
being able to have success against him, that I had the better cause; and
besought him not to implore that life I gave him, and <hi>Izadora</hi> had preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for his ruine, and for mine: since he would hereafter know how near
she was to sacrifice her own for his, and that I would ever be of a resemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
resolution. <hi>Flamminius</hi> made me some answer which I could not
hear, for having effected my design, (though in the most unfortunate way)
I thought it high time to retire, lest a longer continuance in so dangerous
a place, might rob me of the fruits of my Victory. I was but newly gone
out of the Room, when (occasion'd by the curiosity of some that had
listen'd at the door whil'st we were fighting) I heard all the house in an
alarm, and was scarce half way out of it, but that I found my self in a
narrow Entry assaulted by four with Swords, who cry'd out, Kill, Kill, the
Murtherer of <hi>Flamminius;</hi> one of those was so hot in his fury, that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at me, he stumbled, and fell at my feet, and by his fall choaking up the
passage, I had time to take away his Sword, with which for awhile I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
safe against the rest; but as soon as I was come into a more spacious
place, not only the other three came all upon me, but most of that crowd
which were invited to this Marriage, and <hi>Blacius</hi> at the head of them: so
that I had certainly there receiv'd my Fate, had not those two Friends I
formerly specified, with <hi>Strato,</hi> relieved me; who suspecting my design,
had continu'd about the house ready to answer all alarms; and this they
did so vigorously, that having worsted some that oppos'd their entrance,
they join'd me in my greatest danger, and crying out, Courage <hi>Perolla,</hi> by
their voyces, and their performances, had restor'd me mine, though I had
lost it. The name of <hi>Perolla,</hi> made <hi>Blacius</hi> discover what my disguise had
conceal'd; and the affront, but more the Actor of it, so transported him,
that striking at me with all his force, and I defending his blow with my
Ponyard, his Sword fell out of his hand, which snatching up, I presented it
him by the hilt, and beg'd him not to employ his Arms against a life, that
I was perpetually ready to sacrifice for his service. <hi>Blacius</hi> was so extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surpriz'd at the loss of his Sword, and at the manner of his recovering
it, that I had time to leave him in his astonishment: But I ow'd it to the
Valor of the Gentleman with whom I had that discourse at my first coming
into the Room where the Ball was dancing, who learning by the publick
noise that I was <hi>Perolla,</hi> and pardoning my attempt on <hi>Flamminius,</hi> as to my
resentments, did preserve my life, by cutting off another Gentlemans hand
that was coming behind me to have taken it away, whil'st I was restoring
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96335:116"/>
                  <hi>Blacius</hi> his Arms. With this generous additional assistance, I recover'd the
Street-gate, where I found by the care of my two Friends so powerful a
recruit, that had my revenge been my design, I might as easily have acted,
as desir'd it; and indeed I found a greater difficulty to suppress the fury of
those Swords which were drawn in my quarrel, than I believe I should, to
have been victorious by them. To be brief, I retired to a private and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Sanctuary, though most of us received so many wounds, that their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not dangerous, made us acknowledge a high Providence.</p>
               <p>Whil'st we were thus disputing our difference, <hi>Izadora,</hi> though she were
but a hearer of it, was (as she has assured me) in far greater fears, than
any that were Actors in it; but being told that <hi>Flamminius</hi> was killed, she
ran with <hi>Callione</hi> where he lay, and where she wept so many tears, that he
almost mistook her Pity, for her Love; but <hi>Blacius</hi> being (after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat)
come thither also, caused <hi>Flamminius</hi> to be carried into the next
Chamber, and as soon as the Chyrurgions had searcht, and bound up his
wound, the impatient Father asked him, Whether his Daughter had any
share in this Tragedy? Ah Sir (said <hi>Flamminius</hi>) be not so cruel to truth
and to me, as to suspect her guilty of such a Crime; for had she intentions
of that nature, she needed not employ any to kill me, since she knows, she
has not only the power to act it herself, but by the honour of dying by her
commands, she has wherewithall abundantly to recompence my death. No
Sir, he that has reduced me to this condition, is some Stranger, and Friend
to <hi>Perolla,</hi> who believing him too much injured by the loss of <hi>Izadora,</hi> has
so civilly endeavor'd to revenge his absent Friend, that I can no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of his resentments, than I should at the loss of so much blood, had it
been in <hi>Izadora</hi>'s service; for after he had by courage (and not surprize)
disarmed me, and that I had given him no slight hurt, when the latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
him to revenge, and the former gave him power to execute it, he
restored me my Poniard, and for that gift, only besought me to excuse
those resentments his Friends interest had created, and so left me. Take heed
<hi>Flamminius</hi> (said <hi>Blacius</hi>) lest you make me question what you said of
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s innocency, by seeming to be ignorant of <hi>Perolla</hi>'s guilt, when
that he wounded you, is so known a truth, that there are as many Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of it, as People in this house.</p>
               <p>It may be (said <hi>Flamminius</hi>) that it was <hi>Perolla,</hi> but you cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude that I must know 'twas he; for if it were, his disguise might
have deceived one that had been better acquainted with him than I have
the honour to be; besides Sir, 'twould have been too much in me, had I
thought it had been my Rival, to have given so large a character of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
before my Mistriss.</p>
               <p>Well (reply'd <hi>Blacius</hi>) the certainty that it is <hi>Perolla</hi> cannot be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
than that he shall never have <hi>Izadora,</hi> who I will think innocent, because
you do, and who upon your recovery, shall be the reward of your passion,
and your wounds. <hi>Blacius</hi> immediately after went away, and <hi>Izadora</hi> to
satisfie her Father, and her goodness, continued with <hi>Flamminius,</hi> whose
gallantry she admir'd, as much as she esteem'd herself unfortunate, in being
uncapable of rewarding it. But he (as soon as <hi>Blacius</hi> was retir'd) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
touch'd with my carriage to him, but much more with what I had
told him concerning <hi>Izadora</hi>'s design upon herself, besought her, to permit
him the honour of entertaining her without Witnesses, which she granted;
and the Chamber being emptied, <hi>Flamminius</hi> told her particularly all that
had past betwixt us, magnified my actions in terms as flattering as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
and then conjured <hi>Izadora</hi> with passionate and moving words, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96335:116"/>
him ingenuously, Whether all I had delivered was true? but she
(more perplex'd at this question, than she would have been to drink the
fatal Bole) for a good while did nothing but fix her eyes upon him, and
cry'd out, Oh gods! <hi>Flamminius,</hi> Oh gods! <hi>Flamminius,</hi> What is it you
ask me? And at length answered him only in a shower of tears, which
drew another from him, and words so distracted, yet so significant, that <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
found, Rhetorick did not wholly consist in well speaking, or in talking
sence. But <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s disorder being somewhat mitigated, he continu'd,
I perceive (fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) that your apprehensions I should destroy my
life, when you do my hopes, hinders you from letting your words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
what your tears have done, but I beseech you believe, that I
shall be more tormented in continuing your misery, than in knowing my
own; that I shall consider my affliction as my joy, if it can build yours;
and if by the learning my own misfortunes, I may put a period to <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>'s,
she will more oblige me by building her Happiness on the ruine of
mine, than if she continued my hopes, by her sufferings. Alas! (said <hi>Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>)
what shall I answer? for your virtue is such, that it makes mine my
pain; and that constancy which I still gloried in, is now a subject as fit for
my tears, as satisfaction. Oh gods! she continu'd after a short silence, why
do you make virtue so offensive to virtue? why do you make <hi>Flammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s
virtue of such a quality, that I am troubled to profess mine? And
why do you render perseverance in good, a torment as great, as the fault
in declining it? Alas! <hi>Flamminius,</hi> press me not to tell you what I elected
to shun by death, and guess at the nature of what I am to speak, by what I
would have performed to avoid it; let it suffice, you having tied me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of your passion, or your death, and that since my preingagement
hindered me from cherishing the former, to preserve you from the latter, I
was willing, and am resolved to exchange our destines. Great gods!
(<hi>Flamminius</hi> cry'd out) why did you teach me what retributions I ought
to make so high a perfection, and so long delayed giving me the power to
perform them; then turning to the excellency he had mention'd, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd,
Fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> you have not only taught me what to practise, but
given me the power to act it: Yes, I am now ready to lose my hopes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my life, and the joyes of having served you in a way that you can no
more hereafter doubt of, than reward my passion, will recompence my
loss, and preserve a life which must be my contentment, since it has esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
yours, and is esteem'd by you. But why do I lengthen my discourse?
'Tis sufficient you learn (generous <hi>Spartacus</hi>) that the great <hi>Flamminius</hi>
made a resignation of all his passions for <hi>Izadora,</hi> but those of being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to her, and became as perfect a Friend, as he had been a Lover.
This admirable change both he and <hi>Izadora</hi> acquainted me with, by a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his, to whom she had told my retreat.</p>
               <p>To draw to a conclusion, during <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s weakness, he so perfectly
acted the Lover before <hi>Blacius,</hi> and so perfectly the Friend, when he was
absent, that <hi>Izadora</hi> was convinc'd (by so painful a part) he was as much
concern'd in procuring her for me, as formerly he had been in doing it for
himself; but when his health was so much return'd, that he could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
cloud the fallacy, we were all in new disorders: For <hi>Blacius,</hi> who was
still confident of <hi>Izadora</hi>'s constancy to me, and who suspected what she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to attempt for her own deliverance, would be as soon as <hi>Flamminius</hi>
was recover'd, so strictly kept his Daughter, that she was then absolutely
confin'd to her chamber, whose windows were grated with Iron, and whose
doors were justified by a Guard. <hi>Flamminius,</hi> in this exigency, to manifest
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96335:117"/>
his conversion, and to make himself uncapable of a relapse, advis'd us by
speedy Marriage to exempt our selves from the power both of <hi>Blacius,</hi>
and of Fortune; which course if we would elect, he was confident in
some short time to furnish us with the means to practice. This both my
Passion and Reason infinitely approv'd, and by <hi>Callione,</hi> with whom I had in
disguise some private meetings in the Temple, I besought <hi>Izadora</hi> to be of
my opinion, and made use of those very Arguments to her, that she had
to me, when I was in the blest condition of <hi>Blacius</hi>'s esteem, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the contrary from <hi>Pacuvius;</hi> but that scrupulous Virtue resolv'd
it as great a sin against her duty, to marry <hi>Perolla</hi> without her Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as it was against her Vows, to Marry any other; and though the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Flamminius</hi> represented, that when he could no longer conceal his
change from <hi>Blacius,</hi> she must expect to be depriv'd of his assistance; which
if not made use of, whil'st he had the opportunity of paying it, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
alter her confinement, into a perpetual Prison; or by her Fathers
presenting her a new Husband, necessitate her to act what she had but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd:
yet all he could extort from <hi>Izadora,</hi> (in my favor) was, that she
would contribute to any thing which might secure her from her Fathers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
so the place of her future Sanctuary were of such a quality, that
she might be confident her Honour would no more suffer in Report, than
in Act: this unalterable Decree cast us into new difficulties; and before
we could imagine any way of suppressing them, <hi>Flamminius</hi> was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recover'd, that <hi>Blacius</hi> publisht within two dayes the Nuptial, which
had been interrupted, should be consummated. This Alarm (which I
receiv'd from <hi>Callione,</hi>) by that just and high character I had of my late
Rival, had no further operation on me, than the fears of what advantages
we might lose by his banishment from <hi>Blacius,</hi> who permitted no creature
but <hi>Flamminius,</hi> and <hi>Callione,</hi> to see <hi>Izadora;</hi> and who kept a Guard as
strong, as faithful to him, at the door of his House, as at the door of her
Chamber; but when my hope had resign'd itself to despair, he that to
create my joyes, had ruin'd his own, was not content only to leave <hi>Izado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
to me, but to help her to me; in prosecution of which gallantry, the
day before the intended Marriage (for 'twas so long defer'd, either that
he found not out the invention sooner, or else to endear it) by that free
access he had into <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Chamber, he came to visit her, with a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as full of satisfaction, as if he, not another, had been to enjoy the
fruits of his industry; and there inform'd her, that he had seen, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
ador'd her, coming to <hi>Salapia</hi> to visit an Aunt of his, who was
chief of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Vestals, whom that morning he had acquainted with all
his Story, and whom he had persuaded, to repair what his Civility to her
had caus'd, to receive her into that Nunnery, without those oaths which
they really admitted must necessarily take, and thereby, by deluding <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>'s
belief, frustrate his hopes of forcing her return into the world, 'till she
might make it her election, and not constraint. I cannot express with what
joy and acknowledgment <hi>Izadora</hi> receiv'd this News, both which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creast
by <hi>Flamminius,</hi> assuring her, that before the Night was many hours
old, he would conduct her safely to her retirement; and towards the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, presented her with a water of so excellent a quality, that its nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was Iron; this strange Liquor he apply'd to the Bars of the Windows,
in little Channels of Wax, which did its operation so powerfully, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently;
that late at Night when he repeated his Visit, he found a breach in
the Window, large enough for <hi>Izadora</hi> and <hi>Callione</hi> to get out at, which
they did by a Ladder of Silk he had purposely brought. They were no
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96335:117"/>
sooner descended into the Garden, upon which the Window answer'd, than
by the ordinary way (to delude the Guards at her door) he went thither
himself, and by picking the Lock, they got into a retir'd street, where by
<hi>Flamminius</hi>'s appointment I attended them. I cannot tell you what were
my expressions of joy, and gratitude to my Mistriss, and my Rival; nor
what Prayers, and Reasons, I us'd to invite her rather to a Temple, than a
Nunnery, and to embrace the opportunity of an union, when the gods
presented us so favourable an one: that to decline it, was not to rely on,
but tempt their Provicence. 'Tis too much you know, that all was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
and that we conducted <hi>Izadora</hi> to her living Grave. Who can repeat
<hi>Blacius</hi>'s amazement, when next morning, instead of finding his Daughter
preparing herself to be a Bride, he only found a Letter on the Table, of
what forlorn courses his rigor had forc'd her to; but though his surprize,
and astonishment, had been as high as fancy could reach, yet it could not
transcend <hi>Izadora</hi>'s and mine, when discoursing together, we were adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that one of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Priests desir'd to speak with us, who being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we found `twas <hi>Flamminius</hi> which had taken that Holy O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der, and
who told us, That having lost the hopes of this world, he would no longer
livein it; that having been a servant to <hi>Izadora,</hi> he could not go less, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that servitude, than become one to the gods, that he was the more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for their service, by having practised under their perfectest resembler;
and at last so passionately beg'd a pardon for having so much endanger'd
<hi>Izadora</hi>'s safety, as to have brought it to an equal Fight, (though his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
had been both his and her ruine) and so admirable declam'd upon
a speculative and recluse life, that we could not more absolutely excuse
what he had done against us, than admire what he had done for us; which
had it not been of a quality that had plac'd us above the thoughtsof any
other felicity, <hi>Izadora</hi> had esteem'd a real Nunnery, and I the taking of
<hi>Flamminius</hi>'s habit a blessing. But what he had perform'd, render'd fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
what he had spoken; and his actions were more eloquent, than his
words. When this great man had spent about an hour with us, he took
his eternal leave, with a look asserene as his thought, and with words as
heavenly as his profession; we both accompany'd him, as far as we durst,
and then casting our selves at his feet, we implor'd him, by his Prayers, to
preserve us in that condition, as his Virtue had placed us in; which having
faithfully promis'd to endeavour, he return'd to that holy Society, of which
he was the greatest glory, and the noblest portion. After our tears were
something lessen'd for so sad a separation, because I had but that day allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me by <hi>Flamminius</hi>'s Aunt to entertain <hi>Izadora</hi> in, (which too, was a
favor above example) I employ'd the small time that was left, to implore
her permission (now that she was in an inviolable Sanctuary, and my Visits
thither prohibited) to return to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Massanissa,</hi> by whose favors
(upon the knowledge of my condition) I made no doubt but to procure
the Senate to enjoin <hi>Blacius</hi> to permit our Nuptials; which course was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
justifiable, since we sought to make use of Power, but to oppose
Tyranny; and to obtain that from Authority, which was deny'd to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
that since the severe Laws of the Society she was in, permitted me
not to see or speak with her, during her residence there, my absence in <hi>Asrick</hi>
or <hi>Italy</hi> was the same; and by my continuance about <hi>Salapia,</hi> I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>Blacius</hi> to suspect she was a conditional, not an absolute Vestal, and
increase his hatred, by increasing his jealousie. These reasons (and my
engagement of a sudden return) obtained her consent for my journey,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96335:118"/>
which I began the next morning, having first sent a friend to beg <hi>Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>'s
permission to pay him the duty of a Son; who returned me word,
that he knew of none which bore that name, but that if ever <hi>Perolla</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
before him, he should esteem it the highest injury he had ever done
him. The grief of this message, was not much inferior to the satisfaction
of having freed <hi>Izadora</hi> from so great a hazard, and the having setled her
in as great a security. But I must acknowledge (Sir, continu'd <hi>Perolla,</hi>
speaking to my Prince) in this Voyage my heart and my tongue were
strangers; for though what I have specifi'd were the pretence of it, yet
the design was to prosecute <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose wrongs to <hi>Izadora</hi> and me,
though they were as hard to be reveng'd as pardon'd, yet I could not but
undertake the former, not being able to grant him the latter, and I esteem'd
the Siege of <hi>Carthage</hi> would furnish me with an occasion. But as I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Capua</hi> to take ship for <hi>Africk,</hi> I met <hi>Scipio</hi> returned from thence; he
Landed at <hi>Lillibeum</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> from whence all the way to <hi>Rome</hi> he was met,
with merited and triumphant Songs and Trophies. That great man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pardon'd my uncivil departure, upon the knowledge of the cause,
told me the particular conditions <hi>Carthage</hi> had submitted unto, without a
Siege, (which are too long to be specified) and which were in substance,
they had acknowledg'd themselves vanquish'd, in such a way, that the
very proofs they had given of that confession, ty'd them perpetually to
continue so. He inform'd me also, as a testimony of their believing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as justly, as absolutely conquer'd, that a Senator asking them by
what gods they would swear to keep the Peace? He was answer'd by <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi>
Even by the very same gods we have found so severe to those that
violate it.</p>
               <p>After I had awhile congratulated a Success which none could doubt,
that were not ignorant of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s quarrel and virtue, and after I had beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his assistance in converting <hi>Blacius,</hi> I took leave of him, and learning
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was about <hi>Carthage,</hi> at <hi>Scipio</hi>'s departure thence, I rowed
down the River <hi>Vulturnus</hi> that night, next morning set Sail for <hi>Africk,</hi> and
in three dayes arrived where I thought my Enemy was; but I found that
but six dayes before, he had embark'd himself for <hi>Asia,</hi> and had elected
the Court of King <hi>Antiochus</hi> for his retreat: Thither I directed my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
resolving to prosecute him with as little intermission, as he had <hi>Izado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
virtue; but the gods were so much enemies to my design, that what
by tedious sickness, what by the crossness of the winds, I arriv'd not there,
'till there was nothing left of the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> but his fame; he himself
being gone to <hi>Prusia</hi>'s King of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> after he had lost the Battel of
<hi>Magnesia</hi> at Sea, by the Cowardice of <hi>Apolonius</hi> his Colleague; who fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, left all the Right Wing of the Enemies Fleet entire, to fall upon
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Squadron that was much shatter'd in obtaining a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over the <hi>Rhodians</hi> which compos'd the Left: But this misfortune was
term'd a Crime by <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Courtiers, who apprehended <hi>Hannibals</hi>
knowledge in War, would soon, if once manifested to their King, discover
their ignorance in it. I cannot omit telling you a passage which perhaps
you may esteem worthy the digression, when <hi>Antiochus</hi> was at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and
<hi>Hannibal</hi> with him, the <hi>Romans,</hi> amongst many other Ambassadors they
sent to that great King, elected <hi>Scipio</hi> for one, who discoursing familiarly
with the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> desir'd to know of him, who he esteem'd the noblest
General of all others? <hi>Hannibal</hi> answer'd, first he thought <hi>Alexander</hi> King
of <hi>Macedon</hi> the chiefest; next to him, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epire;</hi> and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96335:118"/>
                  <hi>Hannibal. Scipio</hi> (smiling) ask'd him, What wouldst thou say <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
if thou hadst vanquisht me. Truly (said he) then I would have
been the chiefest my self. This Reply was the handsomest Compliment I
have heard, for without counting <hi>Scipio</hi> amongst the greatest, he inclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledg'd him so.</p>
               <p>To conclude our Story, I will not tell you all <hi>Hannibals</hi> Actions under
<hi>Prusias,</hi> in his Wars against <hi>Eumenes</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> 'tis enough you
know wheresoever I follow'd him, I found him (by his Military virtue) a
General, and at last (through a thousand troubles and dangers) I came
to <hi>Libissa,</hi> the Town of his Residence, where the next morning I intended
to endeavor the finishing of that Combat in <hi>Asia,</hi> which was but begun in
<hi>Asrick;</hi> and that which gave me the hopes of effecting it with less pain,
was, that by a new contracted jealousie of <hi>Prusias</hi>'s, he liv'd then but as
a private person. The day no sooner appear'd, than I went to <hi>Hannibals</hi>
house, but alas I found all his Domesticks weeping over his dead body, and
inquiring from one of the principallest of them, the occasion of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster;
he told me, That <hi>Titus Quintus Flamminius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Ambassador to
<hi>Prusias,</hi> having seen <hi>Hannibal</hi> in his Court, was so incensed at that object,
by the remembrance of those miseries his Valor had involv'd the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire in, that he never left solliciting the barbarous King, to revenge
their sufferings on the Actor of them, 'till he had obtained an order to
have him delivered into his hands; which the generous <hi>Hannibal</hi> inform'd
of, to prevent falling into a <hi>Romans</hi> power, had that night temper'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Poyson, and hearing <hi>Prusias</hi>'s Guards forcing his Lodgings, cry'd out,
Come, let us end our own misery, and the <hi>Roman</hi> fears, and then drank of
the fatal Cup, which has afforded him that ease, which none that know
him, and Virtue, can participate of, till they are in his condition; but (said
the sad servant) I beseech you (Sir) observe in this example, how much
the present <hi>Romans</hi> do degenerate from their Ancestors; those preserved
their conquering Enemy from Poyson, and these induce a King, contrary to
the Laws of Hospitality, and Faith, to betray his Guest. <hi>Hannibals</hi> servant
could speak no more for weeping; and though I was sorry any but <hi>Perol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
should revenge <hi>Izadora,</hi> yet I was satisfi'd that the gods (by making
him become his own Executioner) evinc'd, his Crimes were great by their
punishment, and declared their justice to be so too, in forcing him that had
been her Enemy, to become his own, and her Revenger. The next day
this great Captain was buried, and my anger dying with the cause of it, I
esteem'd it a duty to attend his body to the Tomb, which had no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
but HERE LIES HANNIBAL, and indeed was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a greater. This Solemnity perform'd, I began to return into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
from whence my Revenge had too long detain'd me, but the misfortunes
I endur'd, and the obstructions I met with were such, that I arriv'd not in
this City, 'till the very day the Inhabitants of it sent to treat with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Spartacus,</hi> which to do byfear, and not by necessity, I esteem'd so
low a thing, that making my self known, I made their duty so to them,
which was to oppose their captivity in a way, that if afterward it prov'd
their destiny, yet at least it would be esteem'd their misfortune, and not
their crime. The first day our success was proportionate to our desires, and
the next, where <hi>Canitius</hi> storm'd, I had the fortune to oppose, and worst
him; but whil'st a fresh Alarm drew me, though not the Guard, from that
Post, by your unresistable Sword, you made a passage for your Army, as
easie for them, as glorious for your self; But I thank the gods (<hi>Perolla</hi>
continu'd) that I was call'd away, for perhaps my sacrilegious Arm might
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96335:119"/>
have been employ'd against a Virtue, which to have fought against, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
would have more troubled me, than to be vanquisht by it, and which
to know, is so great a felicity, that I count my defeat an easie purchase of
it. The news of you possessing that quarter of the Town, no sooner came

               <p>If I thought your justice were not as great as your conquests, I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
after <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Story, that you would not have the patience to
hear my defence, but look upon that as an evincement of my being as
highly guilty of cruelty, as I am confident by that time I have ended speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you will think me free from it; for I will make it evident, that all
those Actions which she alledges, proceed from his inclinations to her, and
to virtue, are only testimonies of his hatred to his father. His high gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity,
and a desire of freeing his Countrey, was, to kill <hi>Hannibal,</hi> my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
friend, which was far worse than to have murther'd me, my death had
ended all miseries with it; but to survive such a friend, was to endure a
torment, which none but he that resented it, can believe; or if I thought
death a greater contentment than life, by that Action he reduc'd me to the
sad extremity of being my own Executioner; but that which was worse
than all this, he design'd to murther that great Conqueror in my own house,
where he would have no Guards but my Fidelity; which to have violated,
had been a breach of Trust, and Hospitality, two of the most sacred Tyes,
and all this under a pretence of serving the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had they not
scorn'd to owe their safety to a sin that had render'd them unworthy of it,
night certainly have found spirits of a temper apt enough to sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to have preserv'd the Publick; but the high esteem they yet pay
<hi>Fabritius</hi>'s memory, for not permitting one of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s own Subjects, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as it were) the eve of their ruine, to poyson him, does sufficiently
demonstrate, they had rather hazard their Empire, than their Reputation;
and certainly if they thought it gallantry in <hi>Fabritius,</hi> not to purchase their
safeties, by only permitting an ill Act in an <hi>Epyrote,</hi> which he had no interest
in, but what his knowledge of it gave him, how much would they then
condemn a <hi>Roman,</hi> when their State was not near in so great a hazard, so
that that which he would have appear an obligation to his Countrey,
would have been really a sin against it, and his family: But besides, who

Life, when I might by so favourable an adventure have purchas'd
that Death, which I would a thousand times have bought by my own, had
not higher considerations, plac'd limits to my just revenge. He pretends
indeed, that he comes to see me, but the event justifies, 'tis to preserve
<hi>Blacius;</hi> he is loaden with wounds for the defence of <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Father,
and spends that bloud for his preservation, which could not have been
more generously spilt, than for his destruction; in a word, he employs
that Life I gave him, to preserve his, that he knew, made mine my greatest
torment; and as if all those were not sufficient wrongs, he makes his House
his Sanctuary, and thereby excludes me, and his friends, from affording
him any demonstrations of our care; but that I look upon as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his guilt, which was of a quality, to make him esteem himself safer
with his Enemies, than with me. But his most unpardonable crime was,
to become a Slave to one of that Family, whose greatest ambition should
have been, to have made all of them his; nay, Courts her with Sighs and
Tears, to accept his Liberty, and by a thousand such unworthy submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
endeavours to make me question his Mothers Faith, which I should
have done, did I not know one of the greatest vices, is to suspect she hadany;
for in a long succession of years, there were none legitimate of our Line
till the degenerate <hi>Perolla,</hi> but with their milk, suck'd a hatred for that of
<hi>Blacius's;</hi> but he had no sooner gotten his health, and lost his liberty, but
more joyful of the last than of the first, he quits <hi>Salapia,</hi> without paying
me the duty of a visit, which was the pretence of his coming thither, and
his impiety not being yet come to the height of attempting my Life with
his own hand, he endeavours it obliquely, by taking up Arms for the
<hi>Romans,</hi> against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in whose party I was so engag'd, that
he could not prosecute their overthrow and effect it, without involving
me in their ruine; and when the great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> had justly censur'd <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> to death, for his pactice with the <hi>Romans, Perolla</hi> (that I might not
suspect the first service he did him, was by accident, but design) engages
all such of his friends as he could seduce, and with them, employs his
Sword, and Life, to redeem my greatest enemies; in which attempt, as
you have heard, he had a success proportionate to his desires; and after
that <hi>Blacius</hi> was found out, and brought to the Scaffold, there to receive
the punishment of his offences, lest I might yet doubt he lov'd his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as much as he hated his Father, he voluntarily embraces Death, to
justify that Truth. Judge (Sir) if ever there were a higher injury than
this, and if by it, my hatred be not as just, as great, for in this one action,
he destroys that Life, he knew (maugre all his ingratitude) I yet lov'd
best, to preserve his, whom I hated most; but he was preserv'd from death
by <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Tears; <hi>Izadora</hi> I say, one of <hi>Blacius</hi> Family, which had he
had any generosity, he should rather have suffer'd, than ow'd his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to such a Deliverer; For my part, the cause of his safety, took away
all my joyes for the effect, and made me celebrate his preservation in Tears:
but though <hi>Hannibal</hi> pardon'd his life, yet he kept him in prison, where
he had still retain'd him, had not the generous <hi>Maharbal</hi> given him his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which he had no sooner obtain'd, than he employes it by bearing
Arms under the <hi>Romans</hi>) for his destruction that gave it him; but perhaps he
will say, he redeem'd that fault by giving <hi>Maharbal</hi> his life; to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that was no satisfaction for the old Crime; but the acting of a new
one, for he was only treacherous to his friends, to repair his ingratitude
to his Enemies, and thereby committed one sin, to act another; he makes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96335:120"/>
the publique, pay for his particular fault, and redeems his own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by depriving the party he serv'd, of so considerable a prisoner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
what happen'd was but an accident, but his taking up Arms was a
design. Thus you see, those actions he most glories in, being diligently
enquir'd into, are found contrary to what they appear'd, and if his best
performances are crimes, what are then his others? He was an earnest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> (my greatest friend) while he continu'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> all
my perswasions, and Prayers, not being able to hinder him so much, as from
acting against him in his person; and as if the knowledge of the affection I
pay'd that great General, were a sufficient cause to creat <hi>Perolla's</hi> hatred
for him, he left his own Countrey, and his <hi>Izadora</hi> too, to prosecute him
under <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and at that famous Battel at <hi>Zama,</hi> a thousand
times ventur'd his own life, to deprive <hi>Hannibal</hi> of his; and though he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that he preserved him, when he might have acted his destruction; yet
I shall beseech you to consider, he is but his own Witness, and whether it
be likely he would have neglected that opportunity, had it been offer'd,
which he has since sought out over all the world, and never declin'd,
whilst there was any possibility of finding it, He was not only content
to injure me in my Friend, but does it too in my Enemy: and that I
might not doubt his perseverance in his former courses, by stealing away
<hi>Izadora</hi> (in which Sin every accessary is a principal) he violates both
Humane and Divine Laws, and rather elects the committing of so high a
crime, than that I should want testimonies of so proportionate a Truth;

and that I hope will not prove in your judgement inferior to any, when

the rigor of War upon us, and that your Justice involves <hi>Perolla</hi> in
the publique Fate, I shall then find my happiness in my destruction, and
more commend Fortune in revenging me upon him, than be displeas'd at
her, for my own and <hi>Salapia</hi>'s ruine. <hi>Spartacus</hi> and all the assistants, were
infinitely surpriz'd at so strange a reasoning, and request: But my Prince
put a silence to the general murmur, by inviting <hi>Blacius</hi> to speak, who thus
obey'd him.</p>
               <p>I attest the gods (said he, lifting his Eyes and his Hands to the place of
their residence) that from the time <hi>Perolla</hi> preserv'd my life, it has been
my misfortune; for if ever since, I deriv'd any joy from this Woman, (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Izadora</hi>) 'twas only learning by my own sufferings, in her want of
Duty, what <hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s were in his Sons immitating her crime; but because
she has told her own story with so much Art, that it may induce you to
consider my resentments, as an injustice, I shall briefly give you a true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it; I confess she had my Command to cherish, and esteem
him that preserv'd my life; but she had it not to give those retributions
to <hi>Perolla:</hi> That ignorance, which (I believe) procur'd my safety, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd that injunction; I found him my Friend, when I gave him my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but she knew him my Enemy, when she gave him hers, Observe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96335:120"/>
too, I beseech you, how confident this young man was of having it; when
the argument he us'd to make her declare that Truth, was only, if she
avow'd it not, he would kill her Fathers Enemy; that which was a just
motive to silence her Flame, was his inducement to invite her to disclose
it; in which one action she doubly injur'd me, in not only being content
to save my mortal'st Enemy, when too, she contributed nothing to
his ruine, but the performing of her Duty, but also in making the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of that safety, the loss of my only Child; she obey'd me, whilst she
knew I was ignorant of what I did, and disobey'd me, when she ignor'd
not what I enjoyn'd, but that also the injunction was just; besides, after
I had preserv'd <hi>Perolla</hi>'s life, when I had both Power and Justice, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
it, by her receiving his prohibited visits, and by making a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of passions with him, she thereby endeavours to induce me to detest
Charity, by converting the effects of Mine, into so sensible a gief; and
when for my successful endeavours and duty to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, I
became <hi>Hanniba'ls</hi> prisoner, she invites an assistance for my Liberty, which
I had declar'd in her hearing was a greater misfortune than that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I was menac'd with; whereby she did offend either my professions or
me; the first, by not crediting them, or the last, in acting against them,
if she believ'd their Truth; nay, she acknowledg'd she was apprehensive
of losing her happiness, in attempting to preserve a part, intending her
Lover by the former, and her Father by the latter, thereby becoming so
impious, as before <hi>Perolla</hi> was her Husband, to give him a precedency,
only due unto that relation: She is so earnest to disoblige me, that she
impudently confest, she put her self in the highest perplexity she was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, to involve me in a resembling one. When I was got out of prison,
in the hurry of that change, she endeavours to extort a declaration from
me, that in a setled temper of mind, she knew my judgement would deny;
gives <hi>Perolla</hi> unjust praises, to make me give him an unjust reward, and
would render that an act of Friendship for me, which was but one of
Friendship to himself, as you may be pleas'd to remember I then largely
evinc'd; but when the second time I was taken, whether it proceeded
from their revenge, or my own misfortune, I will not positively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
Alas (Sir) how ungrateful was her carriage? she says that she
came to preserve my life, but her actions say, 'twas to preserve <hi>Perolla</hi>'s
and when her Fathers, and her Loverslife, came in competition, she gave
up the first a Sacrifice, to preserve the last from being one; neither can
she alledge this impious proceeding, was an effect of a precipitate electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon a suddain emergency; for after she had publish'd her Love was
the god over her Duty, <hi>Hannibal</hi> (startled at a Declaration which was
even a Monster in Nature) gave her, not only leasure to reflect on her
crime, but power to recall it; yet she, to demonstrate that the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Father, was a premeditated design, and not a hasty choice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severes
in, and repeats her impiety, when he that was to receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it condemn'd, and detested it: which action of Virtue, her
depraved reason makes a confirmative argument for her continuing in her
vice,
This (Sir) which I alledge, would be, I believe, the reasoning of
a stranger, which has any, but now I beseech you, let us take her own
sence upon this way of proceeding; she first alledg'd, that I had not been
gratefull enough to <hi>Perolla's</hi> Virtue, and that now she was to act my part,
she would make him know what his performances were, and what my
gratitude should have been by her Retributions. To this I answer, that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96335:121"/>
besides my former saving his life, after his Father treacherously endeavour'd
to take away mine, the condition I then was in, sufficiently confirm'd
my Gratitude; for the same Proclamation which gave her a rise to save
my life, by her declaring who 'twas that fore'd the Prison for my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
gave me the same power, (for no one was excluded by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest)
which my Gratitude made me decline, and rather elect to lose my
own life, than secure it by hazarding my preservers; (for I was confident
the Guards were too strict to have admitted his going out of <hi>Salapia</hi>) and
though as in this action I evinc'd, that I preferr'd my Gratitude, before my
life, so I did too, too, that I preferr'd death, before any alliance with <hi>Pacuvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s
Bloud; yet she persever'd in a passion, which tended to that, or a more
unlegitimate end; Hernext allegation is as vain as the first; for to justify she
murther'd me with a good intention, she designs to murther her self, as if one
crime could expiate another, or as if having kill'd one of the Family, the
destroying of the residue, were a sufficient reparation; No, Sir, she loves
<hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Bloud so much, that she has a hatred to her own, for being the
object of his, and so weds his resentments, that she executes her Father, herself, and consequently all her family, to act them; but my enemy wasmore
merciful than my Daughter, for I receiv'd that life from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which
<hi>Izadora</hi> deny'd me, and though those Crimes (her Constancy in a forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Flame, and her seeking Death, because of a supposed loss which she
knew, was my satisfaction) might have induc'd me to consider her suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as an immediate justice of the gods, for her want of duty; yet as
soon as <hi>Hannibal</hi> threaten'd to be their instrument in it, I not only hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Life and Fortune to prevent it, but also embrac'd her satisfaction
with so much concern, that rather than continue her languishings, I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to set a period to them by giving her to <hi>Perolla;</hi> which I had effected,
had not he at the same time I was acting his felicity, been robbing me of my
Glory; for though he attributed his immediate leaving of <hi>Salapia</hi> after
<hi>Hannibal</hi>'s repulse, to a design of suppressing any jealousie his continuance
in it might create, yet I was perfectly inform'd, 'twas his Ambition not
his Respect, that caus'd it; and his speedy return to the Camp, was only
to ingross an honor to himself, which in a good proportion was built with
my Bloud; neither did his long abstaining from justifying himself to me,
proceed (as his Mistriss said) from his ignorance of my resentments, but
from his being conscious of the justice of them; (And though she magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>Pacuvius</hi>'s Sons gallantry, in crediting my Change, I must only his
Reason, since in that only, by what I had already done, he might well
credit any thing I should doe. But after that, by <hi>Perolla</hi>'s new affront, I
had alter'd my resolutions, by esteeming him unworthy of my Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that esteem'd me unworthy of justice, and after that, by my
former concessions, I had manifested to her, my present resentments
were effects of my Reason, and not of aversion for her Lover, yet
she was so far from sympathizing with me in my legitimate resolves,
that when I presented her <hi>Flamminius,</hi> who wanted nothing but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Pacuvius</hi> Family, she was notonly content to decline the Husband I
approv'd, but elected one I justly abhorr'd; and when his being more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
in <hi>Affrick</hi> on her Revenge, than his Love, which might have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lessen'd hers, had like to have render'd her disobedience without
excuse, she determines to abandon her Father, and the World, rather than
a negligent Lover; and was satisfy'd with no way of being reliev'd from
her Distress, unless she increases her own Crime, by making <hi>Perolla</hi> act
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96335:121"/>
another; nay, so much abhorrs any thing from her Fathers recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Flamminius</hi> coming to her upon that score, she will rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
her Lovers Bloud, than spare his. To conclude, that her impiety
might be uncapable of any accession, and to resemble her Servant as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
in Sin, as in Affection, she (like him) by stealing away, violates all
Divine and Humane Laws; and her not being Married, which she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to qualify her Crime, is an aggravation of it, for flying from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to her Husband, had been only an offence in giving <hi>Perolla</hi> that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but flying from her Father to her Lover, she must be more oblig'd to
Mens Charities, than to her actions, if they have not thereby as bad a
Character of her Chastity, as I of her Duty. These (Sir) said <hi>Blacius,</hi> are
my reasonings, and as I believe they are not much dissonant from Truth,
which gives me a confidence, that if your justice be proportionable to
your power, you will right an injur'd Father; but if her Sex moves you
to pitty, <hi>Perolla</hi>'s I hope will not; your punishment of him will oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repair my wrongs, for either his death will be the occasion of hers, or
if she revive him, her torment, or her cure, will be my satisfaction. This
discourse did but increase that wonder <hi>Pacuvius</hi> had given a being unto;
And my Prince was preparing himself to declaim upon a Theme, which
would have furnish'd reasons to a Judgement as ill, as his was excellent,
when he was diverted by a noise, and suddainly perceiv'd the occasion of
it, was the coming in of <hi>Granius, Furiles,</hi> and some other Officers of his
Army, that presented him with two <hi>Salapians,</hi> whose very sight almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
<hi>Pacuvius,</hi> and <hi>Blacius,</hi> both of theirs, and of their Lives: <hi>Spartacus</hi>
observ'd it, and so did our generous Lovers, but being ignorant of the
cause, they expected with much patience to learn it, which they soon did,
by one of the <hi>Salapians,</hi> addressing himself to <hi>Spartacus,</hi> in these words.
Sir, we are come to beg Justice of you, for you, These two Gentlemen
(pointing at <hi>Pacuvius</hi> and <hi>Blacius</hi>) whose guilt is as much in their Faces,
as in their Hearts, observing in the Assault, that my Companion and I, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
our Lives somewhat prodigally for the defence of our City, inferr'd
from thence, that we would hazard them, to be reveng'd on the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of it; and in this Faith came severally to us, and by assurances of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
rewards, hir'd us by our treachery, to destroy what we could not
by our Swords. This office we accepted; were seemingly wicked, but to
be really the contrary; and undertook to kill you, that we might preserve
you; for we apprehended our declining their overture, might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them to invite some others to embrace it, where the greatness of
the reward, might have cover'd the greatness of the crime; besides (Sir)
for us to have undertook such a design, had been a Sin against Gratitude,
as well as Honour; for we are two of those that receiv'd our Liberties,
when we expected our Deaths, and if we employ'd those Lives against you,
which we receiv'd from you, 'twas not only by your permission, but by
your command; and since to obey you, we durst draw our Swords against
you, you cannot suspect we will decline any other obedience. The <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
had no sooner done speaking, than <hi>Blacius</hi> first, and afterwards <hi>Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
acknowledg'd by their words,, what their tremblings and disorders
had confest; and though they severally alledg'd, that the ignorance they
then were in, of my Prince's virtue, and their knowledge, that in him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consisted the Life and Soul of his Army, had induc'd them to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
yet all the Assistants (but the generous Lovers) were so enrag'd
at them, for their Tyranny to their Children, and their intended trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96335:122"/>
treachery to so mild a Conqueror, that there was nothing heard in that
great Assembly but Cryes, that <hi>Spartacus</hi> should revenge himself, that he
should extirpate such Monsters out of the World, and pay with their
Lives, those Crosses which they had given to <hi>Izadora</hi> and <hi>Perolla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Granicus</hi> too, and the other Officers that came with him, inform'd
<hi>Spartacus,</hi> that they had been already condemn'd by a Court-Marshal
upon that Article, That whosoever endeavour'd the death of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
should receive his own, for his punishment, so that he had nothing to
do, but to give the Law its course, which in that case to oppose, was not
to be merciful, but unjust. All this while the generous Lovers were so
confounded, that had not their innocence been known, their disorders and
trouble, had been taken for their Guilt; but my Prince having whisper'd
something privately to <hi>Euriles,</hi> he went to <hi>Izadora,</hi> and her generous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
begg'd them to excuse an execution which <hi>Blacius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
had it been only for their cruelty to them, that in their deaths they
might read the justice of the gods, by rendring their vices, (which had
been the cause of their own troubles) the occasion of their Parents pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and of their own quiet; that since for him to be just, would
make them happy, he hoped they would pardon a revenge, which he
inflicted as much upon their score, as his own. Then my Prince bid
<hi>Euriles</hi> carry away the Delinquents, to receive the censure had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthem.
At that sad command, both <hi>Izadora</hi> and <hi>Perolla</hi> cast themselves
at <hi>Spartacus</hi> Feet, which having a while wash'd with their Tears, they
begg'd him either to alter his sentence, or permit them to participate in
it; that if the death of their Fathers must be the only way to their union;
they would be content with the being eternally deny'd it, rather than
purchase it at that rate; that they should be more miserable in the loss of
their Parents, than in their cruelty: and lastly, they protested by invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Oaths, if they suffer'd; they would perpetually banish themselves
from each others company, and either by grief or resolution, suddenly
follow them. Then rising up from my Prince, they prostrated themselves
at their Fathers Feet, where they again reiterated those engagements,
and in such passionate terms, and moving actions implor'd their pardons
for those disobediences their Lovers, (not they) had committed, and
which they would suddainly repair, by embracing a resembling destiny to
theirs, that my Prince could not abstain from crying out, Tyrants, are
you so much fortified against Virtue, that so powerful an assault, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
fruitless? can Fathers see that without pity, which Strangers cannot?
can Nature be insensible against the attempts of Nature? Whilst <hi>Spartacus</hi>
was speaking many things of this quality, <hi>Izadora</hi> and her generous Servant
had by their weepings so laid their Fathers rage, as showres do storms,
that those Clouds of hatred, which had so long hinder'd Reason, and
Nature from shining, began by little and little to dispell, and they were
no sooner absolutely vanish'd, than <hi>Blacius</hi> first went to <hi>Perolla,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuvius</hi>
afterwards to <hi>Izadora,</hi> and in more Tears, than Words, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
their repentance, and conversion, and when their several passions
permitted them to speak, they joyfully commanded them to consider their
sentence; but as a tribute to the Law of Nature, and War, and that they
should in the joys of their union, extinguish all the sorrow their Deaths
could inspire, which they protested was not so great a trouble to them, as
that they had so long, and cruelly hinder'd it.</p>
               <p>I am, I confess (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) unable to tell you <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
at this change; he first ran to the Fathers, embracing them, pardon'd
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96335:122"/>
them, and gave them as many thanks for their conversion, as if he had been
to enjoy the effect of it; then he went to our generous Lovers, told them,
that his private Commands to <hi>Euriles</hi> were much different from his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ones, that he seem'd to be cruel, but to make their Fathers just; that
he was glad an attempt against his life, had setled the Felicity of theirs
which he would have gladly bought by the attempts, having been turn'd
into an execution. I should lose my self, did I acquaint you with <hi>Perolla</hi>'s
and <hi>Izadora</hi>'s extasies, with <hi>Pacuvius</hi> and <hi>Blacius</hi>'s embracings, their beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mutual Pardons for a hate, which then was converted into as great
a friendship, and with all their gratitudes to <hi>Spartacus.</hi> To finish their
Adventures, 'tis sufficient I tell you all things changed their Faces, and
those passions of Hatred, Fear, and Revenge, resign'd their places unto
Love, Friendship, and Kindness, and as soon as those wounds <hi>Perolla</hi> had
receiv'd from the Sword; permitted him to heal those he had receiv'd from
Love, he was put in possession of his <hi>Izadora,</hi> which was a felicity so far
above needing a foyl to set it off, that his past troubles and crosses were
not consider'd, but forgot; And lest you should think I have the two
<hi>Salapians,</hi> or <hi>Spartacus,</hi> I will tell you, that the former had abundant cause
given them of satisfaction, and the latters Adventures I will now resume,
where I broke them off.</p>

of so perfect an Union, wherein he omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which might testify his satisfaction at it;
That the <hi>Salapians</hi> might for ever remember, and
be sharers in the joy; <hi>Spartacus</hi> assembl'd the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of them together, and in terms as obliging as
the action it self, inform'd them: That least they
might alledge <hi>Perolla</hi>'s Courage drew them into
their misfortunes he protested, the just esteem he
had of it, and of his virtue, made him restore them to their former free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
That for his sake, and the fair <hi>Izadora</hi>'s, he would immediately
withdraw his Army from their City, which should never approach it again
but for their preservation, for which he would at any time relinquish his
own designs, and repeat as great dangers to defend, as he had done to take
it. This generous declaration (as they all profest) afforded them a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
far transcending the grief they resented, for that loss, which
gave my dear Master the power of thus obliging them; and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
their gratitude, as well as contentment, they deputed immediately
from the body of the People, certain select Citizens to the generous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
where after an Oration (too tedious to be remembr'd,) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that since their own sufferings, had been the cause of their Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
they were so far from deploring them, that they would willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
greater, if they might produce a resembling effect. These Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
were no sooner finisht, than <hi>Spartacus</hi> went to take his leave of <hi>Perol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
and <hi>Izadora,</hi> the last of which (in both their Names) conjur'd him to
acquaint them who he was, for they could not fancy, so sublime a virtue
had a disproportionable extraction. Alas Madam (said my Prince, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surpriz'd) what is it that you ask of me? then after some deep sighs
(which the reflection on his miseries forc'd from him) he continu'd; I take
the gods for witnesses, (fair <hi>Izadora</hi>) did not an inviolable Vow tye me
to a concealment of myself, I would have satisfy'd your curiosity, as soon
as I had known it, but all that I dare inform you of, is, That I had my
birth in <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a;</hi> that I am born a Prince of the greatest bloud of the World;
that an infelicity in Love has not made me abandon my Countrey onely,
but my hopes, and forces me to languish in as high torments, as you are now
in joyes. These sad words, and the remembrance of the cause which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them, struck <hi>Spartacus</hi> with so black a melancholly, that it prov'd
contagious, and communicated it self to the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> and her generous
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96335:123"/>
servant, who judging what those misfortunes must be which could have so
powerful an ascendent, over so admirable a courage and judgment, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
converted those Prayers which they had used for the learning of his
Adventures, for his Pardon in having desir'd a knowledge of them. After
that <hi>Perolla</hi> in civility and sympathy, had awhile continu'd in silence, he
at last interrupted it, by saying to <hi>Spartacus,</hi> Generous Prince (for I
should have given your Virtue that Title, had I yet been ignorant of your
Birth) since you are resolv'd that we shall only know you by the felicities
you have plac'd us in, permit me to offer you that life you have preserv'd,
and made me relish; perhaps it may serve you, and help to build for you,
what you have perfected in me; I know the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> will dispense with
my absence, when she considers the cause of it, and will be as much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
with my Gratitude, as with my Company. This I implore (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Perolla</hi>) as the only means to let you know my resentments, whose
greatness you cannot suspect, since I beg even to forsake <hi>Izadora,</hi> to acquaint
you with them.</p>
               <p>This offer (said <hi>Spartacus,</hi> embracing <hi>Perolla</hi>) is far more obliging,
than if it were acted; for I know no way which could render me more
unworthy of it, than the accepting it: Neither could I embrace so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a motion, without being as much an enemy to my own happiness, as
to yours; for the only consolation in my misfortunes is, that they have put
a period to yours, and by your abandoning the excellent <hi>Izadora,</hi> that also
would be revisht from me. I should never finish my relation, did I acquaint
you with all those noble tears and expressions which were shed, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
at my Princes departure; but, in a word, to describe the strange ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it had, not only <hi>Pacuvius</hi> and <hi>Blacius,</hi> but all the <hi>Salapians</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolable,
and so justly admir'd his Virtues, that they almost accounted it
a misfortune to return to their former liberty, since the being deprived of
his company, was the rate of that purchase. At last all the divisions and
Squadrons of my Princes Army marched out of the City, rather like Friends
than Conquerors, and received at the Gates so liberal a Largess, that they
had as much reason to be satisfied with the <hi>Salapians,</hi> as the <hi>Salapians</hi> had
to be so with them: All the Nobility and Gentry, accompanied him two
Miles on his march, where they made him so many fresh Retributions for
his Civilities, that he found his Sword had not been the only thing which
had Conquer'd them. 'T was at this last farewell that <hi>Spartacus</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his leave of all the rest, reiterated his Vows of perpetual Friendship
to <hi>Perolla,</hi> whose grief was of a nature not to be exprest by any thing, so
well as silence. But alas those Glories and Triumphs lost that name, or at
least their operation with my Prince, he languisht in the midst of Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and had been more obliged to Fortune, if she had presented him with
Death, instead of Lawrels. All that day, and the next following, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in so silent a melancholy, that those which knew not the Cause, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
at the Effect; but at last finding, that Time did rather improve,
than diminish it, I took the confidence to conjure him by what he had so
lately heard, to banish his despair, that his Love could not be more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> success than <hi>Perolla</hi>'s had been, and that I was confident the gods
had shew'd him so miraculous an example, to raise and fortifie his Faith.
No, no, <hi>Symander,</hi> (said my Prince) the gods are resolved never to let me
see the joyes of fruition, but in others, they will give me the power to
create all mens felicities but my own; and to speak truth, they have so far
ruined me, that it is as little in their Power now, as Wills to restore me;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96335:124"/>
for <hi>Parthenissa</hi> is fallen into a Crime which admits no cure, and her loving
me again, would but render her more unworthy of my love, for she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now be kind, but by a new vice: Had the cruel gods been pleas'd to
have raised me but as great Crosses as <hi>Perolla</hi>'s, I might have strugled with,
and perhaps overcome them as well as he, and should never have repined at
my Afflictions, could I have propounded a possibility of ending them; but
at the same instant that they made me wretched, they made me uncapable
of being otherwise, and gave me no hopes in my torments, but that their
greatness would prove their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure; whereas when they made <hi>Blacius</hi> hate
<hi>Perolla,</hi> they made <hi>Izadora</hi> have a Passion for him; when they brought
him to be executed, he received his life from <hi>Izadora</hi>'s love; the cause of
his preservation, being more pleasing than the preservation: and when they
made <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ibal</hi> his Enemy, they made <hi>Izadora</hi>'s constancy his Friend, and
gave it power to triumph over all obstacles; so that all his miseries were but
demonstrations, and endearings of his happiness, he had never impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to wrestle against: For if the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and <hi>Blacius,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
or converted, he had alwayes <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Heart, and Arms, ready to
receive him; so that his obstructions (unlike mine) were in the way, and
not in the end. 'Twas with a thousand such Reasons as these, that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
mine; and indeed they were uttered with such violence, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my arguing would rather inflame, than lessen his grief, I determined to
choose a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itter season for my design. The night which succeeded this day,
as soon as the Army was Campt, and the Guards plac'd, <hi>Spartacus</hi> (who
long'd to be in his designed solitude) sent for all his chief Officers, and
spoke to them to this effect.</p>
               <p>Since (my generous Companions) we took up Arms only for our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to repair our wrongs; and since the gods have contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and perfected our designs, it is high time to think of laying them
down: But before we put this resolution in practice, let us face <hi>Rome,</hi> and
shew her by so bold an Action, that what we intend to perform, is our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
not our necessity; from thence, if their fears will not give us new
occasions of glory, let us march directly to the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which having crost,
every man may return into his own Countrey, and I make no doubt, but
passing thus through the heart of <hi>Italy,</hi> I shall load you with as much wealth,
as glory. I must acknowledge (said <hi>Symander</hi>) that he extended himself
eloquently, and largely upon this subject; but because I have so long dwelt
on <hi>Izadora</hi>'s Story, I am resolv'd to repair that fault, by cutting off all
things that are not absolutely essential in my Princes. This motion found
its wisht effect, for his Army were as desirous to secure what they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as my Prince was to be a Hermit; and truly he so doted on recluse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and upon any thing which nourisht his melancholy, that he would
have prefer'd a Cell, before a Throne, and often told me, that since the
gods would not afford him a Crown of Myrtles, he would never wear one
of Lawrel.</p>
               <p>In brief, the Senate having advice that we took the direct way towards
<hi>Rome,</hi> sent <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Lentulus</hi> (both their Consuls) to meet us, as to
the most dangerous War they could employ them in; and the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome,</hi> by a thousand Sacrifices, and publick Humiliations, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
a fear, the justice of which, was soon made evident by an entire loss
of their Armies, which in a pitch'd Field we absolutely defeated; but this
Victory was bought, rather than won by <hi>Spartacus:</hi> For he purchas'd it by
the loss of all the <hi>Germans</hi> in his Army, who, in a bravery, having quitted
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96335:124"/>
that Post my Prince had assign'd them, found their destruction in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and their punishment in their fault: <hi>Canitius,</hi> who command ed
them, came covered with wounds, and vowed to <hi>Spartacus,</hi> that thouigh
he had been a sharer in their Sufferings, he was not in their Crime; whcch
Protestation my generous Master accepted; as his excuse. But this suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ess
hinder'd us from viewing <hi>Rome,</hi> though we might have done it in a ar
nobler posture than at the first time, being now more loaden with success,
than we had been with chains. But my Prince, who design'd to face those
stately walls only, because 'twas dangerous, now declin'd it, because 'twas
safe; and thought what he intended for a Gallantry, would look (after
the Consuls defeat) like an insulting; we therefore left <hi>Rome</hi> on our left
hand, and march'd without any opposition, into that <hi>Gaule</hi> which extends
its self along the famous River <hi>Poe,</hi> so celebrated by the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Eridanus. Cassius</hi> the Pretor, and Governor there, thought
with a select Army of 10000 Men, and by the advantages, and straights
of the Countrey, to interrupt our passage, but he found by the loss of his
Army, that Resolution, and Conduct, can overcome all obstacles; he had
not the misfortune only to outlive his loss, but to carry the news of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Senate, who were so highly troubled at these successive dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters,
that immediately as a punishment of the Consuls faults, or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
they recalled them, and gave the ordering of the War to <hi>Marcus
Crassius,</hi> (one of those that compos'd the first and greatest Triumvirate)
and raised so vast an Army for him, that the same of it coming to my
Princes knowledge, it kindled that fire of glory in him, which had been so
long cover'd, and made him lead back his victorious Troops towards this
new General, lest if ever he were discover'd, the world might think his
abandoning <hi>Italy,</hi> proceeded from the noise of those Forces, and not from a
premeditated intent. <hi>Crassus,</hi> attended by all the Gallantry of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, joyfully understood that <hi>Spartacus</hi> was saving him the trouble of
a march, and the less to harrass his Army, expected my Princes approach in
the fertile Plains of <hi>Romania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be short, the night before the design'd Battel, <hi>Crassus</hi> sent <hi>Memmius</hi>
(his Lieutenant General) with two select Legions, to lie in Ambush on the
Left Flank of our Army, and strictly commanded him, That upon no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
he should discover himself, till both Bodies were joined, But my
Prince, who is the vigilantest Captain living, and of whom no advantage
is to be gotten, but what is given by Fate, sent two Soldiers in the habits of
<hi>Italian</hi> women, to a height which was unsecure for our Scouts, and which
look'd into the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, where under a pretence of Sacrificing for the
safety of their Army, they became the Intelligencers of ours, and soon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiz'd
<hi>Spartacus</hi> of this stratagem; but before he could engage them,
they had recover'd a fastness, where 'twas impossible to make use of force,
but yet next morning before the Battel was ready to begin, he gave <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
so seeming an advantage, that thereby he himself gain'd a real one,
and by so sad an Argument as the cutting in pieces of 8000 <hi>Romans,</hi> made
both the Lieutenant, and his General, of an opinion that he was invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Those that fled, were again receiv'd by <hi>Crassus,</hi> and having cast away
their Arms to save their Lives, he furnisht them with new ones, but first
made them give security, that they should keep them better than they had
the former, and then reviv'd that strict Discipline of Decimation, where
every tenth Run-away was executed in the sight of the whole Army; so
that 500 ran to receive from their Friends that Death with shame, which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96335:125"/>
with less pain, and with Honour, they might have had from their Enemies.
But for <hi>Mummius,</hi> his rebuke was so just and sharp, that he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the Camp, and by a lingering Death justifi'd, that whosoever in
War undertakes an Attempt without Order, must either make Victory his
Apology, or render himself uncapable of making any other. This Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
hinder'd the Feast, for <hi>Crassus</hi> perceiving a pannick terror in all his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
would not expose those to our Swords, whose fears had already half
conquer'd them, but was so much more a Friend to his Countrey, than his
Ambition, that he advis'd the Senate to send for <hi>Pompey</hi> back, and rather
endeavor to preserve, than increase their Empire. Three dayes successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
my generous Prince presented the <hi>Romans</hi> Battel, and the fourth day, as
he was going to take up his late design of marching over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
of confining himself eternally, in their greatest horrors he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a solemn Embassy from those <hi>Sicilians</hi> which had cast off the <hi>Roman</hi>
yoke, wherein they protested, That his Fame, and not their Necessity,
made them choose him their Prince; That though the latter was pressing,
yet the former was the only motive of their Election; That he could not
employ his Arms more gloriously, nor more charitably, than for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
That the only hope that his Courage would protect them, inflam'd
theirs: But if they were supprest before he came, they would sell their
ruine so dearly, that he should not be asham'd to acknowledge them his;
and that they would all take up that consolation at their Deaths, that they
dy'd Subjects to the great <hi>Spartac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sicilian</hi> Deputies accompany'd their Oration with so many tears,
that my generous Master, though he declin'd the Title of their Prince, yet
he did not that of their Friend; and having compos'd a considerable Body
of Men, as well for their Numbers, as their Resolutions, he Convoy'd them
with all his Army to the Fare of <hi>Messina,</hi> and from thence sent them over
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where they renew'd the War with such success, as at length that
fertile Island was upon the point of changing their old Lords. The daily
intelligence of our Companions Victories, and of the wealth which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them, so fixt all our Army upon participating of both, that they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
beg'd <hi>Spartacus</hi> to finish their labours, by setling them in so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Countrey, who willingly yielded to their requests, perceiving that
<hi>Crassus</hi> absolutely declin'd a Battel, and that now he might with Honour
profecute his old design, having no Enemies that durst oppose him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given his Soldiers for their Reward one of the pleasantest Kingdoms
in the world.</p>
               <p>Consider, I beseech you, how deep a root his Melancholy had, when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
nor the empire of <hi>Rome</hi> (which he might almost as easily have
possest, as desir'd) could neither tear it up, or so much as shake it; and
truly, to the best of my observation, I never perceiv'd him pleas'd but in
dangers, and never so much troubled, as when he had avoided them; which
I attributed to the height of his grief, whose torment was so great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that he would even have joy'd if Death itself had eas'd him of it. But
to effect this determination, understanding that <hi>Menas</hi> rid with a good
Fleet in that small Channel which separates <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>Sicily,</hi> he employ'd
an Express to him, who by large promises and gifts, receiv'd an assurance
from him, That if my Prince would march with his Army into a <hi>Pen-insule</hi>
of the <hi>Reggians,</hi> where there was good quarters for his Army, and a good
Road for his Fleet, he would not fail within ten days, there to receive and
obey his commands. Immediately the Messenger return'd with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96335:125"/>
and soon after <hi>Spartacus</hi> mov'd with his Army to the place assign'd,
where, after twice ten dayes expectation, instead of discovering a Fleet,
we only perceiv'd a single Gally, which having cast Anchor, Man'd a small
Skiff, and sent a Gentleman on shore, attended only by two Slaves, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Guards that he desired to speak with <hi>Spartacus,</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
conducted to his Tent, where he soon found it was that <hi>Gallipus</hi> who
had made <hi>Pompey</hi> so just a character of him, that it had like to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his liberty. My Prince remembring it, used him with exceeding ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
and the first compliments being past, <hi>Galippus</hi> thus spake to him; Sir,
I am employ'd by <hi>Menas</hi> to acquaint you, that as he was weighing Anchor
for this Island, we perceiv'd a Sail to the Windward of us, and having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
sent a swift Brigantine to bring us an account of her, they both
came to the Fleet, where <hi>Domitius,</hi> one of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s greatest Favourites,
presented my Admiral with a Letter from the General, (all written with
his own hand) which was to conjure him, as ever he valu'd his friendship,
that laying all other designs apart, he would immediately come to him
with his Navy to <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> where then he was, and where he would
expect him, being newly return'd from the <hi>Asian</hi> War, and from the defeat
of <hi>Mithridates.</hi> This Letter (continu'd <hi>Gallippus</hi>) was accompany'd
with such earnest and reiterated desires, from the valiant <hi>Domitius,</hi> that at
last <hi>Menas,</hi> who fancy'd the business could not be but of exceeding conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
since <hi>Pompey</hi> thought fit to make him the Messenger, and not being
above 18 hours Sail, and the Wind suddenly veering about to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west,
which was as opposite for our Sailing this way as fair for <hi>Greece,</hi> yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his request, and in two nights and a day, having crost the <hi>Adriatick</hi>
Gulph which separates that Countrey from <hi>Italy,</hi> cast Anchor at <hi>Dyrrachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
where my Admiral and I waited upon the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> who first
shew'd us Letters from the Senate, (occasion'd by the apprehensions <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
had of your Army) which recall'd him out of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ia,</hi> to finish the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
War, (for that was (said <hi>Symander</hi>) the appellation the <hi>Romans</hi>
gave it:) Then <hi>Pompey</hi> further told him, That being inform'd by a ship
which accidentally came from <hi>Messina,</hi> that <hi>Spartacus</hi> had contracted with
him to transport him into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he had sent for him purposely to hinder it,
and to desire him, as he valu'd the title of being esteem'd a friend to <hi>Rome,</hi>
not to transport those Slaves from the <hi>Romans</hi> revenge, and his glory, but
as <hi>Italy</hi> had been the Scene of their Rebellion, so to let it be of their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
<hi>Pompey</hi> join'd with those words so many other pressing motives, and
persuasions, that <hi>Menas</hi> desir'd that nights respite to form his resolution,
which was readily yielded unto. I confess Sir, (said <hi>Gallippus</hi>) that the
fear I had of my Admirals yielding, (for whosoever considers whether he
shall do ill, has already done it) made me take the confidence (after we
were retir'd) to tell him, That he ought to prefer the being a Friend to
Virtue, above the being one to the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> That the way he
took, made him unworthy of the end; and that to deserve that title with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
possessing it, was nobler than to possess it without deserving it. I know
(<hi>Menas</hi> hastily reply'd) all thou say'st is true, but canst thou wonder <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi>
that a <hi>Genius</hi> which has triumph'd over <hi>Europe, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rick,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> should
now vanquish <hi>Menas?</hi> No, no, all things yielding to that great man, makes
it no shame for me to imitate them. In a word, seeing I could not make
him continue your Friend, I made him vow he would not be your Enemy.
The next morning <hi>Pompey</hi> having repeated his charms, obtain'd from my
Admiral an assurance not to serve you, on condition not to be employed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96335:126"/>
against you; there were some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonels which mov'd that
<hi>Menas</hi> should take you aboard, and then carry you to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> but
that, both he and <hi>Pompey</hi> detested, the last alledging he would not cheat
himself of a Victory. This being thus determin'd, my Admiral thought
fit to employ me to acquaint you with what had past, to beg your excuse,
to return your Presents, and to protest, that nothing but the great <hi>Pompey</hi>
could have made him violate his engagement. <hi>Gallippus</hi> thus finish'd his
Discourse, at which my Prince was extremely troubled, as indeed he was
at all things that retarded his retirement; but least his melancholy might
be misinterpreted, he made haste to return him this Answer: If your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
had been principled like you, he would never have undertaken to
serve me, or having engaged himself, would have perform'd it; but tell
him from me, I am very much my own Flatterer, if what he has done to
make the <hi>Romans</hi> his Friends, will not produce a contrary effect: For by
necessitating me to stay in <hi>Italy,</hi> he will too necessitate me to conquer it;
and that having hitherto had no designs but of Revenge, he will now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
me with those of Ambition, and force me against my will to be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
But (my Prince continu'd) because you have so generously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
your Captains breach of promise, I give your Virtue that Reward I
should have given his services; and thereupon presented him all those gifts
that <hi>Menas</hi> had return'd, which <hi>Gallippus</hi> made some scruple to accept, but
at last took: And then in acknowledgment of my Princes generosity, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him to sail into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there to hire as many ships for his service, as
would transport his Army thither; which <hi>Spartacus</hi> absolutely declin'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
that he would not have his Gratitude hazard his Ruine; and that
since <hi>Pompey</hi> was coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> he had now left the design of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
it, being 'twas only taken up because he could see no enemies
there, but those which were his Prisoners. <hi>Gallippus</hi> admir'd at his gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and having made him a million of engagements to sacrifice his life and
fortune, when the Honour of his service should afford him an occasion,
took his leave, and return'd towards his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally: But the report of his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to my Prince being diffus'd over the Camp, fill'd some of the common
Soldiers with such a blind rage, that not being able to discharge their fury
on <hi>Menas,</hi> for the violation of his promise, and for leaving of them (as
they falsely said) a Prey to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s victorious Troops, they determined
to punish the innocent for the guilty, and make <hi>Gallippus</hi> pay for his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
crime, who not suspecting any treachery of that nature, was setting
foot in his skiff, attended only by his two Slaves, when a croud of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
men fell upon him; at first he endeavor'd to appease them with an
information of their error, but perceiving they were deaf to all reason, he
retir'd into the Sea to his middle, that none might come behind him, and
there with his Sword resolved to sell his life. One of his Slaves, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him, got an Oar, and being join'd to his Captain, twice preserved
his life, and gave so large a proof of a singular Courage, that my Prince
(upon hearing of this Barbarism, being run thither) admir'd it, and judg'd
that his condition was not answerable to his cloaths; but though <hi>Sparta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>'s
presence and threatnings qualifi'd, yet it did not extinguish the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult;
which he no sooner observ'd, than with his Sword, having killed
three of the most violent, he ended the disorder, by causing five others to
be executed upon the place. All things thus appeased, and <hi>Gallippus</hi> come
out of his Fortification, my dear Master beg'd a thousand Pardons of him,
that his Soldiers had so far violated the Law of Nations; and that if he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96335:126"/>
esteem'd the punishment already inflicted not sufficient for their Crime, he
permitted him to be his own Judge. <hi>Gallippus</hi> assured him, that he had
rather been too severe, than too partial; and having by many Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
repaid his civility, my Prince desir'd to see that Slave, whose Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Valor, deserv'd so plentiful a character. <hi>Gallippus</hi> instantly called
him, and spite of his habit and some blood which endeavor'd to disfigure
him, <hi>Spartacus</hi> observ'd that his shape, and meen, were answerable to his
Courage; and after a little reflection on the inequality of Fate, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
him such ornaments i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ings so disproportionate a Fortune, he very
intentively observ'd the Slave, and found that the Slave was not less fixt in
looking upon him. This made him remember he had once seen some fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
not unresembling his, and as he was calling to mind where it had
been, he heard himfetch a deep sigh, and say to himself, Oh gods! what is
it that I see? am I deluded? or have I already found what I seek? These
few words (which were loud enough for <hi>Spartacus</hi> to hear) put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
strange disorders, sometimes he cast his eyes upon him that spoke them,
sometimes upon the ground, now trembling and looking pale, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
blushing: The poor slave did not only observe those alterations, but
imitated them, which wholly converted my Princes suspitions into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
but the better to confirm himself, he drew him aside, and having
whisper'd something in his ear, they both, to our great admiration, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
one another with admirable Transports; I was present whilst all this
was acting, and was so ravisht with the strangeness and intricacy of the
Adventure, that before I could go to discover what it meant, I perceived
them both returning to <hi>Gallippus,</hi> to whom my Prince said, He that was
once your Slave, (<hi>Gallippus</hi>) now begs one of you, but does not intend
so much to wrong your Valo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s wages, as to expect him as gift: the height
of my desires is, that you will let me have him at any ransom; and if those
Treasures I possess be not of sufficient value, I will lose my Army and my
self, but I will present you too all those in the Capitol. <hi>Gallippus,</hi> who relisht
nothing of his profession, and who thought to excuse himself to <hi>Menas,</hi> in
giving the Slave his liberty, for the service he had that day renderd him,
reply'd, Generous <hi>Spartacus,</hi> you have paid his ransom in desiring his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which from this instant I give him; and all I expect in exchange is, that
you will believe I have been less beholding to him in twice saving my life,
than in furnishing me with the happiness of obliging you. At this noble
Answer, my dear Master ran with open arms to embrace him that made it,
and then sent me for his Cabinet, from whence he took out many Jewels
of an immense value, and by plain force made him accept them. Then
<hi>Gallippus</hi> having acknowledg'd my Princes liberality in words as ample as
the cause of them, and embraced a thousand times his enfranchis'd Slave,
took of both, his last farewell, and went from them with as high a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as he had left them in. <hi>Gallippus</hi> being gone, <hi>Spartacus</hi> return'd to
his Tent, leading his Slave with him, in so high raptures of joy, that both
his looks and actions testifi'd them. They were no sooner come thither,
than he desir'd all that accompany'd him (but I) to give him an hour or
two's privacy, and then he fell again to repeat his Transports with so
much earnestness, that I believ'd in those very embracings he had lost the
thought of ever doing the like to <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> but at last perceiving my
astonishment was the effect of my ignorance, he was so charitable as to tell
me, what! <hi>Symander,</hi> do you not know the Prince <hi>Sillaces?</hi> At those words
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96335:127"/>
my Eyes were unseal'd, and I admir'd as much all that while, I knew him
not, as then I was happy in doing it. I will pass by telling you how I flung
my self at his feet, how I embrac'd his knees, and how I wash'd them with
my tears, since all my Extravaganices were interrupted by <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s who
lov'd so passionately his Friend, that he could not be at quiet, till he had
ask'd him what strange Adventure had reduc'd him to the sad condition he
found him in. I know not (said <hi>Sillaces</hi>) if it be a strange, but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
'tis an advantageous one; for when I least expected to find my liberty,
and my desires, I have lighted upon both; 'tis you (my dear <hi>Artabbanes</hi>)
that I seek, and 'tis only in that employment I have suffer'd miseries, which
nothing could render tolerable, but the reflecting upon him for whose sake
I endur'd them. the gods forbid (my Prince reply d) that I should be
the cause of your sufferings, they are not sure so cruel as to render my
misfortunes infectious; and to make those that share in my friendship, to
participate in my miseries. You have none (<hi>Sillaces</hi> answer'd) unless
you contracted them since you left <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> certainly (said my Prince
exceedingly astonish'd) when you speak thus, you look upon my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not my condition; for there has nothing happen'd since I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
that fatal Countrey, which could afford me any ease of my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but what I found in my courage and resentments. Alas! (reply'd
<hi>Sillaces</hi>) are you still in that darkness which your jealousie cast you into?
must you believe <hi>Parthenissa</hi> criminal, till you appear so your self? and
must I shew you your fault, to shew you your happiness? Yes, yes, (he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd)
I see your suspitions will vanish no other way, prepare your self
then to hear a Story, which these two years I have sought you out to tell
you, and believe it with that faith you would an Oracle, for nothing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
is more certain. That which <hi>Sillaces</hi> tells me, (said my Prince) I
alwayes credit at that rate. You had best (he reply'd) not decline that
practice now, for what I must acquaint you with, will as much need your
faith, as the cure of your Affilictions will stand in need of it. <hi>Spartacus,</hi>
at these last words, had too great an impatience to delay the satisfying it by
any Reply; which <hi>Sillaces</hi> perceiving, began this ensuing Relation.</p>

                  <p>THE same morning, in which by Duel you decided your unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
difference with <hi>Surena, Arsaces</hi> (as he usually did) was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in those pleasant Fields which are water'd by the River <hi>Tygris,</hi> and
as they were the shortest way to <hi>Ninive</hi> from the place you fought in,
so he had not long been there, but he perceiv'd some four or five Men
advancing towards him, carrying something betwixt them, which by the
great care they shew'd of their load, manifested how much they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it; but they were no sooner come near enough to know it was
the King, than one of them leaving his companions, came with all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
signes of an exquisite grief, and flung himself at <hi>Arsaces</hi> Feet, where
the abundance of Tears he shed, hinder'd him awhile from shewing the
cause of them, but at last (though his words were interrupted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sighs) he told the King, I am come (Sir) to demand justice against
one, who has not only contemn'd your Laws, but you also: 'Tis against
<hi>Artabanes</hi> that I ask it, who this morning sent <hi>Surena</hi> a challenge, whose
courage has been so unfortunate, that this last proof of it, has (I fear) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him uncapable of ever giving any other: Yes (Sir) 'tis his Body
that we are carrying back, and his Murtherer is fled, who could I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
I would never have implor'd any other Sword of Justice for my
revenge, than my own, and either punish'd the killer of my Brother, or
not resented the misery of surviving him. That word of Brother, made
us soon know 'twas <hi>Vixores</hi> that spoke it, and truly he so mingl'd his
grief with his expressions, that <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who (you know) doted on that
Favourite, was so inflam'd, that he protested by a world of horrid Oaths,
you should never enter into his Dominions, but to bring your head upon
a Scaffold. Then running to <hi>Surena</hi>'s Body, he flung himself upon it, and
by kissing his pale and bloudy Face, and a thousand such other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
publish'd his Frienshdip and his Grief. I know not whether the
motion in carrying, or <hi>Arsaces</hi> tormenting him, was the cause, but we
soon perceiv'd that he began to breathe, and suddenly after, faintly to
open his Eyes. Oh gods! into what transports did this discovery cast <hi>Orodes</hi>
in, truly he was thereby so overjoy'd, that he perform'd many things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of his years, and Majesty; but that these good symptomes might
be improv'd, a Litter was instantly brought, <hi>Surena</hi> put into it, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to his own Palace, accompani'd (on foot by <hi>Arsaces</hi> and all the Court.
The Chyrurgeons having immediately search'd, and bound up his wounds,
told the impatient King, that till the third dressing, they could make no
positive judgement of his life, but they assur'd him, if his cure lay in the
power of Art, they durst boldly promise it. I was present whilst all this
was acting, and as soon as I found they left <hi>Surena</hi> to his rest, I stole out
of the company and went to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> in hope to learn the subject of
your difference, but alas, I found her so drown'd in weepings, that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
a while the cause of my visit, to bear her company in that sad employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
at length observing, that my weakness did but augment hers, I
interrupted her Tears, by desiring to learn the subject of them, for if
she knew no more than I, she had no just cause for so immoderate an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
Alas <hi>Sillaces</hi> (she reply'd) have not you then understood
what I came from being inform'd of, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> has kill'd <hi>Surena,</hi> and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96335:128"/>
being fled, <hi>Arsaces</hi> had solemnly bound himself by sacred Oaths, that
the reparation of his offence shall be a perpetual banishment? Madam
(said I) 'tis true indeed, <hi>Arsaces</hi> in his passion, when he thought <hi>Surena</hi>
dead, swore what you say, but since, 'tis found that 'twas only a long
swound he was fallen into, and that the hopes of his life are greater than the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ears of his death, so that I believe the King will repent, and recall his
vows. But <hi>Sillaces,</hi> (she hastily reply'd) do you tell me this as a Truth,
or to flatter my grief? I tell you it (Madam, said I) as the former, for I
pay you too high a respect to delude you into a greater sorrow, which I
should unavoidably perform, did I give you a false subject of joy. Then (she
said) one of my greatest fears is supprest, but I am doubtful I shall not so
easily silence the other, which is (for, to you I dare boldly tell my thoughts)
I apprehend I am the innocent cause of this disorder, and that <hi>Surena</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the advantage, <hi>Artabanes</hi> had over him in my affection, has taken this
fatal way to destroy his Rival. No, no, Madam (I reply'd) though I
cannot tell you the cause of their difference, yet I can assure you, that
which you mention is not it, for <hi>Vixores</hi> relation to the King, made us
evidently understand, that the challenge came from <hi>Artabanes:</hi> Oh gods!
(she imediately reply'd) what it <hi>Sillaces</hi> that you tell me? you have
made my admiration as great as my grief; thereupon she began to renew
her weeping with such violence, that I have often since believ'd, some
Divine fore-knowledge of your suspitions, produced her Tears; for my
particular, I was at first as ignorant of their cause, as perplext at their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
but at last, remembring her grief, to repair my error, I told her,
perhaps (Madam) <hi>Vixores</hi> relation had more of design than truth, and
knowing that the Kings Edicts were only rigorous against the Senders,
and not the Acceptors of Challenges, he to exasperate <hi>Arsaces</hi> fury, and
extenuate his Brothers Crime, made that to be <hi>Artabanes,</hi> which was <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>'s
Offence. Alas, (said the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) would your conjecture
were certain, 'twould exempt me from fears, which makes me tremble;
But <hi>Sillaces</hi> (she continu'd) if you have any sense of that affliction, my
suspence has cast me into, I conjure you to enquire certainly, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
what has happen'd, for I verily believe, the knowledge of what I
apprehend, could hardly prove a higher misery than are my doubts. I
was so earnest to obey her, that immediately I went to <hi>Lindadory</hi>'s, as
well to satisfy my Inclination as my Duty to <hi>Parthanissa</hi>'s command, for I
was confident, your Sister was as well instructed with your affairs, as any
other could be; but alas, I discover'd nothing there but fresh causers of
sadness, and found by a melancholly experiment, that the resentments of
Nature, are as violent, as those of Love or Friendship, and at my first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in,
though I had arm'd my self against all weaknesses of that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet the fair <hi>Lindadory</hi>'s Tears were so eloquent, that I thought it no
sin to imitate them; and having mingl'd ours together for our common loss,
I began to do that for her, which I needed as much my self; in brief, I so
fortify'd her hopes, by assuring her, you could not be dangerously wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
since you had strength enough to fly from <hi>Arsaces</hi> choller, and that
<hi>Surema</hi> being in a probability of recovering, 'twas not unlikely to make
him recall a rash vow, where the performance would be a greater sin than
the breach of it; that in the end I moderated her afflictions, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
her how I was employ'd by the unconsolable <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> she
permitted me to follow my enquiry, which though extream diligent, was
absolutely fruitless; for though I ask'd of <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and she of all her
Brothers Servants, and Confidents, yet we could no more discover the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96335:128"/>
of your difference, than suppress the troubles it created. All this

<hi>Orodes</hi> stood all pale, and trembling, and in a far worse perplexity, than
if their sentence were to have been pronounc'd upon himself; at last <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>'s

it lay not in the power of any thing but a Miracle, to recover him; at
this fatal declaration, the King (fetching a deep sigh) fell speechless on
the ground, and <hi>Surena</hi> perceiving so high demonstrations of his favour,
made such excellent and passionate retributions for them, and so
admirably exclaim'd against Fate, not for ending his life, but for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
him to end it in so generous a Princes service, that all which heard
him, found his impiety, rather a justice, than a crime, <hi>Arsaces</hi> being by
many remedies recovered from his fainting, was (before he had the
strength to speak) carried out of his Favourites Chamber, who no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
perceiv'd it empty of all but his Domesticks, sent one of them for the
Princess <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> who being come, was conjur'd by him, to obtain from
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> for him, the honor of a visit, to whom he protested he had
some secrets of Importance to communicate, which should he dye before
they were reveal'd, would leave too great a horror on his Conscience.
The fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi> immediately obey'd his injunction, and came to wait
on <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thenissa,</hi> when she and I, were admiring at the occasion of your si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
The sadness which so visibly appear'd in <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s Face, was at
first attributed by us both entirely to that unimitable Friendship, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Princess paid you, but we soon found, that Nature had a large
share in it. When she had inform'd <hi>Parthenissa</hi> with the occasion of her
visit, your fair Mistriss was extreamly starl'd at it, whether it proceeded
from a Prophecy of what she afterwards learn'd, out of sympathy with <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalinda,</hi>
or from that sad banishment, which would inevitably follow by
your Rivals Death; but to contract your suspension, I will not inform you
of all those pressing motives, his generous Sister us'd to obtain her desires,
since 'tis enough you know they were successful. But <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was no
sooner retir'd into her Chamber; to make her self ready for the intended
visit; than one of her Servants came to inform me, that a countrey-man
which had sought me at my own house, and mist of me there, (being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
where I was) was come to speak with me, having a Packet,
which he said was of some consequence. <hi>zephalinda,</hi> (though she knew
'twas you which had reduced her Brother to that extremity, never lessen'd
her friendship, but was so generous, as to profess she was confident 'twas

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urena,</hi> not you that was the cause of her misfortune) and was so earnest
with me to satisfy her opinion, which was, that those letters were from you,
that to obey her, I was uncivil, and left her alone to go and receive them;
The superscription I scarcely lookt upon, when I knew it to be your hand,
and transported with joy, I ran up to <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and with her into <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>'s
Chamber, where I assur'd them, that not only I should now know
your condition, but the cause of your Duel; but alas, assoon as I open'd
my Pacquet, I found a Letter for the King, and another for <hi>Zephalinda,</hi>
but none for her which did most desire, and most merit one; I confess, my
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96335:129"/>
disorder at it was not far short of hers, but she attributing your silence
to any subject rather than the true one, and believing my Letter might
discover the cause, conjur'd me to peruse it; But oh gods! what astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was mine, when I found what it contain'd? it made me a long time
continue silent, and trembling, and <hi>Zephalinda</hi> had no sooner ended hers,
but it ingender'd the same effect; <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who could not fancy (since
you were living, as appear'd by your Letters) what strange accident could
produce such an operation, broke her own silence, to learn the occasion
of ours. Alas, Madam, (I reply'd) you will be more happy in theigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
than the knowledge of it. If (said she) I knew not <hi>Artabanes</hi> to
be living, your words would make me suspect he were dead, No, no,
Madam, <hi>Zephalinda</hi> answer'd, the certainty he is alive, is not greater, than
having committed his Crime, he is unworthy to continue so. Is it possible
(said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) that he can commit a crime, which may render him
worthy of death in your judgement? Yes Madam, (she reply'd) and
when you have read this Letter (presenting him to <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) I believe
you will be of my judgement; whilst he was the destroyer of <hi>Surena,</hi>
I excus'd the action upon the belief I had, that he was invited to it
by justice, but now I have discover'd he can suspect your Constancy, and
convert a passion of Love, unjustly into one of hatred, he shall find I can
from his Friend, become his Judge, and when his actions are ill, not fear
to term them so. Whilst <hi>Zephalinda</hi> was thus speaking, the unfortunate
<hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>henissa</hi> read her Letter, and no sooner found what was in it, than fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a languishing sigh from the botton of her heart, she only said; alas,
<hi>Arta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nes!</hi> how ill do you reward the purest Flame? and then fell down
at our Feet, without giving any signs of Life, <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> who thought
the sight of her Letter, would have rather inspir'd her with resentment,
than grief, a thousand times condemn'd her own rashness, and by an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
weeping, discover'd her repentance for it; but at last, what with her
help and mine, we brought <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to her self again; but indeed she
employ'd that life we restor'd her to, to torment her self so excessively,
that we found our charity was a disobligation. Yes <hi>Artabanes,</hi> had you but
seen how she deplor'd your inconstancy, and how transeendent her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was, even when she thought you unworthy of it, I am confident the
knowldege how yor were lov'd, would have sufficiently punish'd your
belief, that you were not. <hi>Surena</hi> in the mean while, finding his forces very
much diminish'd, and apprehending he should not have life enough left, to
disclose that which would make his death a less misfortune, sent a servant
of his to know the cause of <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s stay, who finding <hi>Parthenissa</hi> so
well recover'd, as not to need her help, went to give her brother an account
of her employment; but he hardly was inform'd of what had happen'd
when he conjur'd his Sister with fresh impatiencies, to beg <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to
afford him the blessing of seeing her before he dy'd, for he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to reveal, which might set a period to her grief, and which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
was of so high a concernment, that she should never repent the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit.
With this message, <hi>Zephalinda</hi> return'd, and though <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was
in extream disorder, yet we both so effectually employ'd our Prayers, that
we obtain'd what they desir'd, and were no sooner come into <hi>Surena</hi>'s
Chamber, than he begg'd all but your fair Mistriss, to go out of it, which
being perform'd, he told her; (Madam) I know the incivility of putting
you to this trouble, and of leaving you alone in this room, is so great, that
nothing but my weakness could render it excusable; I know too, that as
some expressions of my joy for this transcendent Honor, I should cast my
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96335:129"/>
self at your Feet; but Madam, what is my Apology for the former, must
be also for the latter. I should too (I must confess) be offended at these
wounds, which necessitates me to this rudeness; but Madam, so much is
the respect I pay you, that I cannot be troubl'd at my own torment, when
I consider it as a punishment of having betray'd you; at those words the
fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> fell fresh a weeping, which <hi>Surena</hi> perceiving, he cry'd out,
Oh gods! would I were so blest, as to be the object, and not the occasion
of those Tears; but alas (he continu'd) 'tis in vain to expect a felicity,
which the gods, as well as a perfection as great as theirs, thinks me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of. Know then, Madam, that I have been wicked, in expectation
to be happyy, but having lost the hopes of the latter, I will no longer
practice the former; Yes (fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) those Eyes which are unresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
had that influence over me, which they have over all they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or they which look on them, and inspir'd me with a flame, whose
violence forc'd me to embrace any remedy, that might moderate it; and
finding that my continual sights, did rather cool than enflame your Breast,
I could not fancy but some other possest what I sought: To resolve this
suspition, I courted <hi>Zianthes</hi> Favour with such humbleness and assiduity
that at last I obtain'd it, and from her learnt, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> was the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Man which blasted all my joyes, and possest what I but ambition'd;
I must confess, when I reflected on that seeming passion he had for <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi>
I wonder'd for a while at that Truth, but upon that publique
breach betwixt them, I began to believe the Mistery, and soon after to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
by <hi>Moneses</hi>'s resentment, to see it too visibly; This made me ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
<hi>Arsaces</hi> declaration in my favour, in expectation that <hi>Artabanes</hi> would
not oppose his King, but I quickly found by <hi>Zianthes</hi> intelligence, that
all the operation it produc'd, was only a necessitating you to manage
your Amours with greater privacy, and a bringing of an accession to your
aversion for me. This discovery had so powerful a production, that in
its effects, I had like to have found the cure of all my troubles, and an
exemption from needing that forgiveness, which I acknowledge I cannot
be more ambitious, than I am unworthy of; would to the gods, fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa,</hi>
I had been so happy, for then I had dy'd with this satisfaction, that
I had only merited your pity, and not your hatred; but the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which form our Fates, and permit us not to make them, ordain'd the
contrary, and <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who was too much concern'd in my Life, not to
contribute every thing which might preserve it, so necessarily conjur'd
me to discover the cause of my languishings, that at last I obey'd him, and
gave him a true account of all which <hi>Zianthe</hi> had inform'd me. At first,
that generous King, would publiquely have taken notice to <hi>Artabanes,</hi>
of his daring to contradict, what he had so openly manifested was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and then by some rigorous penalty, have commanded him never
more to see you again; but I absolutely oppos'd this proceeding, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
to the King, that it would infallibly ruine <hi>Zianthe,</hi> who being
the only confident of your Loves, must be immediately known to be the
discoverer of them; that by losing my intelligencer, I should lose my hopes;
and that his violence to <hi>Artabanes,</hi> might perhaps hinder the progress of
his passion, but nothing advantage mine. I will not trouble you will all
those reasons I us'd to make <hi>Arsaces</hi> deeline that overture, since at last he
did it, and immediately caus'd me to send privately for <hi>Zianthe,</hi> where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her large Presents, and larger Hopes, and by telling her how infinitely
he was concern'd in my recovery, so entirely gain'd her, that she promis'd
him, not only to leave no means unessay'd, which might cast a jealousie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96335:130"/>
betwixt you, and your <hi>Artabanes,</hi> but also toact any thing I propounded,
which might conduce to that end. This assurance, which till then by all
my Arts I could never draw from her, gave me my health, by restoring my
hopes, for I could not despair of vanquishing all difficulties, when I had so
powerful an Assistant; But, mada, for a long time we could not fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any design proportionate to our desires, till the <hi>Tabienian</hi> revolt, which
necessitated <hi>Arsaces</hi> to raise a vast Army, to repair that affront they had
done his Lieutenants, and to reduce them to their obedience. This I elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the fittest opportunity to act, what I intended, and besought the
King before that Army was form'd, not to declare who should be the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but afterwards to make <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and the same night he gave him his
Commission, to enjoyn him by inviolable commands, next morning to go
to his charge; This was perform'd as I desir'd, and the same evening, in
which <hi>Arsaces</hi> gave <hi>Artabanes</hi> his Orders, I made <hi>Zephalinda</hi> (who I durst
not inform of my resolutions, for I found her more inclin'd to your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress,
than mine) to invite you to a Ball, where, whilst you were divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your self, I writ a Letter to you, as if that Command <hi>Arsaces</hi> had given
<hi>Artabanes,</hi> was by your advice to me, that we might, during his absence
enjoy a satisfaction which his vigilancy, and presence deny'd us, and fill'd
the rest of the Letter with some expressions, which might make conjecture
you had long honor'd me with a private Passion. This Letter I sent <hi>Zian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi>
and conjur'd her to let it so fall into <hi>Artabanes</hi> hands, as if it had been
by accident, for I knew he would wait your return at your own Lodings,
to kiss your hands before his departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All this was so admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ably acted
by <hi>Zianthe,</hi> that it produc'd the wish'd effect; (as that very night she
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd me) and the more to confirm him in his error, I caus'd a small
Christal Looking-Glass to be made, by one of the rarest Artists in <hi>Asia,</hi> and
by a false screw I artificially put my Picture betwixt the Cafe and the Glass,
and some time before, sent a Merchant to sell it you, which he did, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
of the work inviting you (as I ws confident) to buy it, this glass
you so justly priz'd, that for the most part you carry'd it about you, and
valu'd it, so much above any thing of that nature, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> took
notice of it. <hi>Zianthe</hi> therefore, after she had reveal'd unto him, what by
the reading of my Letter, she seem'd she could not well any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,
the better to confirm that fallacy, shew'd <hi>Artabanes</hi> the Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glass,
which we well observ'd you had often worn, and then by opening
the private screw, discover'd that to him, which you never knew of your
self, and so excellently insinuated, that the este<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m you plac'd upon it,
proceeded more from that which was conceal'd in it, than from that which
was visible, that being fill'd with a rage, which render'd him uncapable
of all things but revenge, he went away, and going down the Stairs, met
with a Servant of mine in the dark, whom I had expressly sent thither, who
seeming to take him for one of yours, desir'd him to tell <hi>Zianthe,</hi> that
you lay that night at my Lodgings with <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and that he
was sent purposely to wait upon her thither. You know, Madam (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
<hi>Surena</hi>) that all that night you honor'd my Sister with your company,
for when you were returning late, I caus'd one of the wheels of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
to be so dexterously broken, that upon the first motion, it fell all to
pieces, so that you were necessitated to remain at my house, which the
deluded <hi>Artabanes</hi> attributed to a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trary cause, and though, that to put
the greater Complement upon me, you evaded, allowing him the honor of
taking leave; for his being made General, and his resolution of going next
morning to his charge, was so suddainly divulg'd, that I am confident all
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96335:130"/>
                     <hi>Nineve,</hi> except those of my house knew it in an hour; but there, I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
such strict order, that none should speak of it, that it came not to
your knowledge, <hi>Artabanes</hi> therefore without so much as answering my
Servant, retir'd to his own house, where, had I seen the defects my delusion
produc'd, I had (it may be) repented it. But Madam, his Griefs had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
operation than I expected, for I believ'd the being so egregiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd,
would have made him decline any resolutions, but those of hating
you, and have induced him to vent his despair, upon the revolted <hi>Tabie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
in which time, by the assistance of your resentments for his so aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
you, and my humility and constant passion, I was not out of hopes
to gain what he had lost; but it seems he abandon'd himself so entirely
to revenge, that as he had lost the hopes of possessing you, so he resolvd
to endeavour I should wear his Livery; in pursuance whereof he sent me
a challenge, which I could not decline, for he that has the courage to adore
you, cannot want it to dispute you; which I did, but the gods, (who will
not suffer infidelity to prosper in Love it self, where 'tis least unlawful)
gave him an advantage over me, which perhaps upon a juster subject he
could not so easily have gain'd: Whilst <hi>Sillaces</hi> (said <hi>Symander</hi>) was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this relation, my poor Master was in so many several disorders, that
in my life I never saw a subject fitter for pitty; but no sooner had his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
friend disclos'd this fatal treachery, than he cry'd out, O gods, <hi>Silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
what is it you tell me? I tell (he reply'd) that, which, if your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
suspition had not been too predominant, <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thenissa</hi> would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
you of, and thereby exempted her self, you, and all your friends,
from that misery, your precipitate and voluntary banishment has cast us
into; but be not so cruel to your self, as to interrupt me in that which
makes your wound, and not permit me to apply the cure: Alas (said <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes</hi>)
'tis not in your power, for though <hi>Parthenissa</hi> should by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of goodness, pardon my crime, yet that it self would but increase
it, by demonstrating, I have offended the greatest Mercy, as well as the
greatest Beauty. You are (said <hi>Sillaces</hi>) very ingenuous to persecute
your self, and your wilfulness is admirable; you will run into a storm, and
then refuse the Harbor. No, generous friend (<hi>Artabanes</hi> answer'd) that
which you call a wilfulness, is a justice, since for a Criminal to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Life, when his Conscience will be more severe than his Judge can
be, is to become as much an ememy to himself, as to Justice. If (said <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi>)
you will not permit me to finish my relation, for the interest you
have in it, yet at least let me obtain that favour, as a reward of those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
I have undergone, to bring you news, which I thought would not
have been altogether unacceptable. I beg a thousand times your pardon
(said my Prince) if the effects of my despair have been so uncivil, but as
a pennace for it, I will no more interrupt your Relation, but listen to
it with as much silence, as my miseries will permit. <hi>Surena</hi> (said <hi>Sillaces</hi>)
had no sooner ended this discourse, than perceiving how strange an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it had over <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> he thus continu'd: Alas (Madam) all the
hopes I had in my misfortunes, I apprehend are groundless, for I expected
by disclosing my fault, to obtain a pardon for it; but I find by your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that you are more inclin'd to Justice, than Mercy. I confess
(said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) you have by your relation, made your self very unworthy
the latter, for by your own acknowledgement, you are no longer wicked,
but because you can live no longer, and 'tis not your repentance, but your
death, which makes this discovery. 'Tis true, Madam (<hi>Surena</hi> answer'd) and thereby learn the power of your Beauty, which violently forces me
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96335:131"/>
to actions against my Inclinations, and against Justice. But Madam, I have
greater hopes of your forgiveness, by submitting, than disputing, and
the more to induce you to it, consider, that if I am the only actor in this
fault, 'tis because I only had the means to act it; that none would have
declin'd my crime, if he had had my hopes; that it lay in my power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
as well as to create your troubles, (for I understand <hi>Artabanes</hi> is too
perfectly deluded, ever to return of himself, and discover the contrary)
consider too, Madam, that I have given you an ill opinion of me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
you to a good one of my Rival, that you will render my death as full
of torment, withour uour pardon, as of quietness with it, and excuse my
fault upon the score, that the purest flame was the creator of it, and that
as it was my first, so 'tis impossible but it must be my last. All the while
<hi>Surena,</hi> was thus speaking, his sighs accompany'd his words, and had so effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
power over the generous <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> that she told him; Yes <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,</hi> you have my forgiveness, and I beseech the gods, that it may render
your death as full of satisfaction, as that crime which made you need it,
will (I fear) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill my life with misery. At the end of these words she went
out of his Chamber, and coming where <hi>Zephalinda</hi> and I were, she told
her (passing by) Ah Madam, your Brother has forever ruin'd me. That
virtuous Princess was as much surpriz'd at this Declaration, as <hi>Parthenis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
had been, when she learnt the cause of it: But <hi>Zephalinda</hi> perceiving
your fair Mistriss was too much possest with grief, to desire an explanation
of what she had said, contented her self to suspend her curiosity till a fitter
season, and having waited on her to her Chariot, return'd to <hi>Surena,</hi>
who she knew, by the emotions of such a visit, would remain in too sad a
disorder to abandon him; but assoon as <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was got home, she learnt,
<hi>Zianthe</hi> had absented her self, which so confirm'd <hi>Surena</hi>'s relation, that
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> immediately fell into a violent Feaver, and the distempers of
her mind, so well conspir'd with the malignity of the disease, that for
seven days together, all the Physitians were in despair of her recovery,
but in the middle of her highest ravings, she would often excuse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you, and in such passionate terms, that in her frenzy, I almost learnt
the subject of it; but at last, the gods who shew'd us our fears, to indear
our joys, heard our Tears, and by a happy <hi>Crisis</hi> asswag'd, and at last
took away her pain and danger; I say our Tears, for <hi>Lyndadory, Zephalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
and I, had hardly any other employment during her sickness, and that
generous Princess was so much more concern'd in <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> than in her
Brother, that as often as possibly she could, she left <hi>Surena,</hi> to wait on
her Rival. Whilst we were thus paying our duty, and care, to your sad
Mistriss, <hi>Arsaces</hi> was not less vigilant, and concern'd about his Favourite,
who, it seems, (was by those powers, which were concern'd in your Loves)
reduced, into a danger of Death, only to extort a discovery from him,

boldly to him, as he was returning from the Temple, where he had been
sacrificing for <hi>Surena</hi>'s health, and told him, that he would undertake to
end his fears, by recovering his Favourite, if for his cure, the King would
build a Colledge for Physitians, and endowe it with a competent Revenue
for their maintenance; <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who easily saw, that to grant the <hi>Ara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his desire, was but to oblige his people in obliging himself, greedily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his request, and promis'd him rewards, which though they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96335:131"/>
yet were but short of his merit; for by an admirable Art, onely
dipping some Linnen in <hi>Surena</hi>'s bloud, and by covering it with a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which he turn'd the Sympathetick, in eight days to our wonder,
and <hi>Orodes</hi> joy, brought your rival out of all fear of death; but the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Physitian, who envy'd what they could not imitate, gave out, that
his cure was not the effects of Knowledge, but of Magick: but the skilful
<hi>Arabian,</hi> to make their malice, as apparent as their Ignorance, promis'd
to publish a Treatise, which should evince, that for his receipt he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beholding to Art. His Enemies therefore, who imagin'd, that he which
could perform a cure, could tell the means how it was wrought, one night
privately murther'd him in his Bed, and so that excellent remedy is, (I
fear) for ever lost, and only appear'd, to make us think it a misfortune.
But assoon as <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was in any condition fit to be spoken to, <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dory,
Zephalinda,</hi> and I begg'd her with such incessant importunities, to
discover to us what <hi>Surena</hi> had to her, that at length she granted our
request. Alas! what disorders were we in at that relation? they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
so great, that for a time <hi>Parthenissa</hi> attributed what was meerly our
astonishment, to a tacite condemning of you, but <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s resentments
against <hi>Surena,</hi> gave her soonest the power, not only to condemn her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but to draw <hi>Parthenissa</hi> out of that error, our silence had lead her
into, by telling her; But Madam, since the gods so mercifully have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
your and <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s delusion, why do you so long let him continue
in torments, whose greatness you may know by your own sufferings, and
which are too high a punishment where his crime as much his design,
as 'tis his misfortune. Madam (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) (who condemn'd you,
but to learn more Arguments for your pardon) it seems then by your
discourse, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> is not faulty, which I must inform you, is a far
different opinion from mine; for was it a sufficient inducement to think
me unconstant, because his Rival said I was so? if he thought me guilty,
why did he not accuse me? and if not, why did he condemn me? is an
accusation then a sufficient convincement? No, no, (Madam) when I
consider the slight foundations his suspitions have, I must believe he has
resign'd his liberty to some new Conqueror, and that which he ascribes
to my inconstancy, is but an effect of his own. Ah (reply'd <hi>Zephalinda</hi>
interrupting her) how unjust are you now to <hi>Artabanes,</hi> as well as to
your self, had he any such criminal design, he would not have expos'd his
life to <hi>Surena</hi>'s Sword; that was too dangerous a counterfeiting? No
Madam, he was deluded so artificially, that he merits rather your pity
than your resentments; for 'twas not only <hi>Surena,</hi> said you were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
but <hi>Zianthe</hi> (your Confident too) whose flight has confirm'd her
guilt; besides your wearing my Brothers Picture, and transcendantly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
the Glass which contain'd it, above all things of that quality, your
absenting your self from his Company, when it might have been the last
time of your enjoying it, and when all <hi>Ninive</hi> knew of his departure,
your making his Rivals house your lodging, and his next days accepting a
challenge to justify your election (as he alleadg'd) were such strong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that I should rather have admir'd if they had not succeeded, than
that they did; whilst I thought him faulty, I was the frist to condemn him,
but now I find him only unhappy, I am become his Intercessor, and if I
prove not a successful one, I will publish to all the world, that 'twas not
the gods cruelty, but <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s ruin'd <hi>Artabanes.</hi> Madam (said
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>) your friendship makes your partial, and you could not but

opinion, for he that could think me uncapable of Constancy, I must make
him so of my affection, and since his believing me guilty of change is his
fault, I am resolv'd it shall be his punishment. If (reply'd the perfect <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalinda</hi>)
you are determin'd to be rigorous, let him rather know his error,
than conceal it; for whilst he thinks you faulty, he may find his cure in
that belief, but to learn the contrary, will prove a torment almost great
enough (if 'twere plac'd on <hi>Surena</hi>) to punish his Treachery. Madam
(said <hi>Lindadory,</hi> who all this while was drown'd in Tears, by an efflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on your sad condition) will you make my Brother miserable, because
others have made him unfortunate? will you make him bear the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Surena</hi>'s fault? and will you not grant him your forgiveness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his rival has reduc'd him to a condition to need, and deserve it?
Would to the gods (<hi>Parthenissa</hi> answer'd) I could find as much reason,
as I have inclination to pardon him; but Madam, the cause of his fault, is
of so misterious a quality to me, that perhaps in forgiving this crime,
I may discover him guilty of a greater, and what I inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d as a Charity,
may prove an offence. Madam (said I) you ought then the sooner to clear
your doubts; neither will we become his Sollicitors, if he obey not your
first summons, and if at your Feet he do not acknowledge the infelicity of
your credulity, and the continuation of his passion: consider, fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa,</hi>
I conjure you, that a longer delay may so confirm him in his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
that his despair may render your mercy fruitless, by driving him into
some fatal resolutions against his Life, or at least, make him elect an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
exile, and I beseech the gods, that already he has not chosen one of
those misfortunes, But why (continu'd <hi>Sillaces</hi>) do I make the way to your
Felicity so long, that I render it a new misfortune, let it suffice, that at last
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> seem'd to give that to our Reasons, which proceeded from her
Inclination; Yes <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that generous Princess pardon'd your unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Crime, assur'dus, that she would divide the joy of your return,
and that her Heart should be as open to receive you, as ever. With this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
declaration, I dispatcht several Expresses, to seek you, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you of it; and in the mean time employ'd all my friends, and my
own power with <hi>Arsaces,</hi> to recall his Vows; but alas, our incessant Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were so far from altering, that they confirm'd his cruelty; and though
I know not from what misterious cause his aversion for you proceeded,
yet I remember, for his final snwer he told us; The <hi>Parthians</hi> shall be
convinc'd, how sacred an observer I am of my Laws, by making them as
penal to the first Prince of my Bloud, as to the meanest of my Subjects;
that though <hi>Surena</hi> be recover'd, it was no lessening of <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s
offence; that I owe the preservation of my Favourite, not to his respect,
but to the goodness of the gods, to whom I shall make an unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
if my first action was a violation of my Oaths; And concluded,
that whosoever mention'd your return again, he would consider it as an
affront to his Authority, and resent it at that rate. With this barbarous
answer I went to the thee Princesses, where I found two of my Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
return'd, who assur'd us that they had been at <hi>Babilon, Selutia, Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomphile,
Arbelles,</hi> and all the other chief Cities of <hi>Orodes</hi> Empire, and
made such diligent search for you, that they durst engage their Lives, had
you been in any of them, their pains had not been fruitless; the others
also at their coming back, made us the like assurances, so that all their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
concurring, it fill'd <hi>Lindadory, Parthenissa,</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> with
such excessive sorrows, that perceiving nothing but your return, could
put a period to them, I undertook to give them an account of you, or
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96335:132"/>
never again to give them any of my self. This motion extreamly surpriz'd
them, who perhaps thought, that an improbable way of finding one friend
would turn to a certain one of losing another; but I so represented, tha'
my friendship to you, and my eagerness of silencing all their Tears, would
inspire me with a higher diligence than any other, that I obtain'd my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
and indeed I found Captivity a lesser trouble, than the seeing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day so deep a melancholly as that which possest your Sister, your Mistriss,
and your Friend. Immediately therefore I fitted my self for my journey,
and though the King did me the honor to send me a Commission for that
Army, which was desing'd for you, yet I wholly declin'd it, and rather
elected to become a wanderer, to restore you to your felicity, than to tread
the way which leads to glory, when not in order to it; within two days
I had fitted my self, and having taken a pretence (to obtain the Kings
permission) for a private affair, which would necessitate my absence for
some time, I took, leave of those, for whose sakes and yours, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
so uncertain a voyage; I will not tell you how I rais'd their Faiths
by naming greater probabilities of success, than I fancied; nor all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
expressions at our separation, but I must tell you, that in hope I
might be so fortunate as to succeed in my inquiry, I procur'd a Letter
from <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to you, which having secretly made up in a Ribbon, that
night I lest <hi>Ninive,</hi> and bethinking myself, that from that Peasant, which
you sent with your Pacquet to me, I might get some light of the way you
took, I went directly to that Village, where I found my hopes deceiv'd
but riding a days journey further, by incessant inquiries after you, I learnt
that not very long before, a Gentleman, attended only by one Servant,
had hir'd a Guide to pass over those Sandy Desarts, which are between
that place and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and by the description they made of the person,
and his sadness, I imagin'd it was you; I therefore instantly hir'd the same
Guide, who brought me to the same Inn you lay at in <hi>Antioch,</hi> where the
Master of it assur'd me, that Gentleman embarqued himself in a small Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
that was bound for <hi>Cyprus;</hi> this gave me a belief, that since an infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in Love was the cause of your banishment, you intended to confine
your self in that Island, where the Queen of that Passion had chosen her
earthly residence. With this hopeful fancy, I hir'd a Ship, and in two days
landed at <hi>Paphos,</hi> and from thence exactly visited every corner of that
Kingdom, yet all the advantage I deriv'd from a hundred days spent in so
curious a search, was, to remain confident you were not in it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I was inform'd, that several discontented persons, retir'd themselves
into certain small Islands of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> I resolv'd to try whether you
did not increase their number, but we had not been under Sail above twelve
hours, when a <hi>Cilician</hi> Pyrate gave us chace, and though with my Sword
I disputed my liberty, yet at last being opprest by number, I lost both,
and receiv'd so many wounds, that had not our Enemies Captain, by a
good opinion conceiv'd of my Courage, been exceeding careful of my
cure, I had mist the happiness of restoring you to yours; about half a
year I continu'd with this <hi>Cilician,</hi> where I had nothing of a Slave, but
the name, and whose affection I gaind so entirely, that he often protested
'twas that only which hinder'd my liberty; but out of apprehension that
I might not have the same inclinations for him, which he had for me, he
would every day endeavour to wean himself from my company; and as
soon as he could digest our separtion, he would then give me my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to obtain a pardon for having so long delay'd it; his former Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and those fresh demonstrations of his friendship, were so justly predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96335:133"/>
over me, that when the valiant <hi>Gallippus,</hi> and <hi>Menas,</hi> with three
Galleys more, fell upon ours; I joyn'd my self to the generous <hi>Cilician,</hi> and
though after a virtuous resistance he lost his life, yet in that action I sav'd
it three times, and loaden with wounds, fell by his side; <hi>Gallipus</hi> and
<hi>Menas</hi> having enquir'd, after their victory, who I was, were inform'd by
some which surviv'd our defeat, that I was a Slave, and only in gratitude
to him, whose courage took, and whose charity preserv'd me, I perform'd
what they saw. I know not whether my resolution or gratitude, gave
them an opinion, that it was not unlikely, the same usage might produce
the same resentments, but whatsoever was the cause, <hi>Gallippus</hi> took up
my Body, carried it into his Cabbin, and there so prest the Chirurgeons
to shew their Art, that as proof of it, by powerful Cordials, they brought
me to my self again, and having found my faintness, proceeded rather
from the loss of Bloud, than any mortal wound, they then gave <hi>Gallippus</hi>
an assurance of recovering me, and afterwards perform'd it. I cannot but
tell you, that had not higher reflections than any which related to my
self, silenc'd my despair, I had made my own Sword testify, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
Death before Slavery; but the consideration of my engagements to
your fair Sister, <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> and the eternal torment, the
not knowing your error, would be to you, made me look as a providence
upon my double Captivity, and as it were my double Refurrection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
I could not fancy the gods, who are the relievers of Innoency, did
so miraculously preserve me, but to render me at last their instrument in
it; and since the Sea was the place where I lost any further intelligence
of you, the being with Pirats, who examine all Ships they see, gave me
no small hopes, that those accidents, which in appearance were misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
might prove the best way of putting a period to yours and mine;
to conclude, the gods made not my conjectures false, for 'tis by my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
that they have brought my troubles to an end; but before I have
done so to my discourse, I must let you know, that in some sights, I did <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi>
such memorable services (for 'twas with him I always went) that
he endeavour'd to obtain my freedom from <hi>Menas,</hi> which the barbarous
Pirat always declin'd; but the valiant <hi>Gallippus,</hi> to make my hopes ease
my sufferings, protested that the next service I render'd him, which might
make his Admiral, not justly to condemn his setting me free, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hazard to lose the expectation of his future preserment, than not do
it; 'twas a long while before I could on so favourable an opportunity,
which at last was given me this day in your sight; but my being a Slave,
having been the means of inceasing your Glory, I shall no more deplore
it, than I do my other miseries, since they are so fortunately finish'd and
since by them I have given some proofs of a friendship, whose greatness
cannot be resembling to any thing so aptly, as to his perfections to whom
it is paid.</p>
                  <p>'Twas thus the generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> ended his relation, and 'twas in passionate
embracings, and not in words that <hi>Spartacus</hi> was eloquent in his gratitude;
but his friends perceiving that his silence exprest his impatience for <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>'s
Letter, immediately by unsowing a little Ribbon, which in all his
misfortunes he had artificiallay preserv'd, presented my dear Master with

                  <p>O gods! (<hi>Spartacus</hi> cry'd out when he had ended reading) why did
you give me the courage to love <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> the happiness to obtain hers,
and not virtue enough to know she was uncapable of vice; Then abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while from words, he made those sighs which interrupted them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Office; but having at length allay'd that storm, he thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd;
Great gods! what crime have I committed, that you make a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Passion for me, my punishment? and yet you are
therein but just, for since the suspecting of it was my sin, it is fit it should
be too, my torment. My Relation would be endless, did I tell you all
those rational extravagancies he utter'd, I will therefore pass them over,
with all those Menaces he made against <hi>Surena</hi>'s Life, and only inform you,
that never any man's condemnation brought him a more real grief, than
did <hi>Artabanes</hi> pardon to him, and that his despair for having injur'd the
perfect'st excellency, flung him into a violent Feaver, which was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
like to have cost him his life, but was really the cause of those disasters,
which afterwards did happen. For <hi>Canitius</hi> (who my Prince had honour'd
with the office of his Lieutenant-General) at the taking of <hi>Salapia,</hi> saw
the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> and had for her so violent a Passion, that it gave him
the impudence to beg her of my generous Master, as a reward of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
but <hi>Spartacus</hi> not only refus'd it, but gave his so just a reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for it, that instead of producing repentance, it inspir'd him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
to effect which (as we afterwards learnt) he held a private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
with <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> at that famous Battel, in which
they were defeated, and 'twas by his Treachery, and the quitting of his
Post, that all those valiant <hi>Germans</hi> were then cut off; and for which, he
attributing of it to their rashness, and my Prince not to his infidelity, he
had his pardon; which generosity was so far from producing his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that it gave him encouragement to abuse a Virtue, which, if he had
had any himself, he should rather have admir'd. This Traytor therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the advantage of his Generals sickness, which gave him an unrestrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
liberty to accomplish his infidelity, began by his Agents, to let the
Army know that <hi>Spartacus,</hi> who built his Glory upon their Bloud, car'd
not how profuse he was of so precious a treasure, whilst that by it he
could purchase his desires; that they had no reason any longer to follow
a Captain, who declin'd so much as acquainting them with his Name, and
Countrey; that to the best of his observation, they must not expect a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96335:134"/>
of their troubles but by a period of their lives, for having led them
cross all <hi>Italy,</hi> with an engagement of disbanding them, when they had
reach'd the <hi>Alps,,</hi> yet, when all their dangers were past (but that of not
observing his promise) upon the bare noise of <hi>Crassus</hi> Army, he leads them
from their security, to make them undertake a hazardous War; that when
by the only blessing of the gods, by the defeat of <hi>Mummius,</hi> they had
created such fears in <hi>Crassus,</hi> that they might with as much safety, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
have retir'd themselves to enjoy their Valours recompence, he declines
<hi>Gallippus</hi> overture, of sending them a Fleet, which would have convey'd
them into a Countrey, where at once they might receive their security,
and their rewards, and for the hopes of a little Glory, which their Swords
and Lives too must purchase for him, he is resolv'd, not only to expose

who are so accustom'd to Victory, that they desire no greater certainty
of it, than to come to a Battel; in which, the best name our Victory can
bear, will be that of a happy rashness; neither can they have any hopes of
his favour, had they no other experiment of the contrary, than that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapia,</hi>
where lest <hi>Perolla</hi> should be too weak to shed their Bloud, he sends
him those prisoners to destroy their Valours, which had been made so, by
their valours; and that late one of <hi>Gallippus</hi>'s Slave, who, though he gave no
other proof of his Courage, than the defence of himself, and the killing of
some of them, yet immediately, as if the shedding their companions Bloud,
had been the best Title to a recompence, his liberty is purchas'd, and by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures far
greater than any which has been, their reward for two years misery
and success; and not content with this injury, but because they vented their
just resentments upon a violater of his Faith, from their General he becomes
their executioner, and lest they might judge that violence proceeded from
the heat of Bloud, he causes afterwards five of them to be publickly hang'd,
and offers their Enemy to become their Judge, who finding <hi>Spartacus</hi> to be
more cruel, than he himself could be (though a Pirat) declin'd the motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that score only. It was with many such instruments that the traitor <hi>Caniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;</hi>
his Instruments, endeavour'd my Prince's ruine, and though he were the
only Author of this wickedness, yet he appear'd the chief detester of it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was he content to be false within our Camp, but carry'd his perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Prince's indisposition permitted him to manage with security) not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his Friend, but his Intelligencer; and advis'd him, during his Generals

we then quarter'd in, where if <hi>Spartacus</hi> ended his life, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
disease, the command of the Army by succession, being his, he would
betray it into his hands; or if he recover'd, he would raise so dangerous a
mutiny in the Army (for the which, their being thus besieg'd, would give a
sufficient rise) that in so great a disorder he might make his advantage. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
protested, he would then have perform'd that, for which he was future<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

enough to produce the fruit he expected, but yet as an earnest of the reality
of his professions, he would not oppose <hi>Crassus</hi>'s making that Trench which
was to besiege us; who upon this persidiousness rais'd his hopes, and his camp,

he would adventure nothing, till <hi>Spartacus</hi> was recover'd, left fighting
under his fortune, the success might be attributed to his own courage; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
he often laught at so endless a toil (as he tearm'd <hi>Crassus</hi> Trench) and
said 'twas a work sitter for Labourers, than Soldiers; but yet if the <hi>Romans</hi>
effected it, they would but become the makers of their own graves, for they
must be so over-haras'd, that it would be impossible for them to use a Pile
or a Sword: I must confess, I was of his opinion, and had I not been so, I
esteem'd it less hazardous to be besieg'd by <hi>Crassus,</hi> than to fight a Battel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Canitius.</hi> Neither was it singly <hi>Canitius</hi>'s treachery, which gave the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
General this confidence, but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s unexpected return had a share in
it, for though <hi>Crassus</hi> had conjur'd the Senate to send for him out of <hi>Asia,</hi>
yet he had done it to palliate any disgrace which might have befallen him,
to manifest the greatness of the danger, and the better to set off the glory
of a victory, than out of a belief that <hi>Pompey</hi> could so soon, and so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
disingage himself from the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> -War; but when to his grief,
and admiration he receiv'd advice from <hi>Rome,</hi> that not only <hi>Pompey</hi> was at
<hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and expected but a fair wind to transport him into <hi>Italy,</hi> but
that all the Senate consider'd him as the Man destin'd for that work, and had
made him General of that War, taking the very rise from <hi>Crassus</hi> his own
Letters, spight, and ambition made him undertake what his judgement, nor
his courage, could have invited him to. In the mean while, my generous
Prince lay strugling with greater difficulties than all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
could have rais'd him, I mean his despair for having suspected the perfect
innocency; which cruel thoughts, made him look with some sort of joy,
upon that sickness we consider'd with horror; but in the end, the gods (who
had not yet wearied themselves in persecuting him) abated, and afterwards
took away the danger of his Feaver; but then his Melancholly augmented,
as his disease decreas'd, and had so powerful an influence over him, that
it appear'd as dangerous an enemy, as that which was so lately supprest;
to be brief, <hi>Sillaces</hi> took so opportunely his good intervals, and so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
employ'd them, that <hi>Spartacus</hi> began to listen unto reason, and one
evening, finding him much inclin'd to relish his perswasions, he told him;
Are you then, <hi>Artabanes</hi> resolv'd eternally to render fruitless that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
discovery the gods have made in your favour? will you by your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
necessitate <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to believe, that what was your misfortune,
was your design? will you render what you would make the testimony of
your Repentance, a greater offence than your fault? and will you make
your Love more obliging than your Hatred? for whilst you thought your
Presence was <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s trouble, you banish'd your self from her, and
now she tells you 'twill prove her only consolation, you deny it her: No,
no, (<hi>Artabanes</hi>) if you think you have not really her pardon, a new diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is not the way to obtain it; and if you believe you have, why
do you deny your self the benefit of it? 'twas with many perswasions of
this nature that <hi>Artabanes</hi> despair was assaulted, which at last were so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
that after a deep sigh, he told <hi>Sillaces,</hi> You have vanquish'd me, (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Friend) yes: I will go to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> for since 'tis she I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
'tis unfit any other but that injur'd innocence should pronounce my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
neither can she doubt how sensible I am of my crime, since I make
her both the Party, and the Judge, and offer my life unto <hi>Arsaces</hi> fury, only
to preserve it to her justice; you will find (said <hi>Sillaces</hi>) with extasies of joy,
and a thousand embraces, how little cause you have to be apprehensive of
either, for as <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s goodness has pardon'd your offence, so if <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
justice does not imitate her example, let it be my care to preserve
your being in <hi>Parthia,</hi> from his Knowledge. My generous Master
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96335:135"/>
being brought to this good temper, we thought it high time to inform
him, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had in a manner besieg'd us, and that the vastness of
our Army had so exhausted the Island of all Provisions, that our necessities,
if not our courages must invite us to force our passage. <hi>Spartacus</hi> heard
this advertisement (which till them we had de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lin'd giving him, reason by of
his sickness, and melancholly) with a singular satisfaction, and about some
four or five days after, having recover'd sufficient strength to make use of a
Horse, he came out of his Tent, which the Soldiers celebrated with so
loud a shout, that the <hi>Romans</hi> apprehended their besieg'd were coming to be
their Assaulters; neither do I believe their fears had been any thing lessen'd
had they known the true cause of that Allarm, for I dare justly affirm,
they more apprehended my Princes recovery, than a Battel: But <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
having taken 10000 Men for his Guard, went to view that miraculous
Trench, which he more admir'd than fear'd; but lest his Officers might
misinterpret his silence, he told them; That <hi>Crassus</hi> (doubtless) had more
Pioneers than Soldiers in his Army: that since he never declin'd a Battel,
he rather thought the <hi>Romans</hi> secur'd themselves, than besieg'd him; that
'twas impossible any people could take that pains, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t for their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;
yet lest the world might believe the contrary, he would in few
days evince the truth by a demonstration, and was more pleas'd to
know where he might fight with <hi>Crassus,</hi> than troubl'd at those difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he must surmount to do it. And indeed not long after, when he had
perfectly recover'd his strength, and when all his Army despair'd of disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
themselves from so ruinous a labyrinth; in a stormy night, when the
earth was cover'd with Snow, he gave orders to all his Forces to be ready
to march, and whilst he was putting on his Armor, he told <hi>Sillaces;</hi> Come
generous Friend, let us make <hi>Crassus</hi> defeat, the way to assault <hi>Rome,</hi> and
having taken it, let us retire into <hi>Parthia,</hi> where I will manifest, that I
prefer not the greatest Empire of the world, before lying prostrate at <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>'s Feet, nay, that I relinquish'd it, for so glorious and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an exchange; yes <hi>Sillaces,</hi> I will in few da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Palmes and Laurels, that my criminal jealousie shall not be seen, and do
such virtuous actions, that her justice shall pardon my offence; or my
Bloud shall expiate it. These words were scarce spoken, when he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the head of the Army, and without the least stop, led on those
Troops, who under such a General, could not but be victorious; in effect,
<hi>Sillaces</hi> and he, were the first in person which pull'd down the <hi>Roman</hi> Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
planted more fortunate Ensignes in their places, and without giving
their success any leave to cool, with their Swords perform'd so great an
execution, and so strew'd the ways with <hi>Roman</hi> Carcasses, that the effects
of their valour almost hinder'd the progress of it, and had they not had
a nobler design, they might have besieg'd the living <hi>Romans</hi> with the
dead, and made as famous a Trench by their victory, as <hi>Crassius</hi> had done
by his labour; but the unequal'd Friend so much undervalu'd a Conquest,
where nothing was considerable in it, but the number of the Dead, and
so abhorr'd all things which retarded their return into <hi>Parthia,</hi> that leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Crassus</hi> to deplore, and admire his defeat, they took the direct way
to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was to be the crown and limit of their Conquests; but
alas, that fatal poyson which the Traitor <hi>Canitius</hi> had given our Soldiers,
began now to shew how strangely it had diffus'd it self; and though <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
(a considerable Officer of our Army) were not of his conspiracy,
yet imagining that <hi>Crassus</hi> loss had made him uncapable to revenge it, and
finding the Soldiers prepar'd for any Mutiny, he so well husbanded their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96335:135"/>
disorder, that the second night, as we were in our march towards <hi>Rome,</hi> he
revolted with 13000 Men from our Army, and campt with them near the
Lake of <hi>Lucania,</hi> with intention to set up for himself. <hi>Spartacus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
enrag'd at this, and none appear'd more violent to punish it, than
the false <hi>Canitius,</hi> who inwardly rejoy'd at so unexpected an advantage,
and immediately advertis'd <hi>Crassus</hi> of it, lest he might lose that favourable
opportunity; but though my Prince was sensible of so great a dismembring
of his Forces, yet the belief he had, that in them all the Traytors of the
Army were out of it, he consol'd himself, knowing that they were less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in a distinct body, than under his Colours, and to satisfy those that
prest him to be reveng'd, he told them; That he knew no way more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
for their punishment, than their having put themselves out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and that he doubted not, but in their very offence they would
receive the reward of it. Therefore believing himself for all that loss strong
enough to carry <hi>Rome</hi> by storm, he determin'd the next morning to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his march, almost as much troubl'd that <hi>Granicus</hi> had hinder'd it a
day, as at his Revolt; but the first Squadrons were hardly drawn out of
the Camp, when advertisement was brought; that <hi>Crassus,</hi> (who now
fought for revenge, and the preservation of <hi>Rome</hi>) was fall'n upon <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us</hi>
with so much fury, that 'twas impossible but in it he must find his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
This Allarm so mov'd the gallant <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s generosity, that though
<hi>Canitius,</hi> (and <hi>Crassus,</hi> who by that time was corrupted too) begg'd my
Prince to permit the <hi>Romans,</hi> to become his Executioners, yet considering
the danger, and not the cause of it, and remembring <hi>Granicus</hi>'s Courage,
and not his Revolt, he lead his Ensignes back to the relief of those, who
had so often been victorious under them; and though his only appearing
made <hi>Crassus</hi> return to his Camp in a hasty march, yet it produc'd no other
considerable effect; for <hi>Granicus</hi> and all his Soldiers were kill'd before
<hi>Spartacus</hi>'s arrival, not one receiving a wound in his back, or dying out
of his rank, preserving that Order with their Bodies, which they could
not with their Lives, their Deaths manifesting whose Soldiers they were,
and their defeat, what General they had abandon'd; and indeed, my
Prince was so taken with their resolution, that he spent two days in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them a Military Funeral, burying their Crimes in their Graves. This
sad Solemnity perform'd, we continu'd our design; but as if my Prince's
Virtue had not opposition enough from publique and private enemies;
the heavens themselves conspir'd against him, and by continual Rains so
swell'd the Rivers, that the <hi>Romans</hi> having broken down all the Bridges,
it was impossible for him to proceed. I leave you to think what his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were at so froward a destiny, for it not only retarded the Conquest
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, (which was more intollerable) his return to <hi>Parthia,</hi> but
also gave <hi>Crassus</hi>'s recruits leasure to joyn with him, and the danger of the
Empire made them so considerable, that before the waters were return'd
into their usual channels he came, and with much confidence pitch'd his
Tents within some sixteen Furlongs of ours, where the vicinity of our
Camps, furnisht frequent occasions of fighting, which was our constant
divertisement, in expectation of more favourable weather; but one day
<hi>Spartacus</hi> having advice that <hi>Scroffa</hi> and <hi>Quintus,</hi> two of <hi>Crassus</hi> bravest
Captains, were gone with all the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry for Forrage, he sent the
generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> with all his, to intercept their return, where after a
bloudy dispute, our Forces, by the valour of their Leader, had the better,
who with his own hand having given <hi>Scroffa</hi> very dangerous marks of his
courage, return'd into the Camp, loaden with Victory and Wounds. My
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96335:136"/>
Prince receiv'd him in Triumphs, but was more afflicted for the latter, than
pleas'd at the former, esteeming the loss of so much precious Bloud, too
prodigal a payment, not only for having vanquish'd those <hi>Romans,</hi> but
though it had done the like unto their Empire. But the Chirurgeons
soon mittigated his fears, by an assurance that <hi>Sillaces</hi> was in no danger,
and that the greatest trouble he was like to suffer, was the keeping of his
Bed for some 10 or 12 days; Five of which were not expir'd, e're the
Flouds were so asswag'd, that <hi>Spartacus</hi> might have continu'd his march
towards <hi>Rome,</hi> had not his friends weakness hinder'd it. <hi>Crassus</hi> imputed
this delay to his Fear, and having a while before, received advice from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius,</hi>
that now all things were in such a perfect readiness, that if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
could bring <hi>Spartacus</hi> to a Battel, he would bring them to a Victory,
he determin'd, as a provocation to my Prince (which was a needless la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
to cast up two great Trenches, the one to hinder our passage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Rome,</hi> the other to hinder our Camp from Watering. To inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
this design, <hi>Spartacus</hi> made many vigorous attempts, and thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
the <hi>Romans</hi> by fighting, to obtain leave to work; but the eighth
day after <hi>Sillaces</hi>'s victory, the morning was spent in so sharp a dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us, and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Seconds on either side came so thick, and
numerous, that my Prince perceiving he might engage <hi>Crassus,</hi> gallop'd
back into the Camp, and Commanded all his Army immediately to prepare
themselves for a Battel, which whilst they were doing, he came in to <hi>Sillaces,</hi>
where he acquainted him, that before night, he would be in a condition.
immediately to return into <hi>Parthia,</hi> or never to see it again; that nothing
appear'd a higher misfortune, than to be depriv'd of his company and help,
in so glorious an occasion, but since he had so lately engross'd a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
victory to himself, he was hopeful he would not repine, if he also laid
hold on so favourable, and so often ambition'd an occasion, to imitate his
example. <hi>Sillaces</hi> was extreamly surpriz'd at this Declaration, and having
sufficiently curst those former marks of honor, which now hinder'd him
from increasing his Stock, he begg'd <hi>Artabanes</hi> he might wait on him,
though in a Litter, that since he could not be a sharer in, he might at
least be a Spectator, and admirer of his Glory; and thereupon forcing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to rise, he found how ill a correspondency his Mind and Strength
had together: This sad experiment, and my Prince's Prayers, made him
yield to his weakness and his friend, who having selected 7000 choice
Men, more for the Guard of <hi>Sillaces</hi> than his Camp, he gave me the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of them, and though I begg'd with vehement importunities, to be
near his Person in so famous an occasion, yet the consideration of some
slight hurts I had receiv'd in <hi>Scroffa</hi>'s defeat, and the necessity of a faithful
Attendant on <hi>Sillaces,</hi> made him deny me. The two generous Friends ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
took leave of one another, with words, which nothing but so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a friendship was capable to produce, and my Prince having done me
the honor to embrace me, he immediately lead his Troops which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
(not counting those left with me) of 55000 effective Men, to that
Field in which he was confident they would purchase so much Glory;
where he already found the <hi>Roman</hi> Army in Batalia, and with as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
in their countenance, and posture, as if they had been victorious
as often, as defeated; his Army too being put in order, by an Oration, he
animated his Soldiers, and then gave order to the Trumpets, Clarions,
and all the warlike Musick to do the like, by sounding the Charge; and
that his Soldiers might see his resolution, in all their sight, he kill'd that
Horse, which he constantly made use of in a Battel, saying, that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onqueror, he should want none, and if defeated, he would make use of
none. My Princes Army was divided into two great Battalions, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
was led by <hi>Canitius</hi> and <hi>Castus,</hi> which consisted of 30000 Horse and
Foot, the other which made up 25000 more, had my Prince in the head of
them, who that morning was assur'd by those two Traitors, that they
would act miracles, which indeed they perform'd, in betraying the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Virtue that ever shin'd upon Earth. The ground over which my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Master's Batalion was to move, proved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o uneven, that the other
went first to the Charge, and those which led it march'd with much order,
and seeming resolution, till they came within shot of their Enemies, but
then <hi>Canitius</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> (with each of them about forty of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Officers) turning the points of their Javelins to the ground, abandon'd
their Soldiers, and ran full speed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who opening their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, receiv'd them with shouts of Triumph. This Treachery you may well
imagine, brought a world of confusion in those un-officer'd Troops, and
in the height of it, the two Traitors, accompany'd with their adherents,
and some <hi>Romans,</hi> return'd, and <hi>Canitius</hi> in <hi>Crassus</hi>'s name, offer'd all those
their Lives, who would lay down their Arms; to which a gallant <hi>Thracian</hi>
(that my Prince had honour'd with a considerable Command) immediately
reply'd, Traitor, 'tis a higher satisfaction to punish thy Treachery, than to
live by it, and 'tis upon that score, that I decline the latter, to act the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
thereupon, breaking like Lightning through a hundred Swords, he
past his through <hi>Canitius</hi>'s Body, and by so resolute a performance, depriv'd
him of his Life; but <hi>Euriles</hi> (for his Virtue, Merits, to have his name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded)
had not the consolation long to out-live his and <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
yet before his death, he gave <hi>Castus</hi> (who was most earnest after
it)
so many wounds, that he made him <hi>Canitius</hi>'s companion, as well in
Death as Infidelity, and sent him to learn in the other world, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which attends the being treacherous in this. But though the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of this generous Action, found his own end in it; yet it had so strange
an influence over all those which were ignorant of <hi>Canitius</hi>'s designes, that
in imitation of <hi>Euriles,</hi> having chang'd their disorder into resolution, they
oppos'd all those which were not of their opinions, so that the numbers
being almost equally divided, there began a most bloudy dispute, and the
<hi>Romans</hi> had that satisfaction to see those Swords which were design'd for
their ruine, employ'd to ruine those which had that design; But whilst
the Honest, and the Traytors, were thus engag'd one against another,
(<hi>Crassus</hi> being inform'd, that <hi>Canitius</hi> and <hi>Castus</hi> were dead, to whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had past his word) came, and ended both their differences, by end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their Lives; which was no small satisfaction to my Prince's marty'rd
Friends, to see those which their companions fought for, to become the
punishers of their Treachery. But (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) you wonder,
perhaps, why <hi>Spartacus</hi> all this while was idle? but your admiration may
cease when I inform you, that the Fates, either not to see so unparalell'd a
Treachery, or to contribute towards it, had on a suddain rais'd so thick a
Mist, for above a quarter of an hour, that my Prince, by the uncouthness of
the ground, advancing slowly with his Battalion, could not possibly see
what had happen'd, and perhaps had longer continu'd in his ignorance, had
not a Trooper which escap'd the Enemy, come full speed, and aloud adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
him of those events which I have told you, but not of their cause: and
immediately after, as if that Mist had been purposely sent to contribute to
his ruine, and then to shew him the greatness of it, it suddainly broke
up, and discover'd the cruel execution the <hi>Romans</hi> had made and their
Army in all its Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> marching a precipitate pace to Charge us. Gods!
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96335:137"/>
what courage (but <hi>Artabanes</hi>) had not been startl'd under such misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes?
but his was so far from being thereby impair'd, that it increast, and
turning to those that follow'd him, he encourag'd them, both by his words,
and then by his example, for advancing some hundr'd paces before all the
rest, he call'd <hi>Crassus</hi> out, resolving as the <hi>Romans</hi> had by accident, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
his Army of a Wing, so he would by his valour deprive theirs of its
Head. At this Summons, two of <hi>Crassus</hi> valiantest Centurions, successively
came out of their ranks to my Prince, and by a fatal counterfeiting, were
render'd for ever uncapable of deluding him again; <hi>Crassus</hi> perceiving by
those examples, what his own Fate had been, had his Valour resembl'd
theirs, declin'd what he was going to undertake, and to disguise his fear,
commanded his Army to cut in pieces all the Reliques of those Slaves,
(for those were his words.) But why do I dwell so long on so sad a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?
let it suffice, I tell you, that <hi>Spartacus</hi> was become so horrible by the
being cover'd with his Enemies bloud; that his Presence was as much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
as his Sword; that in his was verified the Fable of <hi>Anteus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
strength by his very falls; that he never won so much Glory in all
his victories, as in that defeat; and that he perform'd such prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
that I absolutely believe, had he been blest but with twenty of his
humour, and resolution, their valours had supply'd the losses of <hi>Canitius</hi>
Treachery; but at length, those Divisions he had left, being infinitely
over-numbred, dishearten'd, and pierc'd in several places, were totally
routed, and most of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cut in pieces; <hi>Spartacus</hi> perceiv'd it, and might
have avoided so general a Fate, but scorning to out-live a loss, which he
thought would have render'd him worthy of it, and observing a <hi>Roman,</hi>
who had that fatal day made himself admirably remarkable, by his courage,
he seiz'd upon one of those many Horses which were without Masters, and
taking a Javelin in his hand, he ran full speed after him, and having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
him alone in the Grove, in the midst whereof was a little Meadow,
fit for his purpose, he cry'd out to his valiant Enemy, To me, to me, brave
<hi>Roman,</hi> I am <hi>Spartacus,</hi> and seek but a gallant Sword to cure this days mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
'Tis thee I seek (the other briskly reply'd) and since thou hast
thought me sit to end thy sufferings; I should be very unwilling to
have thee mistaken in thy choice; thereupon they both leapt a Ditch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that little Meadow, where having fetcht as long a Career, as the place
would permit, they fell upon each other with more futy, than two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Storms, and their Javelins flying into the Air into a thousand shivers,
they drew their Swords to supply that loss, and to end their combate, or
their Lives; and truly they were so intent upon each others ruine, that
'tis a miracle they did not mutually act it; above a quarter of an hour the
dispute was so equally ballanc'd, that detesting the faithfulness of their
Armours, they were often upon the point of moving a truce, till they had
taken them off, but so long to be idle, appear'd a greater difficulty, than
to cut them in pieces in the fight; at last my Prince enrag'd, that posterity
should know one single Sword ended a life, which that day had divers
times forced a passage through a thousand, recollecting all the strength
which his Grief and Rage could inspire him with, struck his valiant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
so furious a blow, that cleaving his shield in two, it did the like unto
the Gorget, and made a wound upon the height of his Shoulder. He (on
the other side) enrag'd at a resistance, which till then he had never found,
to be only vanquish'd when all the Army he fought in was victorious, and
to leave so liberal a gift unrepaid, stiffening himself upon his Stirrups, and
inflaming himself with those thoughts, by an unresistable reverse, which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96335:137"/>
though it glanc'd upon my Princes shield, yet afterwards lighting upon his
Helmet, cleft it in two, and left his Head and Face unguarded, and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd;
which his Enemy perceiving, and as the gods would have it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfectly those unequall'd Features, though his Sword were in the Air,
to prosecute the advantage my Princes perfidious Armour had given him,
yet he suspended it there, and by crying out, Great gods! is it not <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
that I see? not only hinder'd <hi>Spartacus</hi> by that example, and those
words, from giving him a blow, whose strength had render'd it unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
fatal to the Receiver, but also made him say, who ever thou art, if
thou be'st a friend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

The gods forbid, (the Stranger reply'd, unlacing his Helmet) that ever
my Sword should be employ'd in so criminal an action, for though my ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
made my sacrelegious Arm offend, 'tis not the gods themselves
that can command my knowledge of you to repeat my sin; thereupon
flinging off his Helmet, he discover'd a Face, which <hi>Spartacus</hi> no sooner
saw, than they both ran with as much willingness to embrace, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did to destroy one another; and for a while, my Prince in the joy of
such an encounter, had laid aside the thoughts of those miseries which had
caus'd it; but alas, they were too deep, and too recent to be forgotten,
and the sad remembrance of them, made him on a suddain cry out, Oh
gods! why do you give me so new a subject to desire Life, when you had
so lately given me many to detest it? and why (if you design my ruine)
do you make him know, and favour me, that was only capable to act it?
These reasonings made him that only heard them, admire what might be
their cause, and his wonder producing his silence, made my dear Master
thus to continue; No, no, <hi>Artabanes,</hi> when thou wert a Slave to Fortune,
and to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and when thou sought'st Death and not Victory, the
gods gave thee the last, and deny'd thee the first; but now thou bear'st
the glorious Title of <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s, the gods having deny'd thee the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ter,
deny not thy self the former, shew by so generous an experiment, that he
which for not obtaining the victory, could act his own death, did not lose
the one, out of an apprehension of the other; Thereupon he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinguish'd the fairest life that ever was, had not the generous <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
(for 'twas he whom <hi>Spartacus</hi> had fought with, and whose strange
being in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, shall be told you in its due order) observing my
Prince's despair proceeded from his defeat, first hinder'd the fatal effects of
it, and then to take away the cause, assur'd him that he was betray'd, and
not vanquish'd. <hi>Spartacus</hi> at this assurance (for till then he was ignorant
of it) look'd upon his Friend with a Face which spoke his doubts, and
then begg'd him to deal clearly, and inform him, whether what he had said,
was not onely out of a design to hinder his violence towards himself? But
<hi>Artavasdes</hi> having by many protestations, and particulars, assur'd him of
<hi>Canitius</hi> and <hi>Castus</hi>'s persidiousness, made <hi>Artabanes</hi> (who saw that 'twas
not <hi>Crassus,</hi> but Treachery that had beaten him) to relinquish those sad
designes he had upon his own life, and to preserve it for a perfection, who
only merited so transcendent a blessing. This resolve was no sooner taken
up, but the apprehension of <hi>Sillaces</hi>'s safety, began to afflict my Prince with
such excess, that <hi>Artavasdes</hi> for a while suspected, a relapse into his former
despair produced it; but being inform'd of the occasion, he immediately
made <hi>Artabanes</hi> to fling away his own Arms, to take those of a Servant of
his, (which by accident was riding by) and then assuring him, the power he
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96335:138"/>
had with <hi>Crassus</hi> was so great, that if <hi>Sillaces</hi> were not already lost, he
durst undertake his, and my preservation (for they were so generous as to
give me a part in their care) they both gallop'd away towards the Camp,
where they found, that night (and not victory) had put an end to the
<hi>Romans</hi> Assault, whereby it was apparent, if so unconsiderable a person
as <hi>Symander,</hi> could defend so large a Line with so few hands, what then
would <hi>Artabanes</hi> have done with so vast an Army, had it been free from
Treachery? <hi>Artavasdes</hi> therefore joy'd at <hi>Crassus</hi>'s repulse, and having lodg'd
<hi>Artabanes</hi> in his own Tent, caus'd an inviolable secresie to be administer'd
to his Servants, and his generous friends wounds to be drest, which were
many, and those much inflam'd by that violent agitation, that his care to
preserve <hi>Sillaces,</hi> had occasion'd; he went to <hi>Crassus</hi> (who with eloquent
Elogies gave his Valour a just Character) and acquainted him, that a
Servant, or rather a Friend of his, (for his unimitable fidelity, merited
that name) was taken prisoner in the Enemies Camp, dangerously wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and had sent him word, that he had obtain'd his own liberty, if <hi>Crassus</hi>
would engage himself to their Commander in Chief, to release the first pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
of his quality which he should take; that whether or no this was
granted, he desir'd that a Chirurgeon might be sent him, (all those of the
Enemies were so busy about their own Patients, that none of them had
the time, or the charity to dress his wounds.) <hi>Artavasdes</hi> further told the
<hi>Roman</hi> General, that the Chirurgeon he meant to employ, might serve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to bring intelligence, in what posture the reliques of his Enemies were,
and added to those two so many further motives, that <hi>Crassus</hi> willingly
yielded to both his requests. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was no sooner return'd, than he
acquainted my Prince with what he had done, and after a short consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they immediately imploy'd the faithful <hi>Philanax</hi> (who my Prince men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in his generous Friends adventures) as a Chirurgeon to <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who
passing the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards (by <hi>Crassus</hi>'s direction) came with a Letter of
Credence under <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s hand, into our Camp, and fill'd us both, by the
relation I have made you, with a joy, which nothing could equal but the
greatness of our grief, before his arrival; but the time pressing us, I gave
all my Soldiers Orders (by <hi>Philanaxes</hi>'s advice) to shift for themselves du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the obscurity, for we were not able next morning with so small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to receive that storm was intended; therefore all of them that night
(by a way which the <hi>Romans</hi> thought inaccessable) descended to a little
River, that issues from the Lake of <hi>Lucania,</hi> where some that could swim,
helping others that could not, what by that charity, and some few Boats
and Planks which were there, and which had been employ'd to fetch Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
to our Camp, whilst the Floods were so violent, all of them (before
day) recover'd the Mountains of the <hi>Brutians,</hi> where afterwards they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
the War, and furnish'd <hi>Pompey</hi> with an occasion to tell the Senate,
that it was <hi>Crassus</hi> had defeated the Slaves in Battel, but 'twas he had pull'd
up the War by the very root. But our Soldiers were no sooner gone, than
<hi>Philanax</hi> and I prepar'd <hi>Silla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </hi>'s Litter, and having put him into it, we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him out of the Camp, and freely passing the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards, brought
him to <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Tent, where these three great Men manifested their
joys, and friendship, in expressions, which if not related in their own words,
were too great a wrong unto them; and the better to palliate the business,
I writ a Letter to <hi>Crassus</hi> (as Commander in Chief of his Enemies) and
deliver'd it with my own hands, as a Messenger sent expresly with it from
the Camp, wherein I let him know, that upon his promise of the like ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
I had sent the Prisoner he desir'd, and afterwards to favour the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96335:138"/>
flight of that remainder of my Prince's Army, I assur'd him, those in the
Camp were in a readiness for some exploit, that 'twas not impossible but
they would make a desperate Sally, to fell their Lives handsomely, and
that I told him this the more freely, because I was resolv'd to abandon his
enemies for ever, being assur'd of my Life and Liberty by the prisoner, I
had brought off. <hi>Crassus</hi> for this Intelligence, and at <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s request
(who accompany'd me to him) confirm'd what the prisoner promis'd, and
immediately put all his Camp in Arms, in apprehension of a Sally, which
abundantly contributed to my poor companion's escape; For all the <hi>Romans</hi>
being only intent on the east side of our Camp, which was the only place
for an attempt, permitted those on the <hi>West</hi> (which was the way that lead
to the River) to make a more facile flight. 'Twas in this sort (continu'd
<hi>Symander</hi>) that all things happen'd in that famous Battel of the Trenches;
I know some <hi>Romans</hi> gave out, that <hi>Spartacus</hi> was cut in pieces, others
(and more truly) affirm'd, that after the Battel, his Body was never found,
and some too (knowing none could contradict them, for there was no
Quarter given) and, to receive a reward, cut off a Head, which they said
was my Prince's, carried it to <hi>Rome,</hi> and fix'd it on the Gate of the Capitol.
To conclude this part of my Story, I will not tell you all those desires <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes</hi>
had to return to those Men, which escap'd unto the <hi>Brutain</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
whose courage and fidelity he admir'd, and with whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to repair the misfortune of <hi>Canitius</hi> and <hi>Castus</hi>'s Treacheries. 'Tis
enough you learn, That had not his wounds hinder'd him a while, and their
defeat afterwards he would never have return'd to <hi>Parthia,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
redeem'd that loss, which was his misfortune not his fault. The next
morning as <hi>Crassus</hi> was preparing to repeat his Assault, news was brought
him, that his Enemies had abandon'd the Camp, at which his discontent
was greater in appearance, than in effect, for we had not so ill defended
our selves the precedent day, as to make any thing which avoided a second
storm, appear a misfortune. Three days <hi>Crassus</hi> spent, to repair the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his Army, and to bury the dead, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

numbers being great, they might infect the Air; in which time my Prince
acquainted the generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi> with his Fortunes, who admir'd as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
to find <hi>Artabanes,</hi> the famous <hi>Spartacus,</hi> as he was joy'd to have been
the instrument of saving him. When <hi>Crassus</hi> had ended his charitable, and
necessary Office, he return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> by easy marches, which gave <hi>Sillaces</hi>
and my Prince, the means of accompanying <hi>Artavasdes</hi> thither, and where
they had enter'd in Triumph, if their Success had proportion'd their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Symander</hi> was in this part of his Relation, one of the Priests of
<hi>Venus</hi> came in great haste to advertise him, and <hi>Callimachus,</hi> that <hi>Artabanes</hi>
was return'd, and had brought with him a stranger, that yielded nothing
to him in the blessings of Nature, that they were both much wounded,
but yet they seem'd, in the joy of having found out each other, to have
forgotten the danger they were in. <hi>Callimachus</hi> therefore perceiving <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>'s
impatiency, to satisfy it, and his own, immediately went to learn
the cause of this fresh accident, and provide necessaries for persons which

real satisfaction, that to continue the latter, or
to be reveng'd on you for the former, she has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

This, Madam, had not given me the presumption of obeying her,
had not <hi>Altezeera</hi> also joyn'd her Prayers to <hi>Parthenissa's,</hi> and both
assur'd me, it would not be amiss that you should see, the Beauty of
one of your Sex has acted more, than one of mine could fancy; the
first of which, you might as perfectly know in your self, as the last
in this Book. That to write of you, is worse than to write to you,
this being but an injury to your Person, that to your Memory. (Though
indeed the former has nothing of misfortune, but that 'tis not as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as the latter, which yet we cannot reproach you with, it being
our infelicity as much, if not more than yours) That I had injur'd
<hi>Altezeera</hi> as much in her Actings, as in their Relations; and having
done so much against her, I could only but this way, do something in
proportion for her; they further added, if my Writings needed no
Protection, they were fittest for your sight, and if they needed any, you
were ablest to give it. And though to all this, I represented, That if
their ambition of being known, Madam, unto you, had not entirely si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd
their Iustice, they could not have believ'd a Crime against you,
could have prov'd an obligation to them; and that in my thus obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, I should necessitate many to conclude, I had an endless quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
to those which were the most perfect of your Sex, by injuring such
of them as are dead, in my Book; as such of them as are alive in the
Dedications of it. Against this, they enjoyn'd me to remember the
example of that excellent <hi>Genius,</hi> who presented you his Oblations
under the fair Name of <hi>Sacharissa,</hi> who was guilty of both those
crimes (writing of you, and to you) only to please himself, of which
they sollicited me, to be guilty but only of one, (and that also the least)
to please and repair them, and yet was not only pardon'd, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the high Honor of your Conversation, But Madam, though I were
<pb facs="tcp:96335:141"/>
concern'd to say little against my obedience to them, the more to invite
you to pardon it, as being an offence of Ignorance, rather than Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
yet I could not but let them know, I consider'd that usage,
Madam, of yours, was only more and more to convince him of the
greatness of his Crime, and of the greatness of that Mercy which had
pardon'd it. That Cloud of <hi>Sacharissa,</hi> which some ascribe to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
I do to his Iudgement, for thereby he was believ'd a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber
of Fancy, whereas otherwise he would have been known a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
describer of Truth. Yet I must say, the greatest fault he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in attempting your Character, was his attempting it; for in
the necessity of his crime, he had this satisfaction, That whoever had
assum'd his Design, must have commited his Offence, and come as
short of him, as (almost) he has of you. For, Madam, you are
above being describ'd, which condition, though it be the most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

deplore an Ignorance, which is occasion'd by a Perfection, that even in
degrees transcends it. I hope a part of it will be manifested in forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Confidenc, which is impos'd, and not sought; and has indeed
no title to your Mercy, but that is great enough for it; which though
infinite, cannot exceed the Ioy with which it will be receiv'd, nor the

ease, the better to enable him to support her longer
cruelties) he was fallen into a slumber; and though
his cares were so unusually civil, as not to interrupt it, yet it was suddenly,
by a noise of Horses, and clashing of Swords, and Arms, which reach'd his

to see a Combat which struck him both with admiration and anger; the
first was caus'd by a single Valor, which could not be but transcendent,
since it had such an Admirer; and the last was occasion'd by six armed men,
which endeavor'd to destroy the possessor of it; who, to sell his life at a
rate worthy so high a purchase, and to make his Enemies deplore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of so great a Courage, or the effects of it, had already kill'd two
of them, with blows that struck as great a terror into the rest, as the very
example of those deaths; but finding at last that his Courage might be
worsted by, though not yield to his Enemies numbers, he was retir'd to a
little Thicket that shelter'd him behind, and his Horse being kill'd in the
retreat, defended his right side, doing him service even after death: 'twas
in this little fortification and posture, <hi>Artabanes</hi> found him, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no greater invitation to his generous mind for the relieving of virtue,
than to find it in distress, he instantly took up one of the dead mens Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
to join himself to the opprest stranger, who (as he was coming full
speed towards him) thinking the now wearer of the Helmet, as much his
Enemy, as he that had so lately worn it, cry'd out to <hi>Artabanes,</hi> Make
haste, make haste, and help those, whose hearts are as ill as their cause; and
who need relie on their number, since they cannot on their quarrel. Our
Hero esteem'd it more handsom and necessary, to shew the generous Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
his error by his actions, than words, and at his first strokes so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
did it, that he which he reliev'd, thought his mistake a greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
than that which he had now more than hopes to be freed from;
and indeed <hi>Artabanes</hi> perform'd things so far above his strength, though
not himself, that three of the surviving four, left the Stranger, to employ
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96335:142"/>
their Swords against an Enemy, who they concluded would render the odds
as needful, as it was dispoportionate; but the valiant Stranger finding he
had to deal but with one, and that his relief might endanger the Bestower
of it, suddenly abandon'd his intrenchment, and as suddenly made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
abandon his life; but his Horse he made use of to assist his unknown
Friends, who was already in a condition not to need it, for he had killed
one of the three; and the other two perceiving how powerful an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was coming, endeavor'd in their Horses feet, to find a security they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired
of from their own hands: <hi>Artabanes</hi> and the Stranger followed
them awhile, but finding more difficulty in the Chace, than the Quarry
merited; and that the way they had taken to avoid their resentments,
rendered them unworthy of them, they gave over the pursuit; and then
the Stranger having with as much grace, as civility, beg'd a Pardon from
<hi>Artabanes,</hi> for a mistake created by the Arms he had on told him, Though
my life is rather a misfortune, than the contrary, yet my obligation to my
Deliverer is nothing inferior; and what my miseries made me desirous to

Truth, as acknowledge it; and if you refuse that Present I offer you, (as

by disputing who you deriv'd it from; and though I am a Stranger in these
Parts as well as you, and as much your Equal in misery, as you are my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
in those virtues, of which, that ought not to be the reward; yet I
can offer you a retirement, till your health, or business, invites you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
your journey. I am (reply'd the Stranger) so miserable a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that nothing can increase my being so, but the belief that you are a
more; and though I accept of your civility till my wounds be healed,
yet I must beg your pardon if I first learn from whom I receiv'd them. Are
you (said <hi>Artabanes</hi>) yet ignorant of that? Yes, (said the Stranger)
and cannot fancy, any that knows me, and are my Enemies, can be so much
mistaken in their revenge, as to think killing me, is any. 'Twas such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
as these, that brought them where the marks of their Courages
and Victory lay, where the Stranger pulling off all the Murtherers Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
to learn if he knew any of them, found himself as ignorant in their
faces, as in the cause of their malice; yet one of them, by the benefit of
the Air, and by the turning of his Body, faintly open'd his eyes, and being
ask'd of the Stranger, who 'twas that had invited them to so unfortunate,
and unjust an attempt, was only answer'd by half words, and signs, 'twas
the Prince of <hi>Parthia;</hi> and then he clos'd both them and his lips for ever.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96335:142"/>
Whil'st the Stranger was thus employ'd about this dying man, <hi>Artabanes</hi> was
about his companions, whose souls were so long fled from their guilty
bodies, that all his pains and art could not recall them; this made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the unknown Gentleman, who he found (by that little intelligence
he had gotten) almost as moveless, as he that had given it him; but <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>'s
presence drew him from his amazement, and after he had fruitlesly
endeavor'd to make a dead man speak, he beg'd our Hero's pardon for his
necessary incivility, which had so long suspended his waiting on him to that
retirement, which he was now ready to do. <hi>Artabanes</hi> obey'd this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but observing that he which made it, was more melancholy than he
had been, he desir'd to know whether he had newly learn'd any thing that
caus'd it. Alas Sir (said the Stranger) I am inform'd who has attempted
against my life, and am involv'd, by that knowledge, in a higher confusion
than I was in, by my ignorance, <hi>Artabanes</hi> perceiving by what he had said,
that he was not willing to explain himself, alter'd the subject of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
which he entertain'd him with, till they came to the Temple (the
place as the Stranger said of his intended journey) where our Hero brought
him to his own Lodgings, and where they had no sooner pull'd off their
Helmets, than having awhile gaz'd at each other with a mutual and high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
they suddenly after ran to embrace with as much joy and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
One of the goddesses Priests was present at this Adventure, who
carry'd his Superior the news of it; and though at his departure, the two
friends were in one anothers arms, yet he, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and <hi>Symander,</hi> found
them still in the same posture; and because the celebration of their joyes,
hinder'd them from taking notice of this company, the last of it, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to interrupt a contentment, which he knew was as just as great,
took the leisure to acquaint <hi>Callimachus,</hi> that the Gentleman his Prince em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd,
was the generous <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> the beginning of whose Story he had
learn'd from <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and the service he had render'd him, was the subject
of their last discourse. <hi>Callimachus</hi> was highly satisfi'd to have at once
in his house, more virtue than the world had besides; but whil'st he was
in the contemplation of that blessing, the Chyrurgions which he had sent
for, coming in, interrupted it, and <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> perceiving
how rude their joy had been, repair'd it by a thousand excuses; but <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hus,</hi>
more intent on their healths, than their civilities, broke them off,
to employ the Chyrurgions, who having search'd both their wounds, found
them somewhat inflam'd; and that they might prove dangerous, unless by
quietness and silence, they would contribute to their recovery; and though
<hi>Callimachus</hi> had prepar'd a magnificent Apartment for <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that, nor the Chyrurgions Prayer could invite them to a separation;
nay, 'twas with much difficulty that they extorted a promise from the
Princes, not to speak to one another in Four and twenty hours, which they
both profest was more troublesom to them than those wounds, to which
their silence was to be a contributory cure. <hi>Symander,</hi> who knew his Prince
was as much concern'd in <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> as in himself, proportion'd his care
accordingly, and the Holy Priest by his transcendent diligence, manifested
he knew the merit of his Guests; but the first time for their silence being
expir'd, the Physitians enjoin'd a second of the same continuance, which
our Hero's would not have submitted unto, but upon a faithful promise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that was efflux'd, they should, and might without danger, entertain one
another. <hi>Callimachus</hi> was as impatient at this new imposition, as they
were, on who it was impos'd; and though his curiosity was great, yet his
civility was greater, which hinder'd him from desiring <hi>Symander</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96335:143"/>
his Naration, or from begging his Prince to command it him. But
the so much impatiented however was no sooner come, than <hi>Artavasdes</hi>
remov'd his Bed, so near to that of <hi>Artabanes,</hi> that they might discourse as
commodiously, as if they both had lay'n in one. There the generous <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
began to exclaim against his fortune, for having render'd his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
contagious, and for having made the means of his deliverance, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
misfortune, than the want of it could have prov'd. But <hi>Artabanes</hi> took
him up so short, and so civilly, for thinking those wounds a misfortune,
which had secur'd his friend, that <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> by being fore'd to beleieve
them none, found them a greater. <hi>Callimachus</hi> came in as the two Princes
were in those discourses, and finding them so employ'd, offer'd again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
but <hi>Artabanes</hi> had given his friend so true a character of him, that
they jointly assured him, his company could never prove an injury, but in
his depriving them of it: This (with their entreaties) stay'd him, and he
being too much concern'd in both their Lives, not to be ambitious to learn
the Accidents which compos'd them, cast out some oblique words that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
his curiosity, which infinitely reviv'd <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
some fad expressions his friends had us'd in their late meeting, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatient to learn the whole, of what he knew but in part, beg'd him
to satisfie both <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s, and his Prayers. Sir, (said the virtuous
Priest) since you have made my curiosity your request, I will let you
know, that <hi>Symander</hi>'s Story being interrupted by the generous <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>'s
arrival, he cannot better repair that injury, than in telling his own; and
to induce him the rather to it, I can truly assure him, I had learn'd a part of it
before now, had not he himself hinder'd it; for we were already so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
as to your strange encounter at the Battel of the Trenches, and to
your coming to <hi>Rome. Artabanes</hi> was somewhat troubled, that to satisfie
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> he must be necessitated to remain awhile ignorant of a fresh
intelligence, to listen unto one he knew, yet he was so perfectly interressed
in all his friends Actions, and in the respect due to so signal a person, that he
besought <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to begin his Adventures, from their separation in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ince till then <hi>Callimachus</hi> had learn'd them from his mouth. <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
having first ty'd the generous <hi>Parthian</hi> to repay his Story, by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him afterwards with his own, began his obedience to his friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
in these terms:</p>

                  <p>AFter I had recover'd my liberty, by your running so great a hazard to
yours, which I attest the gods was a higher trouble to me, than the
benefit I thereby enjoy'd was a satisfaction, I found in <hi>Rysolis</hi> by your
commands, a continuance of your favours, who, under the pretence of
searching for me as far the Confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was my Convoy thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where he dismist me, as sending me in the quality of a Spy, after my
self. In my journey from thence towards <hi>Artaxata,</hi> in divers Towns, I saw
many which deplor'd me for dead, and found by the small services I had
paid my King and Countrey, I was much more esteem'd of, than either I
thought, or merited; I know not whether the vainty of repeating those
flattering sights, the desire of being at the Court before any knew of my
being at liberty, or the providence of the gods, made me continue my
Voyage in my disguise; but this I know, that had I cast it off, I had at the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96335:143"/>
same time cast off my safety with it. The Cloaths I then wore, were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Troopers, so that a violent War being kindled in <hi>Armenia,</hi> I past the
gates of <hi>Artaxata</hi> in that quality, without examination, and lighting at the
Palace, I went (to my admiration) to the Princesses Apartment, without
meeting any by the way, and the door of the Chamber being unlock'd, I
gently open'd it, where the reward of so large a confidence, was the sight
of the fair <hi>Altezeera;</hi> and though I unexpectedly made a little noise, yet
her thoughts were so obliquely intentive, that she heard it not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
gave me liberty to contemplate a Beauty, that had nothing in degrees
equal to it, but the zeal and passion with which I ador'd it; and truly I
was so ravisht in the contemplation of so many perfections, that had not the
Possessor of them, by hazard turning her eyes that way, taken me from
my rapture, I had longer continu'd in it; but as soon as I found to
lengthen my felicity, was to lengthen my rudeness, I cast my self at her feet,
to beg a pardon, for having continu'd it so long, and for having so much
intrencht upon her retirement. My voice and my actions chang'd the fair
<hi>Altezeera</hi>'s fear into admiration, since a Soldiers coming into her Chamber,
could not more create the former, than that Soldiers being <hi>Artavasdes</hi> did
the latter. Great gods! when her wonder was supprest, how liberally did
she reward the sufferings of my duty, and manifested so transcendent a joy
for my deliverance, that the sight of it, inspir'd me with a greater, than the
cause of it could my Princess. There (generous <hi>Artabanes</hi>) I told her
of your gallantry, and that the same fortune I had had in Love, did follow
me in War, since I ow'd my preservation to my Conqueror; but alas these
contentments were as sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

she hop'd by the cloaths I wore, I was not ignorant of it; and that I would
more fully convince her thereof, by retiring to my Fathers Army. Madam,
(I reply'd, somewhat surpriz'd) If what you last mention'd must be the
evincement of that belief, I fear 'twill be also of my ruine; and if I must
be banish'd from my Princess, and by her, I shall be in greater danger in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
than I was in <hi>Parthia,</hi> since the consolation of my miseries there, is
ravish'd from me here: As for my disguise, 'twas rather by chance, than
design, for I am as free from fear, as guilt; neighter do I know the posture
my Father, and the Kingdom is in, though, as I Travel'd, I heard some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of both: But the information was so dark and confus'd, that it left
me in as deep an ingorance, as their silence could. I will tell you then
(said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) that <hi>Anexander,</hi> after some sharp encounters with <hi>Zenax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
(who you know, before your Expedition into <hi>Parthia,</hi> had taken up
Arms to revenge his Brother <hi>Celindus</hi>'s death, and to maintain his ambition
and quarrel) within these ten dayes, under the very walls of <hi>Nicapolis,</hi>
drew your Father to a pitch'd Battel, in which his Courage and Cause gave
him so entire a Victory, that the marks of it were all the Rebels Colours,
and the Field pav'd with 35000 of their Bodies, the Reliques, with their
General, saved themselves within that City, the Mertropolis of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
which <hi>Anexander</hi> the next morning besieg'd, and from whence <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxtus</hi>
sent a Trumpeter, to let him know, he was desirous to Treat, but it
should be with his King, not his Conqueror. <hi>Anezander</hi> esteem'd it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to inform <hi>Artabazus</hi> of this, and as much his duty to dissuade him from
accepting it; which the more to induce him to, he undertook in 30 days,
to send this capitualating Traytor to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> in a posture as low, as his
condition, or hopes. These Letters came three dayes since, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in a general Council, (which till then, since your imprisonment had
*
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96335:144"/>
not been convened) <hi>Crassolis,</hi> and his party, by their old power, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
advis'd and persuaded my Brother, to go Post in person to <hi>Annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s
Camp, and there not only settle a Peace by a Treaty, or a Conquest,
but also have the glory of doing it. This being determin'd, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ready to break up, the generous <hi>Phanasder,</hi> who by your favour suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Celindus</hi> in all his Commands and Dignities, and consequently was
of the highest quality in this Assembly, earnestly motion'd, that some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
course might be taken for restoring you to that liberty, you had so
meritoriously and successfully lost; and that for the effecting thereof, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
might be sent to <hi>Arsaces.</hi> The false <hi>Crassolis</hi> in a set Speech, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mouth of the Council) gave <hi>Phanasder</hi> an answer as handsom, as
hypocritical, for his care of so publick a concernment; which to forget, (he
said) was to be as unmindful of the general gratitude, as safety. I tell you
(said <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to <hi>Artabanes) Altezeera</hi>'s words, and <hi>Crassolis</hi> flattery]
but (continu'd <hi>Crassolis</hi>) I am apprehensive, that the way which <hi>Phanas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
propounds, will be obstructive to the end, which would be sooner rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by a seeming neglect of <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> than a real and pressing sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for him, since I have ever observ'd, that the <hi>Parthians</hi> raise the value
of what they posses, by the value they know we place on it. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
(reply'd <hi>Phanasder</hi>) were <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s performances of a quality
that they could be conceal'd, there might be some appearance in <hi>Crassolis</hi>
Allegation, but since the very Act which made him a Prisoner, makes him
unworthy to continue so, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neglecting his liberty, will look too like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
not to be taken for one. These, and many other Reasons of <hi>Phanas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
were so prevalent with my Brother, that he order'd Ambassadors
should be sent, and the care of sending them to <hi>Crassolis:</hi> The King thus
declining his Advice, follow'd it; and <hi>Phanasder,</hi> who saw it no time to
dissemble, told <hi>Artabazus</hi> so much, for which he receiv'd so severe a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
that yesterday morning when my Brother took Post to go to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexander</hi>'s
Army, <hi>Phanasder</hi> retir'd unto <hi>Artemita,</hi> the chief Town of his
Government. But that which brought no small accession to his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
was, <hi>Artabazus</hi> leaving the care of this City to <hi>Crassolis,</hi> and with it,
that of two such considerable and dangerous Prisoners, as <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisdes.</hi>
But (continu'd <hi>Altezeera</hi>) that you may see my Brother was not
sent from hence only to eclipse your Fathers glory, but also to raise that of
<hi>Tygranes,</hi> I will acquaint you with an intelligence as strange, as the manner
of my learning it. You are not ignorant that <hi>Regeliza</hi> (my chiefest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident)
has as much judgment, as beauty, the last of which has so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inflam'd <hi>Crassolis</hi> eldest Son, that he has not long since acquainted her
with what effects it has produc'd; and though his Virtues, and Birth, might
have made her consider, and condemn that Declaration as a confidence,
yet the power she has over herself, made her suppress all resentments of
words, in hope to acquaint him with hers in a more sensible way; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to effect this, after by many Artifices she had induc'd the young Lover
(who she knew his Father doted on) to believe, all her doubts were, that
his passion was rather an appearance, than a reality; and that what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
her in that belief, was, his never communicating any of those secrets,
in which he was a principal Agent, and which he could not conceal, were
not his heart and word strangers; she so admirably acted her part, that this
morning her servant, to silence her reproaches and doubts, clearly inform'd
her, that <hi>Artabazus</hi> was sent out of the way, but to place <hi>Tygranes</hi> in the
Throne; That though <hi>Crassolis</hi> had not yet as great an influence over that
young Prince, as over his Father, yet he was confident of obtaining it, by
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96335:144"/>
the obligation of a Crown, and of Liberty; That <hi>Artabazus</hi> was too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to be a good Friend, and was as facile to be lost, as won; That on the
contrary, though <hi>Tygranes</hi> was hard to begain'd, yet being so, he was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
lost; That <hi>Crassolis</hi> had done too much privately, not to apprehend
the discovery; and having merited death, his Adversaries were too dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and too considerable, not to fear it; That <hi>Anexander</hi> was so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and powerful, that either he would obtain, or assume the Authority, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which, would be his Fathers ruine; That <hi>Palisdes</hi> and <hi>Tygranes</hi>
were perfectly reconcil'd, and had join'd their interests; That <hi>Artabazus</hi>
and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> absence, would give them the opportunity to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
where they were Prisoners; and that <hi>Crassolis</hi> (to leave as little in
the power of fortune as he could, and to seem to follow what he lead) was
to be made a Prisoner by his Friends, to have this mutation appear his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
not his design, thereby not to lose the Father, if the Son lost
himself; and that all this was immediately to be put in execution, lest the
delay of the Conspiracy, might be the ruine of it. <hi>Regeliza</hi> seem'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this Plot, lest her Lover might have suspected she condemn'd it; but
he was no sooner gone, than she (being more faithful to her Mistriss than
her servant) came this morning, and acquainted me with what I have you,
which was the cause of that deep melancholy you found me in, and which
your presence here will continue and increase. The fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> (said
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) had no sooner done speaking, than I found, that the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
was the cause of so solitary a Court; that <hi>Artabazus</hi> was an enemy to
reason, and to gratitude, or to <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> and that <hi>Phanasder</hi> was not to
the two latter. 'Twas therefore that I humbly beg'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> to make <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temita</hi>
her Sanctuary, and not expose herself amongst those, to whom Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and Nature were only words. But my fair Princess absolutely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, alledging, that there was more hazard in a flight from <hi>Artaxata,</hi> than
in a continuance in it; That if she did remove, <hi>Regaliza</hi> must do so too,
and consequently lose all intelligence; or by leaving her behind, raise a
jealousie in <hi>Crassolis</hi> son of the Cause, and thereby inevitably ruine what
it should perform; That she had sent already an Express after <hi>Artabazus</hi>
with the intelligence, and an assurance that she would, to continue it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
where she had learn'd it, till either his Commands called her from
thence, or his Forces render'd it a secure habitation; that if after such an
Engagement she should flie away with me, who (all men knew) had a
passion for her, it might raise too pregnant jealousies that her love, and not
her fear, was the occasion of her remove; and that since she knew there
was, nor could be nothing intended to her prejudice, she had no reason to
contribute to it, by her own Actions, and to put herself in danger to be
safe, when she was already so without any. I then propounded my going
immediately to <hi>Artemita,</hi> which was not above 200 Furlongs off, and with
<hi>Phanasder</hi>'s Forces attempt to suppress the Rebellion before it appear'd. To
which my Princess answer'd, That could I effect my Proposition, what proofs
could I bring of the intended Conspiracy, but <hi>Regeliza</hi>'s saying it? which
would be too invalidated by her servants denial, and be look'd upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> an
Act of my hatred to <hi>Crassolis:</hi> But my Proposition was so far from being
feasible, that <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and his <hi>Partisans,</hi> had above 4000 select men alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in <hi>Artaxata,</hi> who would execute their design before I could tell it <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasder;</hi>
she therefore conjur'd me, since my continuing with her would
but increase her fears, and my danger, and that my being out of <hi>Artaxata</hi>
might probably contribute to the speedy reduction of it, and her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that I would immediately leave off all thoughts of the former, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96335:145"/>
embrace the latter. This sad command went much against my inclination,
but it went more against my duty to disobey it, therefore as soon as we had
form'd all our resolutions, and setled our affairs and correspondency, I kist
my Princesses hands, and having beg'd her to consider of the merit of my
obedience, by the torment of it, that thereby I might find my consolation
in my very sufferings, I took my leave, and going out of the Palace, I met
my faithful <hi>Philanax,</hi> to whom I made my self known, and whose joy at
it, had like to have been as prejudicial to me, as if it had been treachery;
but finding his error, he immediately repair'd it: and after he had told me,
that <hi>Lindesia</hi> with all her Family was remov'd to <hi>Thospia (Anexander</hi>'s
Government) the place too, where he had found both his sickness and
his health; and that I had commanded him silently, and with some Jewels to
follow me to <hi>Artemita,</hi> without any disaster next morning by Sun-rise I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
there, where the generous Governor made me a reception, in which I
read both his satisfaction and heart. The Night following <hi>Philanax</hi> came
to me, and acquainted me, that what I knew of in design, was turn'd into
action. This true Alarm made me think my immediate repair to the King
and <hi>Anexander</hi> requisite; and whil'st I was fitting my self for my intended
journey, <hi>Phanasder</hi> sent some Troops of Horse to beat the wayes, who did
too, a Party of the revolted, leaving 100 on the place, and presenting him
with half as many Prisoners; from some of which, we learn'd that a Post
was intercepted with a Packet for the King, and that <hi>Crassolis</hi>'s eldest Son
was kill'd in a quarrel, an hour before they were come out of <hi>Artaxata;</hi>
we immediately concluded, that the former was the cause of the latter, and
that <hi>Tygranes</hi> and <hi>Palisdes</hi> declin'd the forms of Justice for the Sons pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
lest it might have incens'd, and appear'd a cruelty to the Father.
My Equipage was no sooner form'd, than I took leave of <hi>Phanasder,</hi> who
was extremely pressing to have been my Convoy, which I absolutely decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
since it might lose a Province, I was confident his care and presence
would preserve; I besought him too, to be very vigilant for intelligence,
to communicate to me what he learn'd, and to raise what Forces his power
and credit would maintain. This <hi>Phanasder</hi> faithfully promis'd, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conducted me with 500 Horse to the Confines of his Government, we
there parted; but because I found that to Travel with all my company,
would take up too much time, I commanded them to follow me by easie
journies, and only taking <hi>Philanax</hi> with me, I continu'd mine, which was
indeed so long and troublesome, that the next evening, to refresh our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and selves, we quitted the High-way, to gain a Wood not far from it, (for
we durst not enter into any Towns, lest they might have become our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.)
We had not been an hour in this wild Inn, when <hi>Philanax</hi> (whose
turn 'twas to watch whil'st I did sleep) came and interrupted mine with
the most dejected and confus'd look that horror and amazent was capable
to put on, and told me, Alas Sir, I fear we are for ever ruin'd, and that the
gods have forsaken virtue, to take part with vice. This sad Introduction, and
his sadder countenance, made me start up, and impatiently enquire, whether
too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ittle rest, and too much travel, had not made him frantick? Ah Sir!
(he reply'd with a deep sigh) would I were, for that would appear a less
misfortune both to you, and me, than what has created in you that belief:
for as you were taking your rest, a sad voice in a neighbouring Thicket
reach'd my ears, and invited me to discover the unfortunate utterer of it;
but I was no sooner approach'd near enough to satisfie my curiosity, than
alas I found it was <hi>Artabazus,</hi> tearing his hair, and by a thousand other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
cruelties, seeming to take part with fortune, by contributing to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96335:145"/>
his own misery. Oh gods! (<hi>Philanax</hi> I reply'd) what is it that thou
tellest me? That (said he) whose truth your sight may convince you of,
if you will silently steal wheremine receiv'd so fatal an intelligence, Come
(said I <hi>Philanax</hi>) I will go and satisfie my doubts, though I believe the
clearing of them, will be a greater trouble than they themselves are; but
canst thou not (I continu'd) judge at the cause of this unexpected change?
Yes Sir, (he reply'd) and I am much mistaken, if it be not of a nature
which will be as great a grief unto you, as the effect it produces. We were
by this time so near, that had he continu'd his discourse, he must have had
more Auditors than one; and I had crept but a little further, when alas I
did perceive my poor King in so sad and dejected a posture, and so many
tears running from his eyes, that the loss of my own, had been more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than to have had them so employ'd; I had not the patience to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his sufferings, and not offer them my consolation and assistance, which
rising up to perform, the noise I made was so near, and so sudden, that the
unfortunate <hi>Artahazus</hi> believing he was surpriz'd, covering his face with
his Cloak, he cry'd out, Strike, oh strike, for I am reduc'd to so much mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that mine is uncapable of accession, but by permitting me to live, and
continue in it.</p>
                  <p>The gods forbid (I reply'd, prostrating my self at his feet, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his knees) that ever I should ease my Princes Afflictions by so crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
a Cure; No (Sir) they have doubtless sent me hither to offer you
towards that duty (but in a nobler way) my Sword, which if it proves
fruitless, I will then employ it rather to follow your Fate, than act it. These
words and actions were as strange to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> as the cause that render'd
them necessary was to me; and at length fancying he knew my voice, by
degrees he unseal'd his eyes to be resolv'd, and no sooner was, than going
back two or three steps, he cry'd out, 'Tis <hi>Artavasdes!</hi> 'Tis <hi>Artavasdes!</hi>
Yes Sir (said I) 'tis he, who did not he value his life out of a belief that
it might be serviceable to you, would blaspheme the gods for having so
long preserv'd it, to shew him his King as much forsaken of his Subjects, as
of Fortune. I fear <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> (he reply'd) I fear thou wilt repent thy
kindness, when thou shalt learn what has reduc'd me to need and invite it;
for know but two dayes since, I not only contemn'd thy Fathers advice in
not listening to a Treaty with the perfidious <hi>Zenaxtus,</hi> but upon Hostages,
sent even him into <hi>Nicopolis</hi> to conclude it; and relying on the faith of
that Traytor, against <hi>Anexander</hi>'s prayers and intelligence, I kept so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a Guard in the Camp, that in a night as black as his action, he surpriz'd
his own Hostages, cut thy Fathers victorious Army in pieces, I fear himself
too; and all the benefit I receiv'd from the fidelity and courage of my
Guards, was the time only with one of them, to flie where Fortune and the
gods did lead me, which was to this Wood, where inforc'd by hunger, I
sent the only companion of my misery to the next Town, who last night
brought me some refreshment, but accompany'd with news, that after it, the
want of relief had been no misfortune; for alas he told me, that <hi>Tygranes</hi>
was at liberty; that he had seized upon <hi>Artaxata,</hi> declar'd himself King,
and Partizan of the Rebels; that he had imprison'd the faithful <hi>Crassolis,</hi>
kill'd his Son for sending me intelligence, and hath promis'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> to
<hi>Palisdes,</hi> whose Nuptials in five dayes are to be celebrated. This morning
I sent him again for further intelligence, and to procure some Horses, both
ours being dead by the violence of our Travel; the faithful Guard was
already at the extremity of the Wood, when his care of my safety made
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96335:146"/>
him come back and assure me, if he were not return'd at a time he limited,
I might conclude he was either killed, or taken, and that therefore I should
remove my self to some other concealment; this time is an hour since
eflux'd, so that when you came to offer me your assistance for preserving
my life, I believ'd it was some-body that was come to afford me his, by
easing me of it: Though I will not (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) give you so
low a character of my grief, as to endeavor to describe it, yet I must tell
you, that my constancy, which was firm enough not to sink under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of my Kings, my Countries, and my Fathers ruine, was too weak to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the thought of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s, which had so sad an operation on me,
that my misery appearing more transcendent than my Princes, for awhile
he suspended the sad reflections on his own, to consider mine; but after
that through pity, or goodness, he had given me leave by his silence to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a throng of sighs and complaints, he told me, Consider <hi>Artavasdes</hi> what
my griefs are, when thine have so strange an influence; those that afflict
thee, are thy misfortunes; those that do me, are my faults; thou hast that
consolation, that the gods have made thee miserable; I have that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that I made my self so, and consequently must consider the cause of
my misfortune as great a one, as the effect. Alas Sir! (I reply'd) that
which you alledge for an Argument to console me, is an aggravation of my
misfortunes; for the Actions of the gods are more just than those of men,
and they having inflicted mine, 'tis a more pregnant testimony I have meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, than that you have those you have drawn upon your self; when
I consider the wayes how mine are impos'd, I cannot hope they will end,
since that expectation must be grounded on no less an impossibility than the
justice of the gods; but the wayes in which yours are inflicted, carry their
comfort with them, for had you been guilty, you should not have been
your own Punisher; and not being so, you cannot doubt of your relief,
but by injuring the highest powers as much as your hopes. Were there
(said <hi>Artabazus</hi>) but as much truth as art in this Argument, I might be
flatter'd into a belief, that I am as innocent as miserable; but when the
gods make us become our own executioners, 'tis so much a mark of being
guilty, that then to doubt it, is to have a higher title to our punishment.
Yet (I reply'd) we seldom see, that Humane Justice (which is a Copy of'
the Divine) does execute a Criminal by a Criminal: But Sir (I continu'd)
let us not contribute to our own misfortunes, by so long disputing whose
are the greatest, rather let us seek out a retiring, since by what you have
told me, I fear this will prove no safe one. Alas! (the King answer'd)
that we should flie, is not more requisite than it is impossible, since for ought
I see, you are as destitute of Horses as I am. No Sir (I reply'd) I have
two, not far from hence, which we will make use of; as for <hi>Philanax,</hi> I
know he would lose, much more hazard his life, to preserve his Kings. Yes
(said that faithful servant) 'tis my inclination, as much as duty; and next
the spending of it in your service, the best fortune it can aspire unto, is, to
lose it in it. <hi>Artabazus</hi> embrac'd him for his Loyalty, and gave him assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that if ever he return'd to his former fortune, he would build his in so
plentiful a way, that he should acknowledge he had found his interest in
his duty. Then turning to me, he said, But now <hi>Artavasdes</hi> we are fitted
for our journey, whither shall we direct it? <hi>Thospia,</hi> which is the only
honest and secure retreat I can rely on, has a way to it as hazardous
as continuing here.</p>
                  <p>Ah Sir (I reply'd) why does your memory or suspitions, do the gallant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Artemita,</hi> &amp; the Province belonging to it, so much wrong? you will
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96335:146"/>
find, that could he rejoyce in any of your misfortunes, he would in this,
which will afford him so ample an evincement of his Affection and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
'Twas (said <hi>Artabazus</hi>) neither my memory nor suspitions, but (I
fear) my reason that made me not look on <hi>Phanasder</hi> with the same faith
that you do; for <hi>Crassolis,</hi> whose judgment if forming opinions is as great
as his honesty in communicating them to me, has given me so bad, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
so just a character of him, that I should as soon put my self in <hi>Zenax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s
hands, as his. Oh gods! (I cry'd out) is it possible that <hi>Crassolis</hi>
could so much bewitch your reason, as to make you consider your servants
as your enemies, and they as your friends? Believe me (Sir) I will make
that dissembler appear what he is, in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st extreme, as <hi>Phanasder</hi> will
shew himself in the best, with whom you shall find a Sanctuary as inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as his faith, and for which I do engage you both mine and my life Upon
your score (<hi>Artabazus</hi> reply'd) I will venture what I would not on my
own, neither would I give my retiring to <hi>Phanasder</hi> that name, were I as
confident of his Loyalty, as of his that made me suspect it. Sir, (said I,
going to our Horses) this is a time fitter to flie from a Traytor, than prove
one; but I will be contented to wear that name, if I do not evince that
<hi>Crassolis</hi> does it already. Then commanding <hi>Philanax</hi> to go meet the rest
of my servants, and return with them to <hi>Artemita,</hi> (which afterwards he
did through many dangers, and then brought us word how the faithful
Governor was put to death, in torments as great as his fidelity, for not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
to the Rebels where the King was conceal'd.) <hi>Artabazus</hi> and I,
by very unfrequented wayes, and by as great diligence as good fortune, in
three dayes arrived there also; but never was there a more melancholy and
silent journey: for after I had acquainted my King with all my Adventures
since my imprisonment, his griefs were so obliging, that they gave me the
liberty without interruption of entertaining my own; where to find a
remedy for them appear'd as difficult, as the torment which thereby I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.
We had not been an hour in <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s Government, when he
(who was gone to beat up one of the Enemies quarters) return'd with
success, and presented <hi>Artabazus</hi> with the Keys of <hi>Artemita,</hi> and with the
lives of 200 of his Enemies. I cannot express with what assiduousness and
zeal he served his Prince; you may learn them better by their effects than
description, which were, that they wholly converted <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into as great a confidence, and made him acknowledge he had injur'd
the best of his Subjects, when he thought <hi>Phanasder</hi> was not so, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first resign'd his own magnificent house to the King, receiv'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his orders, and doubled his care and guards, came to visit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me, that by a Prisoner of quality that day taken, he was assur'd, that
to extinguish all difficulties between <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> Partisans and <hi>Tygranes,</hi> the
latter had engag'd himself within two days to give <hi>Altezeera</hi> to <hi>Palisdes;</hi>
who either to satisfie his ambition, his passion, or his doubts, commanded all
his Party to keep their houses, till he were in possession of what might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
them with honour and safety to take the field. I am then (I cryed
out) a creature as far above being capable of more misery, as of relief.
Sir (said <hi>Phanasder</hi>) I would not have told you so fatal an intelligence,
had not my hopes of relieving your sorrow been as great, as the certainty
that this would create it. Alas! generous Friend (I reply'd) my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot so much yield to hope, as to afford me the latter with the
former: Do not I know <hi>Altezeera</hi> is in a place as strong by Numbers, as
by Art and Nature? Do not I see my self void of Forces, and of all
things tending towards her Relief, but my desires of attempting it?
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96335:147"/>
Do not therefore endeavor to silence my despair, since 'tis as impossible a
Task, as to remove what creates it. At least (said <hi>Phanasder</hi>) let me
acquaint you with what I design, to prevent <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s loss, which I know
will be accompany'd by yours.</p>
                  <p>Yes, yes, <hi>Phanasder,</hi> (I reply'd) I invoke the gods to punish me with a
higher affliction (were it possible) than the losing that fair Princess, if, in
the same minute I hear she is in <hi>Palisdes</hi>'s Arms, I do not cast my self into
those of death. That (said <hi>Phanasder</hi>) which I have to propound, is of
a quality, that you may dye acting your revenge, if you cannot reach
your hopes, and be certain not to survive your felicity when you have lost
it. Ah Friend (said I embracing him) this is something worthy <hi>Phanas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and my attention. I believe (said he) when I have told it you, you
will esteem it too worthy your hopes: This Night (he continu'd) I shall
have here a thousand select Horse, and as many Foot, drawn out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Garisons of this Province; I can take from <hi>Artemita</hi> 500 Horse, and
as many Foot, without endangering the place, or <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s safety; these
numbers being too few to storm <hi>Artaxata,</hi> we must supply their want with
Art; to effect which, to morrow Night (which is the Eve of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nuptials) we will march during the obscurity, by unfrequented ways
to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> and under some Ruines and Banks of <hi>Artaxis,</hi> we may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
lodge a greater Body than ours; at the first opening of the gates,
I will send in at several Ports (to avoid suspition) 200 of the valiantest
and youngest Soldiers in womens cloaths, but with weapons under their
gowns, who passing for Villagers come to see the Solemnities, may, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
draw towards the gate next to us, seize upon it, and give us entrance;
which if once we have, we deserve to lose our hopes, if we do not convert
them into certainties. I was infinitely satisfi'd with so probable a way of
relieving my Princess, and so certain a way of death if that fail'd. But
whil'st we were making and answering all Objections in our design, an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer came and advertis'd his Governor, that all those Forces he had sent for
were near the City, and expected his commands; this joyful intelligence
separated us, he to dispose of those Troops, and I to acquaint <hi>Artabazus</hi>
how we intended to employ them. I found him somewhat startled at the
greatness of the hazard and attempt, but when I had told him that our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
was too desperate to refuse any cure; that as we had lost our selves
by a deep security, so we must endeavor our restauration by as high a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that we could but lose 3000 men, and that we might recover half a
Kingdom, which at least follow'd the fate of <hi>Artaxata, Tygranes,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisdes,</hi>
he at last gave us his leave, and his prayers. The next Night all
things being (by <hi>Phanasdes</hi> care) in an exact readiness, we began our
march, and by continuing it without any intermission or encounter, an
hour before day we came and lodg'd our selves behind those Banks and
Ruines, and having sent our young Villagers scattering to the several Ports,
they were no sooner open'd, than without any examination or suspition,
they all enter'd, and about half an hour after, by a successful resolution, cut
off as great a number as their own, which compos'd the guard of the East
gate, and having given the agreed-on signal, <hi>Phanasder</hi> with 500 Horse,
ran with full speed to the assistance of his Amazon's, who, for all his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
were, before he join'd them, deceas'd above 50. I cannot express
with what ravishment I follow'd with all the rest of our little Army, nor
with what fury we trampled over all those that oppos'd our passage to
the Temple, whither, I was told (by a Prisoner) <hi>Tygranes</hi> (immediately
before the Alarm) had lead the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who I was greedily am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96335:147"/>
to relieve, lest I might lose the invitation and reward of my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
I therefore beg'd <hi>Phanasder</hi> to pardon the impatiency of a Lover,
and to oppose our Enemies, whil'st I was going to relieve our Friends.
That generous man conjur'd me to make haste, left he might miss of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by missing me; I had not leisure to answer so flattering a Compliment,
for I went directly with 500 Gentlemen, to the dwelling of the gods,
where I was necessitated to sacrifice unto them near 1000 Soldiers that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
my entry, and where the reward of that victory was great, though
the victory itself were not; for by it I possest the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who I found
abandon'd by <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and her design'd Husband, and with whom I left
all those to secure her liberty, who had obtain'd it, being hastily called
away to assist <hi>Phanasder,</hi> whom I join'd in the great field before the Royal
Palace, ready to receive the charge of 3000 Horse and Foot led by <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Palisdes.</hi> I will pass over the Accidents in this little Battel, to tell
you the event of it, which was an entire victory on the justest side, and
which shew'd that Fortune had no hand in it: <hi>Palisdes</hi> found his Fate on
that Sword on which his father and brother had found theirs, but the
Prince <hi>Tygranes</hi> by flight avoided his, though in this Action he manifested
so much courage, that had his duty been as great, he had not given testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of it in a way which chang'd that virtue into a crime. With the
winning this little Battel we won <hi>Artaxata,</hi> which I left to his care that had
conquer'd it, and went to my Princess, who receiv'd me with such passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
praises, that I found in them a higher reward, than in having been suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful;
but observing that her joy or ignorance, made her attribute the
entire glory to him that had but the least share in it, I let her know, that
'twas not only <hi>Phanasder</hi> that had acted her release, but design'd it too;
that for my particular, my grief for her captivity had been so large, that I
could do nothing but deplore it; and that it had not been so transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as to have made me decline the thought of her relief, had not the
thought of the impossibility of it render'd it so. Whatsoever you tell me
(said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) I will call you my Restorer, and I believe <hi>Phanasder</hi> will
neither envy nor deny you that Title; but believe me (she continu'd)
though you had not reliev'd <hi>Altezeera,</hi> your Rival had not possest her, but
my evasion only was a trouble to me, because the way which conduc'd to
my not being <hi>Palisdes</hi>'s, had render'd me eternally uncapable of being
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s. Thereupon she shew'd me a glittering steel, which I can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say struck me with more fear than all of the same metal I had seen that
day in my Enemies hands; which my Princess observing, she told me, what
<hi>Artavasdes!</hi> does a demonstration of my Affection fright you? And had
you rather I should be unconstant, than dead? Yes Madam (I reply'd) for
I had rather dye, than you should. But (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) had you rather
have me live in vice, than dye in innocency? when too that vice, would
render me as unworthy, as undesirous to live.</p>
                  <p>Ah Madam (I reply'd) let us (I beseech you) break off this discourse,
left perhaps the evincement how much I love you, might induce you to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I do not, You may (said <hi>Altezeera</hi> smiling) impose what Laws you
please, where you have made your Conquest, which I will obey, lest you
might think it not so entire as it is. We had in the Temple some discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this nature, which at length were interrupted by the generous <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasder,</hi>
who came to kiss the Princes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es hand, and to tell her, that now she
had no more enemies in <hi>Artaxata,</hi> than those which had lost their lives for
having been so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:96335:148"/>
Have you then (said to <hi>Phanasder,</hi> after <hi>Altezeera</hi> had receiv'd him with
a respect worthy his services and virtue) given <hi>Crassolis</hi> the reward of his
infidelity? No Sir (he answer'd) <hi>Crassolis</hi> shall be (if you please) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s sentence, which pronounc'd from that mouth, will
be more regular, and perhaps more sensible, we are too much his Enemies
to be his Judges: But (he continu'd) when I spoke of the Princesses Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I only intended those in Arms. I believe (said I) though <hi>Crassolis</hi>
does more merit the name of Enemy, than any that have been in Arms;
yet we shall find it a more difficult task to make the King think him his, than
we had this day to conquer all ours. If he does not (<hi>Phanasder</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd)
he will find his punishment in his fault; but were I of your faith,
I would immediately be just to <hi>Artabazus</hi> and <hi>Crassolis,</hi> by having the latter
executed. No <hi>Phanasder</hi> (I reply'd) I beseech you leave off that thought,
for if we impos'd his death, we might bring his guilt to be doubted, by the
way in which it is punish'd.</p>
                  <p>I tell you this (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) the more particularly, that you might
see how near I was to have avoided all my future miseries, and how I my
self contributed to the preservation of him, which caus'd them; for this
Inchanter <hi>Crassolis,</hi> made himself appear as innocent to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> as he did
faulty to us; nay, the loss of that life which discover'd his Treason, he
made a successful argument of his innocency, and thereby obtain'd a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whose effects I shall eternally deplore with as much cause as violence:
but whether (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> interrupting himself) does the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on that Traytor transport me? I must beg your pardon for a fault,
which I believe you will excuse when you know the cause; and the sooner
to acquaint you with it, I will return to the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who I left in the
Temple, and who merited one with more reason (perhaps) than the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to whom that was consecrated. She too was so merciful to <hi>Crassolis,</hi> as to
think it lust to have his King only his Judge. Her opinion was our resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which we had no sooner elected, than we return'd to the Palace, and
meeting by the way <hi>Palisdes</hi>'s Body carrying to the Grave, it had the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Solemnity of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s tears, which afforded him a fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

better than his life had merited; but it may be she shed those for his crimes,
and not his fall. <hi>Phanasder</hi> and I having waited on <hi>Altezeera</hi> to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
withdrew our selves, to make our dispatches to the King, who in few
dayes came to his old residence, and new conquest, where he receiv'd <hi>Crassolis</hi>
into his former favor, who made use of it according to his former
practice. You do perhaps, think it strange, that I found <hi>Altezeera</hi> so early
in the Temple, but I believe you will no longer, when I acquaint you, 'tis
the <hi>Armenian</hi> custom for the Bride to employ half the day of the Nuptials
in Prayers, and Divine Solemnities, to render the gods propitious to the
marriage. Her first thus happily prevented, I was a thousand times ready
to implore her permission to beg her of her brother, and when I had even
supprest my fears, and taken up a resolution for so transcendent a request, I
was diverted from it, by the certain intelligence that <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of 60000 men, was marching towards <hi>Artaxata,</hi> to recover or lose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
before it; and that the Prince <hi>Tygranes</hi> was gone to <hi>Pompey the Great,</hi>
(the Successor to <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Army and Fortune) and by his prayers, and
assurances of a considerable Party's joining with him, induced that great
Captain for a time to suspend his prosecuting <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to invade <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
towards which the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles were flying with great celerity. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi>
in this great exigency gave me the command of all the <hi>Armenian</hi>
Militia, and opening the publick Treasures, left them to my dispose, with
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96335:148"/>
which I immediately levy'd an Army to oppose <hi>Zenaxtus,</hi> great enough to
raise my hopes of relieving <hi>Anexander</hi> (if living) or of revenging him
(if dead.) I gave the gallant <hi>Phanasder</hi> Commission and Money to levy
another, to secure and defend the Passes on the Banks of <hi>Araxis,</hi> where
then <hi>Pompey</hi> was Campt, till I had decided the dispute with <hi>Zenaxtus,</hi> who
was the nearest and the most pressing Enemy. To be brief, <hi>Phanasder,</hi> who
reign'd more in <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s Subjects, than he himself did over them, so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
form'd his Forces, that before I thought he had sent his inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to have rais'd them, I learnt they were all ready, and possest of the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Frontiers. For my particular, with 6000 Horse, and 24000 Foot,
I advanc'd to meet the Enemy, he relying on his numbers, and I on my
quarrel, and the virtue of those that fought in it, we soon came to a Battel, which lasted till night did the office of Trumpets, and founded a retreat.
The advantages and the animosities of both Armies were so resembling,
that we soon found what call'd the Soldiers to rest, was esteem'd by them
an injury, which the next morning was again evinc'd; for they could no
sooner see their enemies, than they went to destroy them; and though we
omitted nothing of either side which might end the dispute before the day
did, yet I believe this had been the perfect Copy of the Precedent, if an
Accident, as strange as the Battel, had not put a period to it. The Scene
of this long Tragedy was at the foot of a great Hill, which in our hottest
dispute we saw cover'd with a great cloud of Cavalry, that so terrifi'd both
Armies, (not knowing to which of them the release was intended) that
whatever <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> and I could do, all our Soldiers at first suspended their
Swords as their thoughts, then sheath'd them, and by degrees return'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Ensigns, thinking all dispute against so powerful a supply, as vain
as dangerous. I was enrag'd to find that the faith of my Army, for I was
confident those Forces came to ravish, not contribute to my Victory; and
in that belief I prest my Army to return to the charge, that if they were
friends, they might see and have no share in our success; and if not, to fight
them before they were join'd. But all my persuasions being fruitless, I was
taking some resolution of an honourable death alone, since I was deny'd it
in company, but those designs instantly vanish'd, and gave place to joyes
as pleasing, by those new Troops falling like a storm on <hi>Zenaxtus</hi>'s Army,
who by it, having lost their hopes, soon after did their courages and lives.
My Army contributing nothing to the Conquerors glory, but the not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating
in it. <hi>Zenaxtus</hi>'s death accompany'd by 40000 of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was the end and expiation of their Rebellion, all the rest having been
kill'd the precedent way, and taken in this. After the execution was ended,
I rid up and down the Field, to learn from whom <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Artava'des</hi>
had receiv'd so signal an obligation; but I soon found the sight of my
Preserver, was a greater blessing than the preservation it self, for 'twas the
generous <hi>Anexander;</hi> I flung my self instantly at his feet, acknowledg'd
him twice my Father, in giving me my life, and in preserving it, and by a
million of other demonstrations, endeavor'd to manifest a contentment as
great exteriorly, as it was in my heart. That generous Princes extasies were
not inferior to mine, which being somewhat lessen'd, to satisfie my impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
longing, in knowing from what kind god he deriv'd his deliverance,
he told me, after I was fallen into <hi>Zenaxtus</hi>'s hands, by his treachery to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus,</hi>
which might as easily have been prevented by the King, as it was
foreseen by me; the persidious Traytor had immediately executed me, but
that he thought a death without lingring, rather a mercy than a revenge,
therefore I was kept alive, till some torment as great as his cruelty, or as he
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96335:149"/>
merited, was found out, which being at length, I was carried out of a
Prison that I believe could not be an inferior one to that he design'd me;
and as the Tormentors were beginning their office, (my Judge being one
of the Spectators of his sentence) a Post arriv'd, who presented him a
Packet, which (as I after learn'd) brought the news of your success
against <hi>Artaxata,</hi> the death of <hi>Palisdes,</hi> the flight of <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and your
being made Generalissimo of all <hi>Armenia,</hi> this which in all probability
should have increas'd his fury, suspended the execution of it, and return'd
me to a less troublesom Prison; but though he gave out, that he preserv'd
me only, to make you (whom he was then going against) participate in my
sufferings, by imposing them in your sight; yet I rather believe my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve
proceeded from his apprehension of a turn in fortune, and that his
would be desperate, if yours were successful, did he extinguish his fury in
my blood: whatever was the cause I cannot determine, yet he carry'd me
Prisoner in his Army; but as the gods ordain'd it, <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> committed the
care of my restraint, to a Gentleman who was engag'd in his Cause, more
by his relation to those in it, than his approbation of it. This generous
Keeper, the first night of our march, allow'd me half his Bed, and taking
the opportunity of our being without Auditors, by a handsom discourse,
assur'd me of his pity for my miseries, and of his intentions to relieve them;
that my patience in enduring my Torments, was of a quality that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd him, it proceeded not from my Fortitude, but my Innocence, and
concluded that he was thereby invited to be of a Cause, which gave the
Defenders of it power to conquer their Enemies by their very sufferings.
This proceeding was so free, and so like a Gentleman, that to have doubted
it, had been a Crime, as great as his Virtue, I therefore gave him assurances
of my believing his professions, and that if he would decline <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> for
<hi>Artabazus,</hi> he should thereby better his Fortunes, as much as his Cause.</p>
                  <p>Sir, (said he) I will take up Arms to evince that the Quarrel I approve I
will defend, but I will accept of no Command but an inferior one to what
I have here, left those that are Enemies to Truth, and to me, should alledge
my interest was my conversion. In brief (said <hi>Anexander</hi>) the next night,
he so judiciously order'd our Escape, that leaving nothing to Fortune, he
left us nothing to fear, so that without any encounter or interruption, we
reach'd in three dayes to <hi>Thospia,</hi> from whence my Deliverer sent <hi>Zenax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
the cause of his being there, and where, by <hi>Lindesia</hi>'s power and care, I
found that Body of Horse ready for service, with which I march'd after
<hi>Zenaxtus,</hi> but could not overtake his Army, till you had so weaken'd and
harrast it, that I came rather to act an Execution than a Fight; and instead
of helping <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to a Victory, I have rob'd him of one. This flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
was so palpable, that I did not esteem it fit by a Reply to evince it one,
but beg'd him by his permission, to have the honour to be known to his
generous Preserver. He merits it (said my Father) for I have seen him
this day do more against <hi>Zenaxtus,</hi> than when he gave <hi>Anexander</hi> his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
we went thereupon towards those new and victorious Troops to find
him, but alas we found him too soon, for before we had gone half the way,
<hi>Anexander</hi> perceiv'd him pale and cold amongst the dead: oh gods! what
did not my poor father at the fight of that fatal object? But let us pass
over those grateful extravagancies, though they abundantly manifested
how precious to him the life was, whose death was so passionately deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The next morning after our Victory, by a general Muster, we learn'd
what it cost us, which was 10000 men lost, and as many unserviceable for
the present; with this Army we return'd to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> whose littleness made
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96335:149"/>
some believe we had mist of success, and others, that we had dearly bought
and deserv'd it. <hi>Artabazus</hi> (when my father kist his hand) protested he
had brought him two things he most ambitiously desir'd, Victory, and
<hi>Anexander;</hi> that he was as much oblig'd to him for the latter as the former;
and if he were capable of any grief whil'st he lookt upon him, it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a reflection of what his Credulity had so much hazarded, and for
his having neglected an advice where the punishment of it could not have
been greater than the fault. My reception was much resembling my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
so were my acknowledgments, which finisht, I presented the King my
Commission, which <hi>Anexander</hi>'s Liberty made my Justice and my Duty to
restore. But (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) why do I amuse my self to give you my
story by retail? 'Tis enough you know I kept my Commission, because my
King would not receive, nor my father accept it, and by that retension I
found the duty of it, and my promise oblig'd me to join with <hi>Phanasder,</hi>
whose courage all this while had kept the <hi>Romans</hi> from possessing what
they daily saw, there being only the River <hi>Araxis</hi> betwixt both Armies.
But to abuse your patience as little as I can without disobedience, I will
omit my Princesses joyes at my late return and success, and her contrary paf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for my then separation, which too appear the more unfortunate, since
the cause of it was to oppose the Conquerors of the world (for that title
the <hi>Romans</hi> gave themselves, and their performances did almost confirm)
with Forces too that were so diminisht by a former success, that they could
hardly expect any in the future: But what consol'd me in this Expedition,
was, if I were successful, my joyes would be no longer protracted; and if
I were not, I resolv'd my life should not. 'Twas with these thoughts and
resolutions I advanced towards <hi>Phanasder,</hi> whose numbers I found as much
diminisht by sickness, as they could have been by a defeat, so that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of both our Forces did not compose as great a Body as mine did
before <hi>Zenaxtus</hi>'s defeat, or his before the mortality; but that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
our admiration was, that though <hi>Pompey</hi> knew our weakness, yet he
made no advantage of it by any attempts, but alas! our admiration was
cured by our grief; for not many dayes after, <hi>Artabazus</hi> (with a small
Train) came to the Camp, and told me, that all the higher <hi>Armenia</hi> was in
a general flame, which he had sent my father to quench, with Forces risen
in haste, and that his intelligence of <hi>Artaxata</hi>'s intended revolt upon the
least misfortune, had made him esteem my weak Army a securer Sanctuary
than that City. Oh gods! Sir, (I hastily cry'd out) if <hi>Artaxata</hi> be no
Sanctuary for <hi>Artabazus,</hi> how could he esteem it one for <hi>Altezeera?</hi> I have
(said <hi>Artabazus</hi>) neither esteem'd it one for <hi>Altezeera,</hi> neither left her
there, she is gone to <hi>Thospia</hi> with <hi>Anexander,</hi> who, were he not concern'd
in her safety for his Kings sake, I believe he would be for his Sons. Those
words made me blush, and the former made me know that <hi>Pompey</hi> had
lay'n quiet, till this new combustion might (by a diversion) facilitate his
entry. That same day therefore (because we hourly expected the <hi>Romans</hi>
advance) a Council was call'd, in which <hi>Crassolis</hi> (who attended the King)
assisted, his opinion was to determine all by Battel, not by Treaty, since
the latter could not possibly cement the fractions, but by the Kings yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much to the Prince, which concessions would be a dangerous President;
would be termed by the <hi>Armenians</hi> a submission, and would invite <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
unto future Revolts by the first proving so successful, who being too
reflected on as a Successor to the Crown, the multitude (which commonly
consider their own benefit, and not the right) might in the future incline
to him, who, according to the course of nature, was probably longest able
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96335:150"/>
to reward or punish them; That a victory against the <hi>Romans,</hi> would be
one too against the Rebels, who never had taken up Arms, had not they
thought those of the <hi>Romans</hi> would have exempted them from making any
use of their own, that the cause of the revolt being taken away, the effect
of consequence would follow; and if the gods had decreed our ruine,
'twas more like <hi>Armenians</hi> to fall by the Sword, than by Submission, without
which he durst (as he said) lose his life, if ever <hi>Pompey</hi> would treat: This
advice <hi>Phanasder</hi> and I oppos'd, not only because 'twas his, (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
we might think it the worst) but because too it was really so, and
esteem'd so generally by all the Council, who concur'd in my reasons, which
were, That if the revolted follow'd the fortune of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by having
an external Peace, we should have an internal one also; That all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Armenian</hi> Militia were almost destroyed by Civil and Foreign Wars, by
Successes, and by Mortalities; That not only the Rebels within, but the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> without, were all pulling on her fate; That she
had never more Enemies, and less power to resist them; That nothing but
a Peace could avoid the former, and restore the latter; That it was better
to yield something, than lose all; That time might procure a return of
those concessions, or enable us to retake them; That by a present Peace
we should (if there were in the future an occasion of War) make it, when
the <hi>Romans (Tygranes</hi>'s greatest help) would not be in a readiness to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him any; That by making a Peace, <hi>Artabazus</hi> would make <hi>Tygranes</hi>
his Subject; but by a War, he would make him his equal, and perhaps his
Superior; That thereby the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Parthian</hi> Arms, which were ready
to invade <hi>Armenia,</hi> would leave her in a quiet security, by being employ'd
one against another; and that if a Peace were refus'd, after an offer of
reasonable terms, we had thereby made the gods our friends, and invited
them to punish an enemy who was guided by the rule of Power, and not
of Justice. I know not whether <hi>Artabazus</hi> fear or judgment made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin
<hi>Crassolis</hi>'s advice to follow the Councels, but I know the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he sent a Herald to <hi>Pompey</hi> to offer a Parley, which he absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd,
without <hi>Artabazus</hi> would submit himself as conquer'd, and to his
mercy yield that part of <hi>Armenia</hi> on the East of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and
pay a yearly Homage for the residue to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Though my
resentment at so barbarous a message was great, yet it could not transcend
my Kings fears, who valuing <hi>Pompey</hi>'s power by his insolency, in apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the former, told me, there was no way but to submit it unto the
latter. Never, never Sir, (I cry'd out) shall <hi>Artabazus,</hi> whil'st I wear a
Sword, unking himself, let the gods do it, if that misfortune be writ in the
Book of Fate; and though I esteem'd it fit to Treat with the <hi>Romans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Army was the greater, yet now I am absolutely against it, their
unjust and insolent demands having at least equal'd our Forces; 'tis more
glorious to dyeat the head of 2000 Gentlemen, than to live with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a King without the power, and to let our succeeding Story's register,
that <hi>Artabazus</hi> was the first that dismember'd his Kingdom, and the onely
man that was conquer'd in it. The King esteem'd what I said to be fitter
for his commendation than his practice, and the false <hi>Crassolis</hi> perceiving the
Father was ready to give as much by Fear, as the Son could win by Battel,
upon the second sitting of the Council, (which was to fix upon a positive
Answer for <hi>Pompey</hi>) he was as absolutely for a Treaty, as at the first he had
been for a War, and so proportion'd his Reasons to his Princes Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that he determin'd to put himself into the <hi>Roman</hi> mercy, when the
Presidents of some Kings of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and of the <hi>Africans,</hi> demonstrated
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96335:150"/>
they had none. <hi>Phanasder</hi> and I, at this resolution, beg'd <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for our selves and <hi>Anexander,</hi> to retire unto our Governments, that
by seemingly becoming Rebels to his Authority, we might preserve some
Forces to maintain and raise it in the future; but our request concerning
our selves, found a resembling return to that we had made for our King,
and 'twas no wonder he declin'd his Friends advantage, when he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
his own; but as the Assembly was upon the point of rising, a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp came into ours, and sent me (in) a Letter
from the Lieutenant-General of that Army; I was surpriz'd at the news of
that name, for I knew <hi>Pompey</hi> had been without one since the death of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus;</hi>
but opening and reading what was sent me, I found the Contents
of it was, to desire a single meeting with me that day, and that the desirer
of it was the generous <hi>Ventidius</hi> (a Patrician of <hi>Rome</hi>) with whom (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my residence there, and in <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Army) I had contracted an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and passionate friendship: I cannot tell you my joy, to learn I had no
small power with one <hi>Roman,</hi> that had so much with all the rest; I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
communicated this to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> beg'd his permission to wait upon
my Friend, and that he would not permit any of the Council to be out of
his fight till my return, left the discovery of his intended submission, might
hinder my preventing it. The King having promis'd my desire, I dispatcht
the Trumpet to <hi>Ventidius,</hi> and immediately follow'd him my self to a place
assign'd upon the Banks of <hi>Araxis,</hi> where I found my generous Friend was
already come, out of a confidence I would not fail his commands, which,
(after a world of embraces, and new reiterations of an ancient Friendship)
I desir'd to learn that I might obey them. I would not (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>)
have given you this trouble but to serve you, and to evince our former confidence of one another is not diminish'd, or impair'd by absence or time,
or by our now being of different Parties. I will acquaint you with that
which shall abundantly perform it: Know then, that but two dayes since
I came to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army to be his Lieutenant-General, which Title I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from the favor of <hi>Iulius C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sar,</hi> who, if my affection deceive me not,
you will see as famous for his power, as he is already for his courage and
virtue; and though now he has the command of all <hi>Gaule,</hi> (one of the
greatest and noblest Provinces in the world) and though against that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Nation he has won more Victories than ever <hi>Alexander</hi> did against the
effeminate <hi>Persians,</hi> yet I have seen him at the reading of that <hi>Grecians</hi> life,
weep that his own has not been so victorious and active, when indeed, if he
ought to have shed any tears, they should have been rather of joy, than a
contrary passion, for <hi>Alexanders</hi> having been his foyle, and not his pattern;
by this you may fancy what <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sar</hi> is like to aspire unto, when though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
he has attain'd unto such a height of glory, he yet esteems himself
scarce ascending; and lest <hi>Pompey</hi> (who he only thinks worthy the name
of his Rival) should prove a successful one, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sar</hi> has sent me to the second
command of this Army, which he knows I have some interest in, it being<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
compos'd (for the greater part) of <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends, who judge nothing but the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire can
satisfie a mind as large, have sent <hi>Domitius</hi> to him, to let him know, that
'tis more for the interest of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make the <hi>Armenians</hi> their Friends,
than their Subjects; That they apprehend <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sar</hi>'s Ambition, Power and
Fortune, will make them stand in need of more than <hi>Roman</hi> Arms,
to maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> liberty; That besides those fears, they have
contracted as great and as just ones, from the Virtue and success
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96335:151"/>
of a Slave, which if the progress of his Actions prove as fortunate as
the beginning, will soon make <hi>Italy</hi> the Scene of two contrary extremes;
That therefore he should with all diligence disingage himself from those
Eastern Wars, lest whilst he is increasing the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> another pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
it. This (continu'd <hi>Ventidius</hi>) I had from <hi>Domitius,</hi> who has been
my companion in my journey, and who esteeming me more a friend to
<hi>Rome,</hi> than to <hi>Caesar,</hi> trusted me with this intelligence, which <hi>Pompey</hi> so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
believes, that I being inform'd 'twas <hi>Artavasdes</hi> which commanded
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Army, and the bad posture it was in, I took occasion this
morning to let my General know, now the opportunity was offer'd of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
all <hi>Armenia</hi> to him, that his power might make them fear, but his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
love him; that by countenancing so unnatural a Son against his Father,
the success of the Action would be blemish'd by the cause; that he which
would be an enemy to him that gave him life, could hardly be a friend to
one which gave him a Kingdom; since the power which could confer such
a gift, will (by the knowledge of his own want of merit) keep him in
perpetual fears and jealousies that it will reassume it; that his carriage to
his father evinces, that those which most oblige him, ought most to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him; and that the General of <hi>Armenia</hi> was so particularly known to
me and my friend, that I durst engage my self as much for his gratitude if
he were oblig'd, as for his induring all the miseries in the world, rather than
incline to any conditions which might look like a submission. To which
<hi>Pompey</hi> (who has set up his rest to win me) reply'd, I shall be rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to grant <hi>Armenia</hi> what you desire, because their General is your
friend, than out of a belief thereby to make that Kingdom a friend to me;
therefore <hi>Ventidius,</hi> upon your own score I gave you a power (to conclude
with them) as large as the Senate has given me, I have too but even now
receiv'd an assurance which makes me think <hi>Tygranes</hi> fit for my revenge,
(were he worthy of it;) For a Packet that he sent <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> before his
defeat and death, came by a strange Accident into my hands, which (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher'd)
discovers, his intention was to keep me here, to divert and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
<hi>Artabazu</hi>'s Forces, till <hi>Zenaxtus</hi> had subdu'd them, and then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me no share in <hi>Armenia,</hi> but what I could purchase by my Sword; and
though what I now tell you may seem to lesten my obligation, yet if you
consider it rightly, it will raise the value of it; for if <hi>Tygranes</hi> had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
in innocency, I must have rewarded it with my Conquests, but his
guilt will give the <hi>Romans</hi> what I shall win with their Arms. I will (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) exempt you from the repetition of our discourses, to
acquaint you with their conclusion, which was, that <hi>Artabazus</hi> the next
day should visit <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he should pardon his Son as <hi>Pompey</hi> would
because he was so, and that he should give the <hi>Roman</hi> Army 6000 Talents
as a largess. That <hi>Pompey,</hi> on the other side, should salute him by the
name of King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> Friend and Ally to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that he
should demand none of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Territories, but should restore him
to the little Kingdom of <hi>Sophena</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had formerly taken
from his Crown.</p>
                  <p>After this result, the generous <hi>Ventidius</hi> return'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp,
and I to the <hi>Armenian,</hi> where I learn'd the King was still in Council; whither
I went, and where as soon as I came, <hi>Artabazus</hi> with a timorous action came
towards, and ask'd me, Well <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> what must I expect? Has <hi>Pompey</hi>
rais'd his conditions, because I was so long a granting them?
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96335:151"/>
No Sir (I reply'd) you are so far from parting with a share of your King
dom, that by the generosity of <hi>Ventidius,</hi> I have gotten you another
Thereupon I told him all we had concluded on, but the poor Prince was
so incredulous, that even for a time, his good fortune afficted him as much
as his ill, but when by many protestations I had remov'd all his doubts,
he ran to embrace me, and was in such transports, that had we been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what his fears had been, we might have read them in his joyes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many Titles of gratitude were given to all men, as <hi>Artabazus</hi> gave
me, the names of his Deliverer, Restorer, and Guardian-Angel, were the
lowest of his irregularities. The next morning we put all things in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to conduct him to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, but truly we found ours so thin
by the mortality, and by the absence of those which fled from it, that we
could hardly form a Guard fit for a King, and hardly leave one fit for a
Camp. As soon as we came to the Trench of the <hi>Romans,</hi> two Lictors, with
Axes and Rods, came and advertis'd <hi>Artabazus</hi> he must light, for never
any man rid in a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp; he obey'd this advertisement, and to
repair his having offer'd an offence (which his ignorance of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
render'd none) as soon as he saw <hi>Ventidius,</hi> who attended him
within the Gates, he presented him with his Sword, which <hi>Ventidius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
with much humility, and pointing at me, told him, you owe
(Sir) both it and your Crown to that Man. I was so asham'd at this
submission, that I heard not then my Friends complement, who conducted
<hi>Artabazus</hi> to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who came with much civility to salute him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my Prince's submissions were below his quality, I will pass them by,
as unfit for my repetition, and tell you, that all which <hi>Ventidius</hi> and I
had concluded, was ratify'd by <hi>Pompey</hi> to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> only the <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
placing the Father on the right hand, and the Son on the left, desir'd
the former to give the latter for his maintainance, the Kingdom of <hi>Sophena,</hi>
which too, he said he ask'd, only to convince <hi>Tygranes,</hi> that they had both
pardon'd him. This <hi>Artabazus</hi> willingly granted, and besides the 6000
Talents, gave the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers and Officers so great an additional gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
that they found from his bounty, more than they could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from their Swords. <hi>Pompey</hi> too, for <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s sake, plac'd on me
many Civilities, of a nature, as generous as his own. But <hi>Artabazus</hi> had no
sooner past the River <hi>Artaxis,</hi> than <hi>Pompey</hi> sent for <hi>Tygranes</hi> to let him
know, before their parting, how great his faults had been, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which had pardon'd them, and to infuse into him some principles,
which might in the future have made him acknowledge he had more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him by by his Advice, than he could have done by his Sword. But
that unfortunate Prince finding his designes reveal'd, and his hopes ruin'd,
was so incens'd against <hi>Pompey</hi> (who he consider'd, as the Author of both)
that he told his Messenger he would not come into a mans company, who
for fear, or for 6000 Talents, had sold his Chest and Faith. <hi>Pompey</hi> inrag'd at
so sharp, and so strange a replymade him a prisoner; this accession of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
made <hi>Tygranes</hi> utter some words, that induc'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to send him in that quality to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be kept till his arrival, to
be led in tryumph. <hi>Artabazus</hi> was soon advertis'd of this proceeding, with
the impossibility of having it alter'd, in which he found, that <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s
want of duty which hitherto bad been his trouble, was now his consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for my particular, I was so sensible of the Prince's sufferings, though
in them I read the justice of them; that I became both to <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius</hi>
an earnest (though a fruitless) Sollicitor. But whilst the <hi>Armenians</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:96335:152"/>
and <hi>Romans</hi> were celebrating their newfriendship on the Banks of <hi>Arraxis,</hi>
there came advice both to <hi>Artabazus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> that <hi>Arsaces</hi> was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in person on those of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with a vast Army, and had invaded
the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies in <hi>Syria,</hi> by his youngest Son <hi>Phraates. Pompey</hi> at this
Alarm, by a personal visit, invites my King to joyn with the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in a League offensive and defensive, against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and to
conclude and ratify the conditions of it, that he would send a solemn
Ambassy to the Senate. <hi>Artabazus</hi> joyfully embrac'd this overture, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
his affront (at the Battel of <hi>Miramnes</hi>) and to be united to a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to which the world submitted; for my part, all the reluctancy I had,
proceeded from being thereby involv'd in a War against my Preserver, and
Restorer; but a publique duty yielding to a particular, I submitted to this
League, with resolution, as well for gratitude as safety, to avoid the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Artabanes</hi>'s Sword, and to employ my own as little as I could (with
Loyalty) in a quarrel he thought worthy to act in, and defend; (<hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
only by a smile took notice of his friend's flattery, who thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
his discourse.) Whilst the <hi>Roman</hi> General was with <hi>Artabazus,</hi> there
came an Express from <hi>Annexander</hi> to acquaint him, that by the assistance
of <hi>Evaxes</hi> and <hi>Falintus,</hi> he had defeated one of the Rebel's Armies, in
the higher <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that the other, learning their companions misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and his new contracted friendship with the <hi>Romans,</hi> were come
without Arms, and had submitted to his Mercy, which he besought <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi>
might so act, as his subjects might find more safety (as well as hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty) inreturning to their allegiance, than in casting it off. This request,
in the joy of the success (and the necessity of Subjects Hearts, rather than
Destructions)
found a ready grant; and that the intended Embassy might
have the greater appearance, <hi>Annexander</hi> was elected for the Ambassador,
his Victories dispencing with his Absence, and rendring his Presence the
more considerable at <hi>Rome;</hi> and though the League was but in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet <hi>Pompey</hi> before his march into <hi>Syria,</hi> to convince <hi>Artabazus,</hi> how
confident he was of its conclusion at <hi>Rome,</hi> and perhaps, to manifest,
how little he apprehended <hi>Phraates,</hi> he left <hi>Afranius</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to unite his Legion with my Army, against <hi>Arsaces,</hi> for I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
sent with all the Forces already rais'd, to oppose his invasion.
I cannot tell you, how infinitely I repin'd at Fortune, for creating new
Wars upon conclusion of the old, and for raising almost as many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
against the satisfaction of my flame, as in the object that gave it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there were Beauties and perfections: <hi>Annexander</hi> upon the Kingscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
left that Army, whose Swords had conquer'd one, and whose Fame
had another, and was no sooner at <hi>Artaxata,</hi> than he was sent from thence
to <hi>Rome,</hi> with <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Letter to the Senate. His Equipage in that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
was so magnificent, that many who judg'd of the King's State by
the Subjects, concluded <hi>Armenia</hi> had been a Countrey fitter for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
than Friendship of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the danger had not appear'd as great as the
recompence. My Father having begun his journey, I advanc'd towards <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>
with <hi>Afranius,</hi> in whose little Camp I saw a pattern of Discipline and
Obedience, which made me no longer wonder at their success. I had that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
too, that my way lay by <hi>Thospia,</hi> and that my Princess did my Army
the houor of seeing it; whereby (but going to a battle) they receiv'd a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler reward (except the repetition of the same) than they could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
after a victory. This prophetical recompence rais'd both the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and his Soldiers resolutions, to act in Gratitude what they should
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96335:152"/>
out of hope, and that which gave us no small one of obtaining a Victory,
was the advertisement one of my spies brought me, that <hi>Artabanes</hi> was
not in the <hi>Parthian</hi> Army. But the <hi>Euphrates</hi> being between that and the
<hi>Armenian,</hi> for above three Moons we onely past the time in skirmishes,
wherein our successes were so good, that perhaps they could not more
enflame our desires, to decide all by a Battel, than they made <hi>Arsaces</hi>
apprehensive of coming to that Tryal, who was not long after sent for
by the Prince <hi>Phraates,</hi> being hotly alarm'd by the approach of <hi>Pompey,
Orodes</hi> esteeming his youngest sons fears to be just, and thinking there was
more honor to be won from <hi>Pompey</hi> than <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> left his eldest Son, the
Prince <hi>Pacorus,</hi> General of that Army, against which I lay encamp'd, and
with other Forces went to relieve <hi>Phraates,</hi> and oppose the <hi>Romans.</hi> And
though <hi>Pacorus,</hi> three days after his Fathers departure, invited me to a
Battel, which next to victory, was the best happiness I could desire in
that War, yet I had no small reluctancy to employ my life against a Prince,
from whom I had receiv'd it; but the ties of Loyalty to my King, and of
Duty to his Commands, made me return him word, I would obey them,
which too, was accompany'd with a passionate and true vow, that I had
rather have drawn my Sword against my self, than him: That I could
not expect his pardon did I not know, he did, the obligations which
Subjects have to their Kings, and that all my consolation was, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querd,
I should increase his Glory, and if Conqueror, I should so employ
my Fortune, as thereby evince, I was so long ungrateful, but only because
I could not be otherwise. The next morning I drew my Army off the Banks
of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to give <hi>Pacorus</hi> liberty, without interruption, to pass over
that Bridge of Boats he had made; and no sooner were the <hi>Parthians</hi> and
<hi>Armenians</hi> ready to begin the Battel, than I made a Proclamation upon
pain of death, none of mine should act <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s, but that they should
take as many prisoners as they could, without indangering the general
safety, and then the signal being given, we began the charge; but the
<hi>Parthean</hi> Army wanting <hi>Artabanes,</hi> wanted Victory, which the <hi>Armenians</hi>
purchas'd at a bloudy rate; twice that day <hi>Pacorus</hi> singl'd me out,
and twice that day I fled the Encounter, after I knew against whom I
fought, though in our first meeting, my ignorance made me spill some Bloud,
which when I knew from whom I drew it, I wish'd it had been my own.
One hundred and five Ensignes, 6000 Common Soidiers, and 300 Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
(in which number <hi>Surena, Labienus</hi> and <hi>Vixores</hi> were) remain'd in
our hands, as arguments of our success, all which the next morning I sent
to <hi>Pacorus</hi> with a Letter, which begg'd him to believe the way in which I
manifested my gratitude, was as great a trouble to me, as it could be to
him. Two days after I caus'd all the <hi>Parthian</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Bodies in
one Funeral Fire to be burnt, and the next night <hi>Pacorus</hi> having done the
same with his Bridge, march'd away, and left me the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> (a happiness greater than the glory of
the success) with whom I found <hi>Artabazus,</hi> whose pardon I implor'd
for having dispos'd of the effects of our Victory without his knowledge,
and to his Enemies. But he seem'd to be angry at the request, not that I
had offended him, but that I thought so. As soon as the importunate ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of my Tryumph were ended, I went to my Prince's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where I so represented the violence of my Passion, and the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
opportunity of now imploring her Brothers permission of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
it as happy as 'twas great, that my importunate Prayers extorted
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96335:153"/>
a grant from his words, which her blushes and disorder acquainted me
with before. Never, (generous <hi>Artabanes</hi>) never was there any thing
greater, than my joy at this concession, but my fears and tremblings when
I implor'd it. Oh gods! what did I not say to my Princess, that I could say
no more? and what vowes did I not make, that my constancy should be
as great as my felicity? the evening of this blessed day, as I was going to
cast my self at my Kings Feet, and to implore a grant, which was as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be desir'd with too much humbleness, as to be receiv'd with too
much extasie, I met a Gentleman sent from him for me, who I desir'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me, whether he knew the cause; he told me that he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it, unless it were a Pacquet, which was then deliver'd him by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.
I shall not (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) be asham'd to tell you that I
trembl'd, left this might be some new Alarm of going to the Field, and
in that apprehension I came into the Kings Closet, where he had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
lockt the door, than he told me; I hope <hi>Artavasdes</hi> you are not ignorant,
that if my resentments for your services are not as great as they themselves,
yet at least they are as I am capable of: but that I may be oblig'd to your
Reason, as well as to your Goodness, for so charitable an opinion, I have
sent for you, to conjure you, without any Ceremonies, to name your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which I shall be as pleas'd to confer on you, as you can be to receive,
and if it be one which can satisfy your desert, I shall more value my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by that effect, than by any other. <hi>Artabazus</hi> having thus spoke, fix'd his
Eyes upon me, and I mine on the ground, with so much confusion in my
looks and gestures, that he read in my silence, what I was not able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him by my words. Well <hi>Artavasdes</hi> (he continu'd) since you seem
to give me your election, whether it proceeds from your modesty, or the
merit of your performances, that leaves me but one way to recompence
them; I must tell you, the former, and the latter, directs me to reward
both by the gift of <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who, if I be not much mistaken, will find
her own satisfaction in yours, and in my gratitude. Oh gods! (continu'd
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) you only know my transports at those ravishing words, which
were no sooner spoke, than I prostrated my self at my Kings feet, embrac'd
his knees and told him, ah Sir, I beseech you do not mention reward or
gratitude, when you do the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> nor so much wrong the
blessing of your gift, as to term it a recompence, since it is so far above
manifesting you are grateful, that by it I am render'd uncapable of ever
being so. Great gods! (I cry'd out) lessen my felicity by some aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iction,
left I do not long possess it. Yes <hi>Artavasdes</hi> (my King reply'd) you shall
possess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> your not demanding her, increases your Title to her;
and I find my self as much ty'd to this gratitude by your humility, as by
your services; but to limit that joy, whose greatness you apprehend, may
destroy it self, and to shew how soon the gods have granted what you so
earnestly implor'd, you must a while suspend the fruition, to act that which
may induce my Kingdom, to esteem me as just in conferring my Sister on
you, as I do therein esteem my self. Thereupon (commanding me to rise) he
gave me a Letter from <hi>Annexander</hi> to him, and another directed to me, both
which I read, and found they contain'd, that he had been receiv'd at <hi>Rome</hi>
with a magnificer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which testify'd his welcome; but in the highest of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating,
the gods had struck him with a lingring sickness, which most of the Physitians assur'd him, would be astedious as irrecoverable; that therefore
he implor'd, that I might be sent (if <hi>Armenia</hi> were in peace) with Power
and Instructions to perfect the Treaty, in case he ended his life before it,
and commanded me to do him the last office of closing his Eyes, or if I
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96335:153"/>
came too late for that duty, yet at least, to celebrate his Funerals. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(I beseech you) how sad an influence this unfortunate Pacquet had
on me, and how in one moment the gods convinc'd me, that neither joy
nor grief could destroy me, I should for ever have acknowledg'd the
confining my felicity, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the qualifying my sorrow by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
had been their providence, if since, I had not found it their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for they made me able to conquer those extreams, but to preserve me
for greater; what need I tell you more, than that my duty to my King, my
Countrey, and my Father, made me pass an engagement to undertake the
voyage, and to mittigate the cause and trouble of it: <hi>Artabazus</hi> by many
assurances, accompany'd by as many vows, told me at my return, I should
be establish'd in a felicity, which he long'd as much to confer on me, as I
could to possess it. I omitted to acquaint you, there was another Letter
to <hi>Lindesia,</hi> from <hi>Anexander,</hi> who receiv'd the news of her Husbands sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with a constancy that render'd her unworthy the affliction; but as
soon as I retir'd from <hi>Artabazus,</hi> I went to my Princess, who perceiving
so high a sadness in my Face, was so much a friend to my passion, as to
believe nothing but a misfortune in it, could have created so large a one;
and in that Faith ask'd me, whether he Brother had been so unjust as to
esteem his allyance a greater reward than my services merited? I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
asham'd at this question, and that I should be capable of so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
a melancholly (having my felicity granted) as to induce my
Princess to suspect it had been deny'd. In this perplexity I continu'd in a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that increas'd her doubts, but as soon as I was able to suppress them,
I did, by acquainting her what had past betwixt my King and me, and how
that I was never so near my Blessing, and yet never was so like to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from it. This separation, and <hi>Anexander's</hi> danger, the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>
concluded, was very sensible, since the joy of <hi>Artabazus</hi> Grant could not
intirely console me, which induc'd her to suspend her own aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ictions (for
<hi>Anexander</hi>'s condition) to lessen mine, that by the knowledge of hers
could not but receive a large accession. But when she came to discourse
upon my absence, and to bring reasons to qualify the hardness of it, alas!
they were so far from bearing that name, or from producing that effect,
that her esteeming they were so, or that they could be thought so by me,
created a greater misery, than she endeavour'd to silence. But the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> either as a Son, or as a Subject, made me
more firm in my resolution of undertaking it, than <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
sensible of it, and though perhaps she lessen'd her disorder, that
it might have a resembling operation on mine, yet it produc'd a contrary
effect, and made me tell her, she had more Fortitude than Love: But
though I apprehended nothing more, than leaving my Princess; yet for
three days, (during which my dispatch was making) I did nothing when
I was out of her company, but wait upon my King to hasten it; the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the last day, coming to his Chamber, I found him writing, and in
great perlexities, sometimes blotting out what he had written, then fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away his Pen, and tearing his Paper. I was something surpriz'd at this,
but at last, turning his looks by chance where I was, he seem'd as much
surpriz'd at my having seen his disorder, as I was at it; but having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
compos'd himself, he call'd me to him, and told me smiling, <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
it may be you do as much wonder at that little fury I am in, as you
will at the cause, which I will tell you, not only that you may remove it,
but be convinc'd, that I have nothing of reserve from my Brother, for
that name I will henceforth give you. Know then, that what <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96335:154"/>
Eyes have acted in you, another Lady's have in me, and though by many
vows I have profest to have now a Passion only for her, yet as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Power or distrust, she will receive no satisfaction, but of a
Letter to my abandon'd Mistriss, that I have deserted her, and of another
to her self, that I only adore her, which hard sentence I was obeying, when
you came in; but having never been blest with a fortunate expression, I
found my self more troubl'd to act my obedience, than to undertake it,
and since you are so happily present, I will make use of your stile, that
my Mistriss may be as much satisfy'd with it, as with my passion.
I was more perplext to obey his commands than to learn them,
for I was not ignorant <hi>Artabazus</hi> was addicted to a Passion, which if plac'd
upon a perfect object for a legitimate end, deserves a nobler name; but
knowing that the Flames of Kings are apter to consume virtue, than che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
it, I was unwilling to shew my ignorance in a cause, which I too
much detested to serve at so dear a rate; and therefore excus'd my self of the
former by the latter; but <hi>Artabazus</hi> was so pressing, that at length being
more vanquish'd by his importunities than reasons, having perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his instructions, to follow them I writ this former Letter to the
forsaken, and this latter to the ador'd Mistriss.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rtabazus</hi> was so flattering as to commend these Letters, and having
passionately enjoyn'd my silence, especially to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> whose scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Virtue (as he said) might think that a crime, which was but a
diversion, he desir'd me immediately to retire, that he might transcribe, and
send them, and commanded me two hours after to come and receive my fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
dispatch for <hi>Rome,</hi> which by then should be finish'd. The short time
which I found was left me, I dedicated to the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who I found
had more constancy to discourse of my departure than to see it. I will not
particularize all was said when I took my leave, which I did with so deep
a melancholly, that I have often since consider'd it a Prophecy and not a
Weakness; my Princess too, perceiving its greatness participated of it, and
practic'd a weakness her self, which she had condemn'd in me; and it may be
suspecting my fears had as great a share in it as my separation, she told me,
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> I have hitherto determin'd to give you no pretence to <hi>Altezeera,</hi>
but what you had by your services and her inclination, but to fortify your
Title, which I find your absence and sorrow will need, I here protest by all
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96335:154"/>
things I hold in highest Veneration, as long as you honor me with your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
I will pay you mine; I am now ty'd to you by Religion, as well as
gratitude, which are Bonds I cannot cancel, without rendring my self, as
unfit for all other Men, as unworthy of <hi>Artavasdes.</hi> And I (I reply'd,
casting my self at her Feet) do protest by <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who not to adore, is
a higher sin than to do it, that not only I will have a passion for her, whilst
she blesses me with a reciprocal one, but continue mine, though she
should prove so unmercifully just, as to recall hers. The fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>
then permitting me to kiss her hand, hastily retir'd into her Cabinet,
lest I might have perceiv'd those Tears, which at once would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the wound and the cure. From my Princesses Apartment, I went
to <hi>Lyndesia's,</hi> who perhaps with more sorrow, but less demonstration of
it, saw my departure; and because she had then receiv'd the Picture of
<hi>Udosia,</hi> my only Sister, which I was much taken with (who had her
education in a Principality that belong'd to <hi>Annexander,</hi> and who then
began to disclose a Beauty, which I should without flattery have thought
unparallel'd, had I not seen <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s and the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s) she
gave it me as well to satisfy my request, as to convince the <hi>Romans,</hi>
that in one of those Nations, which their Pride call'd barbarous, there
was a Beauty to punish it. At last, by my Kings consent, having left
the generous <hi>Phanasder</hi> (who then declar'd himself a Votary to Love)
my Lieutenant in <hi>Armenia,</hi> with a small Equipage I left <hi>Thospia,</hi> and
having past through <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> I arriv'd at <hi>Lydia,</hi> where
lighting upon a good Ship, I crost the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Egaean Sea, and landing at <hi>Athens,</hi>
which I then found as famous for her Ruines, as she had been for her
Learning, there I left one of my Domestick Servants (who I much trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
by reason of a great indisposition he was visited with. From <hi>Athens</hi>
by Land we travell'd to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which stands upon that little
<hi>Isthmos,</hi> that separates <hi>Morea</hi> from <hi>Achaia.</hi> From <hi>Corinth</hi> we went to
<hi>Seutica,</hi> from thence in a <hi>Roman</hi> Gally, crossing the Gulph of <hi>Tyrrhene</hi>
and the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, I came to <hi>Terentum,</hi> but with much hazard (for
your Army) at length to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I found the virtuous <hi>Annexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
had concluded the Treaty, but still continuing under such a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
that my Grief for it could not transcend the Physitians won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it. There I told him with repetitions, all that had happen'd in
<hi>Armenia,</hi> how my joyes attended but my return and his recovery, to be
consummated; I shew'd him too the young <hi>Udozia</hi>'s Picture, which he
consider'd with the admiration it merited, and lifting up his hands, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implor'd the gods to protract his life, till he saw the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> in
my possession, and the original of that Copy. Whilst I recided in that great
City, the Fame of the generous <hi>Artabanes</hi> so fill'd it, though under a name,
which, (had not Fortune lov'd <hi>Rome</hi> more than Virtue) he had impos'd
on all the <hi>Italians,</hi> that after the defeat of <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Army which was by <hi>Annexander's</hi> Treaty to invade <hi>Parthia</hi> under
<hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> was stopt; but <hi>Pompey</hi> who then was as far on his return
as <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> was by divers expresses commanded to transport his Forces
into <hi>Italy,</hi> where if he preserv'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he would win more
glory than he had done by so much inlarging it; But when by your Valour
and Conduct, the two Intelligences came out of <hi>Mummius</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
the Senate immediately were assembl'd, and though they shew'd a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
as great as their danger, yet I easily perceiv'd, it proceeded more
from their dissembling than their nature. The result of that meeting was to
fortify <hi>Crassus</hi>'s broken Troops, with all those which could be immediately
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96335:155"/>
drawn out of Garrisons, or leavied, and to command him to put the fate
of <hi>Rome</hi> to Battel, that if the gods had destin'd her subversion, she might
fall like her self. The fame and necessity of this decision, drew under <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>'s
Ensignes, all the gallantry of <hi>Italy,</hi> and because we were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of fortune in another War, I resolv'd to be his in this, which by
<hi>Annexander</hi>'s permission I was; The <hi>Roman</hi> General at my arrival in his
Camp, offer'd me such Commands, that I esteem'd, not to have declin'd
them, an injustice as great as his civility, but though I refus'd participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in his Commission yet I could not in his Councils and Intelligences,
where I learn'd how <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s Virtue, which could not have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
was sold; the strange innundations which happened then, facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
our overtaking you, but your march to <hi>Rome</hi> so Alarm'd it, that the
Senate invited <hi>Annexander</hi> to remove into the Capitol, left the City might
not prove a secure Sanctuary; but that generous Prince declin'd it, to
convince them, he understood their compliment as 'twas meant, which
rather to manifest their care, than their apprehension. At length that
fatal day came, wherein I lift up my prophane Arm against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
of Men, and in which I had receiv'd the reward of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
I could not excuse (since I could not attribute without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
the miracles <hi>Spartacus</hi> did, to any other Sword, than that of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>)
had not he thought the greatest punishment was, to shew me my
offence. <hi>Artabanes</hi> could not hear those civilities, without interrupting
them, which he did, to tell <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> you might more justly say (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Friend,) that for ignoring by your prodigious valour, who was the
master of it, and for preserving my self so long after having out-liv'd my
defeat, you punisht both those Crimes, by sparing a life, which if then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, had been exempted from torments that can never cease but
with it. I believe (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) it will be a less trouble to you to
hear the continuation of my Adventures, than to find out matter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me, and in that Faith I will prosecute them. But because the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Callimachus</hi> had heard all, till our arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> I will from thence
continue my relation. As soon as <hi>Crassus</hi> was return'd to the Senate, who
deny'd him the honor of the Triumph, not but that his success merited it,
but because (as they said) the persons did not against whom 'twas won,
and that he himself had refus'd the Ovatio-Triumph, which he esteem'd
as much too-low in one extream, as his Lords esteem'd the other too-high
in a contrary one; He was immediately dispatch'd with his Army towards
<hi>Parthia,</hi> taking <hi>Greece</hi> and the lesser <hi>Asia</hi> in his way, and though <hi>Annexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
by servent Commands, enjoyn'd my return with the <hi>Roman</hi> General,
and to leave his death, or recovery to the gods, yet my duty submitted to
my passion, and that which made me confident that the latter would not
be suspended by the former, for above a Moon, was, the Physitians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
assuring me within that time, <hi>Annexander</hi> would be past hope, or
past danger; I know too, that <hi>Crassus</hi> marching with a vast Army, I might
give him so much advance, and yet overtake him, before he could begin
the War, besides, I esteem'd it my duty to endeavour the Prince <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s
deliverance, who was daily expected at <hi>Rome,</hi> but my highest motive of
continuing longer there was, to enjoy the blessing of <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
whose company made me so much a friend to my self, and none to
gratitude, as to rejoyce at his wounds, and pray against their speedy cure;
and since I have begun to tell you my crimes, I will not conceal any of them,
for I was too in some manner satisfy'd, that by your Kings cruelties, you
were out of a capacity of commanding the War, and of preserving him in a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96335:155"/>
power to continue it, which though from thence I promis'd my self success,
yet my joy had not so poor a cause, but deriv'd its being from a certainty,
that thereby I should not imploy my life against the preserver of it; all these
motives the gods rais'd for my ruine, which happen'd by my continuance
in <hi>Rome,</hi> where I receiv'd a loss, which neither the Empire of it, nor all
those of the world can repair. As soon as <hi>Crassus</hi> had past the <hi>Adriatick</hi>
Sea, the same Fleet which transported his Army out of <hi>Italy,</hi> brought
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s into it, he was receiv'd all the way in Tryumph, but especially at
<hi>Rome,</hi> where not withstanding the generous <hi>Ventidius,</hi> and my Prayers, the
unfortunate <hi>Tygranes</hi> compos'd a part of it. This miserable Prince who had
in short time, resented the two greatest extreams, was no more able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the latter, than he had been to keep the former; and though he were
not blest with resolution enough to oppose the vice, yet he was to avoid
the shame of it, which he evinc'd, by the sad demonstration of becoming
his own executioner. The gods shall be my record, that I shed Tears of
grief for the death of him, that would have shed some of a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for mine, though too, by his fall, I was then in a certainty of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Armenia,</hi> which by a legitimate succession, was to descend to the fair
<hi>Altezeera:</hi> for though <hi>Artabazus</hi> had a Son call'd <hi>Artaxias,</hi> and that he was
born after his Master was Crown'd Queen, yet being be gotten unlawfully
(which blemish the King esteem'd the Marriage would deface) all the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Nobility consider'd him rather as their Princes shame, than his successor,
especially too, when to be unjust to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> was to be so unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
since to have declin'd her rule, was to have declin'd the rule of
Virtue. But though <hi>Tygranes</hi> dy'd not like a <hi>Prince,</hi> yet he was interr'd
like one, and no sooner were the solemnities finish'd of that Funeral, than
I fell into so violent a sickness, that <hi>Ventidius,</hi> who never was from my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
believ'd my own would be the next to be celebrated; neither for
above half a Moon, could he find any cause to retract that opinion; but
asson as my amendment began to dissipate his fears, I assum'd them for
him, and indeed, to the best of my memory, I never observ'd so strange
an alteration in so short a time; For that quickness in his look, which
was admir'd, where ever it was seen, now was as much for the change, his
Eyes were dull, and languishing, his humour was resembling them, his
discourses were as void of reason, as formerly they had been replenish'd
with it; in a word, I cannot describe the condition he then was in, than
to the contrary in which I first had the honor to know him; I suspected a
while his care and continual watching, had created the alteration, and in
that faith I apprehended the clearing of my doubts: but lest I might by
ignoring the occasion of his disorder, not offer him my assistance to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, I cast out some oblique words, which might acquaint him with
my desires, but he was so far from esteming them a Rise to disclose his
pain, that he continu'd in a perfect silence, from all things but sighs.
This proceeding induc'd me to believe his sufferings were for me, because
he appear'd so unwilling to discover them to me; I therefore told him, I
was apprehensive his care of, had created mine for him. Yes <hi>Artavasdes</hi>
(he reply'd, with a languishing accent) my care of you makes me take
none of my self, nor deserve it, and then with Eyes big with Tears, he left
me; but my admiration at it, did not for three days, during which time he
never gave me the favour of a visit. So strange a proceeding had cast me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a relapse, but that I esteem'd my health necessary to find <hi>Ventidius</hi> out,
and learn what the avoiding me, and my sickness, gave me no hopes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to expect. But the evening of the fourth day, as I lay slumb'ring on
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96335:156"/>
my Bed, <hi>Ventidius</hi> came into my Chamber, so softly, that I heard him not,
and had not some groans, whose violence he could not suppress, given me
notice of his being there, I had, by not knowing his torment, longer
continu'd it; he seated himself by a Table, on which he lean'd both
his Elbows, and his Cheeks upon his Hands, his Eyes were fixt upon
some object I could not discover, though I could all things else he did,
by gently opening of the Curtain. I had not been long in expectation,
but mine was rewarded by <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s saying with a low voice, Oh gods!
is it possible that a Liberty and a Friendship, I have hitherto preserv'd, and
glory'd in, should be destroy'd, by that which, perhaps, is only an effect of
Art; and not of Nature, and which (may be) has an existence only in
the sight? but (he continu'd, after a short silence) thy fate is not singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
thou hast heard of a <hi>Pigmalion</hi> and a <hi>Narcissus;</hi> the follies of which
were not as great, as of those that condemn'd them; for Beauty is only that
which passes the eies, and the madness is not as high to adore a moveless red
and white, adorn'd with perfect Symetry of Parts, and though dead, has a
lively Air, and Vivacity, as to have a passion for an Inhabitant of a Clime,
where the Suns brightness engender'd their obscurity, and makes a constant
night dwell upon their Faces; were there set rules for Beauty, the World
would have but one Mistriss, and their Fancies are more extravagant that
dote upon a Face, they seldom see, and never but arm'd with Frowns,
where (were I one of their Votaries) that which demonstrates their
cruelty, should render it more than mine, who can enjoy my Mistriss's Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without fearing my presumption should cloud it: where I can breathe
my passion without apprehending any punishment; and if silence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
without suspecting a denial; I fear nor Age nor Sickness to impair
the object of my Flame: I can excuse my Love by all ways demonstrating
the Creator of it, when others in a few years, must be oblig'd to our Faiths,
to believe they were not as blind as the Boy they worship'd; and their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
consists in, (what I should esteem a torment) the remembrance of
what they have been, whereas mine consist in the possession of what it is;
Their Summer must admit of an Autumn, mine is a Spring that is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and though indeed it bears nothing but leaves, yet those do never fall,
and for all those advantages, I am depriv'd of nothing but fruition, which
some have determin'd, and found rather a cure, than a reward of Love.
This I have to say, if it be only a Picture, but oh gods! what can I, if it
be a Copy? (as certainly it is for Nature surpas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es Art) and 'tis a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
miracle that Man should fancy such a perfection, than that the gods
should create it. But alas, (<hi>Ventidius</hi> continu'd, folding his Arms, and
hanging down his Head) 'twere more for thy felicity that this were a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
than a reality, for thou mightst with greater confidence and hope, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a resignation from <hi>Artavasdes</hi> of the former, than if it were the latter;
and be better satisfy'd with the possession of a less happiness, by the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of thy Friend, than the greatest, by the crime of becoming his Rival.
I could (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) have longer listen'd to his rational extravagancies,
had I not esteem'd it a Sin to build my diversion upon my Friend's suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but as I was about to silence them, I heard him say, what <hi>Ventidius?</hi> is
Love then really capable of that mistery which Lovers ascribe unto it? the
changing of Hearts? and hast thou already so effemitate a one, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
with tremblings, to disclose thy condition to thy Friend? If he
be not virtuous enough to excuse thy Sin; be thou to punish it? and by
the gallantry of thy performance, make him acknowledge, that to have
continu'd his Rival, had been a less injury than so to have remov'd him.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96335:156"/>
Then rising up, I perceiv'd in his Hand, an enamell'd Box, cover'd with
Diamonds, which soon made me know, 'twas <hi>Vdosia</hi>'s Picture, which had
created this violent conflict. I made a little noise, to let him know I was
awake, which he no sooner heard, than he came to my Bed-side, where
kneeling down, he open'd the case in a perfect Agony, and ask'd me, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes,</hi>
do you love this Picture? Yes (I reply'd) but the Original
much better. Oh gods (said he) then you cannot any longer love <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius.</hi>
You are mistaken (I reply'd) and to evince that Truth, I give
you my permission to love it too; Alas (he reply'd) you may do that
without fear, when you continue my Rival, for she must have as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility
as beauty, should she, for the unfortunate <hi>Ventidius,</hi> decline the
happy <hi>Artavasdes.</hi> I know (said I, smiling) nothing of her, but what you
see, and that her name is <hi>Udosia,</hi> Great gods! (said <hi>Ventidius,</hi> starting up)
how came you then by her Picture? and are you then the courted Party?
No (I reply'd) I am confident, of all the world she would not have <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
for her Husband, and yet I believe there is few she loves better.
My reason (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) is as much lost in those words, as my liberty
to the subject of them. I hope (I reply'd) I have given you so much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as not to suspect me your Rival: If I have not already, I protest
by your inviolable friendship, of all the Women in the world, I would not
make <hi>Udozia</hi> my Wise, and much less endeavour, or hope to enjoy her,
by an illegitimate way. You confound me (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) as much as
she does, and if you delighted not to torment your Friend, you would not
so long continue my suspension. I will finish it (said I, embracing him)
with an assurance, that if you can like the Original as well as the Copy, she
shall be <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s; as an earnest of which truth, I acquaint you she is my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
He that could describe the generous <hi>Romans</hi> extasies and joyes, must
have resented them; for I that saw them cannot, but when they were enough
diminish'd, to continue our discourses, I told him, he had said so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
things of a Passion for a Picture, that I conjur'd him to accept of
<hi>Udozia</hi>'s, that when time had ruin'd her Beauty, he might preserve some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to extenuate his extravagancy. <hi>Ventidius</hi> a thousand times kist the
Present, and as many times embrac'd me for the bestowing it; I then told
him, 'twas not amiss to let <hi>Annexander</hi> know of his designe, whilst he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
in <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might be the more certain of <hi>Udozia</hi>'s Passion,
which he could not doubt, when it would be both an effect of her judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and her Duty. No (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) I will ask her more handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than so, for I will at the head of 50000 <hi>Romans,</hi> come and implore her
in <hi>Armenia,</hi> she shall see under my Ensignes, Forces that will give her by
their Virtue, those Kingdoms hers do merit, and which my birth deny'd
me; for I will not presume to declare my self her Servant, till I can wear
Crowns of Laurel, and present her with those of Empire. Yes, generous
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> I now repent my self I declin'd that Army (afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on <hi>Crassus</hi>) but now I have the ambition to Command, I shall not
long be without one; I will make Glory my Advocate as well as you, and
'tis fit I should be miserable, did I expect any other way to felicity. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
my narration; after I had assur'd <hi>Ventidius,</hi> I would so fill <hi>Udozia</hi>'s
Breast with the Character of his Virtue, that she should be as much taken
with his Fame, as he was with her Picture, and that he did injure her to
talk of Kingdoms, after she was <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s, he retir'd himself in such rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of joy, that in few days, he return'd to his former health. But alas!
I was no sooner to mine, than the gods cast me into a relapse, whose cause
was worse than the disease: 'Twas the death of <hi>Annexander,</hi> to which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96335:157"/>
I paid so many Tears, that I thought (though falsly) their storc
had been exhausted; never did any death more convince me, there was
another Life than his; for had not he been satisfy'd of that truth, he could
not have yielded himself up to eternal Ashes, with so absolute a resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Great Gods! (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) why did you not then acquaint
me how miserable I was, that I might have left the World when <hi>Annexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
did? and have had so sure a way to eternal Felicity, as the following
of him, and that in the effects of my Duty, I might have found those
of your Mercy: But alas, you had destin d me to be as unparallel'd in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
as in Love: and thereby (I hope) instructed me, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in another world, since my constancy is deny'd one in this. [These
passionate words, both <hi>Artabanes</hi> and <hi>Callimachus</hi> sympathiz'd in, which
made <hi>Artavasdes</hi> the sooner finish them, which he did by thus resuming
his discourse, after he had begg'd their pardon for having interrupted.] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Annexander</hi>'s Funeral, by passionate perswasions of one of his most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
Servants, I caus'd his Body to be open'd, wherein (alas) I too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
found, he was sent to the gods by the wickedness of Men, which
being not discover'd (during his life) made me not wonder that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
had once expell'd the Physitians out of <hi>Rome,</hi> for in this experiment,
I found, 'twas their ignorance, and not their profession which was banisht;
but this sad misfortune and discovery, with my impossibility of disclosing
the poysoner, cast me into a violent Feaver, wherein, though those we
adore, were not so merciful as to end my Miseries and my Life, yet they
were so just as to discover, who wickedly would have been so charitable:
for I had retain'd all my Fathers Domesticks, and being prescrib'd after my
Physick, the drinking of some Broth, as it stood warming by the fire, one
of those little Dogs which are so common, and so much cherisht in <hi>Rome,</hi>
came and lapp'd it all up, but no sooner had he been my Taster, than he
began to reel, then to swell, and at last fell dead by the Bed-side. This
happen'd whilst <hi>Ventidius</hi> was present, who remembring how <hi>Annexander</hi>
dy'd, enquir'd of <hi>Philanax,</hi> who had made the Broth, and having learnt
it was one of my Fathers Cooks, he immediately went down, seiz'd upon him,
and presented his naked Ponyard to his Brest, in the apprehension of
death, he discover'd that which made him desire, and think it a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but as he was ready to expire, observing <hi>Ventidius</hi> and <hi>Philanax</hi> were
spectators of his execution, he begg'd, and obtain'd leave to speak with
them privately, where he told them, that to dis-burthen his Conscience of
a load, which might sink it into eternal darkness, he acknowledge'd that
'twas he by a lingring poyson, had murther'd <hi>Annexander,</hi> and that he had
been hir'd to that sin by <hi>Crassolis.</hi> This intelligence, (after Justice had past
on the Criminal) the only knowers of it told me, I kept it private, lest the
Traytor, by the knowledge of the discovery, might avoid the punishment
of it. But though I had in one Moon, cast off my sickness, yet I did not
recover my health, and was told, should not till I chang'd the Air. <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius</hi>
immediately offer'd me a magnificent Palace of his, which stood
by the Sea side, within the Gulph of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> whither I went, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
took leave of the generous <hi>Artabanes,</hi> who I could not perswade to
remove thither, till his wounds were perfectly cur'd, and unto whom I
promis'd to return, that I might enjoy the felicity of his company, as far
as <hi>Armenia,</hi> but I never had the blessing to see him since, till by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
I not only receiv'd my Life, but the relish of it too. Some ten days
after my arrival at <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s, by that excellent Air, I recover'd strength
enough to walk abroad, and as we were diverting our selves by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96335:157"/>
we saw a Gally cast Anchor in the Road, and mann out a Boat to land
her Passengers, where, to my admiration, I found one of them was the
gallant <hi>Falintus,</hi> who at first seeing me, put on a joyful Look, which his
Face was so little accustom'd to, that I observ'd, it was soon expell'd, as
an intruder. But oh gods! why do I protract the disclosing my miseries,
since I complain their having given me no more, is a misfortune, because
formerly they have given me so many? Yes (<hi>Artabanes</hi>) 'twas <hi>Falintus</hi>
told me, that <hi>Artabazus</hi> had displac'd <hi>Phanasder</hi> as soon as I was gone: that
by discontenting so gallant a Man, he had lost the Hearts of all those which
bore that Title: That he had lost a great Battel to <hi>Arsaces</hi> and <hi>Pacorus:</hi>
his Army being led by one of <hi>Crassolis</hi>'s creatures, who the common
Soliers had sacrific'd to their Fury (to rob the <hi>Parthians</hi> of the Glory of
an entire victory, by acting of a part of it themselves:) That <hi>Artabazus, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desia,</hi>
and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> had been shut up in <hi>Thospia:</hi> and (oh gods! that I
live to tell it!) that the last,</p>
                  <p>Here the miserable <hi>Artavasdes</hi> had not fortitude enough to resist the
remembrance of his loss, but abandon'd himself to effeminacies, which
made both <hi>Artabanes</hi> and <hi>Callimachus</hi> more pity, than condemn them.</p>
                  <p>The generous <hi>Armenian</hi> was above half an hour, e'r he could dry up
his Tears, or silence his sighs, but as soon as he had gotten the victory of
those Passions, which had so lately gotten it of him, he made use of it to
continue his Story, which he thus did, with the sorrow and attention of
the Hearers.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Endeavour'd to tell you (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) in Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the effects of <hi>Falintus</hi>'s intelligence, because I
thought the remembrance of those miseries, would
have deny'd me the possibility of their full relation;
but now I find, that those gods which gave me the
fortitude to bear my affictions, will give me too,
that of repeating them. I will deduce the Story from
its Original, not only because I esteem the strange
changes, and intricacies, it is replenish'd with, worthy your attention, but
that by the knowledge of my sufferings, I may be oblig'd to your reason
as much as goodness, to pardon those esseminacies, which I believe (only,
and then absolutely) excusable, when you learn their cause. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
I told you that I met the generous <hi>Falintus</hi> at his Landing, as
<hi>Ventidius</hi> and I was diverting our selves upon a pleasant Strand, not far from
his Palace; where <hi>Falintus</hi> desir'd me to retire, since his intelligence was
of a length, which by continuing where I was, might impair a health he
found by my looks was but newly restor'd; I obey'd this request, and
we were no sooner return'd, than locking our selves up in my Cabinet,
<hi>Falintus</hi> addressing his discourse to me, began it in these words.</p>
               <p>As soon as you were so far from <hi>Armenia,</hi> as <hi>Crassolis</hi> was confident you
could not receive intelligence time enough to repent his practices; the first
he disclos'd, was, the annihilating the gallant <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s Commission,
and the conferring it on a Creature of his own, both which he effected by
the unlimited power he has over his King, and though <hi>Altezeera</hi> and <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
too, were unsatisfy'd with it, yet the latter had been more to have
declin'd his Favourites Council; but no sooner was <hi>Phanasder</hi> retir'd to
his Government, than <hi>Pacorus,</hi> with all the Gallantry of <hi>Parthia</hi> (which
by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s precipitate return to <hi>Rome,</hi> was safely united in one Body)
presented himself on the Banks of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> absolutely determind'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat,
or repair his disgrace; some were of opinion, that <hi>Phanasders</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing,
gave him the invitation to invade us; others thought he began
the War upon intelligence of <hi>Annexander</hi>'s Treaty at <hi>Rome,</hi> with hopes
to determine it before <hi>Crassus</hi> could come either to divert him, or assist us;
whether the causes were great I know not, but I am sure the success was, for
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Army, consisting of those who sought for Pay, and not for
Glory (all of the latter quality, having flung up their Commission with
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96335:158"/>
                  <hi>Phanasder</hi>) and the General being one, whose suddain elevation had asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
him, the <hi>Armenians</hi> in the first Battel, were render'd uncapable of
a second, for they left above 40000 on the place, but that which diminish'd
the loss, was the addition of one unto it, their General. This Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too infamous to be insisted on, I will pass it over, to tell you the effects
it produc'd: one of the first, was the invironing of <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> (near
which it was won) next morning with an Army of 30000 Horse; where
the King (with the Princess in his company) had remov'd, the better to
act upon any emergency; But <hi>Artabazus</hi> found himself no sooner besieg'd,
than he repented (but would not repair) his injury to <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to yours, which was violated in his. As soon as the news was
divulg'd in <hi>Parthia,</hi> that <hi>Artabazus</hi> was besieg'd, with as little hope of
relief as resistance; <hi>Arsaces</hi> came in person to <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> where he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protested, he would be reveng'd for the Bloud of his Subjects
at <hi>Offala,</hi> and for <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s having hir'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to his destruction.
The gallant <hi>Phanasder,</hi> at the intelligence of the Kings misfortune, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
his injury to remember his duty: neither were the tyes of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Love, less invitations, to his performances, the first of those
were on your score to the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and the latter on his own,
to the Princess <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> to whom <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> not only belong'd, but
was then the place of her residence; and who indeed was blest with such
charms, both of the Body and Mind, that <hi>Phanasder</hi> was as unable as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to resist them. But why do I so much abuse the fair <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> and
my self, as to endeavour to give you a description of a person, that is
above any? and who, if I be not much mistaken, you did assiduously vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
in your Friends favour, a little before you left <hi>Armenia.</hi> I must confess,
(I reply d) that as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oon as <hi>Phanasder</hi> had acquainted me with his Passion,
I acquainted <hi>Theoxcena</hi> with it, and with the merit of her Servants; of
which she was so absolutely convinc'd, that upon that score, she not only
pardon'd, but receiv'd his Flame, and being at his own disposal, she thought
no argument could more evince how much she merited that liberty, than
to give her self to <hi>Phanasder,</hi> without those nice formalities, authoriz'd
rather from Custom than Reason; and besides, she esteem'd it both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to her own election, and her Servants Virtues, only to be satisfy'd of
their greatness, by time. This generous declaration, my concern in my
Friend, and his impatience, made me the more sollicitous before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
to bring this affair to a conclusion, which might be uncapable
of change. I believe (said <hi>Falintus</hi>) you have so well effected that design,
that if all her Sex were as constant as <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> I had been exempted
from an employment, which I detest, though in it you may find, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
nothing for your Service, since I do it not, when 'tis to your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But whilst <hi>Phanasder</hi> was levying of Forces to hinder, or at least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the loss of <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> he receiv'd an advertisement from thence,
that his Kings Fear or Weakness, had made him already offer to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with <hi>Arsaces,</hi> upon tearms so low, that an absolute ruine had been
a fitter election, who yet return'd him word, That he fought not for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but Revenge and Empire, and therefore the destruction, and not the
submission of his Enemies, should be the evincement of his success; This
answer made <hi>Phanasder</hi> conclude, that either <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s cruelty, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
was great, and to hinder both, (finding that to raise an Army, would
be a work of time, and consequently of danger,) with 3000 select Horse, he
advanc'd towards <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> and at noon-day passing over the Bellies
of as many <hi>Parthians,</hi> with the loss of 300, enter'd the Town, and so much
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96335:159"/>
reviv'd the Besieged's hopes, and the Kings goodness, that the former cast
away their fears, and the latter his ingratitude, There <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Servant, was more full of satisfaction to him, than the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;
but that all our enemies might know, as well as hear of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
<hi>Phanasder</hi> and I, (for I had the honor to be with him, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a third part of his Forces) made such brisk and successful Sallies, that
though the number of the Fighters hindred them from the name of Battels,
yet the number of the Dead would have made them thought so; which
so transported <hi>Arsaces,</hi> that he solemnly protested, <hi>Tyranocerta</hi> should be
either his Tomb, or <hi>Artabazus's,</hi> and it may be we had made him keep the
first part of his Vow, had not the Divine Sword destroy'd more Lives,
than the <hi>Parthian;</hi> for not long after our flinging our selves into <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocerta,</hi>
there fell into it from Heaven (if such a Curse can come from
thence) a Mortality of so strange nature, that nothing hardly could prove
a preservative for the Sound, or a cure for the Infected; so that to be Sick,
and to be Dead, were the same; This strange contagion so suddainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
our Forces, that <hi>Phanasder</hi> himself consented to capitulate, but
our Enemies knew too well our conditions, to grant us any; so that many
began to think that Plague no misfortune. But <hi>Phanasder</hi> to make <hi>Arsaces</hi>
believe, both his intelligence, and his hopes were false, placing the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on the Walls, with all the Men, and Gallantry of the Garrison, he
made so furious a Sally, that above 4000 <hi>Parthians</hi> were sent into the
other World, to lament their Kings being inexorable in this: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we had carry'd our success, to the heighth of making him as much
need our humanity, as we did his, had not the Prince <hi>Pacorus</hi> (passing
with all his Army over a Bridge of Boats on the River <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> which
separated the City and the two Camps) come, not only to his Fathers
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ief, but rescue; for <hi>Phanasder</hi> had taken <hi>Arsaces</hi> with his own hand:
but as he was retreating with the Father, the Son fell with all his fresh
Troops on ours (which were tir'd and shatter'd) and forc'd, not onely the
King, but the Victory from us; though <hi>Phanasder</hi> not to lose his Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
did almost his Life, for he receiv'd some such unhappy wounds, that
making the retreat with our Swords, just as he was enter'd the Gates, he
totter'd upon his Horse, and had doubtless fall'n, but that I caught him in
my Arms, till further help came to carry him to his Bed, whither he was
no sooner brought, than my wounds, as dangerous as his, sunk me down
into a swound by him. And though his Action was great, yet because his
success was not, he fell into so deep a melancholly and despair, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s safety (which she protested was involv'd in his,)
could induce him to permit the Chirurgeons, to search and dress his wounds.
<hi>Arsaces</hi> on the other side, assum'd a rage as great, as the danger he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
been in, and by reiterated vows, left himself as little power, as will to
be merciful. <hi>Pacorus</hi> having receiv'd the Elogy due to his Sucess and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
return'd to his own Camp, from whence that day he had not mov'd,
but that those which were to give him a false Alarm, did it so unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that their intention was both discover'd, and punish'd; but though
their loss in the <hi>Parthian</hi> Armies were great; yet their joyes were so too,
for they consider'd our last attempt, as if it were to have been so; neither
indeed were they false Prophets in that conjecture, for the Soldiers by losing
<hi>Phanasder,</hi> not only lost their Leader, but their Inspirer; and before his
wounds permitted him the power of revenging them, or increasing their
number, those of the Garrison were so diminish'd, that he could hardly
command, or obey any but himself. In this extremity, when we expected a
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96335:159"/>
general ruine, we found a general safety. The gods be prais'd, (I cry'd
out, interrupting him, (for though I were not present, yet I was a suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Danger.) Ah (Sir, said <hi>Falintus</hi>) you are too prodigal of your
Gratitude, for when you are instructed in the cause of our preservation,
I fear it will involve you in greater troubles, than we were freed from;
but not to anticipate your griefs, I will tell you my Story in order. The
same day in which <hi>Phanasder</hi> purchas'd so much Glory, and so little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
amongst many of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> which then receiv'd their Fate,
<hi>Crassolis</hi>'s only Son was pierc'd with so many wounds, that though we made
our retreat with so flow a pace, that we might have fetcht off any of our
wounded, yet that young Gentleman was so mortally, that none of his
Friends, esteem'd him worthy the carrying home, or declin'd the doing
it, out of an apprehension of reviving his Fathers affliction, by so sad an
object. This unfortunate Youth fell to the share of one of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
whose Servants having stripp'd him of his Apparel, found about his
Neck, a Box, all sett with Diamonds, which contain'd within it the Picture
of a Beauty, more bright than those Stones that cover'd it; This Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
they presented to their Lord, and he esteeming it one, did the like
to his Prince, who no sooner saw the Picture, but he became as moveless
as it, and continu'd in that extasie till he broke it, to learn who 'twas it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
but therein he found all about him, as ignorant as himself, and
suspecting, their silence proceeded from their knowledge, not their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he told his Favourite; 'Tis in vain <hi>Labienus,</hi> 'tis in vain, now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
who it is has wounded me, for were her extraction as far below my
Bloud, as her Beauty is above my adoration: were she an Enemy as well
to my Nature, as my Flame; nor these, nor as many obstacles as she has
charms shall deterr me from my Passion, whose greatness none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
without declaring himself as much an enemy to Reason, as to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerus;</hi>
do not therefore add so much to the affliction of my Love, as to
conceal who has inspir'd it, for though I should never learn who is my
Conqueror, yet I must always give her that Name, and cary the effects of
her power, though I should never behold the Possessor of it. All that
heard these extravagancies, were perfectly ignorant of her name, which
created them, but one of those who had shar'd in the rifling of <hi>Crassolis</hi>'s
Son, after his Companions were gone, found some weak symptomes of life
in him, and either out of Charity or Avarice, endeavour'd to preserve
what he thought was not absolutely hopeless; towards which he had
caus'd his Prisoner and Patient, to be transported into his Tent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by profession a Chirurgion, had so well practis'd his Art, that young
<hi>Crassolis</hi> began to open his Eyes, and at last to recover his Senses; but the
first thing he did when they were restor'd, was to search for his Picture,
which he no sooner mist, than he began to tear his wounds, to open a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
for a Soul, which detested its dwelling after (and seem'd to sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize
in) so sensible a loss. This strange extravagancy, made the only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it enquire the cause, which he had no sooner learnt, than he told
him, how the richness of the Case, had perhaps, made him lose what it
contain'd, but if he would be contented with the Picture, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the restitution. Alas (said the young <hi>Crassolis</hi>) the Picture is all
I desire, and to invite you to restore it, I do faithfully engage my self to
give you as many Diamonds as can be pil'd upon it. This large reward made
him to whom it was offer'd, flye to his Companion to acquaint him with
it, who he found about <hi>Pacorus,</hi> when he was in the torment of so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
an ignorance, which the Chirurgion perceiving, and deploring, punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
acquainted him with all he knew, which immediately when the Prince
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96335:160"/>
had learnt, bidding his Treasurer give him higher rewards, than the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
could Master of, he commanded him to conduct him to his dying Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
whither they were no sooner come, than the wounded Gentleman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftily
ask'd for the satisfaction of his hopes, but <hi>Pacorus</hi> permitted not his
Guide to reply, and enjoyn'd all which were present to retire, and then
presenting himself with much civility to the Picture, begg'd him to tell
him if he knew whose it was? oh gods (said the young <hi>Crassolis</hi>) 'tis mine?
and were but my Health as good as my Title, who ever you are, you
should lose it, or I would my life. Truly (said <hi>Pacorus</hi>) I place as high a
value on this excellent Copy, as you are capable to do, and would not be
depriv'd of it at a lower price, but that you may know I esteem, and do
not hate my Rivals (for then I should all Men) I will inform you my
name is <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and that I have both Force and Authority to punish your
threatenings, did not I excuse them upon the same account, which I hope
you will, my detention of both our Conquerors. Ah Sir (said the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
if you deprive me of my Picture and not of my Life, you are as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
in the latter, as in the former, and will be as severe in your Mercy, as in
your Injustice; for you must permit me so to call your making that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
your Prisoner. Alas 'tis I (said <hi>Pacorus</hi>) that am hers. If you were,
(reply'd the other) you would not be her Besieger. Oh gods, said the
Prince, somewhat surpriz'd) is she then within <hi>Tygranocerta?</hi> and have
they made me so miserable a creature, as to endeavour to destroy what I
should, and do adore? No (continu'd <hi>Pacorus,</hi> lifting up his Eyes and
Hands) I invoke the higher powers to manifest theirs in my confusion,
if the fair object of my flame be within those Walls, if ever I shed any bloud
near them, but for their defence. Great gods! (the Prisoner cry'd out)
could I believe this Profession, how happy were my ruine; and how full
of satisfaction my death, if it might contribute to the preservation of a
Beauty, whose perfections and cruelty, cannot transcend my Passion? Yes,
said the Prince,) falling upon his knees) I do here repeat my former prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
and implore the gods to fill this Excellency, as full of Ice, as she has
me with Fire, and to make me hated as much as I do love, if I do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Father as an Enemy, if he continues hers, and leave him no way
to act his revenge, but through his Son. I believe you (Sir) I believe you,
(said the wounded Gentleman, kissing <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Hands for joy) since to
doubt so strange a change, were to doubt her power that causes it, who
has evinc'd upon me in particular, that it is as much above being limited,
as resisted; for she has inspir'd me with a Passion without hope, the greatest
miracle but that which created it. I know (said the impatient <hi>Pacorus,</hi>
interrupting him) what her Beauty is, more by the effects, than I can by
the description. I will tell you, (the other reply'd) that the goddess of it,
is the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and though I look upon her as my future Queen,
yet I find she has a greater Soveraignty over me by her Eyes, than her
Birth, and I resent more despair from the greatness of her perfections, than
from that of her quality. This confession, nothing but a certainty of death
could have disclos'd, and if I should have been so miserable, as to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in my conjecture, I am certain I shall not be in my resolution, which
will prove constant enough to punish the discovery of a secret, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the tortures of a fruitless Love, nor Flames as great as my presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has, or could extort from me. Yes (Sir) I will tell you my short
and unfortunate Story, I saw the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and consequently
ador'd her, but with a Silence as great as my Passion; the heighth of my
aspiring was to languish, and consume in that devotion, and because I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
my Eyes might discover my Heart, or my Actions, what I knew
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96335:160"/>
my words should not, having some skill in Limning, by a thousand stolen
opportunities, and by an <hi>Idea</hi> which was always present, I drew this Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
whose Eyes being disarm'd of their light, by these faint Colours,
omitted me to contemplate without dazling, what I could not in the
Divine Original. This is my highest crime, and so much I adore what I
love, that I shall esteem her the highest Mercy if she pardons it; But (Sir)
if ever the gods so bless your Flame, as to make the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> the
reward of it, and that your discourses lead you to remember the occasion
which made you first a Lover, do not mention my unfortunate fire, with
that scorn the ambition of it merits, but with some resentment of that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
death I have embrac'd, out of a sence of my presumption; Let
the remembrance too, of that safety it will give her, and of that blessing
it will for you be instrumental in, extinguish a Fault, for which I extinguish
my Life, and though I am your Rival, yet the way in which I am so, being
a sufficient punishment for having been so. The poor Gentleman was able
to proceed no further, for either the enlarging his wounds upon the loss
of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Picture; the despair of repossessing it; the apprehension of
out-living the discovery of his Passion; or the joy of his Death being like
to prove the preservation of his Princesses Life; cast him into a swound,
from which, all <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s help, nor the Chirurgeons, could recall him any
longer, than to beg the Prince not to fight against his Conqueror; which
he had no sooner said, than an eternal silence clos'd up his Lips. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
was so generous as to celebrate his death with some Tears and Sighs,
excusing his crime by the knowledge of what created it, which by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
he found, was of a quality, that to avoid was far more difficult, than
to imitate; but the last summons of his dead Rival made him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
go into his Fathers Camp, where finding him busy about his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and all the assistants withdrawing themselves out of respect, he
told <hi>Arsaces,</hi> after some other common discourses; Would it had pleas'd
the gods (Sir) to have given you an employment, more suitable to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and quality, than this you are now upon; for you only labour
for that which is already effected, and cannot be more successful than you
are, without rendring your self less worthy of it; Your Sword (Sir) has
made <hi>Artabazus</hi> confess he is vanquish'd, let not therefore his ruine do it;
If he makes any resistance, 'tis you give him that power, and by giving
him despair, you give him resolution: you have conquer'd him already
by force, do it again by humanity, make a King your friend, by declining
making him your Vassal: to conquer your self is a greater victory than to
conquer one you have already conquer'd; and the <hi>Romans</hi> hereby will
apprehend a power, that has vanquish'd both <hi>Arsaces,</hi> and <hi>Artabazus,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I will not (said <hi>Falintus</hi>) tell you all <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s reasons, since they
appear'd none to his Father, who esteem'd the best advantage of a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
was, to win, and not to merit a Kingdom; and indeed that violent
Prince was so far from pardoning his Enemies, that he almost reckon'd <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
in their number, for making so merciful a Proposal. In the horrors of
this denial he return'd to his Tent, where after he had spent an hour in
the highest disorders that ever man was capable of, on a suddain his Face
assumed a joy, which <hi>Labienus</hi> (who only was present) knew not unto
what to ascribe it; but it sprung from a cause, which rais'd Gallantry to a
height, it never knew before; and if <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s constancy could have been
capable of excuse, this performance had been a sufficient one for her
new Lover, finding <hi>Arsaces</hi> unremovable, by his having given him a flat
refusal of what he even begg'd with Tears, which till then he never had;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96335:161"/>
That generous Prince, the night before a general Assault was to be given,
the breach being wide enough, and wanting hands to defend it, (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
only by <hi>Labienus</hi> his Confident) as if he went to view it, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Tygranocerta</hi> by it, and having deliver'd himself up to the Guards, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
them to bring him to the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> to whom he said, he had
some affairs of singular importance to impart; The Captain which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Post, immediately brought him to the Palace, where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
(who then was with her Brother at their Devotions, expecting ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to see another night, but an eternal one) being inform'd that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of quality (which both his Meen and Cloaths spoke him) was stol'n
from the Camp, to give her an intelligence, came into a great Hall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, but as soon as she appear'd, the poor <hi>Pacorus</hi> found how short
Art had been of Nature, and that if he had had cause to love the Picture,
he had more to adore and admire the original; though some few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
either an indisposition, or some other Melancholly, had cast her into
a Feaver, which but then she had got out of; but there is a Beauty in Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
as well as in Roses, and that little paleness did but better set off the
blackness of her Eyes, which shot so piercing, and bright a Flame into the
trembling <hi>Parthians</hi> heart, that his silence, and disorder gave the fair <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera</hi>
as great an astonishment, as her Beauty had him. But his being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dissipated, he esteem'd the making an Apology, for that fault was a
greater than he had committed, since his offence was of a quality which
carried its justification with it; therefore with as much Grace as Humility,
he only told <hi>Altezeera,</hi> Madam, He which has employ'd a part of his life
against you, presents unto you all of it, and will esteem your Pardon a
Cruelty, if you preserve his, but to employ it perpetually in your service:
Yes Madam, you have now in your power, the criminal <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
your Brother's Arms, but he neither had the power, nor the desire
to resist yours, to which he renders his mind as much a Prisoner, as his
Body: Judge then (fair Princess) of the authority of my Conqueror,
who extends her power over that which is immaterial, and has no exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but in speculation; Punish (Madam) <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s cruelty in <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s
Son, or if what I have done, induces you to believe, though I am ally'd
to him, yet I am not to his crimes; shew it, I beseech you, by commanding
me to oppose it at the breach, that if he enter, it may be through me,
and so necessitate him to a Victory, he must celebrate in Tears, as well
as Bloud; My life which has been so often employ'd against you, cannot
expiate that sin, but by being sacrific'd for you; however, you have now
wherewithal to make (or rather to impose) your conditions on <hi>Orodes,</hi>
who perhaps, had rather lose <hi>Armenia,</hi> than <hi>Pacorus.</hi> Oh gods! (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
<hi>Falintus</hi>) is it possible to tell you the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s wonder and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
all the while the Prince of <hi>Parthia</hi> was speaking? No no, it is not,
for were it describable, it would be less than it was, but left he might from
some strange belief of her perplexities and silence, she told him. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(Sir) you ascribe your coming hither unto, I must not to your submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but to your power, which is more evinc'd by entring this City alone
than with an Army, or else perhaps, 'tis to increase the Ardor of yours
by joyning the liberty of their Prince, to the winning of <hi>Tygranocerta.</hi> Ah
Madam (said <hi>Pacorus</hi>) I have so lost my liberty, that it lies as little in my
Armies Power, as in my own Will to recover it, and if I have flung my self
within these Walls, 'twas rather to deterr the <hi>Parthians</hi> from entring them,
than to incite them to it; you raign too absolutely in my heart, not to know
this Truth, and if you desire I shall dye fighting against <hi>Arsaces,</hi> 'tis rather
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96335:161"/>
to satisfy your revenge, than you doubts; but if I am so unfortunate, as
not to fall in your defence, you have still wherewith to act your revenge;
Your Beauty gives you as much the power, as my past crimes gives you
the justice. Since (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) you will have me believe you are come
to preserve those you have hitherto endeavour'd to destroy, I will do it;
but it proceeds more from my obedience, than my Reason, though I must
acknowledge, I have had so high a Character of the Prince <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
that I should have thought him capable of all, but this which he
has now acted, and which is of a Nature, that to suspect, 'tis too great to
be true, is to oblige it when it proves so. Madam, (the Prince reply'd) if
you suspect my Professions, but to invite me to evince their reallities by
my actions, you will as much oblige me upon that score, as injure me, if
your doubts proceed from any other. Whilst the Princess and <hi>Pacorus</hi>
were thus discoursing, <hi>Labienus</hi> was brought to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> to whom he
told his Princes Story, and how by giving him <hi>Altezeera,</hi> he had not only
wherewith to save his Crown for the present, but to secure it in the future.
The King, at so unpresidented an accident, was cast into admirations, as
great as his fears, but having reflected a while, both on the Virtue of <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
performance, and on the advantage of his Alliance; he gave <hi>Labienus</hi>
an answer which gave him large hopes; for he was concerned in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
felicity, and by having seen <hi>Altezeera,</hi> he found his Passion was as
commendable, as great; but <hi>Artabazus</hi> esteeming it high time to visit his
voluntary Prisoner, went with <hi>Labienus</hi> to him, and found, his person was
as handsome as his action. There <hi>Pacorus,</hi> by reiterated, and passionate
expressions, implor'd a Pardon for a Crime, which his ignorance made him
commit, and which his knowledge did sufficiently revenge. 'Twas in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of that quality they spent the residue of the night, and the day
no sooner appear'd, than <hi>Arsaces</hi> Army storm'd the breach, and thereby
gave so hot an Allarm, that it came to his Sons hearing, who hastily told
<hi>Altezeera;</hi> That Life (Madam) which has been employ'd against you, shall
now serve to preserve you, or else shall be lost for having been too-active,
and too-impotent, farwell fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> you shall find I will shed my
Bloud for you, with greater confidence than I dare tell you so. Then
saluting the King with much humility, but his Sister with much more, he
put on his Helmet, and follow'd by <hi>Labienus</hi> and some <hi>Armenians,</hi> he ran
where the noise and danger call'd him, which was indeed great, and had
not his Courage and Fortune been so too, we had lost <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> and
he his Life; but though he perform'd things as worthy wonder, as relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet all had been fruitless, had he not by lifting up his Helmet, and
telling his Name, struck such a reverence and damp into the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
that they made a general stand in the way of victory, and suspended their
bloody Arms in the Air; which <hi>Pacorns</hi> observing, though his wounds
were many, and dangerous; yet leaning on his Sword in the mouth of
the breach, he forc'd himself to tell them; These wounds, valiant <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which I have hitherto receiv'd, carry your excuse, in your ignorance,
but those you hereafter give me, must be sins of design, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pierce me deeper, than your Swords; neither can you avoid this crime,
but by retiring to your Camp, for whoever makes his passage into <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocerta,</hi>
must do it thorough his Prince, who commands you by that duty
you owe him, and which he will abundantly reward, to return to <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and to let him know, that by becoming an enemy to the Princess <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera,</hi>
he has made <hi>Pacorus</hi> his; That if he values his Sons safety, he must
demonstrate it by his care of hers; which if by a repeated Assault, he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96335:162"/>
endeavours to endanger, I will draw my Army in for to maintain it, and
esteem the crime of opposing my King, and my Father, a lesser than his,
which necessitates me to it; and if at last I have not force to resist his, I will
not want it to end a Life upon a breach, which it was so unfortunate as
not to defend. Do not believe, (he continu'd) that this Declaration is dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by heat, or passion; no, it proceeds from a just and digested resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and if either <hi>Arsaces,</hi> or you, do doubt the contrary, and that these
wounds do not sufficiently manifest this Truth, I will by so bloudy an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
convince both him, and you of it, that perhaps your griefs shall
be as large as your doubts. These words spoke with grace and vehemency,
and the great respect all the <hi>Parthians</hi> paid <hi>Pacorus,</hi> wrought a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
effect; many were willing to obey his Commands, others which
knew his disposition, apprehended to prosecute a victory, which could
not succeed, without losing more than they could win in it, and some who
thought to have seen their Prince at the head of their Troops, killing the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> were so surpiz'd to find him at the head of his Enemies, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Servants, that their wonder made them obedient, and observing
<hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Army had not storm'd, contrary to their Orders (for I omitted
to tell you, he had given them express commands, not to draw out of their
Camp, whatsoever they heard, till they did so, either from himself or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus</hi>)
they began to suspect there was some intricacy in the business, which
their prosecuting any further, might discover to their ruine, or their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's;
all these inducements, and (as the gods would have it) one <hi>Ryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
(<hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Creature) commanding these Troops, were the causes that
they began by degrees to retire, with several tones of murmurings, which
sufficiently manifested, their retreat proceeded from divers apprehensions.
But the Enemy had no sooner abandon'd the breach, than the Prince, by
the loss of a deluge of Bloud, swounded in <hi>Labienus</hi>'s Arms, who by the
assistance of some Soldiers which had defended it, was carry'd to the Palace,
and lodg'd in a magnificent Appartment, <hi>Artabazus</hi> had provided for him,
and where, by force of Cordials he was restor'd to that life, which but
seemingly had left him. His sences were no sooner return'd, than the
chiefest of them was entertain'd by the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who <hi>Artabazus</hi> had
brought with him to acknowledge, and reward that Gallantry, which
had been so advantageous to them both. After the King had made his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,
he withdrew himself to the other side of the Chamber, to resign
his place to the Princess, who <hi>Pacorus</hi> no sooner saw, than he fell into
tremblings and confusions, which better exprest his acknowledgements,
than his words could; but <hi>Altezeera</hi> esteeming his performances, merited
more than a silent visit, told him; You have, Sir, endanger'd your Life
to preserve your Enemies, and by that demonstration of your Virtue, we
find our safeties purchast at a rate, which makes us esteem them a greater
misfortune, than our ruines could have prov'd. Alas Madam (said <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>)
you more endanger my life, by giving those I have fought for that
name, than those have done which I fought against, and were there any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in my duty, 'tis too abundantly rewarded by your saying there is, and
by a visit, which I would perpetually implore, by repeating greater dangers,
and greater wounds; but alas Madam, can you so soon pardon a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I made, when I thought I should repair it by my death, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now I had acted, did not I find my life would at least contribute as
much to your safety, as the loss of it could to your revenge; but Madam,
I told you a Truth, which was of a quality which told it self, and my
words did acquaint you, but with that, which every perfection about you
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:96335:162"/>
does, so that what I presum'd to mention, was as needless, as presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<hi>Altezeera,</hi> (who extreamly dis-relish'd entertainments of this sort)
reply'd, if my expressions (Sir) have not acquainted you with my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
I believe my suffering of these discourses will, but I give them to
your actions, and condition, and will in the future, acknowledge your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from them, as great a favour, as any you have done, or are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to do unto me. Ah Madam (said <hi>Pacorus,</hi> after a little silence, and
some sighs) why do you inspire me with so much passion, and command
me to conceal it, and why do you take from me the power of obedience,
and yet enjoyn me it; would to the gods you had commanded me to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
my Life, instead of my Words, you should have seen by an instant
experiment, that I prefer nothing before the honor of obeying you, and
in that performance be convinc'd, if I am disobedient to your first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
'tis because I am uncapable, and not unwilling to be otherwise:
Yes fair Princess, 'tis as impossible for me not to tell you that I adore you,
as 'tis not to do it, my Passion would be less, could my obedience be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I can therefore hardly condemn a fault which justifies so glorious a
Truth; but if the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> does, that Arm which has oppos'd her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
shall execute one of them, and forget the interests of his Master, to
satisfy those of his Conqueror. I render (Madam) my intentions as visible
as my Flame, that you may either permit the latter, or punish the former;
were you a Beauty which needed time to evince the reality of my Passion,
or which perseverance and services might give me a Title to, I should use
that dull method; but since your perfections do not only manifest the
former, but suppress all hopes of the latter, I have the first minute of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you, as great a Title to my Felicity, as I can have the last, so that the
object of my Flame being different from all others, the ways of my addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
must be so too; and the refusing me that blessing now, is to assure me
you will eternally do it, since there can never be any thing in me to induce
it; therefore Madam, resolutely pronounce my sentence, for next living
in your Favour, the greatest felicity is, dying by your Commands, which
latter I protest, by the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> I will perform; but yet, Madam,
do not think I will, to pay you one duty, decline another, and deprive
you of my service, whilst it is so blest as to be useful to you; No, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he which adores you shall fall your sacrifice, he will make many others
do so, which fight against you, and will never neglect his own quiet, till he
has establish'd you in yours; for your suppressing my hopes, shall not my
duty, and to serve you for any reward but the Honor of serving you,
were to deserve none. <hi>Altezeera</hi> was extreamly perplex'd at this vow, and
judging of his resolution by the violence in which he utter'd it, she reply'd;
Your wilfulness (Sir) reduces me to strange extremities, either to suffer
your crime, or to suffer by it; but believe me, if I should elect the first, I
must unavoidably the last. Ah Madam (<hi>Pacorus</hi> cry'd out) had the gods
any way but this to make me miserable, whilst you permitted me to adore
you? No fair <hi>Altezeera:</hi> I will dye sooner than live at this rate, and did
not my duty enjoyn me this election, my gratitude would; I will, Madam
no more hope to raise my felicity, since it must be by your sufferings, I
will languish out this sad Life, till it may be no longer useful to you, and
when it cannot serve, it shall not trouble you. <hi>Pacorus</hi> spoke those words
so distinctly, that <hi>Artabazus</hi> ran to his Bed-side to learn their cause; but
the Prince had too-fetl'd thoughts of Death, to disclose any thing which
might prevent it, and <hi>Altezeera</hi> was too much offended and troubl'd, to
discover the occasion of either; but though the King could not learn the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96335:163"/>
reason of this disorder, yet he imagin'd it, and in that Faith drew the
Princess aside, where whilst he was infusing Gratitude, if not Love, into
her, some of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Domesticks came in, who having understood their
Prince's condition, had abandon'd the Camp, to come and pay him their
Duties. 'Twas by them he was inform'd (at the <hi>Parthians</hi> return to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>'s
Camp, and at their telling him the cause of their not taking <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocerta</hi>)
that <hi>Orodes</hi> had assum'd the highest fury that ever Man was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of: that he had call'd him Rebel, Traytor, and all those injuries which
a violent rage is aptest to dictate: that he had protested he was more troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for his Sons crime, than for that victory it hinder'd: that he hated
him as much as he had lov'd him: that he would have sacrific'd all those
which would have obey'd <hi>Pacorus,</hi> had not they vow'd to sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or redeem him from his voluntary restraint: and that the next
night they intended to repeat the Assault. This news more perplex'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus,</hi>
than either <hi>Altezeera</hi> or <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who knowing his Father, was
unresistable in his fury, immediately told <hi>Artabazus;</hi> I know (Sir) <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>
will make use of Force, and therefore I will; he has an Army to ass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ault
you, and I shall not want one to defend you; neither can that Army
which has reduc'd you to this condition, better repair that sin, than to
free you from it; 'tis therefore with your permission I will send <hi>Labienus</hi>
to my Camp, that if <hi>Orodes</hi> does attempt his threatnings, I may have
wherewithal to make them still bear but that name; My Army (Sir) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more gloriously employ'd, than to preserve a pefection as high as the
sin that would destroy it, and from hindring their King from being unjust,
and barbarous; for the Faith of those I shall draw into <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> I will
mine; and that they shall continue within these Walls, but to obey you,
and to defend them. I cannot tell you what operation this gallantry had
with <hi>Artabazus,</hi> who only exprest it by a thousand embraces; but the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Altezeera,</hi> was so mov'd with it, that before she left the Chamber, she
told <hi>Pacorus,</hi> If you do not believe your Life is considerable to me, you do
me as great an injury, as an obligation if you preserve it. Madam (said the
Prince (taking the confidence to kiss her hand, on which he Printed his
burning Lips) I will preserve my Life, till I know my death will be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
duty; Whilst <hi>Labienus</hi> was preparing things in his Princes Camp, which
lay on the West side of the River <hi>Nicephorus, Arsaces</hi> was the next night
preparing to assault <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> yet with intention, that so much of it
should be spent, as the light of day might see his Vicotry; He chose to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the Assault during the obscurity, to avoid the Enemies Darts, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
before they came to the breach, and left the sight of <hi>Pacorus</hi> might
produce a resembling effect to the precedent. At the hour assign'd, the
<hi>Arsacian Parthians</hi> began the storm, and no sooner did the Allarm reach
<hi>Labienus,</hi> than he entred <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> with 10000 of the same Nation, but
of a different Party. The Affailants admir'd to find the breach so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and the Defendants that they durst assault it, but the day no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
appear'd, than the Stormers wonder ceas'd by another, and by their
griefs; the first, to find that those which should have contributed to their
victory, oppos'd it, and the last, to find, theirs must be won of their
Countrey-men, to be won of their Enemies, these, and many other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
too large to be deduced, by a motion of <hi>Labienus's,</hi> and by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and crime of the attempt, made the <hi>Arsacians</hi> condescend to return
from the Assault of <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> so the <hi>Pacorians</hi> would from the defence
of it; which compact being concluded, was immediately perform'd; for
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> (to suppress whatever jealousies <hi>Artabazus</hi> might have) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96335:163"/>
                  <hi>Labienus</hi> to retire to his Camp, and not move from thence, but
upon a resembling cause to that which had drawn him from it; and truly
that generous Prince seem'd to be griev'd at nothing in his Soldiers success,
but his having had no share in it. During this fight about the Town, there
was another in the Camp, for <hi>Arsaces</hi> understanding of what <hi>Labienus</hi> had
done by his Princes Commands, march'd out of his own Camp with 20000
Men, to his Sons (over the Bridge of Boats which <hi>Labienus</hi> unfortunately
had not broken) to keep those in awe by his Forces, which his Presence
and Authority could not; but <hi>Pacorus</hi> was so passionately lov'd by his
Army, that though <hi>Arsaces</hi> reign'd over, yet he did in them, so that they
all oppos'd the <hi>Arsacians,</hi> as if they had been <hi>Armenians;</hi> and if the gods
had not protected <hi>Orodes</hi>'s person, he cast himself into so many dangers,
that that obedience his Sons Army paid him by Affection, they must have
by Duty. But though the King had assum'd an inordinate rage, yet he
had not so absolutely resign'd all his Faculties to it, but upon the approach
of <hi>Labienus,</hi> and his Forces, who were then returning to their Camp; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces,</hi>
who believ'd they came victorious from the Assault, and would prove
so in the relief of their Companions, sounded a Retreat, and having drawn
up his Army near the Bridge, and secur'd it, sent a Trumpet to command
<hi>Labienus</hi> to come to him, and an engagement for his safe return; <hi>Labienus</hi>
satisfy'd with the latter, obeys the former, and in words (the most moving
he could invent) implor'd him to pardon and settle a Passion, whose great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he might judge by the effects, and whose justice he could not but be
satisfy'd with, when he saw the Beauty which created it; that he could not
destroy his Sons Love without his Life, that therefore his Revenge on his
Enemies, would prove theirs on him, and that by a Marriage he might save
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> and possess <hi>Armenia</hi> (for then the news was brought of <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s
death) But <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who sent for him only to know the cause of his retreat
to the Camp, and to command his continuance in it, having learnt that
'twas by a mutual agreement, and not by a repulse, that the <hi>Arsacians</hi> were
return'd, more troubl'd at the first cause of it, than he could be at the last,
proclaims immediately <hi>Labienus</hi> (and all those which should assist <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>)
Traytors; but finding by what they had done, what they might do,
he left <hi>Phraates, Surena,</hi> and <hi>Vixores,</hi> with all those Forces he had brought
with him, to hinder <hi>Labienus</hi> relieving <hi>Pacorus,</hi> in case he should attempt
it, and flying to his own Camp, he drew all his Soldiers out of it, and by
few but sharp words, condemn'd their remissness, and call'd that their
Fears, which they palliated with the name of a tenderness of shedding their
Companions bloud: that if this opinion was misplac'd on them, they had
an opportunity now to evince it, since he had brought <hi>Labienus</hi> to obey
him by duty or by force, and they had now ouly to oppose those <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who could no longer continue their preservation, without as high a
dishonour to the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as advantage to themselves; in brief, he so
fully remov'd all their scruples, and so incited their Valours, by injuries,
and promises of Reward, that the Solidiers by a precipitate march, went
to repeat the Assault. Oh gods! what a confusion did this Alarm raise in
the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who found their expected ruine the more bitter, by their
late confidence of having absolutely avoided it; but this sad news no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
came to <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s knowledge, than he ran transported to <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s
Chamber to acquaint him with it; The generous <hi>Parthian</hi> at this fatal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
did <hi>Labienus</hi> and himself so much wrong, as to suspect his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but learning that the Camp was in as great disorder as the Town,
*
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96335:164"/>
he condemn'd himself for having condemn'd his Favourite, and finding all
things desperate, inspight of <hi>Artabazus</hi> and his Chirurgion's intreaties, he
hastily put on his Cloaths, and commanded some of his Domesticks to carry
him in a Chair to the breach, whither as he was going, he met the Princess
<hi>Altezeera,</hi> at whose Feet (causing his Men to stay) he prostrated himself all
pale, and bloudy, (for by the violence of his fury and motion, some of his
wounds fell fresh a bleeding) and having a while embrac'd her Knees, he
told her, Can you yet (Madam) have so much goodness left, for one
whose Father endeavours your destruction, as to permit him to speak to,
and see you? this is an undeniable proof you know, and possess my heart,
for if that were not legible, you might justly make me a sacrifice to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and not permit me the honor of dying one for your safety. I go
(fair Princess) to fall for your preservation, if I cannot obtain it; and you
shall never see this offender again, unless by his services he effaces some of
his offences, if <hi>Arsaces</hi> do deprive me of that generous Ambition, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of his Son, and if I now find my Fate, all that I implore,
is, that the way in which I receive it, may expiate the sin of the Fathers
cruelty, and the presumption of the Sons Passion. These words, with the
postures he was in, so pierc'd the Princess's Heart, which was capable of all
impressions, so neer ally'd to Virtue, as Pity, that she demonstrated hers,
by some Tears she could not possibly restrain, which <hi>Pacorus</hi> observing,
he continu'd; you weep, fair Princess, I will go and dry your Tears, by
making those which cause them, to weep Tears of Bloud, or not live to see
and participate in your sorrow. Then with a trembling respect, taking the
Princesses hand, which her confusion made her not oppose, he printed on
it such passionate and ardent kisses, that those which saw them, thought
his Soul would sooner come out of his Mouth, than his Wounds; in this
extasie he had longer continu'd, had not a great cry awaken'd him out of
it, and call'd him from pleasure to danger, whither he went with Tears, not
for the latter, but for abandoning, as he thought, eternally theformer. As
soon as he came to the breach (which by the industry of some Defendants,
had been a little repair'd) he caus'd himself to be set in the mouth of it,
where danger, as great as his resolution, threatned him, and where he found
that shout he had heard, proceeded from the <hi>Armenians,</hi> at the arrival of
<hi>Phanasder,</hi> who hearing the danger <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> was it, caus'd himself to
be carried where 'twas most visible, esteeming it a nobler destiny, to dye
in the Bed of Honor, than in that of sickness; I follow'd him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the same resolution, and in a resembling posture, and came time
enough to see <hi>Pacorus</hi> with his Sword, threaten the Conquerors, who no
sooner saw their Prince in so sad and generous a posture, than by degrees
those clouds of Darts and Arrows began to diminish, and at length ceas'd;
as soon as the noise was so, <hi>Pacorus</hi> with eloquence than I thought a man
in his disorder was capable of, so mov'd the <hi>Parthians</hi> Hearts, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that in the end, concluding with a reiterated, and deep vow, when
he could no longer defend the breach, he would kill himself in it, and
that he was confident if they would retire, either to restore his Father to
his former affection in few days, or himself to his Duty, they began by
little and little to draw off, which when they were entirely, <hi>Pacorus</hi> told
<hi>Phanasder</hi> and me, that he never had a higher Duty, than that which he
paid <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and that he only mention'd that word, to reduce the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
to theirs, and to protract the time, till he could draw in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus,</hi>
and some Forces. Whilst we were in the admiration of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:96335:164"/>
Prince, and upon our return the Centinels upon the highest
Towers, gave us a fresh Allarm, which we found was no false one, for
we immediately perceiv'd the <hi>Parthian</hi> Ensignes flying towards us, and
the foremost of them carry'd by one, who <hi>Pacorus</hi> at last knew to be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces,</hi>
who seeing his Soldiers retreat, and learning the occasion of it, in
that fury both inspir'd, he ran to the Ensign of the first Milliary, and
having forc'd it from him, he cryed out to the rest, I told you, degenerate
<hi>Parthians,</hi> 'twas your fear, you disguis'd under a false Name, for now
that you fought for Glory, and against your Enemies, you resign your
first to the last, in which number I include the false <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who is a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to his King, and to his Father, and whose sight should rather inspire
you with revenge, that respect; you fight not against your Prince, but
his crimes, which being great enough to make me divest my self of all the
dictates of Nature, may well invite you to cast off those of respect; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can you avoid punishing his sin, but by committing a greater; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
from your Prince he is become your Enemy, and that in taking
<hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> you subdue a Kingdom, and a Rebel, who is much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
neither will I command you to act what I will decline, do but
follow your King, destroy you the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and I will <hi>Pacor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> Let us
go then, valiant <hi>Parthians,</hi> by your performances merit that Title, which
the more to induce you to, I vow by the gods, I will find in this assault,
my satisfaction or my death. Finishing these words, he marcht at the head
of his Troops, and through a storm of Arrows, which were shot, before
<hi>Pacorus</hi> knew his Father, he came to the foot of the breach, somefollow'd
him out of Duty, some out of Fear, but the most (as I have been since
told) to oppose, and divert him, if affairs were reduc'd to exreams; but
the generous <hi>Pacorus</hi> no sooner knew <hi>Orodes,</hi> than he commanded the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> to forbear all hostility for a little, and that good conclusion
of this difference, or his death, should render his Orders useless, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with their infringement of them; this being obey'd, he raises him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up, and leaning on his Sword, he cry'd out, <hi>Arsaces,</hi> cruel <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
here is that Son, which thou prosecutest more than <hi>Armenia;</hi> retire thy
Forces out of the latter, and I will deliver thee up the former, and if
thy fury has not so entirely divested thee of Nature, as to become the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutionr
of thy Son, he will in recompence become his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
evince himself thine, since nothing but so near an alliance could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him by death, to exempt thee from what, if acted, will make thee
deserve it. There is Divinity <hi>Arsaces,</hi> within these Walls, and if thou
esteem'st my saying so, no Truth, thou wilt change thy opinion, if thou
reflectest on what her defence has made me undertake, and what reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
thy Soldiers have paid her Defender, or if both these will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
thee to that belief, the seeing of her will; but if nothing can move
thee to reason or pitty, I attest that perfection I adore, and which thou
committest a sin if thou dost not, that the first step thou mak'st towards
her destruction, I will act mine, and perhaps, when thy choller has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
what it has usurp'd over thy reason, thou wilt find some, in deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a Son, who thou didst once honor with thy affection, and who has lost
it in a performance, which hereafter (but when 'tis too late) thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
has given him a better Title to it. Whilst <hi>Pacorus</hi> was thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all the <hi>Parthians,</hi> (as their King) did make a stand, and in imitation
of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> had desisted from shooting, with Looks, in which a
small Phisiognomist might have read their Hopes of not doing it again,
and in a silent eloquence, seem'd to implore that Command from <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:96335:165"/>
whose answer they expected, and heard with impatience, for it was thus;
Traitor, and degenerate <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who to aggravate thy crimes, canst
mention the name of Son, and yet be in Arms and Rebellion against me;
know, that the same moment thou hast cast off the duty of a Son, I have
divested my self of the relation of a Father, and consequently that death
thou threatnest me with, loses that operation with me, which thou act it,
I shall in part excuse the sins of thy Life, and consider it rather as an effect
of the greatness of their horror, than of thy affection! Neither can I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any higher crime than to pardon thine, for thou hast robb'd me in one
action, of a Son, of Glory, and of Quiet, which two last I must, and will
restore, by the destruction of the first; for that Divinity thou mention'st. I
am confident she is none, were it only for inviting thee to sin;
but if she be one, let her shew it in her defence, for I am determin'd
on so vigorous an Assault, that nothing but a Divinity can render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful;
Then turning to the <hi>Parthians</hi> with a furious look, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to follow him, and began in a hasty march to ascend the
breach, but he was stopt by <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who cry'd out, Stay <hi>Arsaces,</hi> stay,
since thou art so greedy of my death, behold I will act it, and it the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out of the World him that robb'd thee of a Son, of Glory, and of
Quiet; and if he that restores thee to the latter two, can merit any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from thee; I conjure thee by those obligations which I will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
confer on thee, content thy self with the submission, and seek not
the ruine of <hi>Artabazus,</hi> or if thy rage has stopt all ways to mercy for him,
yet a least, let his excellent Sister be respected, as near as you can extend
your duties to her merit; I conjure thee once again by the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the name of King, by this bloud, I shed for thy satisfaction, and
by my last breath, grant me this request. Then with a Look, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
relish'd of Death, turning the Pommel of his Sword to the ground,
and the Point to his Breast, he said, farewell eternally, fair Princess, I am
capable of no more but to live your Adorer, and to dye your Martyr,
and then cast himself so suddainly on the fatal Steel, that though some
endeavour'd to prevent it, yet they could not so absolutely, but that
he made a large wound in his left side, and fell on the ground, sweltering
in a Sea of Bloud; which the <hi>Parthians</hi> no sooner observ'd at the foot of
the breach, than in that rage, the loss of their Prince inspir'd, they were
going to increase it by that of their King, who was so struck with <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s
last words, and actions, that it dispell'd all his fury, which had no sooner
resign'd its place to Grief, Reason, and Nature, than in those dictates they
inspir'd, without considering the mutiny of his own Soldiers, or the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> he clamber'd up the breach, and cast himself on the
pale, and bloudy Body of his generous Son, and by Tears, and a million
of as pregnant testimonies of his conversion, acquainted <hi>Pacorus</hi> with it, so
timely too, that the least delay had render'd his change as fruitless, as `twas
real; for <hi>Pacorus</hi> finding, after the amazement of his Fall, that he was
prevented of his intent, drew out a conceal'd Ponyard, which he was
going to sheath in his Heart, had not <hi>Orodes</hi> by molifying his own, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
his Sons. Great gods! (continu'd <hi>Falintus</hi>) could I tell you these
changes which then happen'd, which were as great as suddain, I might fill
you with that wonder which did all that were present, and truly when
you consider this mutation, the more you do it, the stranger you will find
it; the Father and the Son came to take <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> the first instead of
winning the Town, looses both it and his Son; and the last, both his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his liberty, and yet commands where he has lost it. <hi>Artabazus</hi> and
<hi>Altezeera</hi> find their Protector in their Enemy; <hi>Arsaces</hi> loses his Army,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96335:165"/>
because he will lose his Son, ye at last finds his satisfaction in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
<hi>Pacorus</hi> does the like, and learns this truth from thence, that
Affection is a stronger tye upon Soldiers, than Duty, and the unhappiness
that all the <hi>Parthians</hi> lov'd another, better than their King; he finds Death
the way to Life, and Danger to Safety. Th' <hi>Armenians</hi> who did fear to see
<hi>Orides</hi> within their Walls, see it now without any, and that breach they
intended, he should never enter but by their deaths, they see him do it
with satisfaction. <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who had the <hi>Armenians</hi> at his mercy, finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at theirs, and finds himself so without any apprehension, but for the
death of him whose life was so lately his greatest. The breach which
was the Scene of the general dispute, is now of the reconciliation; and
if the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> had any desires, they were mutual for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>'s
recovery, and against <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s relapse. So strange an alteration drew
<hi>Artabazus</hi> and <hi>Altezeera</hi> thither, whose presence contributed more to the
generous Patients recovery, than the Chirurgions A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, by which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
they assur'd the impatient Kings, if no new acce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s happen'd, they
would restore him to that health, he had so meritoriously lost. There
'twas that <hi>Arsaces</hi> saw <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and by that sight, what Nature had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
in his Son, then reason did; 'Twas thought awhile by <hi>Orodes</hi>'s si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and first contemplation, that the influence of the Princesses Eyes,
would have run in a Bloud, but it seems he was but so far in the way of
Love as Admiration, which he soon left, by the reflection on a Beauty in
<hi>Parthia,</hi> who had so large an ascendant over him, and so just a one too,
that his inconstancy could not be more a fault, than a punishment. (These
words made the poor <hi>Artabanes,</hi> by a deep sigh, acknowledge a truth which
he determin'd eternally to deplore; but his generous friend, to make his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
divert his melancholly, thus continu'd his Relation.) But the calm
in <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> could hardly transcend the storm in <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Camp, which
<hi>Phraates</hi> affaulted with much resolution, and found as much in his opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but if in that day he gave proofs of a large courage, he did of as
large a cruelty, shewing all those which submitted to his mercy, that he
had none. The faithful <hi>Labienus</hi> endeavouring to force a passage to the
relief of his Prince, almost found his ruine in his Duty, for being pierc'd
with two Darts, he was at length taken prisoner, and the cruel <hi>Phraates</hi> to
punish the fidelity of his Life, had given Orders to deprive him of it, which
was happily prevented by an Express from <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who sent to end those
differences in the Camp, which he had put a period to in the Town; that
being but a consequence of this. The bloudy <hi>Phraates</hi> receiv'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his being so no longer, and the cause of it, with amazement,
repenting he had shed so much Bloud, only because he could shed no
more, for he esteem'd the difference between his Father and his Brother,
irreconcileable; and by his actions evinc'd that was his Faith, which when
he found 'twas an erroneous one, he began by a thousand formal contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to manifest a Repentance, which he neither had, nor was capable
of, and which he counterfeited so, that he discover'd he did so. But (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<hi>Falintus</hi>) the apprehensions I had, that <hi>Arsaces</hi> was guilty of a
resembling Crime, made me propound to <hi>Arbazus,</hi> the detaining of him,
now we had the power, which I said, the gods gave us, to raise in us the
Will; This proposal I fortify'd, by never having engag'd our Faiths
for the contrary; that his change was rather from Passion than Virtue;
That not being the latter, it would soon expire; that by having him
in our hands, we had our safeties too, and so good a tye upon the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> that we might derive it from our selves, and not from their
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96335:166"/>
Mercy, And, that we had wherewithal upon their retiring to gratify the
Son, by restoring the Father. I had too (said <hi>Falintus</hi>) to my self, as
strong a reason as all these together which yet I durst not mention (I mean)
the apprehension that if <hi>Orodes</hi> were at liberty, the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> would
be the condition of the peace, which being inform'd my King was intent
upon, though that should the rather have induc'd me to motion it, yet it
did to silence it, since it might have render'd me suspected, and that my
former allegations were for you, not him. But <hi>Artabazus</hi> absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
this overture, either through Fear or Virtue, but indeed all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for his so doing, relish'd of the latter: But (continu'd <hi>Falin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>)
why do I dwell so long upon this subject, as if it were to one who
were little enough concern'd in it, to be delighted with it; 'Tis too much
that you know, after <hi>Arsaces</hi> and <hi>Pacorus</hi> had had some private discourse
accompany'd with passionate gestures, and that the Father had kist and
embrac'd the Son, he took leave of <hi>Artabazus</hi> and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> in words
which resented of nothing but Friendship and Peace, and begg'd the last to
give him good account of a Son, which he entirely left to her dispose,
and from whom only they both expected his recovery. After these ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
were finish'd, he descended the same way he came up, and was
receiv'd with more shouts from his Army (which attended him at the
foot of the breach) for leaving <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> than he could have had, if
he had conquer'd it. <hi>Pacorus</hi> immediately after this separation, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Altezeera</hi> to preserve a Life which she now acknowledg'd, she
was more than ordinarily concern'd in; To which injunction, having
made his passionate and eloquent retributions, he was carry'd to his
Apartment, <hi>Artabazus</hi> doing him the honor to go on foot by his Litter.
But the strong apprehensions <hi>Phanasder</hi> and I had, that these transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
obligations, the power of a King, and Brother, and the general
safety which would as absolutely be hazarded by <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s declining
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> as setl'd by her receiving him, made us joyntly conjure the fair
<hi>Theoxcena</hi> (who was ever publiquely and zealously concern'd in your
interests) to go visit <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and by her perswasions, convert or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
her inclinations, which was a Duty our wounds hinder'd us from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, and which were more troublesome to us upon that score, than
any other. The fair <hi>Theoxcena</hi> by our desires, judging of our fears, assum'd
them too, and with a hasty earnestness, went in her Chariot immediately,
to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> whose discourses at first were somewhat cold, but at last
were so entirely divested of all that dull quality, that <hi>Theoxcena</hi> return'd
to us with a Gayity, which manifested his satisfaction, and with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
that what we had contemplated as arguments of Fear, <hi>Altezee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
did as evincements of her constancy, and that she reflected with
joy on <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s obligations, from no other motives, than that <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
might be in them convinc'd, she was uncapable of change, since <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>'s
Services, Person, and Quality, had not that Power. This generous
declaration converted our Fears into nobler Passions, for we were so much
concern'd in your satisfaction, that we had rather have hazarded the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
than it. The next day <hi>Regeliza</hi> came to visit <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> where after
the first civilities, she told her with a freedom, which is not common
to Courtiers, That the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> did not entirely approve her
last solicitations, what-ever Face she receiv'd them with, since, if <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
were the object of her Passion, she desir'd he should continue so,
without deriving that Felicity from any secundary causes; and if he were
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96335:166"/>
not, she might attribute her visit, rather to a sounding her intentions,
than a confirmation of them. This Madam (said <hi>Regeliza</hi>) the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
I pay you, makes me discover, and I believe you cannot doubt my
Heart, since I acquaint you with my Mistrisses. The virtuous <hi>Theoxcena</hi>
paid this freedom by many embraces, and protested what she had done,
was meerly an effect of her Duty, which since it was esteem'd a fault,
she would not repeat, neither discover the Cause, or Author of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
<hi>Regeliza</hi> thereupon told her, that to the best of her observations,
<hi>Altezeera</hi> was as constant as fair, and that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he deceiv'd <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> she
deceiv'd her too. Some other Ladies then coming in, they began a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
discourse, which had not continu'd above an hour, but that
(as <hi>Regeliza</hi> was upon the point of her return) she fell into an indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that lasted all that night, which she spent on a Couch in <hi>Theoxce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
Cabinet, but the next morning, being in some degree recover'd, she
return'd to the Princess, who soon after fell so extream ill, that many
thought her Confidents sickness had chang'd its place, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it self to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who gave express order, that none should give
her any visits, till she were in a fitter condition to receive them. This
news, and this order, very much troubl'd the generous <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss,
who apprehended, that direction was chiefly for her, and that it
was general, but the better to cloud it as to her particular. But whilst
the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> lay strugling with a dangerous sickness (which was so
much the more so, that the Physitians were entirely ignorant from whence
it proceeded) <hi>Arsaces</hi> sent a solemn Embas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> to acquaint
him, that as nothing but the bestowing the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> on <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
could give <hi>Armenia</hi> peace, so that alone should. But alas! her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
so increast, that her Brother fear'd she was like to be the gods,
rather than <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s. As soon as this fatal news came to <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
he blasphem'd them for it so transcendently, that it increast their
Title to her, at least diminisht his. Those that attended him, during <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera</hi>'s sickness, found his condition was more dangerous from hers,
than his own, and protested, he sent so often to know if she took any
rest, that he hinder'd her from taking any. Three days successively <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi>
had constrain'd <hi>Pacorus</hi> to keep his Bed, and silenc'd his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities,
by words which assur'd him in few days, it should be satisfy'd
by <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s sight. But <hi>Arsaces,</hi> whose Embassadors were return'd with
protestations, that nothing but the Princesses sickness hinder'd the honor
of being his Daughter, grew so impatient of this delay, both in his own
and <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s behalf, and <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s indisposition arriving so unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it relisht more of design than mischance, so inflam'd him, that
he passionately sent <hi>Artabazus</hi> word, unless <hi>Altezeera</hi> would declare to
his Ambassadors, the same assurance he had, he would look upon this
protraction as a delusion, and resent it at that rate. This harsh message
so troubl'd <hi>Artabazus,</hi> that (all trembling) he went to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and
conjur'd her on his knees, by the affection of a Sister, and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of that Empire, in which she was to succeed, that she would
give her self to <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who besides the Title of his merit, had that of
power, which though he was so civil, as absolutely to decline, yet his
Father that had not those invisible restraints, might start into an action,
in which they might find an eternal ruine. <hi>Altezeera</hi> to this, (as <hi>Regeliza</hi>
inform'd <hi>Theoxcena</hi>) reply'd, That the obligations of fear were not so
much to be consider'd by generous Minds, as those of Virtue, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
the <hi>Parthian</hi> was not to be gratify'd by the ruine of <hi>Artavasdes,</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:96335:167"/>
to whom they were both engag'd by undeniable promises; that could she vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate
that faith, it might give a just assurance to <hi>Pacorus</hi> she had none, and so
that which he design'd as a cure of their disorders, might create as great
as those they supprest. Ah <hi>Altezeera!</hi> (said the King) 'Tis not we, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
disobliges <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> and in believing, he would sacrifice his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
for our preservation, we acquaint him how much we believe he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
us; if in this we are not mistaken in him, he is not disoblig'd; and
if we are, he merits to be so. There are (reply'd <hi>Altezeera</hi>) some things
of a quality, in which we may have so good an opinion of <hi>Artavasdes</hi>
that we may thereby leave him none of us; and if I be not much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
this performance will be of that nature; let us therefore, Sir, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
our resolutions, till we know his, and if he can consider any thing
above me, I may be induc'd to consider <hi>Pacorus</hi> above him. If (said <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi>)
you can esteem it possible to observe this course, after you have
perus'd this Paper; I durst almost bind my self to submit unto it. Then
presenting her <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s Letter, which was the cause of his visit, she had
no sooner read it, than she coldly said; 'Twas not with those Arms she
was to be vanquish'd it. But <hi>Artabazus,</hi> who knew there was a storm in
that calm, conjur'd her with fresh and powerful motives, to make her
self a Conqueror by yielding; yet all was in vain, for though in Tears
he implor'd a more merciful answer, yet the only he could extort from
her, was, that if ever she were <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s, if should be as a Guift, and not
a Sacrifice. The poor <hi>Artabazus,</hi> almost frantick at this ill success, went
to visit <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who all this while had labour'd under a belief, that his
Princess was in some extremity, and that her being in no danger, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his information than her condition; these being his constant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
'twas no wonder they were as much his dreams, from one of which
he was newly waken'd, when the King came to see him, whose disorder'd
look, and moist Eyes, so abundantly confirm'd his fears, that to remove, or
resolve them (upon <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s going away (which he did without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him with his Fathers desire and threatening, either as thinking
it impertinent, if he were accessary to it, and cruel, if he were not) <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
immediately caus'd himself to be drest, and in spight of his Wounds,
or Servants, train'd himself along to <hi>Alterzeera</hi>'s Apartment, where having
begg'd and obtain'd a permission to visit her, he prostrated himself on
his knees by her Bed-side, and after a short silence, which his joy and pain
made him keep, he brake it to tell her: I could not (Madam) so much
as hope a pardon for this presumption, did I not tell you the cause of it,
which proceeds from so high and just a concern in your health; that I have
endanger'd mine, to come and learn the state of yours; in which too, I
shall find for the future, what to expect from the gods, for if they grant
not the fervent'st Prayers I am capable of, I must expect they will never
condescend to my others, and so lay aside Devotion as a needless, or at
least a fruitless thing. <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who consider'd <hi>Pacorus</hi> as accessary to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>'s
Crime, told him coldly, he could best give an accompt, whether she
were in any danger, since her greatest proceeded from his Father, and him.
Oh gods! (continu'd <hi>Falintus</hi>) how these words struck the poor <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
you only can tell! but I can that his disorder was such, as she took it
for his guilt, and that astonishment which should have evinc'd his being
innocent, made her think he was not; but after his confusion gave him leave
to speak, he cry'd out, can I then be so near guilty of so horrid a sin, as to
be thought so by my Princess? and is she so much my Enemy, that she will
wrong her perfections, rather than not wrong <hi>Pacorus?</hi> ah Madam, if you
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96335:167"/>
desire my death for my presumption, you might have taken some milder
course, than to send me out of the world, as much hated by my self,
as you: Great gods! (he continu'd, lifting up his Eyes and his Hands)
why have you given this Excellence so many charms to inspire Love, and
so little Faith to believe it; Yet Madam, perhaps I have done already
what might create your belief of mine, by a more pregnant perswasion
that Faith; but alas <hi>Pacorus</hi> why dost thou so wrong thy actions, as to
believe thy words can create in her a knowledge of that truth, when
they could not: shew her by thy death what thou wert during thy life, for
she would not use thee at this rate, were it not for that end; yes Madam
(he continu'd, addressing his speech again to <hi>Altezeera</hi>) I will now satisfy
your suspitions or your desires, then drawing out a Ponyard, which he
constantly wore, he was about to increase the crime of that design, by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, when the Princess cry'd out, hold <hi>Pacorus,</hi> I command you, hold,
if I have any desires, they will be satisfy'd in your obedience, not in your
death, and if I have any doubts, you may be satisfy'd in this Paper, if they
were not legitimate. Then she gave him the Letter, <hi>Arsaces</hi> had sent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus,</hi>
which he had left with her, and which <hi>Pacorus</hi> had no sooner
perus'd, than fetching two or three profound sighs, he told her, Yes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I am criminal, but I am only so, in being the Son of such a Father;
who before a few hours are effluxt, shall send you assurances of another
quality, or you shall be convinc'd I am a sufferer and not a sharer in his
Guilt. Thereupon, rising up, he took his leave, with a countenance so well
appropriated to his words; that those could not more discover his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
than the other did. As soon as <hi>Pacorus</hi> was return'd to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the violence of his motion, but much more that of his grief, cast
him into a new Feaver, and set his wounds fresh ableeding, with which
he writ <hi>Arsaces</hi> a Letter, so moving, and so passionate, that it obtain'd
from him one, which gave him as much satisfaction, as that he had sent to
<hi>Arta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>azus,</hi> did the contrary, and another to the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he protested, 'twas to accellerate his Sons felicities, that he was so rude
as to make use of threatenings, which though it were a strange crime, yet
it might serve to evince how infinitely he was concern'd in the honor of
her alliance, since only as a believ'd way unto that end, he made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to act it, which he repented of, and begg'd a pardon for; and to put
himself out of a capacity to repeat that guilt, he would withdraw his
Army, if she commanded it, into <hi>Parthia,</hi> and till he knew with what
Orders she would honor him, he would (in expectation of them) retire a
hundred Furlongs from <hi>Tygranocerta.</hi> This Letter (said <hi>Falintus</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
many things of a resembling quality, which my memory is not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough to retain, and which coming to <hi>Pacorus</hi> when <hi>Artabazus</hi> was
with him, he made him the Ambassador to carry it to his fair Sister, who
receiv'd that testimony of his innocency and power, so well, that in the
dictates those resentments did inspire, and in that lively representation, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi> made her of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s passion and danger, to obey the Kings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and perhaps her inclination, she forc'd her weakness to write
these few, but powerful words.
<q>Live <hi>Pacorus,</hi> if you desire <hi>Altezeera</hi> should.</q>
Never any remedy was more suddain nor efficacious than this, and if there
be any charms in words, they sure inhabit in the obliging ones of Love,
<hi>Pacorus</hi> idolatriz'd <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s and was a thousand times more satisfy'd with
them, than with that health they afterwards restor'd; and if he had now
any desires, none were more violent than those of recovery, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at his Princesses Feet, that he ow'd not only his, but a more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96335:168"/>
Blessing to her goodness. <hi>Altezeera</hi> too, as if her sickness had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
entirely from her constancy, no sooner had divested her self of that,
but she did so of the other, and either to sympathize with, or please, her
Servant, assum'd her Beauty and Health, as fast as he did his. But the fair
<hi>Theoxcena,</hi> either to satisfy her affection, or her doubts, went to visit the
Princess, and <hi>Regeliza</hi> being then gone to pay one to <hi>Artabazus</hi> (who of
late was so taken with her company, that many thought it was with her)
none of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s other women had either the confidence or the command
to deny her an admission: When she came in, <hi>Altezeera</hi> was newly fall'n
into a slumber, which <hi>Theoxcena</hi> consider'd, as so conducing to her health,
that on that score she deny'd her self the honor of her conversation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reluctancy, and in expectation of it, went to a window in the
Chamber, which afforded a diverting prospect. Not above half an hour
was expir'd, when <hi>Regeliza</hi> return'd and being ignorant the Princess was
asleep by her coming in, interrupted it. <hi>Altezeera</hi> knowing 'twas <hi>Regeliza</hi>
open'd the Curtains, and no sooner saw <hi>Theoxcena</hi> (who was presenting
her self to her) than shutting them hastily again, she cry'd out, oh gods!
<hi>Regeliza,</hi> is not it <hi>Theoxcena</hi> which I see. Yes Madam (said the fair <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxcena,</hi>
somewhat surpriz'd) 'tis she, who has acquainted you with her
rudeness, that she might with her affection, which could relish of no quiet,
till she were satisfy'd of a health, for which she has so great, and so just
concerns. Alas Madam (<hi>Altezeera</hi> coldly reply'd) if you have any concerns
in mine, I shall beg you to manifest them, by denying me any more the
honor of your visits, which will be a way more conducing to that end,
than any other you can elect. 'Twere almost as hard to fancy, as describe
<hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s astonishment, the lowest effect it produc'd, was an amazed si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which <hi>Regeliza</hi> observing, drew her aside and begg'd her to impute
it rather to a suddain and disorder'd wakeing, or indeed to any thing soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than a decrease of her affection, in which too, she would be a friend
both to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and to Justice: But <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> who ascrib'd it to the
reliques of that distaste <hi>Regeliza</hi> had inform'd her of, or to her infringing
the general Orders, which prohibited any visits, went again to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
Bed-side, and told her since the crime (Madam) of waiting on you,
is esteem'd greater than the duty which invited me to it; I shall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
content my self to enquire of your health at a less offensive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and no more pay you my visits by intrusion, but obedience. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera</hi>
having only told her, she would esteem it a great obligation; she
withdrew her self, <hi>Regeliza</hi> waiting on her to her Chariot, and making by
the way many excuses, which sufficiently manifested themselves to be what
they were; I ommitted to tell you, that the next day after the dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Phraates</hi> and <hi>Labienus,</hi> the first of them hearing of a reconciliation,
as strange as 'twas either unexpected or undesir'd, sent to visit <hi>Pacorus,</hi> to
implore a forgiveness for an action, which because 'twas against him, he
consider'd as a crime, though it were a duty, and which he might the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier
grant, since in his very offence he might read something for his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
for in manifesting he lov'd a King more than a Brother, it evinc'd
how good a Subject he would prove, when he became one, by <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s
right to the succession. But Sir (said <hi>Falintus</hi> to me, after a short silence)
you must now prepare your self to receive an intelligence that I hope will
verify the Fiction of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Launce, which, not only had the power
to give a wound, but to cure it too. Yes (Sir) the gods gave <hi>Altezeera</hi>
her health, but she employ'd it to so ill an end, that we esteem'd her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
a less misfortune, and if <hi>Theoxcena</hi> by her strange usage had some cause
to suspect she was distracted when she kept her Chamber; we had much
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96335:168"/>
more to believe she was so when she left it, since the first action she then
did, solemnly to promise her self to <hi>Pacorus:</hi> Yet <hi>Artabazus</hi> impos'd this
restriction on the Grant, that their Nuptials should not be celebrated in
<hi>Armenia,</hi> nor till the <hi>Parthians</hi> were retir'd, lest that which she intended
as a gift, might look like a constraint, and that the <hi>Armenians</hi> might be
consol'd in the loss of such a friend, by being freed from so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
If, Sir (continu'd <hi>Falintus</hi>) you esteem this a loss, do but reflect
on the cause of it, and you can no longer think it one, which opinion I
have so justly assum'd, that for your relief, I will not conjure you to make
use of your Fortitude, but your Reason only. Great gods! (I cry'd out,
all pale and trembling) is it possible then (<hi>Falintus</hi>) that <hi>Altezeera</hi> can
be false? and that Fear, not Love, should create her sin? Must that which
creates it, be as great an offence to Virtue, as me? unjust Heavens! (I
continu'd) could you give none the greatest will to ruine me, but her that
had the greatest power to do it? And did you raise me to the highest
hopes, but to make my despair resembling? Alas <hi>Falintus,</hi> I must summon
Death, and not Reason for my cure, since the latter in this occasion, does
with me as it does in the misteries of Divinity, it may confound, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help: Neither has the reflection on her constancy, the power to do it,
for I find, that more my misfortune than her fault, and what satisfaction
can it prove, that she had no imperfection, but what was only one to me;
her crime is not, that she wants loveliness, but Love, and her new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
cannot more certainly evince the former, than my death must unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
the latter. If, Sir (reply'd <hi>Falintus</hi>) 'twas <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and not the
Crown of <hi>Armenia</hi> you ambition'd — Ah Friend (I cry'd out, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him) may the gods continue me in as great torments, as they have
cast me into, if ever I ambition'd any Crown, but one of Mirtles, so it
were of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s putting on, and having lost the hopes of that Crown,
if I do not contemn all others, as much as she does my Passion. Then, Sir
(continu'd <hi>Falintus</hi>) in my opinion, your Case is not so desperate as your
thoughts suggest, for in that very performance in which she has taken away
your hopes, she has given you some, since she that has been once inconstant
may be thought with probability to prove so again. I, but <hi>Falintus</hi> (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
you say she is in a manner married to <hi>Pacorus.</hi> 'Tis true (said <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lintus</hi>)
but that mistery in Nuptials of two being one, is oftner visible to
Faith than Sence; and was there never yet a Wife was kind to any but her
Husband? Great gods! (I cry'd out, starting up, and laying my hand upon
my Sword) that any but a Friend durst say this, and that a Friend should,
No, no, <hi>Falintus,</hi> the way you take, will give me rather Horror, than
Love, for I should hate her more for being so kind, than so unconstant;
though I am an Enemy unto her, I am not so unto her Virtue, which did I
but believe were stain'd, or so much as capable of being so, I should injure
her as much as she has my Passion, or my Hopes. But <hi>Falintus</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
how great my fury was, by the pain I had to suppress it; that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
me with as much rage as grief; and that he had given me Poison ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Cordial, was so just, and so civil, as to implore my pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
me to believe, that he passionately ambition'd my consolation,
since out of but a bare hope of giving me some little, he scrupl'd not to
tax <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s virtue, which too he had done, because he esteem'd it a
maxim in the cure of Love, to give the Lover an ill opinion of her, that
made him one. Yes <hi>Falintus</hi> (I reply'd) embracing him with some sighs, I
forgive you, and will only enjoyn you for reparation, to believe for my
sake, what you should for Justices, which is, that <hi>Altezeera</hi> has no faults,
but such as are only so to the unfortuate <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> and that he is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96335:169"/>
in all things, as I am in misery. I had rather (said <hi>Falintus</hi>) rob you of
that Faith, than assume it, for I fear, if it continue yours, it may make us
lose, what we esteem as much, as ever you did <hi>Altezeera;</hi> the short remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of whose story, I will beg your permission to tell you, that you may find
some consolation in her fault, since I believe she begins to find in it, her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. I would (I reply'd) listen to your relation, with a higher satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
if my Life, as well as my Felicity had been ty'd to it, and were to
expire withit. I believe (said <hi>Falintus</hi>) if you hated not <hi>Altezeera,</hi> you
would never have mention'd so offensive a wish, for I am confident your
death would prove a much greater trouble to her, than her inconstancy
can to you. Would to the gods (I reply'd) I were certain of that, it should
not be long before I acted in one performance, both my revenge and my
quiet: but (I continu'd) generous <hi>Falintus,</hi> let me not thus interrupt the
finishing of your Relation, in which, perhaps I may find some reasons to
make your thoughts my belief, and to which I will listen with as much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as one in so transcendent a torment is capable of. I have already
(said <hi>Falintus,</hi> prosecuting his narration) acquainted you with that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and solemn engagement, which <hi>Altezeera</hi> gave <hi>Pacorus,</hi> which too
was in the presence of <hi>Arsaces, Phraates, Surena,</hi> and <hi>Labienus</hi> (who then
was recover'd of his wounds) and the <hi>Parthian</hi> King, to evince he had
neither any remnants of hatred, or fear, came into <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> only, with
those usual Guards which attended his person. The joy of this contract was
exprest in a solemn Tilting, in which <hi>Surena</hi> obtain'd entirely the honor,
which too he purchast at so much the easier rate, because <hi>Phanasder</hi> would
not dispute it, who had too-deep an impression of your grief, to receive
any of joy, especially in a performance, the cause whereof had divested
him of all his. But though neither he, nor I assisted at this publick celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet we resolv'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> should not run into a Sin, without being
told of it, which <hi>Phanasder</hi> and I joyntly went to her Apartment to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
where we were receiv'd with that grace, which is as unseparable
from her, as charming is from it; but as soon as ever we began to acquaint
her with the occasion of our visit, she imposd on us a perpetual silence,
and gave us no reason why we should keep it, but that 'twas her Command;
only she told <hi>Phanasder,</hi> he had cause indeed to sollicite her in it. To which
he reply'd, That perfect Friendship (Madam) I pay <hi>Artavasdes;</hi> gives me
an abundant cause to sollicite for his felicity, and perhaps the care I have of
you, (Madam) is not a much inferior one. I beseech the gods (she reply'd, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
that both <hi>Artavasdes</hi> and I, may deserve your care. <hi>Phanasder</hi> begg'd
her to interpret her Prayer, and her smile, but when he perceiv'd she ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
declin'd, to shew we came on business, and not on duty, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
retir'd, cursing either the nature or humour of the Sex, which to
preserve a charitable opinion of, we went to <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> to whom we gave
an account of our visit, which she would not accompany us in, her last ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had so unfortunate a success. That generous Princess seem'd to be glad
that either <hi>Altezeera</hi> by her silence confest her crime was of a quality, where
to offer to extenuate, was to increase it, or that her guilt was such a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that she avoided all entertainments which could revive it; and
though this were her opinion of the Princesses silence, yet she hop'd it
would not be yours, but that you would ascribe it to an insolence as high
as her Inconstancy, that therein since she would not reward your Passion, yet
at least that she would cure it. But <hi>Phanasder</hi> who could not put an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Prayer, that you might merit his friendship, at last
plac'd one upon her saying, he had cause to sollicite for you, as meaning his,
not preserving <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> reduc'd her to need it; and though we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96335:169"/>
to him, she could not act so transcendent an injustice, as to lay
that to him as a crime, in which he had purchas'd so much Glory; yet we
could not efface his suspitions, which he fortified by saying, she that cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

justly be suspected to be capable of any other. <hi>Regeliza</hi> who formerly, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
visited <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> still continu'd that practice, protesting to be as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the cause of her Princesses inconstancy, as troubl'd at it; she too
invited her from <hi>Altezeera,</hi> to continue her v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sits, who continue her visits,
who confest she could not more sensibly revenge her injuries, than shewing
her by a daily conversation those charms, of which by her misfortune she
had so long depriv'd her self, and which she begg'd her to impute to her
sickness, and not to her change. <hi>Theoxcena</hi> thus civilly invited, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that what <hi>Altezeera</hi> alledg'd would prove her revenge, would become
her own satisfaction, she went to visit the Princess, where though she us'd
her with the same civilities, she had formerly practis'd, yet <hi>The oxcena</hi>'s
judgement, or suspitions, deny'd her a belief that they were with the same
freedom; and indeed it is a common observation in most of that Sex, that a
division betwixt any of them, though it may be clos'd again, yet there will
be still remaining some Cicatrice, that will perpetually shew where the
wound has been; but <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> who scrutinously observ'd all she did,
found, that her joy was but a part she acted, since she was often out of it,
and as she has told <hi>Phanasder,</hi> and I, she has divers times observ'd her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to shed tears in her highest mirth, and in the midst of a discourese to
stop and start, as if her ill Angel had met her; neither was this her practice
only in her Chamber, but in the greatest Assemblies, which clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
her resolutions were not as strong as her Grief, or Guilt, <hi>Regeliza</hi>
told <hi>Theoxcena</hi> too, that she had several times surpriz'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> in such
agonies, that had you seen them, they would have converted your resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into sorrow. One evening too, <hi>Theoxcena</hi> found she had not made
her Prince's condition worse than it really was, for, coming to visit her, and
finding no body in the Chamber, she stole to the Cabinet door, where look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through a crevice of it, she discover'd <hi>Altezeera,</hi> acting sorrow so to
the life, that she apprehended 'twould have prov'd her death; and indeed
<hi>Theoxcena</hi> found in that sight, as much cause to pity, as to condemn her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy;
which had so strong an operation over her, that the immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retir'd, apprehending lest the visibility of her disorders might have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
she had discover'd the Princesses. But she was no sooner return'd
to her own Palace, than she was visited by the generous <hi>Phanasder,</hi> and I,
where having told us what she had so freshly disclosed (which in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
evinc'd, <hi>Altezeera</hi> had more inclination to repair, than continue her
crimes) <hi>Phanasder</hi> after a short debate with himself, propounded that which
I extreamly relisht, but which <hi>Theoxcena</hi> did not, which was, that he
would cause a powerful insurrection in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which should necessitate
the <hi>Parthian</hi> Army to continue in it, and consequently <hi>Altezeera</hi> not to go
out of it; that seemingly to suppress it, he would raise Forces to joyn with
<hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Army, that in the mean time upon some pretence of affairs into
<hi>Syria,</hi> I should from thence go directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> and inform you of all that
had happen'd, to desire you to make of your particular interest, one of
State, and to press <hi>Crassus</hi> (who we heard was to invade <hi>Parthia</hi>) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
speedily into <hi>Armenia,</hi> and to hinder an alliance, which if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
would render his Conquests impossible, and if prevented, as facile;
and lastly, to assure you, that upon your appearance either with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
or singly, all the seeming Rebels and his Forces, should declare for
you, and thereby force <hi>Alterzeera</hi> to as great a necessity of giving her self to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96335:170"/>
you, as she pretended there had been, to give her self unto <hi>Pacorus;</hi> or at
least make it clearly evident, her inconstancy was her choice, and not her
constraint; which too, you might have the power to punish, in him that
was the creator of it. This generous motion (as I told you) I infinitely
approv'd, but the fair <hi>Theoxcena</hi> seem'd as much averse to it, both as induc'd
thereunto out of that high concern she had in <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s safety, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
reputation, which might both run no small hazard in this action, as
out of a doubt too, that it might appear to you rather a disobligation,
than the contray, who perhaps, by thus having lost the hope of possessing
her, had also lost the desire. To these, and many as pregnant arguments,
we represented the duty of Friends, and the inclination of a Lover, the
first not more powerfully inviting our assistance, than <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
would the continuation of your Passion, and the freeing her from
<hi>Pacorus</hi>'s; Yet for all this we obtain'd <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s consent, rather by her
silence, than her granting it. Having thus elected this resolve, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of paying a vow to the god <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> when I recover'd of my
wounds, I begg'd and obtain'd leave from <hi>Artabazus,</hi> to go into <hi>Syria,</hi> to
a Temple Dedicated to him, which stood upon the Banks of <hi>Euphrates;
Phanasder</hi> would have accompany'd me the first days journey, which I
absolutely declin'd, lest it might give a suspition of that, which were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
ruin'd, if any were taken of it; we therefore took leave in <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocerta,</hi>
from whence in three days he determin'd to depart, to put that in
execution which we had in design; but instead of going to that Temple,
I went but two days on the way thither, and the third (without any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
because 'twas a pilgrimage) I took the shortest way to <hi>Tyre,</hi> where
having hir'd a swift <hi>Quinquerem</hi> Gally, the wind too blowing fair at East,
till we came to the length of <hi>Tarentume,</hi> to which we sail'd and row'd in six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
dayes (so signally did the gods favour my employment) I caus'd the
Mariners to put into this Gulph, which though I thought a misfortune, I
now find is a providence, and hope you will so improve it, as not to make
the gods repent they have conferr'd it on you.</p>
               <p>'Twas thus said, the generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to <hi>Artabanes</hi> and <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
that <hi>Falintus</hi> finish'd his Relation, which I hope you have too just an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of me, not to remember, and though it be of my telling, yet that it
was in his words, since many of them were so flattering, that I could not
have been vain enough to have spoke them of my self; neither will I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with any of my sorrows or disorders, otherwise than by a brief
and true assurance that they were proportionate to my loss; which, to
repair or revenge, I determin'd to make use of that excess of Gallantry,
which the generous <hi>Phanasder</hi> had offer'd me, and to effect it, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to return with Falintus in his Gally. But alas, this resolve was no sooner
form'd, than the thought of leaving <hi>Artabanes</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and of retiring
without him, destroy'd it suddainly again, and that too with more reason
than 'twas form'd. But <hi>Ventidius</hi> observing my trouble, and fancying the
cause, so absolutely undertook my excuse, and the care and protection of
you (for, continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) you know by your permission, I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him who you were) that in the transports of an injur'd, and
hopeful Lover, I at last receiv'd <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s assurances as satisfactory, and
having again by vows confirm'd him my permission to serve <hi>Vdosia,</hi> and my
assistance to obtain her, I staid no longer than I writ to my dear <hi>Artabanes</hi>
that I referr'd the cause of my fault, and the care of his, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Sillace</hi>'s safety to <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s relation and Friendship, which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,
I went immediately without any Servant but <hi>Philanax,</hi> to <hi>Falintus</hi>'s
Gally, where after a million of embraces and vows of an eternal friendship,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96335:170"/>
I took a final leave of <hi>Ventidius,</hi> who promis'd to apologize for my abrupt
departure to the Senate, by the advantage they would probably derive
from it, and who immediately departed for <hi>Rome,</hi> as we did for <hi>Asia.</hi> The
same wind which had hinder'd <hi>Falintus</hi>'s Navigation, so favour'd ours, that
in eighteen days we landed at <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> from whence with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diligence in six days more I arriv'd at <hi>Satala,</hi> a Principality which was
fall'n to me by the generous <hi>Annexanders</hi> death, and in which <hi>Vdosia</hi> resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whom I went purposely to see, and to give her those just impressions
of <hi>Ventidius,</hi> which should fortify her Heart against the reception of any
others. I saw her, (my dear <hi>Artabanes</hi>) and found in that sight, how much
injury the Painter had done her, and how much right <hi>Ventidius</hi> had done
himself in his election, for indeed, never Beauty did both promise and
give so much at once as <hi>Udozia</hi>'s, which (in a word) possest such tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
perfection, that had it not been for the reliques of my Passion,
I might have found the honor of being her Brother, would not be greater
than the misfortune. After these professions which my relations and esteem
made me make, I began to conjure her by both, that she would fix her
thoughts upon a person, which I not only esteem'd most worthy of them,
but which was really so, and which she might be in some degree confirm'd
in, when his interior graces were at least equal to those perfections of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of which I presented her an imperfect Copy; thereupon I gave her
<hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Picture, in a Box so precious, that nothing could be more, but
what it contain'd; and then gave her a character of him, which thought it
were short of Truth (which had been an inevitable error to whosoever had
undertaken it) yet it fail'd not to produce that effect, which a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
one to his desert had done; for <hi>Udozia</hi> whilst I was speaking,
with her Cheeks dy'd with a perfect Vermillion so concernedly consider'd
the generous <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Picture, that I thought she would be wounded in
the same way, in which she had wounded him; and I was no sooner silent,
than she told me, I know not Sir, whether I have more cause to be satisfy'd
with your care, or to be the contrary in so evident a demonstration that
you doubt my obedience and affection, since in this one Command, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Ventidius,</hi> I find pregnant arguments of both, for your election can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
more abundantly demonstratethe former, than your so earnestly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
me, what is as much an effect of my judgement, as obedience,
does the latter. Dear <hi>Udozia</hi> (I reply'd) embracing her) I am not so
much an enemy to my own Felicity, as to doubt your Affection; but if I
did, your giving your self to any man at my request, had abundantly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in me that belief, since when you scruple not to be unjust (for I esteem
it too transcendent a reward, to be a kind of injustice, and your giving your
self to any Mortal, is that rewarad) to raise in me that Faith; I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
making it mine, without revenging on myself my own incredulity.
<hi>Udozia</hi> still retaining her blushes (which this discourse continu'd in as
high a quality as my request for <hi>Ventidius</hi> had created them in,) made me a
return as full of flattery as mine was void of any, and then gave me a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
assurance of an absolue resigning her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf to my dispose. I thought it
then high time to let her know the generous <hi>Annexander</hi>'s death, which till
then I had declin'd, because Grief was an ill preparative to Love, being of a
contrary quality; and because I thought if she receiv'd the former, it would
so entirely possess her heart, that the latter would not have so dangerous an
admittance; at last by degrees I acquainted her with that fatal intelligence,
which having forc'd us to mingle our tears together, by little and little, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to dry my own, and she hers in imitation of me; but knowing that to
divert a sorrow, is to lessen it, I resum'd again my discourse of <hi>Ventidius,</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:96335:171"/>
to whom I told her, I would, and to whom I then did dispatch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
to acquaint him with his Felicity, which I assur'd her he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to come and implore at the head of fifty thousand <hi>Romans,</hi> whose cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
so led, would soon invest her in Empires as large, as the Heart which
ador'd her. I then began to enquire in what posture <hi>Armenia</hi> stood, for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tala</hi>
was upon the frontiers of it, and the first place in the Kingdom I had
rested in: <hi>Udozia</hi> told me all things were in a general quiet: that the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
Army (upon the intelligence that <hi>Crassus</hi> lay about the famous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> intending suddainly to invade their Countrey) were all
with <hi>Arsaces</hi> return'd into it, but 10000 Horse, which remain'd as Guards
to <hi>Pacorus</hi> and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who were shortly to follow, and which had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been interrupted by a fresh indisposition of the latters, who yet was
now so well recover'd that in three days, she with <hi>Pacorus,</hi> intended to
leave <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> and to begin their journey for <hi>Parthia,</hi> on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of which Empire, <hi>Arsaces</hi> with all the gallantry of it, had publish'd
he would meet them, and that all this she had receiv'd by an Express the
day before, from <hi>Lindesia.</hi> I was not more astonish'd to learn <hi>Armenia</hi> was
in so perfect a tranquility, than joy'd to find <hi>Altezeera</hi> had not yet left it;
and after a short reflection on both, I ascrib'd the former to the latter, and
that the gods by having so obligingly detain'd her, had induc'd <hi>Phanasder</hi>
to suspend that Insurrection he intended another cause producing the
effect, for which only that was design'd. Neither was my Fancy so little
flattering, as not to create in me some hopes, that <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s indisposition
was rather a pretence than a reality, and purposely contriv'd to give me
time to come to her rescue, and my own felicity: In this Faith I esteem'd
it not requisite to invite <hi>Crassus</hi>'s invasion, who too, being in this place,
was at too great a distance, to answer so suddain an occasion as mine, but
rather to flye to <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> and there to form my resolutions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my Intelligence. Therefore having found <hi>Udozia</hi> had as much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
as Beauty, to let her know that was my belief, I privately sent
for <hi>Cleomen,</hi> the Governor of <hi>Satala,</hi> who I commanded thenceforth to
obey <hi>Udozia</hi>'s Orders, to whom I left entirely the Care and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all: <hi>Cleomen</hi> gave me a million of thanks for so pleasing a Command
and publish'd himself exceedingly satisfy'd, that what he had hitherto
done by inclination, he should now do by duty. Then after having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Udozia</hi> fresh assurance of a passionate affection and friendship, and
conjur'd both her and <hi>Cleomen,</hi> to keep my being in <hi>Armenia</hi> a Secret,
with fresh Horses, and only with <hi>Falintus</hi> and <hi>Philanax,</hi> in four days I
crost the lower <hi>Armenia,</hi> and came to <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> late at night; the first
place I lighted at, was at the Palace of <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> with whom I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to find <hi>Phanasder,</hi> or learn where I might, and by the advice of so
good Friends and Judgements; fix upon the best resolution; but there I
learnt, <hi>Theoxcena</hi> had that day left <hi>Tygranocerta</hi> with <hi>Artabazus,</hi> and all the
Court, who were gone to accompany <hi>Pacorus</hi> and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> towards the
frontiers of <hi>Parthia.</hi> Oh gods! what horror did this fatal news strike me
with? but not to contribute to my misfortune, I determin'd (having given
our Horses a little refreshment) to follow that Beauty which fled, both
from my Passion and me; and therefore went directly to <hi>Phanasder's</hi>
Lodgings, for I could not learn at <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s any intelligence of him,
but that he was not gone with her. <hi>Falintus,</hi> who went in first, got
me a private Apartment, in which I continu'd til he return'd,
who soon brought me word, that <hi>Phanasder</hi> was a days journey
from <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> and that before he went he had left order, if any came
to him from either of us, that he should be speedily advertis'd of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:96335:171"/>
I therefore immediately dispatch'd a Messenger to him, to let him know
I was come, and that I would the next day overtake <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and learn
my destiny from her whil'st she was in <hi>Armenia;</hi> and that if he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me, he should be certain to hear of me from <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> to whom only
besides the Princess I would discover my self. This Express being dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after three hours rest, we began again to prosecute our journey, and the
next night overtook the Court, which, by good fortune, lay at a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Castle of <hi>Evaxes,</hi> whither as soon as we arrived, I endeavoured by all
means possible to speak to <hi>Theoxcena;</hi> but neither my own endeavors, nor
those of <hi>Falintus</hi> and <hi>Philanax</hi> could procure it, unless absolutely one of
us would discover himself, which we positively esteem'd destructive to our
design; therefore, after a short consideration, I resolved to make my self
known to <hi>Evaxes,</hi> of whose fidelity I was justly confident, and from him to
implore the blessing of an opportunity to entertain without any witness the
Princess <hi>Altezeera.</hi> The civil <hi>Evaxes,</hi> joyfully receiv'd my disclosing my
self, and more the means I gave him of obliging me, which he undertook
positively; and bringing me by stol'n passages to that Room alotted for
her Bed-chamber, he plac'd me in a Cabinet contiguous to it, and assur'd me
so to order all things, that once that night, I should have that opportunity
I so passionatly implor'd. I embrac'd him a thousand times for this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and gave him as many verbal retributions, which finish'd, I only
conjured him to tell me truly, whether <hi>Altezeera</hi> were yet married to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi>
to which he absolutely assur'd me she was not, neither would be, till
her arrival in <hi>Parthia.</hi> Immediately after this he left me, and 'twas already
so late, that I had not been above half an hour in my impatiency and my
Prison, when through a favourable little hole, I perceived the Princess
come into the Chamber with all those Charms with which she conquered
whosoever beheld her, and waited upon by <hi>Pacorus</hi> the last evincement of
that power.</p>
               <p>WHen the generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was in this part of his Relation, the
Chyrurgions coming in, interrupted it, by acquainting him it was
time to dress both his and <hi>Artabanes</hi>'s wounds. This Summons they obey'd,
though in it the last of them found a new affliction in his friends hurts,
whose dressing was so long of necessity to suspend a Narration, in which
he could not be more concern'd than he was ravish'd; but at length the
Chyrurgions having performed their duties, and having assured their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
that their wounds were as hopeful as their Art could wish, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
by <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s command, withdrew themselves, and then <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes,</hi>
upon his and <hi>Arta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where they had interrupted it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat gods! (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) you only know my
Transports at the seeing of so many Beauties, and of him
which ravish'd them from me! Ah! (said I to my self)
go <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> and prostrate at thy Princesses feet, conjure
her not to make herself the reward of any thing but her
perfectest Adorer, and in that quality implore her for thy
self: If <hi>Pacorus</hi> pretend a Title to her under that Notion, decide it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judge, and recompence of the Combat, and by vanquishing thy
Rival, conquer her disdain, and inconstancy, or by being vanquisht by him,
end thy torments, and thy life: This <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> is the noblest, as well as
readiest expedient; but alas! (I continu'd) she that prefer'd <hi>Pacorus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, will not so much hazard the object of her love and inconstancy,
as to expose his life to a hand, which strikes with the Sword of Justice and
Revenge.</p>
               <p>Whil'st I was building and destroying a thousand such resolutions, and
thoughts, <hi>Pacorus</hi> was entertaining <hi>Altezeera</hi> with all the respect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
so great a beauty and flame could inspire. I must confess my disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for awhile gave me not leave to consider what he was doing, or what
he said; but when they did, I endeavor'd by an extraordinary attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to repair that precious time I had so misimploy'd; and I was no sooner
compos'd to a setled hearing, than I heard <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who kneel'd before
<hi>Altezeera,</hi> thus speak to her: My Princess, alas! why did you confine my
joyes from being perfected till you came into <hi>Parthia?</hi> Was it to torment
the ambition of my desires, by so long a protraction of them? or to punish
my crime in my continuance of it? or else did you so much injure my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
to esteem it of so common a quality, that circumstances could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear it?
and that the suspension of the blessing, could bring any accession
to it? If it be the first of these, to continue the punishment of an aspiring
which my Princess hath so often pardon'd to my reiterated prayers and
tears, is to be as much unjust as she is capable of; and if the latter, she is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as injurious to herself, as cruel to me.</p>
               <p>Ah! (thought I) how unjust are the gods rather, to confer their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
on one who has no title to them, and who if he had, merits none, by
exclaiming against a felicity which nothing but a little time will place him
in, and perfect; when at the same instant they divest me, not only of the
joyes, but hopes of them, when she too which ought to be the distributer
of them is mine, by services, by gift, and by vows. That distance betwixt
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96335:172"/>
the place where <hi>Altezeera</hi> was, and where I remain'd so sad an Auditor, was
so great, that she not uttering her answer with that violence <hi>Pacorus</hi> had
done his question, I could not hear it, but I remember after he had printed
an ardent kiss upon her hand, he rose up, and told her, I will go rather
Madam, and implore the gods either to hasten the motions of time, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
those of my impatiency; for whil'st they both continue as they are,
my torments must do the like: Then after some discourses, which I heard
but in broken parts, he withdrew himself. I observ'd, that for a short time
after, none appear'd in the Chamber, nor that any noise was made about it,
and believing I deriv'd this opportunity from <hi>Evaxes</hi>'s favor and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to lose it, I came trembling and pale, out of my concealment, and
going to <hi>Altezeera</hi> in an unequal pace, I no sooner came to her feet, than
prostrating my self at them, I told her, If Madam, the miserable <hi>Artavasdes</hi>
presents himself before you, 'tis not to reproach you having made him so,
nor to summon you of those holy and passionate vows, which rais'd his
joyes to a transcendency nothing can proportion, but the torments your
having conceal'd them has cast him into: Neither, fair Princess, can you tell
him it can be more his duty, than he does you, that 'tis his inclination, to
create your felicity by the ruine of his own. He does not therefore come
to conjure you, not to give that blessing to the greatness of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
which you a thousand times have promis'd to the greatness of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
for he alwayes esteem'd it so unjust you should bestow the divine <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera,</hi>
on one who is almost as much her Subject by the advantage of her
birth, as by that of her beauty, that he would have kill'd himself, that he
would have dy'd to prevent in her so criminal a mercy; and if he hath
liv'd in a contrary flattering hope, 'twas only because he esteem'd no sin so
great, as to disobey her.</p>
               <p>Whil'st I was speaking a thousand things of this quality, which too I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
in the pressingst Accents that ever the highest grief and flame was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of; <hi>Altezeera</hi> was so surpriz'd, and astonish'd, that had her affection
remain'd as fix'd as her body then did, I had been exempted from transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
torments, by resembling felicites; nor did she awhile after I had
ended speaking, give me any Answer which might have resolv'd my
doubts, whether her silence proceeded from a cruel, or obliging cuase; for
all she said when she broke hers, was only, Oh gods! Is this <hi>Artavasdes</hi> that
I see? Yes Madam (I reply'd) 'tis that <hi>Artavasdes</hi> who has given the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Altezeera</hi> so absolutely his life, that he durst not without her permission
put a period to it, though what she has of late acted, has made him languish
in such torments, that the best way of making them cease, next to that of
the blessing of her esteem, is to make them cease, next to that of
the blessing of her esteem, is to make them cease, by the blessing of death:
'Tis therefore (Madam) I present you this Poniard, that if you will not
be just to your vows and promises, yet at least, that you will be charitable
to him, to whom they were made; and if I implore any thing before I die,
'tis only that I may do it with the consolation of receiving my ease from
her, from whom I have my sufferings, and that she will declare I dy'd as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
as unfortunate. This (fair Princess) if your justice does now
deny me, your pity cannot long; for my languishings will evince, death is
the lesser ill: Neither, Madam, do I implore it on any score but yours, for
my sufferings proportionating my loss, will make such deep impressions in
you, that your joyes in your intended Nuptials, will receive a resembling
disturbance, at least if you have not as absolutely banish'd Compassion from
your heart, as Love; thereupon kissing the hilts of the Poniard, I offer'd
that part of it to her, and presenting her my breast, I implor'd her to make
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96335:173"/>
what had been the Scene of her highest Empire, now that of a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
pity. But alas she declin'd making use of that Weapon, to wound
me with a more curel one, I mean her words, which accompany'd with an
inflam'd look, told me, Traytor <hi>Artanasdes,</hi> though thy Crimes merit I
should become thy Executioner, as well as thy Judge, yet I decline being
the former, to make them appear the greater; and if (as thou say'st) thou
dost esteem no sin higher than to disobey me, I command thee evince the
truth of that profession, by never coming again into my sight. Then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up hastily, she went out of the Chamber by the same door she came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; and though her remove was very sudden, and that my amazement
was as great, yet I cry'd out, Stay <hi>Altezeera,</hi> though <hi>Altvasdes</hi> know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
innocent, yet because you do not think him so, behold how he will
punish not his guilt, but his misfortune: Then running to that Poniard she
had flung away, I took it up, and in the horror and despair of my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I had sheath'd it in my heart, if <hi>Evaxes</hi> (who listen'd at a back-door)
had not has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily come in, and snatching it out of my hand, prevented it.
Though it be a transcendent wrong, when one is in proportion at misery,
to take away the cure of it, yet my rage not having so absolutely blinded
me, but that knowing what was in its own nature an offence, was intended
for a charity, I only told <hi>Evaxes</hi> (having first furiously look'd on him) 'tis
in vain <hi>Evaxes,</hi> 'tis in vain you think to keep mefrom death, by having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took from me one means of acting it, when the wayes which lead unto
the Grave cannot be more, than the causes which invite me to it: Then
turning from him, and observing <hi>Altezeera</hi> was gone, I ran precipitately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her, but alas she had lock'd the door upon me, and thereby I found she
had not only excluded me from the hopes of possessing her, but from those
of clearing an imaginary guilt, to which she implicitely ascrib'd that fatal
deprivation. In the rage of so strange an usage, I was a thousand times
about to have forc'd it open, had not <hi>Evaxes</hi> hinder'd me, by representing,
that if <hi>Altezeera</hi> had not apprehended my vindication, she would neither
have then deny'd listning to it, nor debar'd me the means of discovering
how passionate I was to evince it; That since her Actions so evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
that Truth, I ought to impute her objecting Crimes to my
charge, but as a cloud for her own, and consider that to be her inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which she disguis'd under the name of her resentments; That since she
was of so volatile a disposition, 'twas better I had made that discovery in
the condition I was yet in, than in that which <hi>Pacorus</hi> was so near embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
since I might consider, that as my felicity, which he could not learn
but as his torment; That it was still an Argument she loved me, when she
declin'd imposing those miseries on me my desires ambition'd, to confer
them on another, whose subsequent troubles I should pleasingly disclose
those I had so happily avoided.</p>
               <p>These reasons would have appear'd so to any but me, and would too so
to me, had I but listen'd to them, which then I did not; for all the while
he was speaking, I was so too, sometimes resolving to go and punish <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus,</hi>
for having been so far from hindring his Sisters inconstancy, that he
sollicited and provoked it; but then the reflection on the greatness of the
Sin, hinder'd me from acting it, especially too when that reflection was
fortify'd by that on his quality, which made it a greater injustice not to act
for the safety of his Subjects in general, than to do it for any one of them
in particular, so that I had no just cause to be offended with him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of two evils elected the least. My fury not finding a fit object in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96335:173"/>
him, I began to contemplate <hi>Pacorus</hi> as one, who was not only the cause
of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s inconstancy, but the continuer of it, and whose destruction
would both revenge me on him and her. But then the reflection on the
occasion of his Sin, appear'd a sufficient Apology for it, and knowing how
impossible 'twas to see, and not love <hi>Altezeera,</hi> in the very necessity of his
fault,; besides, by services and engagements, she could not be more mine,
than upon both those scores she was <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s; and yet I had been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
as to sollicit her for <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> and therefore 'twere to be more so, to
punish that in another, which I practic'd in my felf; that she was only mine
by the first grant, and his by the last, which in all concessions of Love is
the bindingst Title; and lastly that I ow'd a life unto him, which till I
had repaid, I was his Debtor, and therefore should not be his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
               <p>Whil'st my Reason and my Passion were thus making War against each
other, <hi>Evaxes,</hi> who still apprehended the last of them would fling me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some strange Crime, and that my continuance where I was, might into a
proportionate danger, (all the Guards in the Castle being <hi>Parthians</hi>) he
conjur'd me so passionately to retire to an Apartment he had provided for
me, and there establilsh my resolutions, when my resentments were so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd,
as not to silence the dictates of my reason, that at last by following,
rather than by promise, I obey'd him, who led me by a stolen passage to my
Chamber, not meeting any one by the way, which though we had, I am
confident I had not been discover'd, if at least I had been as unknowable
to all, as I was to my<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lf. There I told <hi>Falintus,</hi> and <hi>Philanax,</hi> what had
happen'd, and there 'twas that <hi>Evaxes</hi> repeating those reasons my rage hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
me from hearing, (which too were strengthen'd by many others as
powerful from <hi>Falintus</hi>) I determin'd the next morning as an evincement
of their operation, to retire into some solitude, and there spend as much
time as the banishing <hi>Altezeera</hi> from my heart, would take up, whose influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
there was not already a little eclips'd, since I could form a resolution
of extinguishing it.</p>
               <p>This Declaration prov'd as pleasing to them, as that which created it,
was the contrary to me; but they having retir'd themselves, I past the night
in such confused thoughts, that it had been difficult to have collected any
thing from them, but that they were the productions of an exorbitant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>emper.
The day no sooner appear'd, than telling <hi>Falintus</hi> and <hi>Evaxes,</hi>
whither I intended to go the next night, and having commanded <hi>Philanax</hi>
to follow me, as soon as he had learnt from them, whether my being in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
and my last Action were discover'd, how they were both relish'd, and
whether I might safely demand justice of <hi>Artabazus</hi> for <hi>Anexander</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that in the certainty of being deny'd it, I might thereby act it myself,
immediately (before the Court was up) I took Horse, and was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
out of the Castle by <hi>Evaxes,</hi> (who for a long while made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to trust me alone, being so newly recover'd from a despair, whose ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
were yet somewhat visible in my face; but having secur'd his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
by many vows, and by the improbability of my so much contributing
to my Enemies triumphs, I finally took leave of him, and had not Travel'd
above an hundred Furlongs, when coming into a Wood at the extremity
of a great Plain, I was stop'd by a violent Cry behind me, which turning
about to learn the cause of, I saw the man that utter'd it, come running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, as fast as his Horse could carry him; as soon as he came near me,
he drew his Sword, and bade me defend my self, if my Crimes had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96335:174"/>
me of the Courage to justifie them: This Declaration, though it
much surpriz'd me, yet I did not near so much as the knowledge that 'twas
<hi>Phanasder</hi> which made it; but being confident he mistook me, I prepar'd
my self for nothing but to embrace him, and offer him my Sword and Life
to join in his revenge; but perceiving he esteem'd himself discharg'd of
all other Ceremonies, by having denounc'd the Combat, I cry'd out to him,
hold <hi>Phanasder</hi> 'tis <hi>Artavasdes</hi> speaks to you. 'Tis he (<hi>Phanasder</hi> briskly
reply'd) that I seek, and who to his other Triumphs must add that of my
Life, or in the loss of his, I must repair my wrongs.</p>
               <p>Oh gods! (I answer'd) if my Death could be but as great a satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Phanasder,</hi> as to me, he would oblige us both in acting it; but since
such a satisfaction cannot be perfected without as great a Crime, let me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
first wherein you esteem me guilty; for if I do not so entirely
vindicate <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that you must acknowledge <hi>Phanasder</hi> criminal, for
having thought him so, I will employ my Sword, not to resist, but execute
your Revenge. If thy Crimes (said <hi>Phanasder</hi>) were not too-too-much
apparent, I should not have sought this opportunity, which since they are,
I will not spend it to shew thee thy sins, but to punish them. Then, having
again bid me defend my self, or my submission should not be my Sanctuary,
he charg'd me with such fury, that I found by experiment the high chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
I alwayes had of his Courage, was but too dangerous a truth. But his
rude Reply to an offer he could not have declin'd without seeking to be
my Enemy, and the certainty I found, that I must derive my safety not from
my innocence, but resistance, though they made me finally draw my Sword,
yet I made but use of it to keep him from acting a sin, I know he would in a
right understanding as much deplore, as now he was sollicitous to perform;
and indeed he prest me so incessantly and vigorously, that had not an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Accident ended the Combat, my death or his must have done it; for
making a furious blow at my head, and I defending it with my Sword, his
flew out of his hand in two pieces.</p>
               <p>At this <hi>Phanasder</hi> was not more astonish'd, than I was satisfi'd, which I
exprest by telling him, <hi>Phanasder,</hi> Let that Life I give you, convince you
that I am still your Friend. No, no, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> (he hastily reply'd) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
me thou art the contrary; for if thou were not, having loaden me
with such sorrows, thou wouldst not deny me their cure, being it is in thy
power, therefore I declare, if thou canst be yet concern'd in having me
esteem thee my Friend, nothing can be more contributory to it, than to
make use of thy Victory, which the more to induce thee to, I protest by all
those wrongs thou hast done me, I will leave no place unsearch'd, nor no
means unattempted for my revenge. If (said I) my giving you your life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your first declaration, has not convinc'd you that I am your Friend, I
hope the doing it after this latter, will sufficiently effect it; for were I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in
your death, I have not only the power, but the provocation to act
it. But, <hi>Phanasder,</hi> I had rather expose my life to your fury, than secure
it by the destruction of what I prefer a thousand times before it, which not
only my friendship for you, but even your hatred to me makes me profess,
and which I still implore to learn the subject of, that if I do not extinguish
your desire of revenge, I may present you wherewithall to act it. Oh gods!
(reply'd <hi>Phanasder,</hi> lifting up his eyes) why do you give unto guilt the
same expressions with which innocency should be cloath'd? Then turning
them to me, he told me, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> thou wilt not then by ending of my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
shew methou hast some pity, if not friendship for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:96335:174"/>
No, (I reply'd) for should I so put a period to yours, I should create
in my self greater than I cen extinguish in you. Remember then (he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
that there being no way to end those I groan under but by my
death, or thine, that denying me the former, thou necessitatest me thereby
as much as by thy crimes, unto the latter, which I will perform, though
thou shouldst conceal thy self in that heart, which thou valu'st more than
thine own; then turning about his Horse, he thrust himself into the Wood
full speed, my pity at his condition not being greater, than my ignorance
of what created it, I follow'd him, to learn what he had twice deny'd me;
and when I found I could not overtake him, I endeavored to make my voice
do it, which was so far from retarding, that it did but hasten his course, so
that I soon lost sight of him, yet for above four Furlongs I follow'd by the
track of his Horse, but then mine began to faint, and suddenly after fell
dead under me, by a deep wound he had received in the fight, and which
my earnest prosecution of <hi>Phanasder</hi> made me not observe. 'Twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
my heat was mitigated, that I began to find how much the gods took
delight to torment me; and after I had a little reflected on those strange
Accidents which had arrived me in so short a space, I could not abstain from
saying, Great gods! was it not enough misery for the unfortunate <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
to lose his Princess, but you must add unto it, the losing of his friend?
And were not both those losses sufficient to glutt your hatred, but that you
must give me resolution and fortitude to survive them? Ah cruel Powers,
did you give me Innocency but by punishing it as Guilt, to change mine
into it? And are you so sollicitous to make me blaspheme, that you make
Innocence unfortunate, to invite me to it? But (I continu'd, after a short
silence) if I have offended you, let the world read my sin in my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but since I have not offended either <hi>Altezeera,</hi> or <hi>Phanasder,</hi> why
would you induce the world to believe I have, by making them my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors?</p>
               <p>'Twas with as many extravagant Reasonings as these that I fed my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
and my rage not permitting me to rest, I found my self out of the
Wood, as soon as I remembred I had been in it, and seeing a Village not far
off, I went thither, where having hired a Horse, I prosecuted that journey
<hi>Phanasders</hi> strange distemper had interrupted. As soon as I came into my
Inn, I found, that <hi>Falintus</hi> and <hi>Philanax</hi> (having met with no obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
were gotten thither before me, from whom I was informed, that
though they could not find by any intelligence they had learnt, that my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Armenia,</hi> nor my having been at <hi>Evaxes</hi> Castle were known, yet they
had cause to believe both were, for <hi>Crassolis</hi> that morning was retir'd from
the Court; neither could they any more discover the cause of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than the place of his retreat, so that <hi>Falintus</hi> told me, I might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<hi>Artabazus</hi> would not deny me justice for my Fathers murther, since
<hi>Crassolis</hi> to think his own guilt, only not my knowledge of it, made him
flie, and in that faith he might return; which as soon as he did, then was
the time of demanding justice: For the giving of it then, would give me
revenge with it; and to implore it now, were absolutely to miss of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by a concession of the former, since to condemn him, were but giving
him advice to secure himself.</p>
               <p>These Reasons since I could not suspect, either them, or the Author of
them, I determined to obey, I then told <hi>Falintus,</hi> what as unfortunate, as
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96335:175"/>
strange an Accident had arrived me with <hi>Phanasder,</hi> which he admir'd at
as much as he was ignorant of the cause, and told me, This morning, Sir, I
met him coming from the Princess <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s Apartment, and with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
whose disorder he could not conceal; after he had by some short
embraces and expressions congratulated my happy return, he then precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately
asked me where you were, for he had some business of high concern
to communicate unto you.</p>
               <p>I told him, that both <hi>Philanax</hi> and I, continued at Court, purposely to
learn, and send you things of that quality; and that if he were over-harrast
with his late journey, and that he would acquaint me with the secret, I
would overtake you that night, and stop you till his coming.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Phanasder</hi> replyed, That he would trust me with his heart, but
that the business he had with you, was of a nature which would lose its
virtue, if it were delivered you by any but himself, and therefore he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
conjured me to let him know which way you had took, and to
pardon a silence which I could not condemn, when I should be instructed in
the cause. I did therefore satisfie both his requests, and 'twas by my infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that he so unfortunately found you out; but could not you, Sir,
(continued <hi>Falintus</hi>) in his passion, collect something which might tell
you what created it?</p>
               <p>No, (I replyed) though by reiterated intreaties I conjur'd him to tell
it me; and with faithful promises, if I were guilty, to contribute to, and not
oppose his revenge; but all was in vain: and I could collect nothing but
that he was as confident I was criminal, as I am, that I am not. The best part of
the night we entertain'd our selves in resembling discourses, which at length
I put a period to, by conjuring <hi>Falintus</hi> to continue about the Court, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to learn the cause of <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s change; that though his carriage
render'd him not absolutely worthy my care, yet thinking the knowledge
of his error would not only punish the Criminal, but restore unto me the
gallant <hi>Phanasder,</hi> I was passionately concerned therein; That he would
enquire after <hi>Crassolis,</hi> and send me constant intelligence to a Solitude near
<hi>Satala,</hi> which I had elected in a great measure by his persuasions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and where I would pass away the reliques of my melancholy and
love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Falintus</hi> would have accompany'd me thither, which I absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd;
and then he having as absolutely promised to obey my former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
the next morning we separated our selves, he taking the way to the
Court, and I to <hi>Thospia,</hi> where I intended to visit <hi>Lyndesia,</hi> before I seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my self from the World. There that excellent Woman gave me such
admirable Reason, for the suppressing of my Passion, that I must havebeen
entirely divested of the former, had I not divested my self of the latter;
which whil'st I did not (for I shall not scruple to confess, that sometimes I
made a start into Love) by the reflection on <hi>Lyndesia</hi>'s reasoning, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
my self void of any, and knowing my self to be so, I excused my
fault, in the knowledge of my condition: Neither did she only give me
precepts, but example against the assaults of Fortune; and what she would
have had me practice in <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s case, she did in herself <hi>Anexanders,</hi>
though in it she found so little reason to fortifie herself with, that perhaps
that was the only reason with which she did it; neither did her calmness
in so high an essay, appear anything like insensibility, no, it shew'd its cause
in its effect, and the gods did in some degree repair her loss, by making it so
largely evidence her virtue: I have been (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
the more particular in <hi>Lyndesia</hi>'s character, because her perfections are
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96335:175"/>
of a resembling quality, as also to oppose a Maxim as absurd as common,
which is the declining the praise of those to whom we have a near relation;
whereas those that have not any, can hardly make an exact character; and
by this low rule, the chief, if not the only way by which we must attain to
the knowledge of a perfection, must be the Argument for not publishing
it. I continued two dayes at <hi>Thospia</hi> with <hi>Lyndesia,</hi> from whose actions, as
well as words, I received that consolation I fear'd she would have needed.
The third day I took my leave, and desired her to continue <hi>Udozia</hi> where
I had given her an absolute power, not only as it was a place near which I
intended to reside, but being on the frontiers, <hi>Ventidius,</hi> (whose passion I
had not only at large acquainted her with, but made her approve) upon
the making his Addresses to <hi>Udozia,</hi> might not be necessitated to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in any hazard, by coming unaccompanied, or <hi>Armenia,</hi> by coming with
an Army. This <hi>Lyndesia</hi> having granted, I left <hi>Thospia,</hi> and in twelve days
came to my little retirement, where retaining none but <hi>Philanax</hi> with me,
and two or three servants for necessary uses, I began to make a fierce War
against my Passion, and my Sadness, which I found were Enemies easier to
be conquered, than extirpated, and like some barbarous people, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
when any power was extant to oppose them; but when that power
appeared no more, they instantly did, and assum'd as high a Sovereignty,
as if they had been Conquerors. This made me incessantly continue in
Arms, and those I made use of, were the remembrance of the services I had
rendered <hi>Altezeera</hi> of her vows, and of her unconstancy; for which I
found so little excuse, that what had given the wrong, I thought would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
repair it: A thousand times in this resolution I was going to abandon my
Solitude, and by a publick undisturbed serenity, evince I rob'd her of so
much of her triumph, as that my sorrow compos'd no part thereof; but
alas immediately I fancy'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> in all her charms, and captivating my
resolution, with the same eyes with which she had my liberty, with whose
influences, my trayterous fancy so conspired, that though I were at too
great a distance to receive their real impressions, yet by that false helper I
carried still their effects about me. Never man endured those torments the
miserable <hi>Artavasdes</hi> did, and his fate was so particular, that whil'st he yet
disputed the Victory, he resented more pregnant sufferings than he could
have in the very losing it: And if mine received any intermission, 'twas
from the visits of <hi>Vdosia,</hi> in whose sight and conversation I had some good
intervals, which continu'd me in some charity to the Sex, by receiving from
one of it the ease of those pains another had made me resent. 'Twas thus
for a long while that I languish'd away my time, during which I received
frequent and faithful intelligences from the generous <hi>Falintus;</hi> his first was,
that notwithstanding a scrutinous enquiry and search, he could never
learn either waht was the cause of <hi>Phanasder</hi>'s change, or what was become
of him: That the fair <hi>Theoxcena,</hi> as Author of, or participater in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
had retired herself either absolutely, or conditionally from the
world; and that he was as ignorant of the place of her retreat, as of what
was the occasion of it: That <hi>Altezeera</hi> had been solemnly married to the
Prince of <hi>Parthia,</hi> immediately after her arrival in that Kingdom: And
that <hi>Crassus</hi> had lost his Army, and his Life, in a furious Battel against the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> who had been assisted by a visible Divinity, that vanish'd as
soon as did the <hi>Roman</hi> hopes. These three Intelligences were as sensible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, as any others I was capable of; for in the first of them, I lost my
friends; in the second, my Mistriss; and in the third, my hopes of reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or repairing that loss. I will pass over the many sighs and complaints I
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96335:176"/>
gave to those accessions of sorrow, to let you know, that the Solitude which
Reason could not make me abandon, Friendship did: For I received an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from <hi>Udozia,</hi> that <hi>Ventidius</hi> with an Army (as formidable from the
Nation, as the numbers which compos'd it) had already crost the <hi>Helles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi>
and was so far advanc'd into the letter <hi>Asia,</hi> that if intended to see
him before he entered <hi>Armenia,</hi> I could not any longer delay my visit. This
Alarm I joyfully receiv'd, and in some degree I was reconcil'd to the gods,
who, though they had deny'd me the establishment of my own felicity, had
yet blest me with the power of setling my friends. In two dayes I had
fitted my self to leave my retirement, which I could not do without some
reluctancy, as an acknowledgement of those uninterrupted hours of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
I had spent in it; my first journey was to <hi>Satala,</hi> where having
formed my Equipage and receiv'd those reiterated assurances from <hi>Udozia,</hi>
which were to settle <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s, and my felicity, I crost the mountain <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus,</hi>
which separates <hi>Armenia</hi> from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and in two dayes after came to
<hi>Tharsus,</hi> the Metropolis of that Province, where <hi>Ventidius</hi> then lay; who
having Advertisement of my Arrival, drew out all his Army (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of 50000 natural <hi>Italians</hi>) into a large Plain on the East-side of
the City, where he receiv'd me with a million of Embraces at the head of
them, and where I found nothing more worthy admiration than the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but their General. 'Twas at this first meeting (after I had saluted all
the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunes) and as we were riding to <hi>Tharsus,</hi> that he told me:
If (my dear <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) I have so long abstained from acknowledging
<hi>Udozia</hi>'s victory at her feet, 'twas only to evince my respect equal to my
Passion, and not to declare my self her Subject, till I presented her with an
Army that might make those so by her commands, which were unworthy
to be so by her sight: The gods know how just this duty is, by esteeming
it fitter to abandon their <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Crassus</hi>'s defeat, than that I should be any
longer suspended from paying it: Yes (my <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) I am now come
to implore that Assistance you have so generously promis'd me, and by
which if I am victorious, I shall no more fear any other Conquests, than
desire them. He told me many as passionate words as these, and deliver'd
them in an Accent which was so full of grace and concern, that I easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
what inspir'd them, and from whence they came. <hi>Ventidius</hi> had no
sooner ended speaking, than I told him: If after those miseries the cruel
gods have impos'd on me, I have found sufficient fortitude to outlive them,
I deriv'd it principally, perhaps intirely, from my concerns in the generous
<hi>Ventidius;</hi> and if since my torments began I have relish'd any thing of joy,
I attest the gods, 'twas only by reflecting on my success for him, which has
been as proportionate to my desires, as to his. Yes (my <hi>Ventidius) Vdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia</hi>
sets that value on you which you have ambitioned, and if by my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
character she has assum'd such an esteem of you, judge then what it will
rise unto, when she sees your person, and has heard the charms of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation? Ah <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) I apprehend you have been
so much more my Friend than Nature and Education has, that to continue
in the blessing of her esteem, I must live in it by your character, and to
continue that felicity, I must deny my self the other of seeing her. If this
(I reply'd) be your fears, you have not many hours Travel to clear them;
but certainly you could not have so good an opinion of <hi>Udozia,</hi> if you had
so ill an one of her judgment. 'Twas in such discourses as these that we
entertain'd one another till our entring into <hi>Tharsus,</hi> where that necessary
formal Civility for awhile deny'd us a privacy, which, as soon as we enjoy'd,
<hi>Ventidius</hi> employ'd a part of it, to tell me those admirable vicissitudes of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96335:176"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> State, in the victories and death of <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> which latter,
though the Conspirators believ'd would either have restor'd the <hi>Roman</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or made them Lords of it, yet they had fail'd of both, and the event
did manifest there was more difficulty in making the <hi>Romans</hi> assume their
freedom, than there had been in making them lay it down. That the gods
had evinc'd how they disrelish'd the spilling of that great Mans Blood, not
only by depriving the Actors in it of that end they promis'd themselves,
but by bringing all those to an untimely death, which had brought <hi>Caesar</hi>
to one.</p>
               <p>He further acquainted me, how that after the defeat and death
of <hi>Crassus,</hi> he found little opposition to be General in his stead, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to raise an Army to revenge the <hi>Roman</hi> honour and loss; and though
the Command was of a quality which might have rais'd desires of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it in the most recluse spirits, yet he had only sought and embrac'd it,
but to have a handsomer way to make his Addresses, and a more powerful
one, to revenge my wrongs; That therefore he had procur'd from <hi>Mark
Anthony, Octavius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> (who then compos'd the second Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate)
a full liberty not only to revenge on <hi>Artabazus</hi> the violating of
that League <hi>Anexander</hi> had concluded with the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but also if
he esteem'd it requisite, to make that Revenge a dethroning of him, and
establishing in his room such an <hi>Armenian</hi> Prince, as he was confident would
have honesty enough to value that virtue above interest: That this power
he had the more easily obtain'd, because the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> by marrying
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> had declar'd herself as much an Enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> as to me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the apparent Successor of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the Senate were justly jealous of
uniting that Crown with the <hi>Parthian:</hi> That too he had the earnestlier
ambition'd this, because that forfeiture of <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s gave me a right to
<hi>Armenia</hi> by my birth, which a <hi>Roman</hi> Army would so confirm, that he would
find in injuring <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> he had as much wrong'd his interest, as his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</p>
               <p>The gods forbid (I reply'd, interrupting him) that you should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your Arms so unjustly, and that I should for my Kings crimes, do any
thing but lament them; besides (generous <hi>Ventidius</hi>) had <hi>Artabazus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his right (which I know he cannot, being answerable for his Actions
to none but the gods) yet still the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> has a Title as firm, as
my resolution not to oppose it: For to be Wife to <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and Friend to
<hi>Rome,</hi> are not inconsistent; and we have examples, that the Conjugal and
Regal rights, are not so incompatible, but they may jointly subsist. But were
they not, I am so far from divesting her of her Empire, that had I that of
the World, I would prostrate it, as I did my Liberty at her feet, and esteem
the Title of her Subject, and the visible effects of so transcendent a Virtue
and Government, a far higher satisfaction, than to take the Reins of it into
my own hands: That since I had neither the power nor the will any other
way to revenge my self on the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> than by manifesting my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
I was confident the declining so large an Empire to maintain her
right after such insensible injuries, would fully do it; and the knowledge
of her fault, would in some degree repair it.</p>
               <p>I further implor'd <hi>Ventidius,</hi> That the <hi>Armenians</hi> for <hi>Udozia</hi>'s sake, might
avoid a storm, which perhaps their King had deservedly drawn upon them;
and that the greater his Title was to their destruction, the greater would
that mercy appear which declin'd acting it. I too well observe (<hi>Ventidius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd)
that you are born under a Monarchy, by giving Sanctuary to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in the Title of the Offender, and making his quality annih<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>late his
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96335:177"/>
crimes, which aggravates them: for faults in Kings are more unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than in others, since they have so great influence over all, and since
those can hardly punish offences which commit them. We that are Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
allow no Sanctuary but to Virtue, and esteem it too troublesome a
respect to put the Gods to punish, what we our selves have the Power:
Besides, their goodness is so transcendent, that 'tis often an invitation to
Princes and Magistrates to relie on it; but they seldom do err when the
punishment and the sin are inseparable, and when those they wrong are
to be their Judges. That Kings do publish they are to give an accompt
of their actions to none but the Gods, is not a greater Tyranny in them,
than imbecility in such as either believe it, or grant it. The giving them
that Power, is to encourage them to be Tyrants, by having no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on them not to be so, but what they impose on themselves; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we Romans, though we leave our Governours a latitude to shew they
are virtuous, yet we also leave our selves one to punish them, if they
prove otherwise; and indeed wise men will avoid such temptations, and
perhaps few that are so will give it them: Besides, you that subject your
selves to a successive Monarchy, are tyed to your Rulers as to your Fate,
you must submit to the bad as well as to the good; whereas we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to ours but as to our Cloaths, if they are sullied, unfit, or worn
out, we make our selves new ones: You at best have but the bare word
of a Woman for your Governours, we the word of Virtue for ours: You
by making Blood a sufficient Title to Rule, invite them to dulness and
vice; We by making Desert the way unto it, necessitate them to Virtue
and Merit: You by trusting the Power to one, run a hazard which we
avoid; for there needs but imbecility, or corruption in one, to ruine
all; but we trusting to divers, many a one must be weak, and perfidious,
to create our misfortunes; and none being absolute, 'tis Reason, and not
Power, which forms our results and actions. To omit many other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminencies,
Commonwealths are not subject to Personal Vices, as Lust,
Avarice, Luxury, Inconstancy and Cruelty. That there is (I reply'd) a
necessity of a Supreme Power in all Governments, to whom final appeals
and resolutions are to be left, (to avoid perpetual disputes and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties)
is not more true, than that Power is absolutely best invested in
a Monarch; which to evince, I shall desire you but to reflect on the
greatest States and Empires that were, or are, and you shall find, 'twas
from the virtue of one Man they had their Beginning or Laws. <hi>Moses</hi>
made those of the Jews; <hi>Lycurgus</hi> those of <hi>Sparta; Solon</hi> those of <hi>Athens,</hi>
(though indeed of short duration;) <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Empire of <hi>Babylon; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>
that of the <hi>Parthians; Alexander</hi> that of the <hi>Grecians; Cyrus</hi> that
of the <hi>Persians;</hi> and to omit many others, <hi>Romulus</hi> that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
'tis a Maxim as general as true, That what creates, is the best of perfect
and preserve. Neither when Monarchy was banisht from <hi>Rome,</hi> was there
any mutation in the Monarchical Laws, but the change of perpetual
Kings into annual Consuls: 'Tis too, no small manifestation that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
is the best Form, seeing 'tis the Government of Heaven: Besides, that
which is the most desirable and seldomest found in Aristocracies, Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
and Democracies, is almost inseparable from Monarchy, which is,
an internal quiet that proceeds from a general submission to one Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which is that, which gives a power and ability to defend or enlarge
a State; whereas in Republicks the greatest and commonest aim is to make
many an Individual what a King is already; or else eternal differences
between the Nobility and People, or among each other, if either has
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96335:177"/>
supprest the other: Besides, in a Commonwealth a Man is seldom famous
without Envy, nor lov'd without Fear, those very actions which evince
him to be capable of serving a State, rendering it dangerous for that State
to be served by him; so that to be esteemed well, one must not deserve
too well, and a great Merit is as usual a Title to Ruine or Banishment, as
it ought to be to Reward. But in Monarchies, the Prince is above those
fears, and consequently not only leaves a latitude, but gives an invitation
to the highest Merits and Actio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, by rendring them acceptable, and not
dangerous duties: It is evident also that there ought to be a Supreme
above the Law, for what invitation have those to preserve That, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they can neither commit an offence, nor deserve a punishment?
whereas a Monarch, besides the Obligation of Trust, the Laws are not
only that which gives him the Power, but that too which maintains him
in it, by being as it were his Guard, in making Death the Reward of all
attempts against his Person or Authority; so that he is likelier to preserve
the Laws which receives a benefit by them, than he which can receive no
prejudice but from them; and to give the Power to those who must live
under it, is in effect to invite them to favour themselves; to let the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
too be Judges whether the Dispencers of the Law do it equally, is to
give them a latitude to destroy those Laws which should govern them;
since the greater part of People conclude the less, and the greater part of
all Nations are the worst. Besides, it makes a Judge apprehensive to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
the Laws without partiality, when those he gives his Sentence
upon, are those who must pronounce his, and so, often, out of hope of
a mutual lenity, mutually prove unjust. But it may be objected, The
People will not repine at the executing those Laws to which they have
assented, or which they themselves have constituted. To this I answer,
Those Laws which are propos'd, are commonly so equal in themselves,
that none can decline his assent unto them, without publishing he intends
to violate them, which were an antedated folly no rational Creature
would be guilty of; and those too, which give their Votes to the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Laws, are then commonly clear of those crimes, which those Laws
are made against; so that what they assent unto a first out of shame, or
innocence, when yet they incur the penalty of those Institutions, they
wish they had never been made; and indeed the People are far better
pleas'd to make severe Laws, than to have them observ'd; since the first
of these is an excellent demonstration of their goodness, and their unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
resolution of continuing it; and in the last, they cannot divest
themselves of Nature, which violently inclines all men to a self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the highest, and first principle. To let the Supreme Trustees of
the People be subject to be call'd unto accompt, is the certain'st way to
make them Tyrants, since the apprehension of punishment induces all Men
to act what may secure them from it; and if they have done any thing
amiss, either by design, frailty or ignorance, it invites them to invest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with a Power which may defend them from Ruine, and thereby,
the acting of one Injustice, renders the acting of a greater necessary; as
Thieves, who out of apprehension of having their Theft reveal'd and
punisht, add unto it Murther; and as your <hi>Catiline,</hi> who told his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
That the Ills they had done, could not be secur'd but by acting
greater: Whereas the Monach being above those apprehensions, if he
commit a fault, he needs not run into that necessary wickedness, but is
rather oblig'd by so noble a priviledge, to repair it by some generous
actions, which may render him worthy of it. Besides, 'tis seldom that a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96335:178"/>
Commonwealth is grateful to a deserving Man, which is not only a large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring
of any from being so, but also as large an invitation if he be so, to
pay himself; was there ever a People more beholding to Men, than the
<hi>Romans</hi> were to <hi>Camillus,</hi> and <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio;</hi> the first for resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Roman</hi> State to the <hi>Roman</hi> People, when not only in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
he might have made himself Lord of it, but even when they were so
low reduced, that there were hardly enough Senators left to give him a
Commission to serve them, and when he had been us'd at a rate, which
might have clouded his Ambition with the name of a just Revenge: And
the last of these, for not only preserving the <hi>Roman</hi> State, but by adding
to it as great a one; yet their returns were such, that if a Stranger had
but known their usage, and not their actions, he would have esteem'd them
the destroyers, not the restorers of their Countrey. These two are not the
only, though the most famous examples; <hi>Marcus Livins, Caius Martius Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus,
Lucius Amilius,</hi> the Asiatick <hi>Scipio,</hi> and such a vast Catalogue of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that 'twere much the more difficult task to name who they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
unto, than to whom they were not. Neither is this Vice the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
one to the Republick of <hi>Rome,</hi> but common to that Government. The
<hi>Syracusians</hi> were the like to <hi>Dion,</hi> and <hi>Hermocrates;</hi> The <hi>Spartans</hi> to <hi>Agis,</hi>
and part of his Family; and, as some have thought, to <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> The <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi>
to <hi>Pansanius</hi> his first Virtues, and Victories; which, it may be,
made him think, Vice was the Virtue, by their ingratitude to the latter; and
the <hi>Athenians</hi> to <hi>Themistocles, Pericles, Cimon, Alcibiades, Aristides, Phocion</hi> and
<hi>Miltiades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtless the example of these, inspir'd <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> with
those designs of rewarding themselves, and of making the People grateful
against their wills. And what King form <hi>Romulus</hi> to <hi>Lucius Tarquin,</hi> did ever
spill so much <hi>Roman</hi> blood, and fill'd <hi>Rome</hi> with such disorders, as those two
did in disputing for that Title: Neither did all the Kings empty so many
<hi>Roman</hi> veins to maintain their name, as <hi>Caesar</hi> did to restore it, and <hi>Pompey</hi>
to hinder it. Is it not then irrational to spend more in resisting Monarchy,
than can be lost by it? The same <hi>Caesar</hi> doth both wayes evince this truth,
for till he won the Crown, the storms were not greater, than the calms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. Besides, what you told me of the <hi>Romans</hi> being now under a Triple
Monarchy (for so I account the Triumvirat) palpably manifests, that that
Form of Government they have found by experience is the most perfect;
for the Conspirators by killing of <hi>Caesar,</hi> so clearly left them their voices,
that their election of Monarchy evinces 'tis their choice, and not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
Their Banishment of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> was evidently as much an action
of choler, as this of premeditation, so that I may say, they did then but
lose their way into Aristocracy. If too the <hi>Roman</hi> actions are to be credited
before their professions, we find they are absolutely convinc'd, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of One is the best; for seldom was there any thing of danger in
the Commonwealth, but they immediately created a Dictator, who is an
absolute Monarch for the time being, and to whom the very Senate and
People, do absolutely resign themselves, as appears by <hi>Camillus,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to relieve <hi>Rome,</hi> as she had agreed for, and was paying for his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to <hi>Brennus</hi> King of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> he brake off the Bargain; and
that barbarous Prince taxing him for violating an Agreement made
by his Superiors: He reply'd, That being Dictator, he had none but
the gods, and acted accordingly; and to evince 'twas the Truth,
and not the Success, which made the <hi>Romans</hi> approve of <hi>Camillus</hi>'s
Reply, <hi>Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> when Dictator, in that Quality, not only
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96335:178"/>
degraded <hi>Minutius</hi> from his Consulship, but constrains him to be a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
over those Legions, the <hi>Equians</hi> had worsted under his command.
Five times was that great <hi>Camillus</hi> in resembling dangers, created Dictator,
and I believe his, and <hi>Cincinnatus</hi>'s happy conduct, gave the people no ill
relish of Monarchical Government. The Military Tribunes, and Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virs,
though instituted by the people, were of no constant, or long durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as alwayes finding that Government which was farthest from Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
the most confus'd; this made the Consulary Dignity, and Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
of longest continuance. Two illustrations of this are very pregnant;
the first was in the institution of the Dictatorship, which proceeded from
the revolt of the <hi>Veians,</hi> and <hi>Fidenates,</hi> who having cut in pieces a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and they desiring revenge, created four Tribunes with
Consular Authority, and sent three of them to this War, who through Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Variance, did nothing considerable, but that they did nothing
which was so; upon which, the <hi>Romans</hi> finding the error of this Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical
Generalship, immediately created <hi>Mamercus</hi> Dictator, who almost
as immediately revenged their losses and wrongs; the other is, of <hi>Quintus</hi>
and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who being both sent against the <hi>Equians,</hi> the latter was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o much
a Friend to Truth above Ambition, that he desir'd <hi>Quintus</hi> might go alone,
since no great Affairs could ever be perform'd, without the Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
were invested in one: And if you observe it, <hi>Rome</hi> never obtain'd
such Victories as under a single General, and never receiv'd such losses as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a plural; which fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st as clearly appears, besides those famous examples
of <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> in <hi>Posthumius</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Regillus,</hi> in <hi>Cincinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
in <hi>Caesar,</hi> and in <hi>Pompey,</hi> who both triumph'd over <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and
<hi>Africk;</hi> the latter also being chosen single to defend the <hi>Roman</hi> liberty,
when Consuls were not only in being, but in Authority; as the last does, in
the examples of <hi>Fabius the Great</hi> and <hi>Minutius,</hi> in <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Paulus Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
at that fatal Battel of <hi>Cannes,</hi> in <hi>Marcellus</hi> &amp; <hi>Crispinus,</hi> in <hi>Gellius</hi> &amp; <hi>Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
and to omit many others, so recently in <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius;</hi> neither has
this been a particular fate to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, but to all others who have
practic'd the like Discipline; as the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>
commanded against the Tyrant <hi>Agathocles;</hi> to <hi>Asdrubal</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax,</hi>
when they commanded against <hi>Scipio;</hi> to the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
War, first under <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who did nothing jointly, and all
things asunder (as in discourse, two Negatives make one Affirmative, so in
War two good Generals makes one ill one) afterwards in the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
under <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes;</hi> and the State of <hi>Athens</hi> obtaining
that famous Victory of <hi>Marathon,</hi> must not be attributed to the ten Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
but to the ten Generals having the judgment which the <hi>Athenians</hi>
wanted, of giving the sole power to the only <hi>Miltiades.</hi> The same misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
attended <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Fleet, when jointly commanded by <hi>Polinus</hi> and
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> against the <hi>Romans,</hi> which latter found sufficiently the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Commonwealth, the <hi>Hannoan</hi> Faction in <hi>Carthage</hi> fighting against
him, more than the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and had he been King of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
he had doubtless been the like of <hi>Rome;</hi> so that if <hi>Rome</hi> affect an Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,
'tis perhaps more out of Gratitude than Reason, neither can I omit
(to illustrate what I affirm) two remarkable Adventures: The first, when
the <hi>Latins</hi> came to re-invest <hi>Lucius Tarquin,</hi> in his Thronne, the <hi>Romans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
nothing could oppose a Monarch, but a Monarchical General, gave
the sole command of that great day to <hi>Posthumius,</hi> who gave them the
Victory: The other was, when <hi>Torquatus</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> were Consuls, and
fought a furious Battel against the same People, the latter to obtain the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96335:179"/>
Victory, devoted himself to a voluntary death, as if the gods had destin'd
it to a Monarchical Generalship, and deny'd it to a Democratical. Besides,
in Commonwealths, the giving of none the Superiority, gives all a desire
of it, and makes that every ones hope, by being no bodies possession; so
that those Abilities and Courages which in a Monarchy manifest and vent
themselves, for the increasing the State, in other Governments, are employ'd
to possess it; I confess indeed that there must be many weak or perfidious,
to ruine a Commonwealth, but then there needs but one able and honest
to preserve a Kingdom; which proves, that to make your happiness, you
must have many blest with those virtues, which one needs but have, to
make ours; so that, as much as 'tis more likely to have one able and
honest man than many, so much 'tis more likely that Monarchy should be
a better Government than a Republick. Neither are Commonwealths free
from personal faults, for never was any King more cruel, avaritious, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, than <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Carthage;</hi> and though the Body of the People
are exempt from some particular Vices, only because they are inconsistent
with many, and inherent to one, or perhaps their not knowing them, or not
having the power and means to act them, yet those that govern, being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
are not at all free from them; and that which was the pretence of
depressing Monarchy in <hi>Rome,</hi> was the real cause of depressing the Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virs,
for 'twas but the Son of the King acted the Rape on <hi>Lucretia;</hi> but
'twas <hi>Appius Clodius</hi> in person, and a Decemvir that would have acted that
of <hi>Virginia,</hi> had not her death reliev'd her misfortune. It was (doubtless)
too, the justice of the gods to shew the People that sin in a Governor,
which they had so severely punish'd but in a Governors son. As to our being
necessitated to take a womans word for our Kings, if there be any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in it, you must except not against us, but the gods, who have made
them witnesses in their own Cause; yet that great Trust invites them to a
proportionate virtue, and 'tis also the onely proof you have at <hi>Rome,</hi> of
that so ador'd Title of Patrician.</p>
               <p>That there is (<hi>Ventidius</hi> reply'd) a necessity of a Power, to which all
final Appeals ought to be made, cannot be a greater T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uth, than it is, that
That Power is best plac'd in the Representatives of the People, since what
ever can be said, for the having it in a King, can be said for the having it in
Those Representatives, and much more also: For besides the high obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Trust, which is common to both, and indeed the chief, if not the
Onely upon Kings (at least if we credit what they say, That they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to none but the gods) That Authority is likelier to be careful
in making, and maintaining of Laws, to which they and their Posterities
must submit, than that Authority which is so far from receiving a prejudice
by ill Laws, that thereby it receives an Advantage; for the less the People
have, the more the King hath. Neither can the Law be more the Monarchs
Guard, than it is the Peoples; for as a King owes All he hath to the being
Above the Law, so the People owe All they have to their being under it;
so that Both deriving Both their All's from that Principle, 'tis likely the
Concern for maintaining it, will be equal; for though a King may lose
more in quality than any Individual in a Commonwealth, yet he cannot
lose more in quantity; for the greatest Loser, never knew a degree beyond
All; where All is lost, the disproportion may be in the losing, but cannot
be in the Loss.</p>
               <p>Neither has the aspiring of any Individual, more or oftner, involved
Commonwealths in War, than the same Passion in Subjects or next Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96335:179"/>
has involv'd Kingdoms; so that that fault is not produc'd by the ill
constitution of that Government, but by the ill inclinations of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; for where Ambition does Reign, those desire to do so who are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
by it, under either Government. And if those ills are unlikest to be
attempted, or acted, which are likest to meet with most opposition, then
doubtless the design of Usurping the Sovereignty, is less like to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
under the Government of a Commonwealth, than under that of a
Monarch; for if the intended Usurper have success against the Forces
of a King, he finds the People prepar'd to embrace that form of
Regiment; but though he have success against the Forces of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
he will find a new difficulty, in constraining the People
to submit to Monarchy; in one He is to destory but the Governor, but in
the other, the Governors and Government: The People too are much
more apt to fight in defence of Both of those, than in defence of One, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
their own concernment being in the Last, and but their Rulers in
the First Besides, Reason (the health of the mind) is much more satisfi'd the
Possessor of it should acquiesce in the certainty of having no Superior,
than run a hazard of that, to have no equal; so that 'tis the rational part
of man, which keeps him to the Government of a Commonwealth, and the
Passionate onely which makes him an Enemy to it; which evinces, that as
much as 'tis likelier that Reason should actuate Rational Creatures than
Passion, so much 'tis likelier that a Commonwealth should be quiet, than
disturb'd.</p>
               <p>I confess indeed, that you need but One exactly Wise and Honest, to
make your Government happy, and that we need Many to make ours so,
yet 'tis much probable that Choice should find Many Wise, and Honest,
than that Nature, or Education, should alwayes make the Eldest of One
Family to be so; to which be pleased to remember, the discovery of your
Governors Crimes, creates the trouble, but the discovery of ours, ends it.
I acknowledge Commonwealths have been ungrateful to deserving men,
but I cannot acknowledge, nor can you I am confident prove, that their
having been so, proceeded from their Form of Government. But because
you have instanc'd some Examples of their Ingratitude, lest thereby you
would cast that aspersion on the Government, which is due but to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
I will name some celebrated Kings who have been guilty of the
like Crime; that either thereby you may acknowledge the Error of such
a misdistinguishing, or else that I may make use of it to retort it on you,
and evidence by your own Arguing, that if the faults of Governors must
be ascribed to the Regiment, Monarchies therein are equal with Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</p>
               <p>The first instances, shall be in two Kings of the <hi>Iews</hi> (the Father and
the Son) whose Subjects do glory in being (as it were) the Menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the God they worship, and do owe the Institution and Progress
of their Government to Miracles; their names are <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon:</hi>
The one signal for the Sword of War, the other for the Sword of Peace:
The first a Man after their Deities own heart, and the last a Type of that
great Prince, their Prophets have so often foretold, and they so certainly
and intently expect; yet the former made one of his last injunctions to
his Son, the not permitting <hi>Ioab</hi>'s hoary head to go down in peace into the
Grave: <hi>Ioab,</hi> who (in effect) made <hi>David</hi> King, when he was not, and
kept him King, when he was; who would not take a Town till he came,
that he might have the honour as well as benefit of success; and <hi>Solomon</hi>
so well obey'd his King, or rather so truly Acted that Part, that <hi>Ioab</hi>'s life
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:96335:180"/>
which deserv'd an Altar, could not be secured even in the embracing of
one, but was there offer'd as a Sacrifice, to the obedience (at least) of
one of his Kings, and to the jealousie of another; some faults overballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
many services; the former writ in his Kings Heart, the latter in the
Air.</p>
               <p>Another instance is in <hi>Alexander</hi> surnamed <hi>the Great,</hi> as much perhaps
for his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uelty as Success; <hi>Calistines</hi> more justly famous than him, dyed
by him; <hi>Clytus,</hi> bolder for his King, than to him, yet did the like; <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi>
without whom he hardly got a Victory, and with whom he never lost
one, had the like Fate.</p>
               <p>In a word, this King destroy'd more gallant men of his friends, than of
his enemies. But yet since you have mentioned him for the Founder of so
great an Empire, as the <hi>Grecian,</hi> I shall desire you to observe who 'twas he
esteem'd fittest to Govern, and when it was he made that Declaration, or
rather Law; it was when death was forcing him from his Empire, and
and when his Queen <hi>Roxana</hi> was ready to present him with a Successor to
it: Yet even then he order'd, and seal'd it with his last breath, that the
worthiest only should bear that Title; evincing thereby, that he alone was
next to the Crown, that was so to him in virtue, not in blood; he found
he should injure truth, more than his posterity, if he allowed not virtue
the highest, nay the only Title to Government. An Action so every way
excellent, that if any thing could, this might have clear'd his Fame from
those stains, cast upon it, by the blood of <hi>Calistines,</hi> who, had he lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Commonwealth, the sincerity of his heart, and the eloquence of his
tongue, had engaged him in no more danger, than <hi>Cato's</hi> and <hi>Cicero's</hi> did
them whil'st under that Regiment; thier words and actions needing no
pardon under a Commonwealth, and finding none under a Monarchy; the
fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st dying, in appr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hension <hi>Caesar</hi> had too much clemency, and the last find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Antony</hi> had too little.</p>
               <p>Nor can you say it is peculiar to Commonwealths to be ungrateful to
their Soldiery, were there no more to illustrate the contrary, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Examples in the <hi>Iudaick,</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire; but the truth is,
all Authorities have been shie of their Soldiery, for since the Sword hath
introduced most Governments, since it does maintain all, and since it only
can ruine any Government, 'tis not so strange that Rulers are jeaous of
those which wear it, as it would be if they were not. As to what is so much
insisted upon, and so often mention'd of Prescription by Time, to prove a
Government just; that, to any rational person will appear, is not to uphold
Truth, but Power, which if illegitimately acquired, the longer the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
lasts, the greater the injustice is; for perseverance in ill, in any other
case, never turn'd ill into good, so that in this, 'tis granted as a Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
rather than a Right; besides, if any person under any Government,
declare he has a will to destroy it, he thereby gives that Government the
Right to destroy him. If then a Will in any particular to subvert a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
merits such a punishment, probably that Government will believe
a power to do it, deserves as much; for the Will in an Individual of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the Authority he is under, never created the Power, but the Power
hath often created the Will; so that if the lesser danger is esteem'd justly
punishable you may thereby judge what is concluded of the greater. It
hath been also not only the Maxim, but the practice of many Kings and
Commonwealths, to make a War, and seek the depression of a Neighbor
State, only because that State was increasing to a greatness which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96335:180"/>
theirs, and this, because a preventative care, has been allowed of as a
just one; so that if States, towards the preventing of a real or imaginary
danger, from those they have no Authority over; from those which have
not then the power to hurt them; and from those which perhaps may
never have the will, and who have not so much towards the ingendring of
it as the power, may justly according to the principles of Safety and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(the last being chiefly establish'd for the first) even by a hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
War suppress such, how much more will they believe it just, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
those, from whom a nearer and pregnanter jealousie doth arise, and
where the safety that performance presents and ascertains, is not derived
from the Rules of Policy, which makes Success Justice, but is derived from
the Rules of Authority, which makes the safety of the People, the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
Law, and those the best, if not the only Judges of that safety, who are
by the People entrusted with it.</p>
               <p>To all which may be added, that Maxim as General, as Wicked, and at
least as usual in Monarchies as Commonwealths, to hate what they fear, and
to depress what they hate. These, and a throng of such other Arguings,
the Craft, or rather Wickedness of Governors under either Regiment, have
establish'd as principles to destroy the generousest Calling; a Calling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they could do nothing, and for which they seldom do any
thing; sometimes they make the prosperity of it necessary to the existence
of a State, and sometimes the destruction of it as necessary; sometimes
they say it hinders, or revenges oppression; and sometimes it invites, and
continues it; sometimes they make it a Scaffold, to raise their structure to
the Clouds; then use it like a Scaffold, and lay it in the dust. These last
words I spake, to evince the most noble, is the most unfortunate profession;
it sowes merit, and reaps ingratitude; yet the knowledge of the last, has
never frighted the generous followers of it from the first; perhaps prove,
that what would deter in all other professions, is the encouragement of
theirs; and that true virtue, unlike material things, the less'tis fed, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it grows.</p>
               <p>I hope by this time you are satisfi'd, That ingratitude to gallant men
which are Soldiers (for unto such only as I remember you have proved
Commonwealths have been ungrateful) is not a sin inherent to that Go|
vernment
alone, but unto all Regiments. I must confess, if to Govern ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by one, is good, it is chiefly so in an Army; for not only where the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power is divided, the affection of the Soldiery is so; and where Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is,
Ruine is not far off; but also the greatest Actions of War, depend
so intirely on the embracing of opportunities, that whil'st two are dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a thing, the time of acting it is expir'd. Besides, 'tis a rare felicity to
have two in supreme Power, so much friends to their Duty above their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
as for the first, intirely to silence the last; and rarer to have them
both blest with what we call, presence of mind, in the highest, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singst
dangers, and actions, and equally invested with it; for if there be but
the least disproportion in that essential virtue to Generals, it may be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
and destructive, as if that difference were in an extreme. But after
all this, I cannot but remember you, that as our plural Generalship in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
is order'd, where every day one of them commands in chief by turns,
there is little hazard to the Commonwealth, and less advantage to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of it: But because you have instanced some signal losses we have
sustained under a double Generalship, lest you might too ascribe it to that
form of Ruling an Army, I will only mind you of a couple of as eminent
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96335:181"/>
Victories as ever <hi>Rome</hi> was happy in, purchas'd under that sort of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralship.</p>
               <p>The one under <hi>Marcus Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Quintilius Varrus,</hi> in a furious Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
in the County of the <hi>Insubrians,</hi> where the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> not only lost
the Victory, but what was more deplor'd, and more justly so by them, even
the generous <hi>Mago,</hi> Brother to their great <hi>Hannibal</hi> both in blood, and in
virtue.</p>
               <p>The other, under <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Livius,</hi> on the famous Banks of <hi>Metaurus,</hi>
which River chang'd its colour as much with <hi>Carthaginian</hi> blood, as ever
<hi>Aufidus</hi> did with <hi>Roman;</hi> there the Noble <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> a true Son of <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars,</hi>
found his Fate, and the Manes of above 50000 <hi>Italians</hi> were appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
did resign their solitary Walks to those <hi>Africans,</hi> which had sent them
thither; there the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> glory was first eclips'd, and the <hi>Roman</hi>
prosperity breaking through so thick a cloud of blood, was never hinder'd
from shining by another. Not to let the Trustees of the People be call'd
by them to an account, lest thereby, if they have err'd, they should defend
their Crimes by Arms, is like killing ones self, for fear of being kill'd; the
highest Tyranny, cannot transcend, what this way the People give, to avoid
Tyranny. Indeed by such a Donation, Trustees may be hinder'd from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
because they are elevated above the Law; and where there is no Law,
there is no Sin, but the People will not be thereby hinder'd from Ruine,
but theirs will be rather ascertain'd and accelerated; for if both Honesty
and Fear, will not deter Governors from ill Governing, certainly Honesty
alone is much unlikelier to do it; and if they will be Tyrants against the
Law, they will be much more above it. 'Tis true, the Title of Patrician is
in high veneration at <hi>Rome,</hi> and one of our Consuls is to be of that order;
but yet though we take the word of a Woman for his being a Patrician, yet
we take the word of Virtue for his being a Consul; the former makes him
electable, but the latter makes him elected. But (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>)
why do I tell you (and so confusedly) our opinions, when I only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to tell you our actions? Not to continue this fault, though we had
several of this quality, yet I will relate no more of them, to obtain your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for having particulariz'd so many.</p>
               <p>For conclusion of all, I told <hi>Ventidius,</hi> that I was confident he had argued
against Monarchy more for his diversion, than as 'twas his judgment, were
it for no other reason, than that he persuaded me to be a King, which if he
esteem'd an ill, I knew he would never have invited me to.</p>
               <p>If (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) I invite you to be a King, 'tis not only that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi>
have unreluctantly submitted to that Government, and that you
have now every way the justest Title to it; (for as to that which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for <hi>Altezeera,</hi> that the tyes of Marriage and Empire are not so insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but she may severally act the duties of both, I must answer, That
where there is on the one side, but a possibility of an advantage; and on
the other, an appearance of a vast prejudice, it is inconsistent with the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
of State, in expectation of the former, not to prevent the latter) but
also that I esteem no form of Government so bad, but to change it by a War
is worse; and that where the Governor is good, the Government will be
so. At last <hi>Ventidius</hi> found himself in no small perplexity by my unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
resolution of usurping neither upon my Kings, nor my Princesses rights;
for at his departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> he had so clearly satisfi'd the Triumvirat,
and especially <hi>Mark Antony</hi> (to whom <hi>Asia</hi> was alotted) that they both
had lost theirs, the better to invest me in them, that he much apprehended,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:96335:181"/>
if after having demonstrated the danger of <hi>Artabazus</hi> possessing the Crown
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s continuing the right to it, he permitted both,
it might prove of ill consequence, and either leave the <hi>Roman</hi> Lords an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
that he was careless of his Trust, or intended some sinister end by
so palpable an omission. I must confess, I found as much reason in his fears,
as in that resolve of mine which created them; but hoping whil'st we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
at <hi>Sattala,</hi> we might find out some expedient for their redress, or that
if we could not, yet his leaving <hi>Armenia</hi> in quiet, would not only be more
probably, but better effected by the intreaties of a Mistriss, than a friend, I
desir'd him to suspend all determinations till we came thither, towards
which next morning we intended to go; and because <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s leaving
his Army (and leaving it too so unaccompany'd) might not relish of any
thing but his care of it, he assembled his chiefest Officers, and told them,
He was to make a short journey which would exempt them from a long
one; that he was hopeful by a private interview with <hi>Artabazus,</hi> and my
assistance, to make the <hi>Armenians</hi> more useful to <hi>Rome,</hi> than they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n entire conquest of them; that upon these hopes he must leave
them for a few dayes; and that his absence might not retard their march,
he order'd them to continue it, till they came to <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> since if there
were a necessity of subjecting <hi>Armenia</hi> in their way to <hi>Parthia,</hi> their seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
passing by it, would render <hi>Artabazus</hi> more secure, and manifest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they had a strong belief of his returning to the <hi>Roman</hi> friendship,
since in a confidence of it, they had march'd beside his Kingdom, when
they might have invaded it; <hi>Ventidius</hi> further told them, That the entry
into <hi>Armenia</hi> out of <hi>Syria</hi> by the mountain <hi>Imanus,</hi> was less difficult, than
to enter it out of <hi>Cilicia</hi> by the mountain <hi>Scordiscus;</hi> that 'twas better to
try moderate wayes, than extremes: and lastly, they should not move from
<hi>Alexandretta,</hi> where in 14 dayes he would not fail to meet them. The deep
respect all <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Officers paid him, and the just opinion they had of his
sincerity and judgment, made them perfectly relish this motion, which they
had no sooner declar'd, than taking some light <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse for his
Guard, we went to <hi>Sattala,</hi> with as much secresie, as expedition; whither
as soon as we were come, and lighted at <hi>Udozia</hi>'s Palace, I perceiv'd that
great mans countenance and discourse, so sensible an alteration, that had I
not experimentally known those violent emotions which are inseparable
from perfect Lovers at their approach near their Mistrisses, I should have as
much admir'd at, as I was satisfi'd with them; but these confusions hardly
merited that name, if compar'd to those which succeeded them as soon as
he saw <hi>Udozia,</hi> who came to meet him in the great Hall of the Palace, and
who participated in no small degree in his disorders; but truly hers were
such, that methought they perform'd something near to a Miracle, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an accession to her beauty, which the generous <hi>Roman</hi> was so justly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
with, that his wonder spoke his passion more significantly, than any
expressions were capable of; but as soon as he found his too-much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and silence, might intrench upon his civility, he went towards <hi>Udozia</hi>
with a grace and majesty peculiar to the only <hi>Ventidius;</hi> and having with
a deep respect kist the bottom of her gown, he told her, That freedom,
Madam, which without dispute I have long since yielded to your Picture, I
am now purposely come to pay you, whose Power perhaps could not more
transcendently manifest it self, than by conquering a <hi>Romans</hi> liberty by a
shadow, as far short too of the charming substance, as all other reall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are short of it. But if the Copy infus'd a high flame, judge then what
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96335:182"/>
the transcendent Original has done, and judge I beseech you Madam of
mine, only by that Rule, since nothing can equal the vastness of my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but the vastness of that beauty which has created it, which former
shall be as infinite in the duration, as that which gave it a being is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
This Compliment could not be fuller of Passion, than the answer
to it was of Civility, which I pass over as being nothing essential to that
Story you have enjoin'd me to tell you; but yet though I omit the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of this first interview, I must not the acquainting you, that as soon as
I had brought <hi>Ventidius</hi> to his Apartment, I retir'd with <hi>Udozia</hi> to hers,
where I told her at large, how absolutely her servant had offer'd me the
Crown of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and how as absolutely I had declin'd it: <hi>Udozia</hi> was
infinitely more satisfi'd that I had refus'd it, than that I had the power to
wear it; and gave me such handsom retributions for the former, that I found
there might be as great a reward for having been virtuous, as in being so:
but knowing how much higher an influence an ador'd Mistriss has over a
Lover, than any other confinement is capable of, I conjur'd her, as I did tye
my self from doing <hi>Artabazus</hi> any harm, that she would <hi>Ventidius,</hi> and give
as good an account of her servant, as I would of her Brother; <hi>Udozia</hi> at
first made some scruples to implore from <hi>Ventidius</hi> what he had obliquely
deny'd me, since it would evince she thought she had a power over him,
which she very much doubted she had not; but yet at last she determin'd
to do <hi>Armenia</hi> a considerable service, or by hazarding so sensible a disgrace
as a repulse would amount unto, manifest she apprehended nothing more
than not obliging her Countrey, and nothing at all, when the safety of it,
came in competition with any thing else: 'Twas therefore some three hours
after, being inform'd <hi>Ventidius</hi> was gone to divert himself in the Palace
Gardens, that <hi>Udozia,</hi> arm'd with such generous and publick thoughts, went
thither to him, waited on by none but me, where after a short search, we
perceiv'd him lying upon some Grass, shaded with Lemmon, and Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Trees; and truly he was so intent on what he was doing, as we percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that was the viewing <hi>Udozia</hi>'s Picture, before he saw her, which as soon
as he did, he rose up surpriz'd, and told her, I have been, Madam, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together the Charms of my first and second Vanquisher, and find the
disproportion so transcendent, that I have no way to excuse my first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
but to remember I made it to a Conqueror, who though she made
not use of such unresistable Arms as my second, yet she did of her name. If
(said <hi>Udozia</hi>) I esteem'd it not a higher wrong to the generous <hi>Ventidius,</hi>
to believe so small a beauty as <hi>Udozia</hi>'s could captivate him, than not to
credit what he has so often repeated, I would not conjure him by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
to evince a truth, which he cannot be more concern'd to make
me believe, than I am to have pregnant cause to do it. Ah Madam (said
<hi>Ventidius</hi>) I shall acknowledge your furnishing me with an occasion to
manifest so high, and just a truth, to be as transcendent an obligation, as 'tis
an impossibility and cruelty, if the way you propound unto that end, be by
merit or time; neither can such injunctions be more a torment to me, than
an injury to your Beauty. I have already (said <hi>Udozia</hi>) told you I am
so much concern'd in believing what you endeavor to persuade me, that I
shall not so long protract my own satisfaction, as to prescribe any length of
time to confirm it; nor so flatter my self, and wrong the generous <hi>Ventidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
as to motion merit in that sense he seems to do it; that which I have to
propound, is of a quality, which if he will grant it, 'twill take up no more
time than to say he does so.</p>

Oh gods! (reply'd the impatient <hi>Ventidius</hi>) the highest favor next to
finding out so obliging an expedient, is immediately to name it. 'Tis (said
<hi>Udozia</hi>) to pardon <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s and <hi>Armenia</hi>'s fault, which perhaps the
necessity they were both reduc'd unto by <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s activeness, and <hi>Crassus</hi>'s
remissness, may in some degree extenuate; or if both those do not, yet still
in the Concession I shall find the greater proof of what I am not a little
concern'd to be convinc'd of.</p>
               <p>Would to the gods, fair Princess, <hi>Ventidius</hi> reply'd, their Faults were as
great, as the Power she has over me, which commands me to excuse them, I
should the sooner do it, since thereby the greatness of the proof of the
truth, would be the more proportionate to the truth itself: Yes, Madam, I
do absolutely forget them; and though I know of how vast prejudice it
may be to me to disobey the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet I know 'twill be of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more, to disobey the fair <hi>Udozia,</hi> for whom the reason that I should
eternally obey her, cannot transcend the inclination which I have perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to do it.</p>
               <p>The generous <hi>Ventidius</hi> (I reply'd) shall not run any hazard to obey
<hi>Udozia;</hi> and though I am much concern'd in my King, and my Countrey,
yet I am much more my Friend, so that I determine immediate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to make
a journey to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> who, if he gives you not a rise to oblige him, and
such an one too, as may apologize sufficiently for your doing so, you shall
not hazard your destruction, to manifest your civility.</p>
               <p>All (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) I will desire, since he is in the blessing of fair
<hi>Udozia</hi>'s concern, is, that he will not, by being an Enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
me to disobey her commands, or after such a provocation, by not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, render my self unworthy to have been honor'd with them. But (he
continu'd) is there no other way, but by <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s absence, to settle
<hi>Armenia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, (I reply'd) I believe mine will accelerate this great work better
than any others. 'Twere to be too prolix, to tell you <hi>Udozia</hi>'s retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and mine to <hi>Ventidius,</hi> with his civilities on them: I will therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquaint you, that being ready to take horse, I recommended the care
of <hi>Ventidius</hi> to <hi>Udozia,</hi> and enjoin'd her so to use her Prisoner, that he
might have no desires of altering that name; <hi>Ventidius</hi> answer'd me for
her, 'twas impossible she should deny me that request, since 'twas so, that he
should ever desire a more noble Title. Then (after having beg'd me to
tell <hi>Artabazus</hi> from him, that for some powerful considerations, he would
desire no greater pennance for his past fault, than to repeat it, which was,
to continue a Neuter) I began my journey, which prov'd not very long,
because above my expectation, I found the King at <hi>Cammona,</hi> whither the
necessity of his Affairs, by the intelligence of <hi>Ventidius</hi> being on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
drew him; all the Court admir'd at my coming to it, and <hi>Artabazus</hi>
when he saw me come into the Palace Garden, (where he was then walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with some of his Council) was as much surpriz'd one way, as after I
had told him the occasion of my visit, he was the other. He made me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
excuses for the necessity of his Crime, (for so he term'd what he had
done with <hi>Altezeera</hi>) and with as many embraces, acknowledg'd my care,
and my affection, when (as he said) he was so far from meriting either,
that he did the contrary.</p>
               <p>In a word, after I had told him on what terms he might have <hi>Ventidius</hi>
his friend, not only (with raptures of joy) he condescended to them,
but by a Letter to him, acknowledg'd he had twice deriv'd both his safety,
and his Crown, from his generosity to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> and friendship to <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:96335:183"/>
As soon as I had thus setled my business to my Kings liking, as well as
<hi>Ventidius</hi>'s, (for the latter could not more joyfully embrace the occasion
offerving <hi>Udozia,</hi> than the former did the friendship of the <hi>Romans,</hi> against
whom he was so ill provided, by the absence and discontents of <hi>Phanasder,</hi>
and, as he said, of <hi>Artavasdes</hi> too, that he was determin'd to have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their mercy, to avoid doing so to their force) I took leave of the
King, without letting him know how I had refus'd that Title, or imploring
his justice against <hi>Crassolis,</hi> who, I learnt, was still conceal'd, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
I thought had been a fruitless, and probably a prejudicial request.
<hi>Artabazus,</hi> who found me positively resolv'd to depart, seem'd to be as
much griev'd for my leaving him, as he had been pleas'd at the cause, and
the result of my visit; and to invite my continuance, he offer'd me large
advantages, amongst many others, that of commanding, during my life, the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Militia; yet this, as well as the rest, I entirely declin'd: for though
I thought nothing could dispense me from a general care of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and
the King of it, yet I esteem'd my wrongs might not only excuse my not
living at Court, but also my refusal of any Command which was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to my revenge on <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who, though he had by giving me my
life, thereby confin'd me to act nothing particularly against his, yet by his
having render'd it my torment, I esteem'd my self thereby not concluded
from ending it by his hands at the head of an Army; besides, I resolv'd
my self not a little disenfranchis'd from that obligation, by restoring him so
many considerable Prisoners after the Battel on the Banks of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and
by the care I had of his person before, and in it. 'Twas therefore that I
implor'd the King to excuse my not accepting a Command, which though
of infinite honour, yet was consider'd by me less out of that respect, than
from an assurance I thereby receiv'd, that he thought I was not his Enemy,
though he had given me the highest provocation to be so; which good
opinion he had contracted of me, I could not better merit, than by decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so advantageous an offer, to put my self in a far meaner condition for
his service, which I esteem'd my attending on <hi>Ventidius</hi> was, and would
prove, and for the doing of which, I humbly beg'd his permission. <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>
granted me my request, because I would not grant him his; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
again convinc'd my belief, that he would not be an Enemy to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
by many pregnant reasons, and by others, I took a final leave, and
with as great expedition in my return to <hi>Sattala,</hi> as in my going from it, I
safely arriv'd there, and found (during my absence) that <hi>Udozia</hi> had so
well discover'd her servants merit and perfections, that any intercession of
mine for him could not have been more just, than 'twas unnecessary. <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius</hi>
seem'd almost as much satisfied with the success of my journy, as with
my return; and finding by the former he could not make a longer resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at <hi>Sattala,</hi> without as largely intrenching on his honour, as by his
abandoning it, he should on his felicity, he declar'd the next morning he
intended to force himself from his joyes, to return to his Army. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
and my former observation, made me esteem it as fit, as I did believe
it would not be difficult, to obtain an assurance from <hi>Udozia,</hi> that when
<hi>Ventidius</hi> did crown himself with Lawrel, she would with Myrtles, and
make him a Conqueror in Love, after he had made himself one in War; to
make her confess to me this was her resolution, was far more facile, than to
make her do it to <hi>Ventidius;</hi> but at last the passionate conjurations of a
meritorious servant, united with those of a beloved Brother, were so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
that they extorted a declaration, which she could not deliver with
more blushes, than he in whose favor 'twas made, receiv'd it with extasies
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96335:183"/>
and Transports: I remember amongst many other expressions of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Ventidius</hi>'s, this was one; I bless the gods (my fair Princess) that
they have made it my destiny to fight against a Nation, which never yet
was vanquish'd, that the world may be convinc'd, this high conquest was
reserv'd for <hi>Udozia</hi>'s Soldier, who can no more be deny'd Victory, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that most glorious Title, than it can be, that that Title is so. These ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Productions of a transcendent Joy, and Passion, were no sooner
qualify'd, than I assur'd <hi>Ventidius,</hi> I would wait on him in this War, to
fatisfy my Friendship as well as Revenge. This promise was receiv'd with
new raptures, and I found how agreeable my company was to him, since
it could appear as a great joy, in his being already possest with so high an
one. <hi>Udozia</hi> made no small scruples to deprive her self at once of both her
concerns; but when I assur'd her my Presence might in no unconsidrable
degree contribute to the preservation of <hi>Ventidius,</hi> whose too-high Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to Glory, might cast him into resembling dangers, and that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and the diversion of War, might efface the Reliques of a grief,
whose entire distinction was not indifferent to her, she at last consented
to my voyage, and perhaps my departure with <hi>Ventidius</hi> the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did not a little contribute to the free liberty of her weepings, for
since in the very Tears themselves, none could read their cause, she shed
hers the more unrestrainedly; and her Brother, and her Lovers joynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
made them as equally ascribable to Affection, as Passion; though
for my part, I not only believ'd, but was satisfy'd with their relishing
more of the last, than the first. But <hi>Ventidius</hi> now assur'd his victory over
the <hi>Parthians,</hi> would give him a more noble one in <hi>Udozia</hi> (at least one
that he valu'd so) flew to his Army, resolving to bring his own, and that
Empires fate to a suddain tryal. All along the way as we went to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretta,</hi>
he entertain'd me with such passionate discourses of his Flame,
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I must acknowledge, they set my old wounds fresh a bleeding, and
by his admirable expressions of a successful Love, he not only made me
resent more pregnantly my own misery in a contrary Fate, but inflam'd
me with resolves, to act in this War such performances, as might force <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera</hi>
to esteem me worthy her Affection, though she were uncapable
to confer it on me; or by a noble Death, and my misfortunes, and desires
together. The joy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army at <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s coming to it, appear'd
as great as it could do in a Victory, and they were so satisfy'd with it,
that though he had brought them nothing but his person; he had been as
welcome, as bringing with it the assurance that he had ty'd <hi>Artabazus</hi>'s
hands; at which, all the <hi>Romans</hi> seem'd to be much satisfy'd, not that they
wanted the vanity of believing themselves soon able to have done it, but
that they consider'd all things as misfortunes, which retarded their reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the death, and appeasing the Manes of so many of their Citizens, as fell
with <hi>Crassus. Ventidius</hi> extreamly pleas'd to observe, his Army were in so
obliging a temper, began his March the next morning, towards the River
of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where his Intelligencers assur'd him a vast Army of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
lay, to justify their Frontiers, The <hi>Roman</hi> General sent an Herauld to
them to denounce the War, which he said the <hi>Romans</hi> were not wont to
steal upon, but to make with their Enemies; that since he was determin'd
to prosecute them to the end of the World, and that nothing could avoid
a Battel, 'twould be more generous, if they would exempt him from a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
march, by dividing the length of it between them. This denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and desire being sent, found a generous return from <hi>Labienus,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the <hi>Parthian</hi> Army, and who advanced four days march into <hi>Syria,</hi>
to decline all disadvantages over the <hi>Romans,</hi> since (as he said) the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
*
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96335:184"/>
                  <hi>thians</hi> needed no greater, than they had in their Courages; which because
so pregnant an Argument as the loss of <hi>Crassus,</hi> and 40000 of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
could not convince them of, he was coming purposely to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
by a fresh demonstration, which he was confident would be so signal
a one, that though none of them should live to acknowledge it, yet their
deaths should do it for them. <hi>Ventidius</hi> excus'd this high reply, by the
<hi>Parthians</hi> putting themselves in a condition, which he was more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
would soon afford him a certainty of revenging it. The two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
having agreed upon a sett day to decide the Quarrel, by one of the
<hi>Parthian</hi> Trumpets, which past between both Armies, for the making of
this bloudy bargain, I diligently enquir'd after my dear <hi>Artabanes,</hi> who I
concluded was not in the <hi>Parthian</hi> Army, because another Commanded it;
but this Trumpeter, either through obedience or ignorance, continu'd
me in mine; but the joy that I should not fight against my generous friend,
could hardly transcend my grief, when I knew I should have the like Fate
against <hi>Pacorus,</hi> yet I hoped this Battel would facilitate my desires against
another opportunity. At last the fatal day came, and 'twas then I perceiv'd
in <hi>Ventidius,</hi> so many Martial Charms, as well in his Knowledge, as in his
Looks, that had <hi>Udozia</hi> but then seen him, she must have unavoidably
compos'd a part of his that days victory. The General of the <hi>Romans</hi> would
have in this Battel, resign'd that Title to me, but I appear'd as much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at the offer, as he was generous in it, and 'twas then he protested,
he deplor'd his not being a Monarch, since thereby he had been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to none but to the gods, and Reason, for his Actions, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would have forc'd me to have taken that days Command. I will not tell
you (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) my return to this flattery. 'Tis enough you
know I did decline it, but yet could not, the Command of the <hi>Italian</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
which was compos'd of the Youth and Gallantry of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by
which charge I found <hi>Ventidius</hi> gave me means, as ample as my desires, to
purchase Glory. He himself took his place at the head of the Legionary Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and the signals were no sooner given, than the Armies began the
Battel, with such fury, that had I not known they were both compos'd of
the Warlikest Nations in the World, I could then no longer have been in
that ignorance; I will not amuze my self, to give you the retail of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
day, 'tis enough you know <hi>Ventidius</hi> did like <hi>Ventidius,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
pierc'd and broke whatever oppos'd him; and though he found
a virtuous resistance, yet it was so far from hindring his victory, that it
did but set if it off the better. The <hi>Parthian</hi> Cavalry are generally the best
that are, and their numbers much exceeding ours, we found we needed
the Legionaries help, which as soon as <hi>Ventidius</hi> had, he advanc'd a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
pace to afford it us. I include my self in the number of those that
wanted it, though the gods gad given the Right-wing, which I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as entire a victory, as <hi>Septimus</hi> a defeat, who commanded the left; So
that the General of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse and I, observing our mutual succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
rally'd Troops together with what expedition we could, but that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being more active of their Feet, when they cannot use their Hands, than
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the execution remaining more bloudy on our side than
theirs, their Commander had sooner brought his Soldiers under their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and in greater numbers, than I could possibly under mine; yet <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius</hi>'s
arrival so well redrest that misfortune, as I found it none; our new
dispute seem'd a second Battel, and <hi>Ventidius</hi> found he must obtain two
Victories, to win one. I cannot with Truth decline telling you, That ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the General of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse, who was much more remarkable
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96335:184"/>
for his Courage, than his Arms, which yet were in the beginning all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Rubies, though now with a nobler, but resembling colour, I
rid up to him, and having singl'd him out, I endeavour'd to take a revenge
of those many deaths he had given divers which serv'd under me; but
those which were spectators of our Combate, fear'd, and believ'd I would
increase his Victories, rather than punish them; I must confess, his first
strokes were so unintermissive and brisk, that I might have made that
my own opinion too, and perhaps the rage of its being mine, did not a
little contribute to the giving of those wounds, which soon made the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
to alter it, but in bestowing on him some which were very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
I receiv'd many which were so, but mine were so much more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
or my constitution so much stronger than his, that uniting all his
Forces to give me one blow (which might revenge my having so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minsh'd
them) as his Sword was in the Air to act it, his Spirits abandon'd
him, his Arms fell softly to his side, and then he himself fell off his Horse
on the ground; some <hi>Romans,</hi> according to their barbarous custom, ran
to cut off this valiant <hi>Parthian</hi>'s Head, to present it to their General, but
perceiving their intent, I lighted hastily to prevent it; but I found my
self so weaken'd by the loss of Bloud, that I no sooner toucht the ground
with my Feet, than I did the like with all my Body, yet as the gods would
have it, remembring the cause why I had abandon'd my Horse, I crept
where the generous <hi>Parthian</hi> lay, where not being able to defend him by
my Commands, I did it with my Sword, and receiv'd some wounds to
preserve him, who had given me so many; my assistance had been fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to him, if <hi>Ventidius</hi> had not then come to mine, of whom I had only
strength enough to beg, as he lov'd <hi>Udozia,</hi> or <hi>Artav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

preserve my valiant Enemy; which words I had no sooner utter'd, than
I fell off my knees by him, and almost in as unpromising a condition as he
was in. <hi>Ventidius,</hi> (one of the most generous Friends) thought he could
not better merit that Title, than by having as much care of my desires, as
of me; this made him at the same instant in which he sent for the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
to beat off those Soldiers, who endeavour'd by the death of the
<hi>Parthian</hi> to revenge, my supposed one, and many of their companions
real deaths, which he had that day acted; <hi>Ventidius</hi> found so much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to effect this, that as he afterwards confest, had not my pressing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations
inviolably engag'd him to it, he had given his Soldiers a liberty,
which the <hi>Parthian</hi> usage to <hi>Crassus,</hi> made it almost as high an injustice to
deny them, as did the sad condition this had reduc'd me to; but at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

having made himself to be obey'd, he caus'd (and help'd) me to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to my Tent, and set up another near mine, to which he made my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
be brought; but he was so sensible of my danger, that he was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
so of his Glory and Success; for commanding the Tribunes to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Victory, and bring him an account, at what rate they had bought
it, and how dear the <hi>Parthians</hi> had lost it, to my Tent he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
thither again, where he found me so much restor'd, as that I had
strength enough to congratulate his glorious success, which was so much
the more so, by his having chiefly, and almost solely purchas'd it, and
to ask him afterwards what was become of my valiant Enemy whose usage
I implor'd from him once again might be as re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>embling to mine, as his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was. <hi>Ventidius</hi> gave me that account of him, which I have given you,
which made me send one of my Domesticks to enquire after a Life, I was
as much concern'd to preserve, as I had lately been to destroy; my Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
brought me word, that as yet he was not recover'd from his faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96335:185"/>
but that the Chirurgions by some certain symptomes, found he would
not long continue in it. I was as glad at the last part of this information, as
troubl'd at the first; and observing that <hi>Ventidius</hi> only call'd him the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
prisoner, I ask'd him whether he had not yet learnt his Name and
Quality. I have not, (<hi>Ventidius</hi> reply'd) discover'd either, but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
all the rules of Phisiognomy are false, if his Quality be not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the richness of his Arms; for the Chirurgions to stop his bleeding,
having taken off his Helmet, I perceiv'd, in spight of his paleness, a Meen,
and Features, which could not but be charming in a perfect health, since
they were almost so in the condition he was then in. This Character (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) would have made me suspect it was <hi>Artabanes,</hi> but that
my success secur'd me from that fear; and as I was begging <hi>Ventidius</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
scrutinously who the <hi>Parthian</hi> was, <hi>Septimus</hi> came in, and assur'd his
General that by the least partial computation on both sides, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had lost 2000, and their Enemies 27000. <hi>Ventidius</hi> finding me in so
promising a condition, suspended awhile the duties of a Friend, to act
those of a General, but he had no sooner hastily dispatch'd his Spies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to learn
the Countenance and intentions of the Enemy, and settl'd his Guards,
than he return'd to me again, and gave me no small hopes, but those
he had employ'd, would next morning satisfy my curiosity, and learn
who the Prisoner was; with this flattering expectation we entertain'd
one another till the hour prescrib'd me for sleep, which I could not do,
till I had first sent to enquire how the <hi>Parthian</hi> did, and learnt that he
was restor'd to Life, though not to his Sences. The next morning the Sun
was hardly risen, when <hi>Ventidius</hi> came hastily into my Tent, and having
sent out all those in it, he told me, with a Face cover'd with joy. At
length <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> at length the gods have manifested themselves to be so,

in a posture to repair those she has so unjustly loaden you with;
Yes <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that Prisoner which yesterday was made one by your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
is <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who understanding of my intention to decide our
quarrel by a pitcht Battel, came in post from <hi>Selutia,</hi> and from <hi>Altezee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
to the <hi>Parthian</hi> Army, which also he was the more invited to, by its
being commanded by <hi>Labienus</hi> (his Favourite) This is confirm'd by three
several Spies, who all assure me, that the Gentleman with the Arms co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Rubies, is <hi>Pacorus,</hi> whoseloss the <hi>Parthians</hi> as much lament, as
that of the Battel, and of their General, of whom as yet they can learn
no news; you will have also (continu'd <hi>Ventidius</hi>) the Felicity of seeing
your Revenge acted, without being the Judge, or Guilty of it; For one
of my Instructions from the Triumvirat and Senate, is, neither to give, nor
receive Quarter, so that in my necessary obedience, you may derive
a satisfaction, which perhaps your own nice Gallantry would scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to confer on you. Judge generous Friend (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>)
Judge if my astonishment were great at so strange and unexpected
an adventure, in which I had on small debate, whether it were an
accident fitter for my joy or grief; but after a short reflection, and dispute
on it, I reply'd; Ah <hi>Ventidius, Pacorus</hi> must not dye, my Honor as well
as Reason will oppose it, for to let a Prisoner be executed by the Sword of
Justice, which avoided it by that of War, cannot more intrench upon both
our Reputations, than it must on my Felicity; for though <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s death
will free me from an injoyning Kival, yet alas, the way in which 'tis done,
will raise me as great an obstruction, as it removes; for with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and hopes, can I present my self to <hi>Altezeera,</hi> having been in effect
the murtherer of her Husband? by so horrid a crime, if she has any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:96335:185"/>
for me, it will be as abundantly as justly increast, or if hereafter she
should discover my Innocency (which is too-bright to be eternally cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
I should hereby render heruncapable to reward it. No generous <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius,</hi>
the gods have too palpably taken the protection of <hi>Pacorus,</hi> to
make me become his destroyer, and they never yet permitted sin to be
the way to Felicity; besides, I owe him a Life, which if I now repay,
I shall ease my self of a burthen, that next to <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Inconstancy,
does most load me; neither is it impossible, but so high a demonstration
as this is, of my concern in her satisfaction, may create in her a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
one for mine, and induce her to confess, what she has done was her
fault, or at least her misfortune, which acknowledgement of her offence,
I shall esteem the highest blessing, next to her repairing it; neither shall
I ever hope her pardon, for having made <hi>Pacorus</hi> a prisoner, but by
setting him at liberty; and those wounds I have given him, cannot more
nobly be excus'd, nor by so pregnant an evincement, that I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to whom I gave them, as that of restoring him his liberty, when I
knew it. I shall therefore (generous <hi>Ventidius</hi>) conjure you, by all those
motives which you esteem most prevalent, permit me to dispose of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
before his qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

might prove a proportionate prejudice to the Giver. That this
Prisoner (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) is <hi>Pacorus,</hi> is not more certain, than that before
now all the Army know it, for my Spies never being employ'd but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
publick concerns, I never us'd to receive their intelligences, but
before such of the Army, with whom I use to advise how to improve,
and act upon them, so that this being given me, as the custome is, and
being a thing of so great encouragement to the Soldiers, and Honor,
and advantage to you that took him, I was so far f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om endeavouring to
suppress it, that I contributed on both those scores to the divulging it;
neither can I think, but therein I heve abundantly serv'd you, which I
believe will be your opinion too, if you act not as much againct your
self, as the gods do for you; for I know you are too-much a Friend to
Virtue, and too-knowing in <hi>Altezeera's,</hi> either to desire, or expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of your Passion and Services, in the condition she now is in; so
that their being but two obstacles to the attaining of your felicity, that
of her real Marriage, and that of your imaginary Guilt, the greatest of
them by <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s death, will be remov'd, and who knows whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
both of them will not be so, for perhaps the danger <hi>Armenia</hi> was in,
did invite her to her crime, and it may be the more to supress <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s
jealousies (who could not but learn her pre-ingagement to you) she
broke with you on your pretended, and unmention'd fault, the better
to palliate her own; neither is it unlikely, but that <hi>Pacorus</hi> by some Arts
of his, has setl'd this misunderstanding betwixt you, and after his being
possest of <hi>Altezeera,</hi> lest she should learn it privately by some other way,
and so as a reparation recall you to her, has himself disclos'd it, thereby
to hinder her from such a proceeding; besides, should <hi>Altezeera</hi> come to
learn your innocency, 'twill be so far from being an advantage to you, that
it will be a torment to her, and consequently to you; and <hi>Pacorus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the course of Nature, being as probable to live, as either <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera</hi>
or you, all you can derive from the manifestation of your Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is only to let her know, but not render her capable to acknowledge,
or reward it; whereas if <hi>Pacorus</hi> be sent into another World, at the
same instant your innocence is clear'd, it will undoubtedly be recompenc'd:
These reasons (continu'd <hi>Ventidius</hi>) cannot more evidently manifest that
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:96335:186"/>
                  <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s death is necessary to your Felicity, than I will, that it cannot be
so much as suspected to be your action, or by your consent, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a prisoner cannot be more generally known, than that my Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
commands me to take none, or if any be taken, to execute them;
so that that which is a general order, no body, nor <hi>Altezeera</hi> her self,
can consider as a particular act for your satisfaction, or interest; what
you have already done for <hi>Pacorus,</hi> evinces also that Truth, since
when you had the power to kill him, you not only declin'd doing so,
when too he had sufficiently invited you to it, by leaving only strength
enough to perform it, but also employ'd that little remnant of life
you had left, to preserve his, which had reduc'd you to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) you must give me leave somewhat to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
my own safety in this particular, which will run an infinite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
by not only infringing my Commission, but by letting goe so
considerable a Prisoner. Would to the gods (I reply'd) I could as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
answer all your objections, as the last, since then I could promise
my self a Concession of my request, as much from your Reason, as
Friendship; for whatsoever is the cause of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s change, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<hi>Pacorus</hi> being thus remov'd, will not leave her a Latitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it; but on the contrary, 'twill make me for ever uncapable of
appearing what I am; though you alleadge, that my having once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> will evidence I am clear of his death, yet I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
it will prove the contrary, for, to save him when I knew not who
he was, and to permit his death when I knew him to be <hi>Pacorus,</hi> will
justly shew, she was oblig'd by my ignorance, and wrong'd by my
knowledge; and indeed will render me as guilty to her, as to my self,
for knowing the perfect friendship <hi>Ventidius</hi> blesses me withal, she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt if I had embrac'd <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s preservation with earnestness,
but my success, would have been proportionate to my desire; besides,
should she never know I was consenting to his death, 'twere enough
perpetually to banish me from her, that I did. <hi>Ventidius</hi> was about
to answer me, when <hi>Septimus,</hi> and a great many Officers, came into my
Tent to visit me, and to give him an advice of such importance, as
necessitated him awhile to leave me alone, which I no sooner was
than I began to dispute with my self on my admirable and strange fate
and to elect some course upon so emergent an occasion; at length the
gods made me pitch upon one, which at <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s return I resolv'd,
to communicate to him, in the expectance whereof, I sent for one of
my Physitians and Chirurgions, who waited on <hi>Pacorus,</hi> to learn how
he did; they told me, that as yet he had not recover'd his senses per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
nor spoke, but they durst undertake his cure, if I were concern'd
in it; Yes (I reply'd) I am so, infinitely, and enjoyn you, as you value
me, to have a care of him, and that you will not only keep from his
knowledge, that 'twas I which he fought against, but my being in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army, both which you may imagine, are of no small importance
to me, since I commend them to you asmuch as his cure, or my own.
This they not only promis'd, but undertook to perform, which they
might the more easily, because he was only waited on by my Servants.
An hour after, <hi>Ventidius</hi> return'd to my Tent, where he told me the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which drew him from it, was, an Advertisement brought him, that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus,</hi>
who was left for dead amongst many thousands that were so, was by
the care of one of his servants, the foregoing night brought to a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
not far off, where beyond all expectation they found him give some
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96335:186"/>
symptomes of Life, which the diligent Servant to improve, went to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
not far off to fetch a Chirurgion, to send advice to the <hi>Parthian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of this rare accident; and to let them know how dangerous a place
their General was in, that they might suddainly remove him from it; one
of my Spies by good fortune was then in this Village, and so industriously
play'd his part, that he got perfect information of this Truth, which then
he came to discover to me, and which occasion'd me to send a party of
Horse to seize upon <hi>Labienus,</hi> and bring him hither; they are just now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
but without him, for an hour before, 2000 <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse had
carry'd him away in a Litter. <hi>Ventidius</hi> having made me this little Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
began afresh to assault me about <hi>Pacorus,</hi> but when he found my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
if not my reason, was unconquerable, he told me, since I was so
absolutely fix'd upon my prejudice, he would afford me his assistance in
it, were it only to convince me he would not deny it me in anything, and
that what he had mention'd concerning his own danger, was purely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
me upon his score, to yield to what was to prevent mine, since I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
it upon my own; that therefore he was determin'd to send an
express to <hi>Rome,</hi> to let the Senate know his victory, and the taking of
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> whose liberty he would represent (as his own opinion) would
sooner settle the Eastern World, than his death, since his being of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
disposition, an obligation that was so, would invite him to be a friend
to <hi>Rome,</hi> which would be a more virtuous Conquest over the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
than they had over <hi>Crassus;</hi> whereas his death by rendring the Parthians
desperate, will render the War so too, which otherwise might be concluded
without hazard, and with glory; I will (continu'd <hi>Ventidius</hi>) so fill my
Letters, not only to the Triumvirate, and Senate, with inducements to
Mercy, but also all those I shall send to my particular Friends, that I hope
they will produce what you desire, at least if they do not, I will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiz'd
of it by a Post, who shall arrive before my Express, that if <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
death be commanded, before I receive that order, I will by letting
him escape, render it impossible to be executed: this course (said <hi>Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>)
I elect, because perhaps I may have no cause to break my instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and if I have, the doing it, may prove a greater obligation to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes;</hi>
besides, <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s wounds cannot possibly be cur'd before an
Express do goe, and return from <hi>Rome;</hi> neither will it be amiss we learn
what countenance <hi>Altezeera</hi> put upon the news of his death, or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment.
This generous assurance made me embrace the maker of it, and
then I told him, since his departure, I had given strict Order <hi>Pacorus</hi> should
be kept in a perfect ignorance, either of my having been his Enemy, or of
my being in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, which I had done in expectation that some
advantagious expedient might be found out for me, if he gave the
<hi>Parthian</hi> his liberty, who I intended to visit in excellent disguise, thorough
which, if <hi>Pacorus</hi> did not discover me, I might be satisfy'd <hi>Altezeera</hi> could
not; and having made him know 'twas from me he deriv'd his liberty
and life, I would return into <hi>Parthia</hi> with him, where I made no doubt
to learn the cause of my disgrace. But (said <hi>Ventidius</hi>) suppose <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
should know you, and yet not seem to do it, till he came where
he has a power to ruine you; and what good too, can it do you to learn
the cause of your disgrace, when it lies not in the Princesses power
to redress it? If <hi>Pacorus</hi> discovers me (said I) which I will almost
render an impossibility, I cannot yet suspect, but what I do for him,
will confine him from doing any thing against me, and to learn the cause
of my disgrace will at least silence the torment of my suspension, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96335:187"/>
me to <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s good opinion, which by her marriage, is the highest
felicity I can now aspire unto; besides, who knows what accidents may
happen, which being upon the place may improve; and I must tell
you, I begin to flatter my self with a belief, that the gods are weary of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
me, since by this new accident they give me some signes of it. I will
(continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) pass over the particulars of our discourses, to tell
you the results, which were, That <hi>Ventidius</hi> yielded up his Reasons to my
desires, and assur'd me, if he had no answer from <hi>Rome,</hi> by the time <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
was able to make use of his liberty, he should notwithstanding be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to it. <hi>Ventidius</hi> immediately after withdrew himself to make his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
to the Senate, and to let <hi>Udozia</hi> know of that success, which he
deplor'd, since thereby I was disabl'd from giving her an account of it.
Whilst we were in expectation of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s and my recovery,, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Army Camp'd upon the same place, in which it had been so victorious,
for I could not perswade <hi>Ventidius</hi> to prosecute his Victory by any hazard
of my Life, which he thought would run no small one, by my remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with the Army, or my being left in any of those small Towns which
were adjacent to it, so that I did more oblige the <hi>Parthians,</hi> by having
fought against them, than the contrary in having done it. And though
<hi>Ventidius</hi> sate still so long, yet he made his Army believe, it proceeded
from the impossibility of doing otherwise, till the great number of the
wounded were cur'd, which if left behind, that Guard, that unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
must be so too, for their security, would endanger the marching Army.
Yet during my cure, the <hi>Romans</hi> made a sharp war on the <hi>Parthians,</hi> by
frequent and successful incursions; and I constantly sent to visit <hi>Pacorus,</hi>
but under the name of <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> which was, that I intended to assume
in my disguise; but at length being perfectly recover'd, the better to act
my part, by the same messenger which return'd with <hi>Udozia</hi>'s answer to
<hi>Ventidius</hi> (which was as obliging as he could desire, or perhaps expect) I
gave out, I had advertisements of some stirrs in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which <hi>Ventidius</hi>
perswaded the <hi>Romans,</hi> my Presence only would suppress; so that taking
a publick and formal leave, I made all the Camp believe I was gone; but
the same night I return'd privately again, sending all my Equipage to
<hi>Udozia,</hi> and reserving only <hi>Philanax,</hi> with that Physitian, and Chirurgion,
which attended <hi>Pacorus:</hi> and to shew you my Disguise was really what the
name imports, I have but to acquaint you, that though <hi>Ventidius</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me at a sett hour, and knew I would wear one; yet we not only saluted
one another, but I told him I was sent from <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> to beg his pardon,
for not being able to wait on him till next morning, without discovering
of me, which he did not, till I told him who I was, and which indeed was
not strange, for my Hair, that naturally is of a dark brown, I had colour'd
of a bright Flaxen, and by a certain composition, strangely alter'd the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of my Skin, and to perfect all, by the help of a certain Gold Wire
fasten'd, and conceal'd in my Mouth, I had disguis'd my Voice as much as
my Face; in a word, I had not known my self, if it had not been for some
internal griefs, which nothing had the power, either to disguise or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate,
and which but too well forc'd me to remember, that I was still
the unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes. Ventidius</hi> was extreamly satisfy'd with my
having so deluded him, which he fancy'd an impossibility, till by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
he found his error. The next morning therefore I went to visit
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> and to give him the Consolation, his condition, and the duty
of a Gentleman requir'd; I found him well advanc'd on his recovery,
but I found him perfect in all those charms of conversation, which till
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96335:187"/>
then I never knew he so abundantly possest. I will not scruple my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
friends (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) to tell you, I was not a little troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at it; and truly by my constant frequenting him, I began to despair of
my condition, by having cause to believe 'twas <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s judgment only
which had made me unfortunate.</p>
               <p>To abbreviate my story, I will let you know, That at last <hi>Pacorus</hi> was
so well recover'd, as my Physitian told me, within three dayes he might
without danger make use of his Horse; two of which were scarcely expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Messenger from <hi>Rome</hi> came privately into the Camp,
and assured him his Express from the Senate, would be with him within 48
hours; That what had been propounded by him to the Senate, had been
largely debated in it, and had been carry'd according to his desires, had not
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> oppos'd it, who suspected <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s liberty would settle <hi>Asia</hi>
in a perfect peace, and consequently take away the occasion of his going
into the East with an Army, which he coveted, only to palliate that Passion
he had for <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and which he durst not publickly
manifest, lest it might create any differences betwixt him and <hi>Octavius Caesar,</hi>
whose Sister the Princess <hi>Octavia</hi> he had married, and who in all mens
eyes (but <hi>Anthony</hi>'s) transcended her as much in beauty, as in virtue;
That therefore he had so manag'd the business in the Senate, that they had
sent a positive Order immediately to put <hi>Pacorus</hi> to death. <hi>Ventidius</hi> was
not dishearten'd at this Advertisement, and to hinder me from being so, he
immediately (but by wayes too prolix for a repetition) put things in such
a certain posture, that I knew there would be no difficulty that night to
steal away with my Friend, and my Rival; till when, I spent the time in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
leave of my dear <hi>Ventidius:</hi> but as soon as the hour came, I went to
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> and having brought him into one of the most obscure corners of
the Tent, I told him, I believe Sir, you have already learnt, that he by whose
good fortune you were made a Prisoner, hazarded as much himself for you;
as he did against you, and thereby you were preserv'd from losing your life
as absolutely, as you have your liberty. This Gentleman who was so much
your Enemy, and your Friend, is in the latter quality so much mine, that
though he is call'd <hi>Pharasmenes</hi> as well as I, yet there is an high equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our minds, as between our names; in his success against you, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
some such wounds, that though they were not as dangerous as
yours, yet they were in such unfortunate and inconvenient places, that he
has not been able to pay you those visits, which he knows is due to your
virtue, as much as to your quality; 'twas therefore that I being sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
of mine, he enjoin'd me to supply his place: But, Sir, that you may
see his concern in you extends further than the formal parts of humanity,
he has now sent me to you, not only to let you know there is an express
Order come from <hi>Rome</hi> to put you to death, but also to attempt all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
means I can to prevent it.</p>
               <p>At this unexpected Advertisement, <hi>Pacorus</hi> appear'd in some disorder;
and truly I should have wonder'd more at the contrary, than I did at it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by <hi>Altezeera</hi> a far dearer blessing to lose than life. I gave him a little
time to reflect upon his condition, which the more he did, the more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it did appear; <hi>Crassus</hi> barbarous death, and the <hi>Romans</hi> as barbarous
usage to all Princes who they esteem'd, or at least term'd so, made him tell
me, Your generous Friend, I believe, (<hi>Pharasmenes</hi>) by his desires, has
already as much oblig'd me as he will have the power, for I know too well
the condition of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to be ignorant of my own; I shall not yet
but acknowledge my self extremely his Debtor, and as much as if what he
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96335:188"/>
desir'd were acted. I beseech you therefore, tell him from me, that having
no other way to pay what I owe him, I will do it in contributing to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by the resolution of my sufferings, which perhaps I shall in some degree
perform, if I endure my death with as much resolution, as I oppos'd it.</p>
               <p>This generous Reply gave me new invitations to serve him, and confined
me afresh to act against the dictates of my Love, to follow those of my
Honour, which forc'd me to embrace <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and to assure him before
next morning, I would participate in his intended punishment, or free him
from it. To be brief, I perform'd the latter; &amp; by learning the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d from <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius,</hi>
I brought him safe out of the Camp, where I told him, That having
by that Action lost my Fortune with the <hi>Romans,</hi> I must depend for it on
him; which if he approv'd I would wait on him into <hi>Parthia.</hi> The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Paecorus</hi> embrac'd me a thousand times for this assurance, and gave me
as many thanks for it, as for his life and liberty. We found some good and
swift Horses in a little Grove, which by my orders were brought thither by
<hi>Philanax,</hi> who I then sent to <hi>Udozia,</hi> he being as perfectly known to <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera,</hi>
as the contrary to her husband.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you the Alarm <hi>Pacorus</hi> escape gave unto the <hi>Roman</hi>
Camp, how seemingly diligent <hi>Ventidius</hi> was to recover him, what formal
Letters he sent to the Senate, to excuse himself for a misfortune, which was
so much the more extenuated as to him, because <hi>Pacorus</hi> was escap'd before
he had receiv'd their commands for his execution, nor the vast promises he
made of taking him again, or <hi>Parthia</hi> in his stead, 'tis enough you know,
that what he said was receiv'd as he desir'd; for <hi>Anthony</hi> was satisfi'd, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
was at least deliver'd in such a way, as would ascertain a War as much
as his death. Whil'st these things were thus transacting amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi>
the <hi>Parthian</hi> and I came safe to <hi>Seleutia,</hi> where the Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t then resided;
<hi>Pacorus</hi> (who perfectly knew the Palace) led me to the Princesses Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where we found with her (for then <hi>Parthenissa, Lindadory,</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalinda,</hi>
were in the Isle of <hi>Eden) Arsaces</hi> and <hi>Phraates</hi> all in Mourning,
but alas <hi>Altezeera</hi> having more in her looks, than cloaths, I cannot, if I
would, tell you the Raptures and Transports at so unexpected a return from
Death, or Captivity, (for they knew not which had been <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s fate)
but after the first celebrations of this joy, he led me by the hand to <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and told them, 'Twas to me they ow'd his life and safety;
and then acquainted them with all, with which I have you. <hi>Arsaces</hi> made
me so many Compliments and Thanks, that in them I read his concern for
his Son; but alas <hi>Altezeera</hi> did the like too, and wounded me a thousand
times more with her gratitude, than she could have done with a contrary
usage, manifesting by the esteem she plac'd upon the performance, how
much a higher one she had for him for whom 'twas perform'd. I must confess,
I was so confounded at it, though I had arm'd my self against it by having
prepar'd my self for it, that had not the company been more intent on their
joy, than me, they had discover'd me inspight of my disguise. To pass over
what would but trouble you to hear, and me much more to remember, or
relate, I will tell you, after a magnificent Supper, where the King and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
constrain'd me to sit with them, (giving therein that honour to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which they thought was not due to me) the Princess <hi>Altezeera</hi> leaving
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> took me aside to reiterate her civilities for his deliverance.</p>
               <p>Great gods! you only know, with how much difficulty 'twas I
abstained from telling her, That her leaving <hi>Pacorus,</hi> to come unto
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> which she did in that way of Gratitude, she should
have done in another; And that she had Reason to be Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96335:188"/>
for <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s deliverance, if she knew from whom she deriv'd it; but I
had then enough fortitude to suppress those risings, and to tell her, That
had I but known so transcendent a reward as the satisfaction of so fair a
Princess had attended that performance, I had acted it as much out of the
dictates of Interest, as out of those of Honour or Friendship.</p>
               <p>We entertain'd one another awhile with discourses of this quality, but
the time was not long, for the impatient <hi>Pacorus</hi> came to ravish her from
me, and to place himself in those extasies and raptures, which the cruel gods
had eternally deny'd, the as-unconstant, as-unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes.</hi> This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
was so operative, that had not the Prince <hi>Phraates,</hi> and the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of the Court came to conduct me to my Apartment, I had continu'd as
fix'd to the place I was in, as to my infelicity; but their civilities drew me
out of my thoughts, which I suspended till they had left me in my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whither they accompany'd me against all my resistance. As soon as I
was a Bed, the remembrance of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s gratitude for having continu'd
the impossibility of <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s being made happy, came fresh into my
thoughts, and made me utter things as disjointed as my hopes; but when I
came to reflect, that in that same instant I was deploring <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s cruelty
to me, she was in my Rivals Arms, and affording him those joyes, which to
be depriv'd of, could not be so great Misery, as to possess, was a Felicity, what
did not my rage and resentments make me speak? Ah (said I <hi>Artavasdes</hi>)
was it not sufficient that the gods, and <hi>Altezeera</hi> contributed to thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but that thou must do it thy self, by bringing <hi>Pacorus</hi> not only to
the embraces of thy Princess, but thyself also to be the Spectator of them?
Never more, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> never more complain of the gods, they had given
thy Rival into thy hands; and when they began to declare themselves thy
Friends, thou didst declare thy self thine Enemy, and by that performance
hast not only divested thy self eternally of hope, but also of the ease of
complaining against all but thy self, without becoming as unjust to them, as
thou hast been to thy Love; whil'st my thoughts inclin'd me on this side,
they suggested to me many such reasonings; but after a short calm, they
began to incline me to consider <hi>Altezeera,</hi> arm'd with all those attractive
charms and graces, which formerly had conquer'd me, and which by their
yet retaining me in captivity, too sufficiently prov'd their being infinite,
and confin'd me to believe all my sufferings for her, were too much my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be my trouble.</p>
               <p>No, no, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> (said I in those dictates) thou hast still the same
quarrel to the gods; for, by the way in which they gave thee thine Enemy,
thou couldst not restore thy hopes, but by becoming unworthy of them;
and those same gods which afforded thee the power of revenge, made the
acting it a greater sin, than it could be a satisfaction, and gave thee honour
and virtue enough to suspend all the inspirations of resentment; do not
then destroy the merit of thy performance, by repining against it, 'tis more
noble to merit <hi>Altezeera</hi> without possessing her, than to possess her, without
meriting her; neither can what thou hast done, but one day contribute to
the disclosing of thine innocence; and that which discovers, must invite
her to reward it; wait then (<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) the manifestation of what the
gods (without declaring themselves none) cannot long conceal, and find
thy satisfaction in thy very torment, by being pleas'd that <hi>Altezeera</hi> is so,
though in <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s arms; and by calculating thy own joyes, by the seeing
of his, if ever the gods remove the obstruction of her marriage, and thy
pretended guilt. It was above a thousand times that I built and destroy'd
such resolutions, sometimes determining to discover my self, and know my
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96335:189"/>
fault, or make her acknowledge hers, and then again declining that resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for I knew too well <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s scrupulous virtue, to have any hopes
of living near her afterwards, though I should prove my self innocent;
and so the apprehension of being banish'd from what I lov'd to see, made
me rather elect to be thought criminal, and enjoy that felicity, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
otherwise, and be depriv'd of it.</p>
               <p>I had longer entertain'd my self in these disputes, had not the Suns ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
and afterwards some of the Princes Officers, put a period to them:
The first of them which came into my Chamber, gave me advice, That <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
had setled a large Pension on me, and form'd me an Equipage which
I found proportionate to my real quality; But alas the next that visited
me, were sent from the Prince and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> to know how I had past the
night? Oh gods! what difficulty had I to abstain from sending them word,
that their having past it so well, had almost made me pass it as ill: But
though this strange Message set all my wounds fresh a bleeding, yet I had
so much discretion left, as only to answer it with a Complement as civil, as
theirs was seemingly so. As soon as I was drest, I went into the Palace
Gardens, which were so admirably oblig'd both by Art and Nature, that
they would have unavoidably prov'd a diversion, to a less inveterate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
than mine; I had not been above two hours there, when I might
perceive <hi>Pacorus</hi> and <hi>Altezeera</hi> at the end of the Walk I was in, coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, at which sight I could not abstain from whispering to my self:
Can you then <hi>Altezeera,</hi> after having past a whole night in <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
present your self without confusion before him, to whom you had first
promis'd that blessing? And canst thou (<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) after being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that she has done so, outlive that misfortune? Or if thou dost not
do it, to be reveng'd upon the Ravisher of thy right and joyes? I could
no longer continue any reflections of this quality, because I went to meet
them, where <hi>Altezeera</hi> by many reiterated expressions for <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s delivery,
but too-too-palpably let me know how dear it was unto her: Neither was
it only at this time that she did so, but so constantly upon all occasions, that
it gave me no small Alarm she had discover'd me, for I fear'd she could not
so incessantly persecute me out of Gratitude, but Hate. But (continu'd
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) if I should acquaint you in particular with all things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
whil'st I resided in <hi>Parthia,</hi> I should take up almost as much time as
did my residence there; I will therefore only acquaint you with those
things which are most essential, and in pursuance thereof let you know,
That one evening, when all the Court were walking in the Palace Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
I had the honour to lead the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and being unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
gotten into a retir'd Walk, she earnestly conjur'd me to let her
know the story of my life, since (as she said) 'twas from it, she deriv'd that
which made hers her satisfaction. Would to the gods fair Princess (I was
upon the point of saying) that my life had not lasted a moment longer,
than when upon its own score, it had created the felicity of yours. But
knowing such a Reply would have prov'd destructive to that resolution I
had assum'd, of expecting in disguise, and with patience, what the gods had
determin'd of me, I gave her an accompt of my life, such as my invention
then suggested, till my arrival in <hi>Syria</hi> with <hi>Ventidius.</hi> But, Madam, (I
continu'd) I cannot now obey you, without something violating a friends
injunctions; yet if you command me to proceed, you shall find, I esteem
nothing more highly, and justly, than the honour of obeying you. Truly
(said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) you have told me so many admirable things in your life,
and I have been so infinitely oblig'd unto it, that I should desire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96335:189"/>
of your story, did I not apprehend your granting my curiosity,
might prove almost as great a trouble to you, as a satisfaction to me.</p>
               <p>Madam (I reply'd) to convince you, I cannot but please my self, while I
do the Princess <hi>Altezeera;</hi> I will acquaint her with the residue of my story,
and the rather, (not only as 'tis her command) but as she has some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
in it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Rtavasdes</hi> was beginning to speak, and to finish that small remainder
of his Narration, when <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s servants interrupted him, by
bringing in their Supper, which both he, and <hi>Artabanes</hi> would have dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, for what it hinder'd them of; but the sooner to repair that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
they took a little refreshment, and then <hi>Artavasdes</hi> having minded
them, he addrest his discourse to the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> continu'd it in these
words.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough that Friendship, Madam, between <hi>Ventidius,</hi> (the
now <hi>Roman</hi> General in <hi>Asia</hi>) and me, be very great, yet
I can truly say, that between him, and <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> is equal
to it; and perhaps I should speak no untruth, if I assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you, that between <hi>Artavasdes</hi> and me, is not inferior
unto either. <hi>Ventidius</hi> being so far on his way to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
as <hi>Tharsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> was there met by <hi>Artavasdes,</hi>
but <hi>Artavasdes</hi> so chang'd, that you would as soon have taken me for
him, as I should have taken him for himself; but, at length, knowing who
he was, more by our ears, than eyes, we thought nothing could appear so
strange as his alteration, till we learn'd that yours (Madam) was the cause
of it, and that the change of his face, could not transcend that of your
mind; but then our wonder ceas'd, or at least chang'd its object; for
whereas we admir'd before at his being so pale and languishing, we now
did more that he was alive, having known at <hi>Rome</hi> how passionately he
ador'd you, and how only he did value his life, because you did, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you had therein render'd it a blessing to him.</p>
               <p>He further told us, That since his disgrace, (which was the less suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for having never learn'd the cause of it) he had confin'd himself to a
Solitude, from which nothing but his engagement to <hi>Ventidius</hi> could have
so long absolv'd him, and whither (having satisfy'd it) he would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
retire, and so assiduously sollicit death, as he was confident in a
short time to have better success in that Address, than in his former; that
this course he elected, as the onely means to end his Torments, and your
Cruelty too (Madam) having also left him no other way to justifie his
innocence, which he protested to us in such moving terms, that both <hi>Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
and I, were abundantly satisfi'd of it; I cannot (Madam) but tell
you, that being convinc'd he was not faulty, I persuaded him often to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
what he admir'd, and as you had elected another Servant, so that he
would another Mistriss: But alas! he was too much a Captive, so much as
to think on Liberty; and condemn'd me more for such a motion, than those
gods for acting against him, what had made me esteem it a reasonable
one.</p>
               <p>Whil'st I was thus speaking to the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> she was in so great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that she observ'd not mine, which did proceed in no small degree,
from my not knowing from whence hers did; but the better to learn it, I
thus continu'd my discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:96335:190"/>
I will not (Madam) particularize <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s journey to the fair <hi>Vdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia,</hi>
(in which <hi>Artavasdes</hi> and I accompany'd him) and for whom he had
contracted a Passion, which I believe is transcended by none, but by <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>'s
for you, and by yours for the Prince <hi>Pacorus.</hi> Neither will I tell
you all those Reasons the unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes</hi> us'd for continuing in his
solitude, nor ours to draw him from it, because I fear you are not enough
concern'd in him, to listen to them with that patience, which their length
requires. It is true <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) I should hardly have
the patience to listen to them, because I know they are but a continu'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of that dissimulation, with which he has captivated your belief, and
did but too long mine, in so high a degree, that I shall not scruple to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
I once esteem'd, as much as I do now detest him. Oh gods!
(Madam, I hastily reply'd) if <hi>Artavasdes</hi> be guilty, why then did you not
tell him his crime, that he might have appear'd so to himself, as well as to
his Princess? which latter, if you had perform'd, I durst undertake he
would have been more odious to himself, than he can be to her. That which
he did (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) was of a quality, that to have told him of it, was
but to have done that to him, which he did to me; let it suffice <hi>Pharasma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
that I had the confession of his offence from him that committed it. If
it were not (I reply'd) a sin, not to believe the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> above <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes,</hi>
I should do it in this particular, for if what he did, was his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and not his misfortune, why did he impose on himself so strict a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as a three years recluseness? And why did he give a higher testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his innocence than that amounted unto, which, Madam, you will
learn, in the sequel of my Relation. You will do well then (said <hi>Altezee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>)
to prosecute it, for that which you have already mention'd, is one of
the most pregnant proofs of his guilt, and proceeded from a contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
than that to which he has ascrib'd it unto. I was (continu'd <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>)
beginning to speak something farther in my own justification, when
<hi>Altezeera</hi> interrupted it, by saying, But <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> I conjure you leave
off all discourses of <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Adventures, and continue your own.
This I found was almost as difficult to be obey'd in one sense, as in the other;
but though I apprehended I should discover who I was, if I took too much
pains to discover what <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was; yet I could not abstain from thus
speaking to <hi>Altezeera.</hi> Alas Madam, why do you take so short a way to
make me fear you are more desirous of <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s guilt, than his innocence.
The fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> at these words turn'd up her vail, and looking on me, by
a deep sigh, seem'd to reproach the uncharitableness of my opinion; but
this she did in so moving a way, that in the flattering dictates it inspir'd me
with, I was going to fling my self at her feet, and there to implore the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of my supposed offence, or to end the torments of that denial, by a
real death; but something which was the god over my inclination, suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me that time from obeying it: and observing my Princess was in no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging
temper, I resolv'd to make some use of it, and therefore I thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd.
I hope (Madam) you will pardon a disobedience, which only
ambitions to preserve my friend from losing as absolutely the honor of your
esteem, as he has that of your affection; in confidence of so just a forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I will presume to acquaint you, That <hi>Ventidius</hi> and I were finally so
prevalent with <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that we persuaded him to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army;
and though we told him the War would prove a diversion to his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
yet we too evidently found he elected it, rather for a cure of his.
And indeed in that Battel we fought against <hi>Pacorus,</hi> though many strange
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:96335:191"/>
Accidents befell him, yet I esteem'd none of them more justly merited that
name, than that he 'scap'd with life. Perhaps, Madam, you will be of my
opinion, when I tell you (and that truly) that 'twas <hi>Artavasdes</hi> which
fought against <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and having been victorious over his Rival, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his defender against all the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and at least as much hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his life for, as against him; but <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s arrival hinder'd you from
losing that which you love best, and that which loves you best; neither
can <hi>Pacorus</hi> be more happy in the first of these qualities, than I am just in
attributing the last of them to <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who having only life enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
to speak three or four words, made use of it to recommend <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
cure to <hi>Ventidius,</hi> more than his own. Judge Madam, (I continu'd)
of the merit of this Action, which were I not too much a friend to <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes,</hi>
I would say, speaks more for itself, than I can for it. This which
you tell me (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) is nothing essential to what you would evince,
since I never doubted <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Gallantry, but his Love; and that this
performance proceeded from his concern in honor, and not in me, I believe
you need no greater eviction, than that he was ignorant who he oblig'd,
positively, or relatively. 'Tis true Madam (I reply'd) <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was
ignorant that he fought for himself in the Combat, and against himself after
the Victory; but yet, if what our Priests do tell us is a truth, that our good
Genius's commonly incline us to those Actions, which though we then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not, yet afterwards approve, I may infer from thence something of
advantage in <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s favor. But why do I so much intrench upon the
merit and clearness of his innocence, as to endeavor to prove it by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inferences, when I can by evident demonstrations? To hasten hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
I must acquaint you Madam, that both the successful, and the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
were carried in a deep Swoon by <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s orders into several Tents,
where the first thing <hi>Artavasdes</hi> did when he was restor'd to life, was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after his enemies. Neither did his care cease, or diminish, when the
next morning the <hi>Roman</hi> General brought him word who he was; and
though <hi>Ventidius</hi> did much admire at it, yet he had by much a juster cause
to do so, when after he had represented, that by his Commission he was to
give no quarter to any <hi>Parthian,</hi> and that by <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s death, he might
have the blessing of revenge, and perhaps therein remove the highest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to a more transcendent one. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was so far from approving
the motion, that he so absolutely disrelish'd <hi>Ventidius</hi> for making it, as he
protested, nothing but the giving <hi>Pacorus</hi> his liberty, could repair having
assumed any thought against his life; and then utter'd so many passionate
expressions upon that duty, which in spight of your cruelty, he had still
preserv'd for the fair <hi>Altezeera;</hi> that perhaps if I told you all the truth, I
might invite you to suspect I did the contrary. I was present, Madam, at
this honourable conference; and though my wounds were many, and as
dangerous as those of <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> yet my friendship never made me aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him; and that very friendship, and my ignorance of those Charms
which I have since discover'd in the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> made me esteem his
desires as strange, as I now find them just; and forc'd me to speak some
things against that excellency, which though infinite, cannot transcend my
crimes, or his mercy, if she pardons them.</p>
               <p>Yes, Madam, upon <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s score, I perfectly hated you, and
in those dictates I was often condescending to the death of what you
loved: nay, I would have had <hi>Artavasdes</hi> done the like; and when
he represented he had no handsomer way to obtain your forgiveness
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96335:191"/>
for what he had done against <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and to shew you the wrong you
had done to <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> than to ruine the hopes of the last, to settle the
joys of the first. I reply'd, That if you honour <hi>Pacorus</hi> with your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
he did in that performance but more certainly exclude himself
eternally from so much as hope; and if you did not, That by obliging
(at least not injuring) you, he removed his highest Impediment. Besides,
If that were the testimony he would give of his Passion, it might bring
in Question, whether he had any? which belief he would render a just
one, if he prefer'd his Rivals felicity above his own. I told him besides,
It was better to repent (if such an action needed it) for having acted
his Revenge, than for the omission of it: for besides the felicity of such a
performance, the first sort of Repentance was a Vertue, but the last a
Vice. Ah! said <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> how ill dost thou reason! if the fair <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera</hi>
loves <hi>Pacorus,</hi> I had rather destroy my expectation, than her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
and if she does not, I yet commit a sin which unavoidably will
clothe me in a proportionate Misfortune, and ruin my hopes in the same
way by which I elect to establish them: for by being the Murtherer (or
accessary to the death) of <hi>Pacorus,</hi> I leave her not the Power, if she had
the will, to reward my Fidelity and Passion; and by removing one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,
I create a greater; for 'tis much more probable <hi>Pacorus</hi> will
die soon enough by the course of Nature, than that <hi>Altezeera</hi> should mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his Murtherer. Above all this (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) I pay too-transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a respect, not only to all which the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> esteems, but to what
also belongs unto her, to act any thing to the prejudice thereof; and 'tis
upon that score I have hitherto attempted nothing against my own Life,
which evidently evinces she has still a power over me, by being capable
to make mine so great a Torment, and by then restraining me from ending
it without her permission: Neither can I apprehend any trouble from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
an omission which was dictated by Honour, by Reason, and
(which is more than both those) by that Duty I owe my Princess, which
is the Name I must eternally give her; as Kings, though unjustly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from their Crowns, cease not to call them so, nor to have a right unto
them, which want of possession cannot prejudice. He gave me, Madam
(I continu'd) as pregnant Arguments as these, which I purposely omit,
not only because the less reason was in his performance, the more it had
of Merit; but also because his actions will give you a better Character of
his Heart than his words can. But at last when the peremptory Command
came from <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Death; Great gods! you only know how it
struck <hi>Artavasdes;</hi> but I do, that his loving so much <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera</hi>
so much hating him, would have made him consider that fatal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with less horror, had it been sent for <hi>Artavasdes</hi> instead of his Rival.
But the former's unfortunate condition hindering him to visit <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and
to act publickly for his safety; he sent for the generous <hi>Ventidius,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
him to let <hi>Pacorus</hi> escape, in terms so pressing, that I can truly say, I
was as much affected with them, as he which deliver'd them. <hi>Ventidius</hi>
represented to him, how much the concession of his Request would turn
to his own prejudice; but finding that would not operate, he let him
then know how much it would be to <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s own. This mov'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
much more than the former, but nothing so much as did the fair
<hi>Altezeera</hi>'s satisfaction, which to effect, he afterwards sent for me, and
violently protested, That if <hi>Pacorus</hi> lost his Life, he would not survive
him, since that was the only evincement he had in his power, that he
was free from so horrid a Sin. This resolution I read as visibly in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96335:192"/>
his Heart, as words, and acquainted <hi>Ventidius</hi> with it, who more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in his Friend than in himself, yielded to his desires. Never, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
did I see <hi>Artavasdes</hi> so fill'd with Joy as at that assurance, no, not
when he was in the blessing of your Affection; which made me conclude
he esteem'd it a more transcendent Felicity to make you happy, than to
be made so by you. 'Twas thus, Madam, that <hi>Pacorus</hi> was deliver'd both
from Captivity and Death, and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to avoid the possibility of
drawing his sacrilegious Sword against the object of your Passion, did as
absolutely abandon the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, as the felicity of Life, which for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
these four Years he has never relisht, nor indeed any but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from this last Service he has pay'd you, and which he earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd
me to conceal from your knowledg, electing rather to be still
thought Guilty, than appear the contrary to cloud and suspend your Joys.
I had no sooner done speaking, than the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> with some Tears
cry'd out, Oh gods! <hi>Parasmanes,</hi> Is all this possible which you have told
me? I was going to reply and assure her, it was not only possible, but
true, when I might perceive <hi>Pacorus</hi> and the rest of the Company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards us; I gave <hi>Altezeera</hi> notice of it, who otherwise was so
intent on her Thoughts, that she had not minded the Prince's Arrival;
but as soon as she did, pulling down her Vail, she endeavour'd the best
she could to conceal her Disorder. I could not abstain from repining
at this cruel interruption, for I was confident in the heat of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s
confusions, to have discover'd the quality and greatness of them, which
probably in a more setl'd Temper, her Vertue, or Judgment, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
her to conceal. Assoon as <hi>Pacorus</hi> and the rest had join'd us, he
began by many Raileries to make a War against me, for having so long
ingross'd the Princess; but I had too many sad and confus'd thoughts,
to make him any frequent returns of that nature, which the sooner end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Walk: But alas, I had afterwards much more occasion to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at <hi>Pacorus</hi> interrupting us, than I then had, since for above a
quarter of a Year after, I never had the opportunity of entertaining
<hi>Altezeera</hi> without Witnesses; Yet I observ'd from that day forwards,
she was more pensive and melancholly, than she had been; and if she
avoided my conversation, 'twas more from a desire of being alone, than
from any aversion she seem'd to have unto it. All this tedious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ime I
past in more tedious sufferings; but at length there happen'd an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by which, if I had not been destin'd to have been my own Enemy
as much as the Gods have been, I might have discover'd my Fate, and
perhaps have found it as full of Felicity, as now 'tis of Torment. The
Prince <hi>Pacorus</hi> was extreamly addicted to hunting the wild Bore, but
commonly before the Huntsmen forc'd him out of the Forest, he would
place himself in a Stand, to Shoot. This Recreation he one day invited me
to, and plac'd me with a Javelin in a Stand within call of his. The King,
the Princess, and all the Court were in a large Plain which inviron'd the
Forest; but whilst we were in expectation of the Bore, I hear a clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Swords, and suddenly after my name repeated, twice or thrice by
<hi>Pacorus.</hi> I instantly leapt out of my Stand, and ran towards his, where
I found him assaulted by three men in Disguises, one of whom he had
pierc'd with his Arrow, yet not so mortally, but that with the help of the
other two, he himself was reduced to such extremity, that apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I could not come time enough to his relief, (which truly I may say I
embrac'd without balancing) I cry'd out, 'twas <hi>Pacorus;</hi> my voice
was no sooner heard, than one of the three came running to me with
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:96335:192"/>
his Sword in his hand, and told me, 'twas <hi>Pacorus</hi> they meant; This
Declaration made me meet him, which made it half-way, and darting my
Javelin at him, pierc'd him through and through, and nail'd him to the
ground; immediately I seiz'd upon his Sword, and came so timely to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi>
that by the Wounds he had already receiv'd, he was even sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down under their burthen: but I not only presented him with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
but Victory: for one of the remaining two, I found so weaken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to
my hand, that I esteem'd his condition unworthy my Sword, if his Crime
had not made him the contray; and the other frighten'd by the Death
of his Companions, was kill'd almost as easily, as he justly deserv'd
it. The generous <hi>Pacorus,</hi> though he wanted strength to dispute his
Life, yet did not, to come and acknowledg by words and Embraces,
that 'twas from me he had now twice deriv'd it; but in so gallant a
Gratitude, he had so overstrain'd himself, that he fell speechless as
he was performing it. I durst not forsake him in that extremity, lest by
wanting my assistance, his seeming Death might have turn'd into a real
one; and lest some further Complices in this fact, might, whilst I went to
call for help, have render'd him past any; whilst I was in this perplexity,
the Boar by another way had quitted the Forest; and a Gentleman which
waited on the Plain, came to advertise the Prince of it, and to bring him
his Horse; but he was so frighten'd at the strange accident, and at the
stranger condition his Lord was in, that turning about, he ran full-speed,
and gave the Alarm of it to <hi>Arsaces, Altezeera, Phraates,</hi> and all the
Court: and though they suddenly came to the place where this Tragedy
had been acted; yet by some fresh water which I fetch'd from a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Fountain, I had brought him from his swound; I cannot tell
you the general regrets and mournings of all the Company, especially
those of the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> which though they infinitely transcended all
the others, yet they could not Mine, by observing they did so. But after
<hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Wounds were bound up, as well as the place did permit (which
he would not until three slight ones I had receiv'd were dress'd before
his, till he had told the particulars of this accident, and the service
I had render'd him) all the Court and my Princess too, came and made
me retributions too long and too flattering to be repeated; which
were no sooner ended, than <hi>Phraates</hi> taking some others with him, went
to pull off the Disguises of those dead Traytors, to learn who they were;
but their Faces were as strong a disguise as their Vizards, being both alike
unknown. This news being brought to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> he had their Heads ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, and fix'd upon short Poles at the Gates of <hi>Seleutia,</hi> where 100
Talents were proclaim'd for whosoever should discover who they were,
or who had employ'd them. Whilst this was a-doing, a Litter was
brought to the Prince, who was carry'd in it to <hi>Seleutia;</hi> but my Wounds
being less for number and danger, by my Princesses command I rid
with her thither in her Chariot, and there being none in it besides,
after she had somewhat moderated her Tears, she began a-fresh to give
me new Torments by new expressions of her Gratitude; but observing
I took no relish in them, which she attributed to my Modesty (but
which alas proceeded from another cause) she told me; If <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi>
your Friend have still those inclinations for me which he once had
and which you would still perswade me he has, I believe he will esteem
you as little his in this days performance, as I must by it acknowledg you
infinitely Mine. I am confident, Madam (I reply'd) The Service I have paid
you cannot more satisfie you, than it will him, who I know, if he thought
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96335:193"/>
this were not really the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Judgment, would be thereby
more dangerously wounded than <hi>Pacorus</hi> is. 'Tis now, Madam (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd)
that I must conclude my Friends fortune desperate, when that
excellence which is to form it, believes surmises against him, more
than Demonstrations for him; and (Madam) if that which he did for
you in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and that which I have this Day perform'd on
his score, are not pregnant Arguments enough for an Innocence which
Ambitions no higher a Reward for being so, than to be thought so; I
leave you to Judg, whether my despair for <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> be not too suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grounded. <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who observ'd I could not utter these words
without sympathizing in their sadness, and truth, was so generous as to
reply; If (<hi>Pharasmanes</hi>) what you tell me of your Friend, be what
you desire I should credit, I will do it, though perhaps the strongest
motion which induces me to it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill be your satisfaction. Madam (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd),
I had much rather you would believe it for your own, which
would bring no small accession to mine; and which to invite you to the
more powerfully, I dare protest by all the gods, and by that which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
adores as much, that if he will resent any trouble at what I have
this Day perform'd, it will proceed only from his not having paid you
the duty. <hi>Altezeera</hi> blusht at this assurance; and as she was about to
make me a reply, the Prince <hi>Phraates</hi> (who rid) came to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot-side
to console his Sister; but his words could not so much
do it, as his looks did the contrary, which carry'd in them so
visible and contagious a sorrow, that then I began to assume an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him, which the Character I had of him, and his earliest Actions
had made me thitherto deny him; which affection you may imagine was
not small in its very Birth, when it was not supprest, though I had
thereunto so much invitation, as his hindering me all the way to <hi>Selutia</hi>
from entertaining my Princess. The Night that succeeded this Day, I
took no rest, more from the trouble of my Mind, than my Wounds,
which indeed was more hurt than my Body; 'twas during the Night
that I had more leasure to reflect on the admirable Revolutions of the
day, which forc't me to say, Great gods! what has the miserable <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
done, that makes you so ingenious to persecute him? was it such
a Crime to adore what was your excellentest Work, and most resembl'd
you as well in perfection, as in tormenting me? was to be constant to a
virtuous flame, a Sin? if neither of these can bear that Name, 'tis with
injustice that I bear your plagues; for I am guilty of no other offences:
was it not enough that you made <hi>Pacorus</hi> ravish my Right, my Reward,
and my Felicity from me, but you must afterwards constitute me his
Tutulary-Angel? and not only make me present whensoever any danger
threaten'd him, but make me also preserve his life, and in so unfortunate
a way too, as not in that performance to lose my own; there could not
be a higher torment than to save a successful Rival, unless it were to
out-live that act: both these yet you have made my Destiny, and you
are not content with this, but that little satisfaction which attends so
much suffering you deprive me of, by rendering my concealment neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
You can make me undertake the danger, but you will not suffer
me to receive the Reward: The revealing of Innocency, which to others
is a recompence, to me must be a Punishment as great as Guilt; for the
Reward which attends the disclosing of mine, will be the trouble of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeera,</hi>
and the Banishment of <hi>Artavasdes;</hi> To continue neer her, I
must be unworthy that Honour; and to make my self appear worthy of,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96335:193"/>
I must be banish't from it; if I remain near <hi>Pacorus,</hi> I am eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin'd
to preserve him; and if I go from him, I must lose that sight which
preserves me. Great gods! either put a period to your Cruelty, or to
that Life which is the object of it; for whilst you continue both, you
cannot make me more miserable, than you make your selves unjust,
These irreligious reasonings ended not, but with the Night; and the
Day was as full of torment, though <hi>Altezeera</hi> did visit me; for she did it,
as she her self told me, to obey <hi>Pacorus:</hi> And alas! though it were to
me, yet it was not to <hi>Artavades;</hi> My cruel Fate made me still <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
when 'twas to receive a punishment, but when 'twas to enjoy a
blessing, it made me <hi>Pharasmanes.</hi> Whilst <hi>Pacorus</hi> and I were healing
of our Wounds, I receiv'd such incessant Obligations from him, that I
found my self as much ty'd to him by Resentment, as by Fate; and the
higher Powers did every day so far remove me from my hopes, that I
began not to despair, but thereby I should remove my self from their
Cruelty: but I had no sooner form'd so flattering an expectation, than
they immediately ruin'd it, and by that infinite Power they shew'd in
tormenting, they manifested, they only wanted the Will to oblige me;
which alas, I fear'd was as great a deficiency, as if both were wanting.
That (my generous Friends, continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) which I have now
to tell you, will perhaps make you think what I have said, proceeds
from my reason, not my irreligion: for though by an internal Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I was so much pin'd away, that the Physicians assur'd me, if in few
dayes there did not happen as strange an alteration in one extream, as
there had happen'd in the other, my recovery would be a fitter subject
for their Prayers, than Art; yet I struggl'd with my infirmity, not to
conquer, but to contribute to its Victory; and therefore 'twas that every
day I constantly waited on the Prince, and Princess, in their several Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments;
who were both so Generous, as to be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>initely concern'd
in my visible Declination. One afternoon I went to the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>
to pay her a visit; but some of her Servants told me she was newly gone
to <hi>Regeliza</hi>'s, who, (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) I forgot to tell you, continu'd
her Mistresses favour, and was married to a great Lord in <hi>Selutia;</hi> she
being in extream danger in her delivery, had passionately beg'd from
<hi>Altezeera</hi> the Honor of a visit, since probably (as she said) 'twas the
last time she should ever receive it. This News did exceedingly trouble
me, because I knew it did the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> whose return I resolv'd to
expect in her own Appartment, not only as the distance between hers,
and mine was such, that my weakness made my going to my own, and
return to hers, a greater trouble than my attending could amount unto;
but also I elected the latter to learn the certainty of <hi>Regeliza</hi>'s condition,
in which both positively and relatively I was not a little concern'd. I had
not continu'd two Hours in this Expectation, when the Princess return'd,
but with Eyes so fill'd with Tears, that I too suddenly read in that effect
the cause of it: As soon as she was come into the Chamber, in which
I waited for her, all her Servants withdrew themselves, and finding they
did it as duty to her Grief, I was going to imitate them; which as soon
as she observed, she told me, You may stay <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> if your going
away proceeds from any consideration of me. Madam (I reply'd) the
deep sadness which I too visibly perceiv'd in your Looks, makes me
conjecture the cause of it is the Death of <hi>Regeliza,</hi> whom I know you
too justly deplore to offer yet, or hope to lessen, or interrupt your Tears.
'Tis true (said <hi>Altezeera) Regeliza,</hi> and the Son she went with, are both
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:96335:194"/>
Dead, but she has told me something before her Death, which has but
too powerfully consol'd me for it, and which perhaps if you knew, you
would confess if there were any Justice in my shedding some Tears for
her loss, it should proceed from a contrary cause, than to that you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
them to; I have (<hi>Pharasmanes</hi>) my heart too much contracted to
tell you now what it is that does it; but if to morrow you will visit me,
you shall know what I believe will invite you to excuse my not being
able to acquaint you with it now. <hi>Altezeera</hi> had no sooner ended those
words, than in fresh weepings she did retire hastily into her Cabinet;
and it being somewhat late, I did to my Chamber, where I past the
Night in a thousand several conjectures what this strange accident might
be; but it so perfectly merited that Name, that I was so far from ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
it, as I could hardly believe it, when <hi>Altezeera</hi> told it me. At
length, as soon as the impatiented hour came, I went to the Princesses
Appartment; I found her on her Bed all alone, and in passions of Grief
which transcended those I had left her in, which thereby I concluded
had a high cause, when a proportionate Judgment and Fortitude made
time bring an accession to them. The Chamber (though it were day)
had nothing of Light in it, but what it receiv'd from a few silver Lamps;
and the Princess, who as soon as she saw me, and that none else was in
the Room (which she had expresly given charge of) she told me, Come
<hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> and see the miserablest Creature living; one which so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possesses that Name, that though the gods granted me my wishes, they
could not yet divest me of it. Would to the gods. Madam (I reply'd,
struck to the heart with those sad words) that my Death could restore
you your quiet, you should soon and experimentally know, there is
nothing so dear unto me. No <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> (she said) 'tis my Death,
not yours, must restore my quiet, if any thing has that power; nor
would I be long from receiving that remedy, did I not apprehend it
would prove none to me: I must <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> I must languish in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for they are as fit for my Crime, as my Justification; but that
you may know my despair is just, I must communicate a secret to you;
though I apprehend your knowledg of it will infect you with so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
a sorrow, that it may even bring an accession to mine. <hi>Regeliza</hi>
(the Princess continu'd) finding her self past hopes of recovery, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
me by so many several Messages to come and visit her, that
at last I did it, though I fancy'd all the effect it would produce, would
only be an aggravation of my Grief, and no diminution of hers, which
alas, though in a different way, prov'd too sad a Truth: I was no sooner
come into her Chamber, than she desir'd all the rest to leave it; and
then with some deep sighs, she thus told me: I should (Madam) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of the gods pardon in the other World, did I leave this without
obtaining yours, and though what I have committed be of a quality
which was authoriz'd by duty, and extenuated by the event, yet I cannot
but call it a Crime, and nothing shall make me term it otherwise, but
your esteeming it none; which if you do, I shall leave the World with
as little regret, as if you do the contrary, I shall with horror. Know,
Madam, That not long after <hi>Artavasdes</hi> went to <hi>Rome, Artabazus</hi> sent for
me privately into his Closset, where after all those flatteries which he
thought most effective, he told me; <hi>Regeliza,</hi> My satisfaction and that of
<hi>Armenia,</hi> now entirely is in your hands, both of them consist in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Passion which is between my Sister and <hi>Artavasdes.</hi> Whilst I
consider'd <hi>Tygranes</hi> as my Successor, I was as much concern'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:96335:194"/>
of that Marriage, as now I am in the interruption: Whilst
<hi>Altezeera</hi> was like to be a subject, I esteem'd none that was so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more
worthy of her, than him she had elected: but since <hi>Tygranes</hi> Crimes
both against me and the <hi>Romans,</hi> has render'd him as unworthy my care,
as their Mercy; I consider <hi>Altezeera</hi> now as what she shall be, and in
that quality I cannot without horror contemplate her placing her self in
a lower degree by her election, than the Gods and Nature have destin'd
her unto; nor in one performance so much injure my Sister, as to deprive
her of her best Subject, to make her self one. This (continu'd <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>)
I would have told <hi>Artavasdes</hi> before his departure, had I not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
his despair would have involv'd <hi>Armenia</hi> in new Wars, and
that <hi>Altezeera</hi> was too far ingag'd in her Passion and Vows, to let any
political consideration absolve them; I therefore elected to effect that by
Art, which I concluded was any other way unfeizable; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Artavasdes</hi> departure, pretending a flame for a new Mistris, and that
she would not be convinc't of it, but by a slighting Letter to my former,
and an assurance of my Passion to her self under my hand: one day in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
sight I so well counterfeited an indisposition to Write, and so
extol'd his Stile above my own, that having acquainted him with what
I have you at length, I procur'd two Letters from him, to those effects I
desir'd and mention'd, which I said I would copy; but which indeed I
have reserv'd for another use; for by their help and yours, I make no
question but to raise such a Fraction between the Lovers, as nothing but
a miracle shall discover it, or unite them. This (said <hi>Artabazus</hi>) I have
done by the advice of <hi>Crassolis,</hi> who is confident (and so am I) if you will
place <hi>Artavasdes</hi> Cypher on one of the Letters, and contribute to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of it by a Servant of his, whom we have suborn'd for that effect,
and who will leave him in his Journey to <hi>Rome;</hi> it may shake her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
which soon after we my ruine, if the other Letter which addresses
it self to his new Mistris, be presented to <hi>Altezeera</hi> by you, as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
found in <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s Closet, who we have thought the fittest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to give <hi>Altezeera</hi> a jealousie, not only for her perfections, but that
<hi>Artavasdes</hi> before his leaving <hi>Armenia,</hi> so assidiously visited her, though
we know 'twas on <hi>Phanasders</hi> score. This will doubtless produce the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
we mention; and when it has, I will engage the Prince <hi>Pharn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ces,</hi>
the great <hi>Mithridates</hi> Son, to make his addresses to her, which in the rage
of her Lovers inconstancy, will certainly prove successful; and when once
she is Married, I will not much apprehend the disclosure of the Fallacy.
If (continu'd <hi>Artabazus</hi>) you esteem of my Friendship, you will not deny
me this proof of yours; and if you value <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s advantage, you will
grant it me upon that score; neither can your refusal prevent it; for if you
should reject this Design, you will but constrain me to act it a more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and perhaps bloodier way; for I am determin'd (at whatsoever rate)
to perform my intentions. This was the effect (Madam, continu'd <hi>Regeliza</hi>)
of what <hi>Artabazus</hi> spake to me, though he gave me more large and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Arguments for my Obedience, than my memory or weakness will
permit me to repeat; but though I had the fortitude to resist his presents
and flatteries; yet I had not to oppose that which he alledg'd was for your
Advantage: there (Madam) he assaulted me where I was least able, and
least willing to resist; neither could he have made me an Enemy to your
desires, but by convincing me that therein I was a Friend to your power
and honour; I had this consolation, that nothing could make me prejudice
you, but for your advantage; nor does a Physician merit his Patients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96335:195"/>
for depriving him a while of health, to restore him thereby to a
more perfect one. But, Madam, I will not so much as think there are any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for my Justification, lest you should believe there are none for
my Pardon; for I would not have so sensible an addition to the Misery of
being deny'd it, as to know 'twas done so against reason. To be brief,
Madam (for I find my Death hastens) to serve you as I thought, to obey
my King, and to preserve <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> whose Death was obliquely threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
by him, and who I thought you would be less displeas'd to see live in
your hatred, then dye in the honor of your esteem and love; I finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
to act what I could not hinder; but yet in expectation, that
time might produce some as strange Revolutions in <hi>Artavasdes</hi> favour, as
it has done to his prejudice; and that <hi>Artabazus</hi> might be converted, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him and <hi>Crassolis</hi> (who was all this while present) that 'twere best
only at first to give you the Letter, which was to acquaint you with <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
change, and then a good interval between, to present you the other,
which was to acquaint you who had occasion'd it; for if they were deliver'd
both at once, it might relish of design; and besides the latter coming, when
the first had shaken your Constancy, it might find the less difficulty to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it. I believ'd, Madam, the first of these would not thrust you to what
they both might; and that if you were not anothers, there was still left
you at any time, in shewing you <hi>Artavasdes</hi> Innocence, the Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it. 'Twas thus, Madam, that the constant <hi>Artavasdes</hi> was betray'd,
whose false Servant <hi>Allaner</hi> presented you with that false Letter, which had
so strange an influence on you, and which I abundantly contributed unto,
till I saw how much it hazarded your Life by that dangerous sickness
it cast you into, a little before <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s besieging <hi>Tygranocerta:</hi> You
know (Madam) that during your indisposition, I took <hi>Artavasdes</hi> part to
make it cease; and you confest 'twas I which restor'd you to health, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
you to hopes, that the cruel Letter had something of mysterious in
it, which I undertook to discover, and which I had done, but that your,
and the general danger, with <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s transcendent Gallantry and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
made me esteem that generous Prince had a better Title to you in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
respect, than <hi>Artavasdes</hi> had; and that to disclose we betray'd him, had
been to betray you, who I resolv'd the gods favour'd in no small degree,
since by so strange a way they lead you to so noble an end, and converted
even the very treachery of your Friends into your Advantage. 'Twas
therefore (Madam) that feigning once an indisposition at <hi>Theoxcena</hi>'s, I
continu'd all night there, and made you believe at my return, that I had
found that Letter there which I had brought thither, and which I then
presented you with a superscription. Cypher to it of my own Invention:
But alas! I soon repented it, when it cast you into that violent fever; and
I was a thousand times upon the point of disclosing all unto you; But
then the certain ruine of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and the as certain of the generous <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi>
with your miraculous recovery, which you told me proceeded from
your having as absolutely banisht <hi>Artavasdes</hi> from your heart, as he had
you from his; and your esteeming your self oblig'd, if not out of Love, yet
out of Gratitude, to give your self unto <hi>Pacorus,</hi> silenc'd that resolve by
which you have enjoy'd a felicity, that I hope will be no small induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to procure a pardon for so successful a crime and event, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which I shall leave the World in Torments, which perhaps will inspire
you with as great a repentance for having impos'd them on me, as me for
having merited them. Neither (Madam) is it one of the meanest services my
Insidelity has done you, to preserve <hi>Artavasdes</hi> Life, who without what I
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:96335:195"/>
did, had tasted of that fatal Cup, which has sent his Father into another
World. <hi>Regeliza</hi> had no sooner ended speaking, than she did her Life
(though she seem'd to have something more of high concernment to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me of); but she had that consolation to do it doubtful of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
which had she liv'd, she would but too visibly have observ'd.
This (<hi>Pharasmanes</hi>) is the cause of those Tears you have already seen, and
which can never cease till their source be exhausted; if I resent any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by <hi>Regeliza</hi>'s Death, 'tis that it affords me a cloud for my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and makes the World believe she is the object of my weepings, when
alas she is the cause. You see by this I am convinc't of your Friends Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and I hope you are so of mine; I am miserable, <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> more
than faulty; but perhaps I shall not appear so to <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who may
think my believing him capable of change, as great a crime, as I find it a
punishment. Alas (<hi>Pharasmanes</hi>) I am in fears as great as my griefs; Not to
let him know I have discover'd he is Innocent, may continue him in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as high as mine, when I thought he was not; and to let him continue
his belief of me, is to invalidate this miraculous discovery, and render his
hate almost as great a Justice in him, as misery to me. Great gods! (she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd)
why did you not make me believe <hi>Artavasdes</hi> innocent, when I
had the power to reward his being so? and why did you make me know
he is so, when I am divested of that Power? But doubtless it will be a less
affliction to the generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to be satisfi'd, I want not the will, but
the ability to recompence his virtue, than if I wanted both. 'Tis therefore
(<hi>Pharasmanes</hi>) I have desir'd this visit from you, that you will by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
acquaint your Friend with my unfortunate Story: I dare not do it, in
apprehension my Letter might miscarry; besides, I am too full of grief to
describe it, and perhaps of seeming guilty to be credited; Tell him (<hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmanes</hi>),
Oh tell him all that the highest sorrow ever dictated, and tell
him all that is short of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s, the greatness of whose Torment, if he
suspects, because it has not yet destroy'd her, tell him, That that it self is a
transcendent argument of its being so, and that I would curse its lingring,
did I not cherish all things as a desirable Justice, which punishes my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Inconstancy. I believe generous Friends (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>)
you do not wonder that all this Time I interrupted not her discourse,
which fill'd me with so much amazement, grief, and joy, that I had hardly
life enough left to hear her; but as soon as she had put a period to it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to do the like unto my disguise; for I esteem'd, though the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Artavasdes</hi> needed one to approach his Princess, yet the innocent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
did not. 'Twas therefore after a short debate, prostrating my self
before her, I told her, Your Commands, Madam, to <hi>Pharasmanes</hi> are obey'd;
he has already acquainted <hi>Artavasdes</hi> with all that you have acquainted
him with, and would to the gods it had been by Letter, and not Sight; for
no description of Grief could equal this evidence of it; I had rather have
fanci'd it less than 'tis, than be so sensibly convinc't of its greatness. Whilst
I was thus speaking, the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> rais'd her self up a little; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while attentively consider'd me, she said; Alas <hi>Pharasmanes!</hi> what
operation will this discovery have on the poor <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> when I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it has had so fatal a one on you? This she spoke, believing by the
distemper of my looks, and the strangeness of my words, that my mind had
participated in the disorders of my heart; but I soon took her out of that
perplexity, though it cast her into a higher, for I reply'd, Though this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
(Madam) has a transcendent influence over me, yet I am not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as to have it increase to that height which you believe it has reacht;
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:96335:196"/>
for to lose my senses, were a less misery, than to have them employ'd as now
they are. Yes, my Princess, give me leave to assume that Name, now I have
assum'd my Innocence; I had much rather be eternally depriv'd of reason,
than have so much, as to find it a Misery; you will be (Madam) but too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
convinc'd of both these Truths, when I let you know, that I am
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who in the hopes of manifesting my Innocence, have indur'd
as transcendent Torments as could attend a proportionate guilt. The
troubles you resent at this disclosure, makes me say this; and I shall do
the like of all my greatest blessings, if they produce such fatal effects. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the gods bestow any on me, if they must be built on your suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
Those cruel Powers know this Truth too well, not to practice it; and
they are so infinitely concern'd to afflict the unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> that
they make the revealing of Innocence as great a punishment as the want
of it. I said this while I only reflected on the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Tears; but
alas! I had much more cause to say it, than I had when I did: for after I had
utter'd a World of expressions of this quality, lifting up my Eyes to my
Princess, I perceiv'd her all pale and moveless. This unexpected and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
misfortune, cast me into strange perplexities; and fearing left <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera</hi>'s
Women were too far to give her relief, I endeavour'd it my self by
all those wayes I had heard practic'd to recover one from a Swound: But
alas! all my attempts were fruitless, and she lay with as little Life as I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desir'd; but the horror thereof had so efficacious an influence over
me, that what with my precedent distempers, and this accession to them;
I fell into a resembling indisposition; and being upon my Knees on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
Bed, when I went to give her my assistance, my faintness surprising
me in that posture, I fell down by her, one of my Arms also being under
her Body to support it, continu'd so during my Swound; and had not the
sad state we were both in, evinc't the cause of it, I might have been as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Envy, as we were of Pity. I tell you this (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) the
more particularly, because of that unfortunate effect it might and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce:
for while I lay in this senseless but happy posture, <hi>Phraates</hi> came to
visit <hi>Altezeera;</hi> and no sooner perceiv'd her in my Arms, than he did also
the occasion of it: but that wicked Prince, delighting as much to destroy
virtue, as he should have done to preserve it; having first extinguisht all
the Lamps but one (for I found them so when I recover'd, and by what he
did, I justly conclude he did this too, though I have yet no other proof of
it but by inference) he went hastily to <hi>Labienus</hi> Appartment, which was
contiguous to the Princess's, and there told him in a counterfeit sadness,
he had made a fatal discovery of his Brothers dishonour, which he beg'd
him to come and be a Witness of, for otherwise the deep opinion he had
contracted of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s virtue, might by making him suspect his own
Eyes, contribute to the prolonging of her Crimes, and <hi>Pacorus</hi> disgrace.
<hi>Labienus</hi> struck to the very Soul with this strange intelligence, askt <hi>Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates</hi>
what proof he had of it. Alas (he reply'd) but too too much: for
but even now going to visit <hi>Altezeera,</hi> I found her in <hi>Pharasmanes</hi> Arms;
It seems the joys and extacies they had relisht, had mutually stupified their
Senses, so that I surprised them asleep in the Scene of their lust. <hi>Labienus</hi>
found it a hard thing to believe <hi>Altezeera</hi> guilty of such a Crime, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being accus'd of it by so known an Enemy to virtue, as he was resolv'd
<hi>Phraates</hi> was; therefore to silence his malice or his own doubts and fears,
he went with him to <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Appartment, where his Guide conjur'd
him to make no noise, nor continue, lest it might waken us; which
<hi>Labienuss</hi> having promis'd, <hi>Phraates</hi> first looking into the Chamber to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:96335:196"/>
discover whether we were still in the same Posture, which he did, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
brought in <hi>Labienus,</hi> and so artificially interpos'd himself in the
light of the Lamp, that it shone not at all on our Faces, which if it had,
would have discover'd the Truth; but on our Bodies, which confirm'd the
wicked <hi>Phraates</hi> Fiction; but yet <hi>Labienus</hi> (as the gods would have it)
observing it, askt <hi>Phraates</hi> why he did so? Who reply'd, lest the light,
by shining in our Eyes, might wake us whilst they were present; and then
immediately hearing us breathe, led off <hi>Labienus,</hi> who was so strangely
perplext at that fatal sight, that by the strange operation it had on him,
he concluded 'twas not fit to tell it his Prince till he was more recover'd
of his Wounds, if it were fit to tell him at all. <hi>Phraates</hi> as absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
with him in the first of his resolutions, as he oppos'd the latter,
which he said was in effect to be guilty of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s and my Crimes; they
being also of such a quality, that to conceal, were to participate in them;
&amp; that 'twere better <hi>Pacorus</hi> should know his wrongs, to put a period to,
and revenge them; than by so fatal an ignorance omit both. <hi>Labienus</hi> on the
other side objected, That if his Prince's Misfortune was of a nature, that
to revenge, would efface it, there would be two inducements to it; but
since that which should revenge it, would not only make it publick, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible;
and that the highest good in such an ill, was, not to know it (since
there was no possibility of proving a Woman Chast); he esteem'd it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer
and better, to tell <hi>Altezeera</hi> of her Faults, that she might banish
both me and them; or by her doing neither, render the disclosure of her
offence so necessary, that the necessity of it, might render it a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
Justice. But <hi>Labienus</hi> durst not use too many reasons to prove
Silence was good, lest that might have prov'd one to <hi>Phraates</hi> not to keep
it. Whilst they two were disputing of our Sin, I came to my self again,
and discover'd that which gave a rise to one of them to call it, and to the
other to believe it one; but the restauration to Life had been much
worse than Death (where at least my griefs had ceas'd as well as my hopes,
which had been an advantagious bargain) had not immediately my
Princess too recover'd: for Nature finding none come to her assistance,
went to her own; Oh gods! How was I surpriz'd to find my self in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of Felicity, and not in a rellish of it! and how confounded was I
as well as <hi>Altezeera,</hi> to find how much more obliging the effects of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
had been, than those of my Constancy and Innocence! but alas!
I had much more cause to be so, when not only the Princesses Women
came running in to her assistance, but when they also found her in a high
Fever, that threaten'd to cast her into an eternal Death, as soon as she was
restor'd from a temporary one. So many witnesses hinder'd her from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me; and they beginning to undress her, hinder'd me from continuing
longer in the Chamber, which I left without receiving any other fruit of my
being Innocent, than the knowledg that it had been more for my quiet, I
had never been so. Ah, when I was retir'd to my appartment, what did I not
say against the cruel Destinies, which had form'd mine so perversly, that
transcendent punishments attended as well my real Fidelity, as my seeming
want of it? The next Morning, I knew by the publick voice of the Court
(for I durst neither satisfie my apprehensions or duty by a personal Visit,
or by employing any of my Domesticks to do it) that the Princess was in
a Fever, which by giving so little hopes in the beginning, made the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with tears apprehend the conclusion; but it was too violent to continue
long our suspensions, and I was satisfied of her recovery, before any symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of it, by knowing the gods would not give me so certain a cure of my
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:96335:197"/>
Misery, as the Death of my Princess, and consequently mine. At last her
Fever left her; when the Physicians had done so, and the generous <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
who had ty'd his Fate to <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s, began to cherish his own Life
when he was assur'd of hers, but till then he contributed all he could to
accompany her; and the more certainly to effect it, he had seiz'd on a
Poniard which he lay'd by him in expectation of the fatal News. 'Twas
in this I disclos'd (and perhaps <hi>Altezeera</hi> too) the disproportion of our
Passions; for I needed but the bare knowledg of her Death to act my
own; whereas <hi>Pacorus</hi> to reach his, must have been necessitated to make
use of his Resolution, as well as Love. It may be this knowledg invited
<hi>Phraates</hi> a while to a silence, which his Virtue would not have kept. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
and I, who were most concern'd in <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Health, as if it had
been by a sympathetical operation, recover'd our own proportionately as
she did hers. This was the cause that the first day I went into the Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Garden,
upon which my Appartment answer'd, <hi>Altezeera</hi> went thither
also ('twas the first time I had seen her since her sickness, or recovery)
I will omit my confusions and my disorders, whilst I congratulated the
latter; which as soon as I had, as if it had been without design, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
she separated her self from the Company: and after having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
some fresh convincements that I was <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> she acknowledg'd
no small joy that I was restored from a Sickness, which she justly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as a tribute to hers; but being determin'd not to lose so happy an
opportunity to learn my Fate, which the Authors of it too presented me:
I told her, If I consider, Madam, my recovery with any Joy, 'tis only
because you seem to do so, and out of a hope that that Life which has
by twice preserving <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s, twice establish'd the felicity of yours, is
still continu'd by the gods for the same end, though by the same way:
Yes, Madam, I am ready not only to employ my Life, but to lay it down
in so glorious an occasion, though it were as full of Felicities as in those
happy days wherein my Princess was as much mine by Promise, as she
is now my Rivals by possession. But, Madam, Did I not conclude the
gods restor'd my Health upon this, or some resembling-score, I should
esteem it as transcendent a Misery, as I shall a Blessing, if they have done
it for that end: Neither need I, for the only cure of my Miseries, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to my Resolution, but Reason, which convinces me, 'twere a less
Misfortune to have <hi>Artavasdes</hi> in the Arms of Death, than to have him
see the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi> in <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s. The gods shall be my Witnesses (she
reply'd, pulling down her Vail to cover her blushes) that if I yielded
not to my last Sickness, 'twas more upon <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s account than my
own; who had I known him still to be what he is, neither the safety or
satisfaction of <hi>Pacorus, Artabazus,</hi> or <hi>Armenia,</hi> should have made me ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his, or recede in the least degree from those professions, which his
Person, and Services, but much more my inclinations, induc'd me to make
him; but alas, the gods contributed to my delusion: You cannot doubt,
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> but 'twas one, and not a Design; for 'tis not rational that I
should willingly act what turn'd most to my own Torment; Yes (<hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>)
I say, my own Torment; Judg then what that grief must be,
which makes my being the Wife of so generous a Prince as <hi>Pacorus,</hi> be
esteem'd one by me; I have liv'd purposely to tell you this, for perhaps
you may resent some satisfaction by knowing, she that has divested you
of all your felicity, has in that very performance done the like to her
own. These words, and some Tears which accompanied them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were so
sensible to me, that I could not abstain from saying in a higher tone
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:96335:197"/>
than before: Great gods! Have not you already render'd <hi>Artavasde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
sufficiently miserable by the loss of his Princess's affection, but you must
make him more so by the restoration of it? And are you so inveterately
bent to continue me so, that rather than not act it, you will make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
produce the same effect? 'Tis now (Madam) I find, that the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my life, will be the most considerable Service it can render you;
You had never been unfortunate, had not the gods ty'd your Fate to
mine; remove the cause, and the effect will cease; That which restores
your quiet will settle mine; either of these inducements, especially the
former, will give me resolution and invitation enough to end it: Those
powers can have no more any pretence to afflict you, when you are as
single in your Fortune as in your Perfections: 'Tis not (Madam) my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
but (if it be permitted me to say it) my Love, which makes this
Motion; Nor can you give me a greater testimony, that I am in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of your esteem, than to enjoyn or permit me to oblige both of us in
one performance. Can you then believe (<hi>Altezeera</hi> reply'd, with a
Look which had something of resentment in it) that because I have lost
my Title to you, I have lost my concern for you? or, that what will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my sorrow unconsolable, will suppress it? Cruel <hi>Artavasdes</hi> if neither
of those are your Thoughts; why by so strange a motion do you invite
me to believe they are? The Death of the Innocent <hi>Artavasdes</hi> would
much more trouble me, than when I esteem'd him the guilty: That was
a loss which my then belief would have render'd none; But that which
he now threatens me with, is of a quality, that if I can receive any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
in it, it proceeds from the impossibility of my surviving it.
If, Madam (said I) the miserable <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Death, could either prove
a misfortune to you or to him, I am convinc'd by many experiments, that
the gods would have long since acted it; and their having so miraculously
kept me from it, proves abundantly 'tis a Blessing. But my Princess,
What then will you determine of a Life which you would confine me
from ending? Do not you then believe, that the horror of contemplating
you in the embraces of my Rival, will make my grief act that, which you
would tye my resolution from? And having now manifested my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
(which is not only the highest Blessing your condition permits
me to aspire unto, but the only, which made me so long languish out my
time) Permit me (my Princess) to die in your esteem, since I cannot in
a nobler Felicity; and since I can extend my Hopes no higher, why will
you let me any longer extend my Life? He dies not amiss (Madam) that
has nothing to expect, or desire; and your condition, and your Virtue
keeps me from both. Ah <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> she reply'd, you are not what your
words would make you, one that considers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o one's Felicity, but his
own; have you then nothing to hope or desire, when I have told you the
continuation of your Life is dear, and considerable to <hi>Altezeera?</hi> I have
almost as much cause to have spoke those words as you, and if I declin'd
them, 'twas upon the same score which I believ'd would have made you
do the like; We must <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> attend the leisure of the gods; if
there be no cause to hope in Reason, there is yet reason to hope in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
for they will not give so pregnant an Argument against their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
(which is themselves) as to let so perfect a Constancy as yours,
continue eternally fruitless. I was upon replying, when we found our
selves at the end of a Walk which answer'd another, where we perceiv'd
<hi>Pacorus</hi> with <hi>Phraates</hi> coming towards us; we therefore went to meet
him, where he again began to tax me of that in Railery, which alas too
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:96335:198"/>
soon lost that Name; for the next day that Gayety which proceeded from
his humour, and which might have much more from his condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to turn into so deep and obscure a Sadness, and so constantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
that to let you know how uncapable it was of intermission, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
none in the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Visits; who so exactly sympathiz'd in
his distempers, that she even assum'd them by deploring them; and the
gods thereby made me know that the cause of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Sicknes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, would
prove as transcendent a Misfortune, as the effect. This visible declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s, made what created it, as visible to <hi>Labienus;</hi> but his
judgment had been so infinitely deluded by his Sight, that what was a
production of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Love, he imputed to one of her shame; and in
this Faith so long continu'd that Error, that his Princess's Death had
like to have prov'd the punishment of it. But the gods, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere as much
concern'd in the preserving the felicity of <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Life, as the Torment
of mine, made the Princess one day send for <hi>Labienus,</hi> who she thought
knew <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s heart as absolutely, as she possess'd it; she receiv'd him in
her Cabinet, which having lock'd, she told him; <hi>Labienus,</hi> That my
Lord and yours has some strange distemper, is not more visible to me,
than I am certain the occasion of it is to you, for whom I am resolv'd he
has nothing of reserve. My Reason would perswade me I am the cause
of his Disorder, did not my Innocence more powerfully do the contrary;
for as often as I have conjur'd him to tell it me, he has only answer'd me
in Sighs and groans and thereby increas'd, instead of resolving my doubts;
'tis therefore that I apply my self to you for the latter: and to invite
you to it, I attest the gods, I can no longer be thought criminal, than I
am ignorant of my Crime; the knowledg of my offence, and of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
will be unseparable: Yes, <hi>Labienus,</hi> you cannot more certainly
absolve my guilt, than to let me know it. This I tell you, presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
I may be the innocent cause of his Disorder, which only his Silence,
and the vastness of his grief make me conjecture; but if it has another
Creation, I shall almost be satisfy'd in knowing he could grieve as much
for something else, as for <hi>Altezeera,</hi> since in that knowledg, I shall be
convinc'd she is not the occasion of giving him so much trouble. The
Princess told <hi>Labienus</hi> much more of this quality, who being thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
that he attributed her sorrow to a wrong cause, to obtain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for that fault, confess'd it; and having acquainted her with what I
have acquainted you, added, He was confident <hi>Phraates</hi> had disclos'd
all to his Brother, since nothing but a vast Distemper of the Mind, could
have so proportionate an influence on the Body, and that it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
reflected on her honour, that he could conceal it from her, or did
from him. To undertake to decypher <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s astonishment, or grief,
were to engage my self in impossibilities: but having a little collected
her Thoughts, and supprest her Resentments; she told him, I was not
then mistaken (<hi>Labienus</hi>) when I judged such violent effects, could
hardly proceed from any other cause but his Love; 'twas his Silence told
it me, but I had much rather his kindness had; that would have relish'd
of confidence, whereas this may of the contrary: I must too (<hi>Labie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>)
somewhat resent your proceeding; for if you thought me guilty,
your silence to your Lord was an offence to him; and if innocent, 'twas
one to me; but alas, how was it possible you could see us, and not see
us fitter objects for your sorrows, than suspicions? thereupon she told
him all that had happen'd, only concealing my true Name, and the real
cause of her fainting, of which mine was a consequence. This perhaps
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:96335:198"/>
was not very difficult to be believ'd, for all the Court knew the high affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<hi>Altezeera</hi> honor'd <hi>Regeliza</hi> with, whose death none imagin'd she
would deplore with less effects; and that I had in the weakness my sad
condition reduc'd me unto, often fallen into fits of swounding, was as
publick, and as known a Truth: <hi>Labienus</hi> somewhat convinc'd at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
but much more by that just Character he had of the Princess's
virtue, began to suspect this was something of design in <hi>Phraates,</hi> as well
as of misfortune in us; which he was the more confirm'd in, when after he
had told the Princess, that the reason why he had not discover'd our faces,
was, That there was but one Lamp in the Chamber, which also <hi>Phraates</hi>
hinder'd from shining on our Faces, left (as he alledg'd) it might wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
us. She told him, That there were at least a dozen lighted when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r
fainting had seiz'd on her; and that when all her Women came running in
to her assistance, they had (finding the Lamps had been extinguish'd,
and not gone out of themselves) admir'd at it, which she too did, after
she had been inform'd of it. <hi>Labienus</hi> having a little reflected on this,
confirm'd himself more and more in his former belief; and after a short
Silence, ask'd <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who had given her Women notice of her Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
The Princess having till then never enquir'd after it, nor had that
Curiosity; now observing <hi>Labienus</hi> was very intent on it, call'd in <hi>Aris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze</hi>
her Confident; and having understood from her, 'Twas a young
Courtier whose name she specified; immediately by <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s order she
withdrew her self again, and then <hi>Labienus</hi> told her; Madam, I am infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
mistaken, if I do not render your Innocence as clear as it is, or as
evident, as that malice which has clouded it. Alas (said the Princess)
I am more troubl'd to have it suspected, than how to have it clear'd; and
'tis something too near Vice, to be thought to be guilty of it; besides,
<hi>Labienus,</hi> that noble Virtue, Chastity, is like the Fundamentals in our
Religion, the highest are not to be prov'd, but believ'd. <hi>Labienus,</hi> who
burn'd with impatience to satisfie his desires, his duty, and his doubts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
in order thereunto, withdrew himself. <hi>Altezeera,</hi> having a while
seriously reflected on the intricacy and strangeness of the Adventure, and
on <hi>Pacorus</hi> deportment on it; at last form'd a resolution, which was, to
go and acquaint him with all she had discover'd; and either suppress his
Melancholly, or by not being able to perform it, not esteem it worthy
the continuation of hers. As she was upon the point of executing this
determination, <hi>Pacorus</hi> came to her all pale and trembling; but the
Princess could not be more astonish'd to see him abroad, whom she had so
lately left Sick and in Bed, than she was when he told her; (after having
first begg'd, and obtain'd her permission to lock the Door) Madam,
the apprehensions I have had lest you might place a wrong construction
on my grief, and believe my Jealousie for your Honour, might be one
of it; has forc'd me to come and tell you, what I have hitherto deny'd
unto your Commands; thereupon he inform'd her of all that <hi>Labie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
had: and having added that <hi>Phraates</hi> was his Intelligencer, he thus
continu'd; I attest the gods, Madam, if I resented any trouble at this
News, it was absolutely upon your score, and not my own; I knew
you of so nice a Virtue, that to be but thought guilty of a Sin, would
afflict you as much as any others being really so; that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of being thought innocent, when your way of Life could not do
you that right; and that you would almost esteem your Chastity a
Misfortune, since it caus'd as many Sinners, as Unbelievers of it: This,
Madam, by your Virtue, which cannot be greater than my belief of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96335:199"/>
it, only created my apprehensions; you will do me but right, if you are
confident 'tis more facile to invite me to believe that Vnchastness is a
Virtue, than that you can be guilty of it; neither do I expect any other
recompence from this Declaration, but that you will conclude I know
the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi> and consequently am resolv'd, that her receding from
Virtue is the impossiblest recession; and that no Crime can equal the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
her capable of any. This generous and just Declaration, wrought
so efficaciously on the Princess, that she reply'd, The gods have in some
measure repair'd the Misfortune they have impos'd upon me, in making
it the means of discovering a proportionate Blessing. Judg, Sir, of the
value I place on the Character you have given me of your affection and
confidence, when I can equal in degrees the joys of it, to the horrors
of Siu and Guilt. By this generous proceeding you have lay'd on me as
strict a Tye for the future, as my Virtue has for the past: Yes, (my Prince
she continu'd) this Obligation is of so particular a quality, that you
have render'd your self as uncapable to oblige me as highly again, as I
am of being so: For this one act of Faith makes another as impossible,
as needless; since 'tis not Faith, but Reason which will confine you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to conclude, I cannot be susceptible of any Impressions, but of
such as may reward and merit the cause of these. Whilst <hi>Altezeera</hi> was
making a Thousand such Retributions, they heard some body at the
Door, which being open'd, they found was <hi>Labienus,</hi> in whose Face
they observ'd some Gayety, <hi>Altezeera</hi> concluded was not causeless, and
had much more reason to believe so, when she heard him tell <hi>Pacorus;</hi> I
have (Sir) made use of your Name without your knowledg, but I hope
it will not be without your approbation, since it has produc'd a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that cannot but restore your health, since it will your confidence of
the Princess's Innocence. <hi>Pacorus</hi> at those words became as strangely
chang'd, as if <hi>Labienus</hi> had brought a contrary manifestation; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
furiously consider'd him, he interrupted his Discourse, by saying,
Who is't has told thee my doubts of the Princess's Innocence created my
Disorders? I now find thou hast ty'd thy Friendship to my Quality, not
Me; for thou could'st not have any for one thou esteem'dst capable of a
Sin, which would not only have render'd him unworthy of it, but of
Life; But that thou mayst not only know, but love me better, I will not
so much as listen to thee; there needs no greater proof that <hi>Phraates</hi> has
ly'd, than his accusing <hi>Altezeera;</hi> and the greatest Sin next to that, is to
believe she stands in need of a justification. <hi>Pacorus,</hi> who found his
Choler had somewhat transported him, begg'd his Princess's pardon for a
zeal which perhaps might carry its excuse in its cause. <hi>Labienus,</hi> though he
were very much troubl'd at his Prince's Rebuke, yet he was much more
the contrary, to observe what created it; and being more satisfy'd,
that <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Virtue needed no justification, than he was to have
found one, continu'd in a joyful Silence. But the Princess observing the
latter, told <hi>Pacorus,</hi> I must begg you (Sir) to command <hi>Labienus</hi> to
continue what you interrupted: for I am oblig'd to prove that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
which you have already by Faith: the latter ties me to
the former, and the former cannot prejudice the latter, but confirm it:
To believe me Innocent, after I had evinc'd I was so, could not be more
Just, than to believe I was so before I prov'd my self so, was obliging:
Had you thought me guilty, I might perhaps have left your Sin, your
Punishment; but your concluding me Innocent, invites me to reward
your believing it, by my proving it. Neither, Sir, is this upon your score:
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:96335:199"/>
for the way in which you have confer'd your Obligation, renders me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of returning it; 'tis therefore to satisfie the World, that I beg
<hi>Labienus</hi> may satisfie us: for those that have not Virtue enough, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I have none; and I should be sorry that my Virtue should be the
cause of other Mens Sin; and which was one of your fears, that your
granting my desires, will extinguish. <hi>Pacorus</hi> oppos'd this with many
pregnant Reasons, but they ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d only the better to illustrate his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
for at length he yielded to <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Commands, which as
<hi>Labienus</hi> understood, he told his Prince: After (Sir) I had learn'd
that the Princess's Women came in throngs to her assistance, I concluded
they had receiv'd an Advertisement of her Condition; and knowing as
absolutely none knew it but <hi>Phraates</hi> and I, as that they receiv'd it not
from me, I resolv'd it must come from him, which I was more confirm'd
in, when I learn'd from <hi>Arismaze,</hi> that both she and her Companions,
understood of the Princess's indisposition from the youngest of the <hi>Palu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's,</hi>
whose eldest Brother (as you know) waits on <hi>Phraates</hi> in his
Chamber, and is not little in his favour. The Faith I had, that they
were too well instructed in their Lessons to make a voluntary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of them, made me send privately for the younger to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
from whom, with some threatnings and promises in your Name, I
drew a confession that he had been employ'd by his elder Brother, to give
the Princesses Women notice of her Distress; I therefore immediately
sent for him, and retain'd my Insormer with me; whose Brother assoon as
he came, and saw him with me, fell into some Disorders, which I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
was an opportunity not to be omitted, and which I did so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
improve, that he confest to me upon my engagement, that <hi>Phraates</hi>
should never learn it; that by his Orders he had sent his Brother to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
the Princesses Women of her condition. This (continu'd <hi>Labienus</hi>)
I promis'd, because in the first place, I resolv'd 'twould be no small pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to <hi>Phraates,</hi> to perceive you were not mov'd with that which
he was confident would produce a contrary effect; and that 'twould be
no small advantage to you to know your Enemy, without his knowing
that you did so, which might in time furnish you with an opportunity, not
only by standing on your Guard to prevent the effects of his future Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
but by surprizing him in the attempts, make your punishing him for
this and his other offences, a publick Justice. <hi>Labienus</hi> having done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Altezeera</hi> told him, If this did as much evince my Innocence, as
<hi>Phraates</hi> Malice, you would then have satisfy'd your Ingagement; but
alas, this does not the former, but the latter. Madam (said <hi>Pacorus</hi>) it
is absolutely unnecessary; the gods are too just to let there be any other
proof of your Innocence, than your Innocence it self; it carries its own
justification so purely, that it leaves us no way to suspect you can Sin but
by our committing one, Sir (said <hi>Labienus</hi>) Though I am absolutely of
your opinion, yet because all have not the Virtue of <hi>Pacorus,</hi> or the
knowledg of <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s; it is not therefore Charitable, that missing those
Blessings, they should be permitted to endure the Curse of doubting her
Chastity; 'tis only upon that scor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I am solicitous to evince it, (which I am
confident I have in what I have already told you) for if <hi>Phraates</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
as he told me, that the Princess, and <hi>Pharasmanes</hi> were fallen asleep
by a stupifaction of their Senses through the excess of their Joys, what
needed he have sent in so many Witnesses, not helpers, of their condition,
which needed none? and if he knew (as both their succeeding and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Sicknesses manifested) that they were in a mutual fainting, what
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96335:200"/>
needed he so artificially have interpos'd himself between the light of that
one Lamp (he had left unextinguish'd) from shining on their Faces, which
if they had been asleep, would have the better prov'd his Allegation, as
their not being so, discovers his wickedness? These, Sir, (continu'd <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus</hi>)
had I no other inducement but my Judgment to clear the Princess,
would invite me sufficiently to do it; 'tis now no more Faith, but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and this discovery makes me suspect who 'twas so lately attempted
against your Life; for that Crime, and this, are so resembling, that perhaps
they may not be erroneously attributed to one Father. Truly (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>)
You have made some Inferences which I did not, because I was
concern'd not to make them: for 'twas more fitting, and (I am certain)
as secure, to credit <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s Innocence without any other proof but the
knowledg of her Life, which has been so immaculate, that her past Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the Testimonies of her future, as those will be of what are past;
like Prophecies, where things past, evidence those to come; and those to
come, will ascertain those which are past. I will not (continu'd <hi>Artavas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>)
deduce by particulars all the passages of this Conference, whose
event so clearly settl'd all Misunderstandings, that they all three separated
themselves with that satisfaction which their Virtues merited. <hi>Altezeera</hi>
had the contentment too, to receive an assurance from <hi>Pacorus,</hi> That had he
thought her Vicious, he could no longer have done so; and they then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to keep the discovery of <hi>Phraates</hi>'s Crime from his knowledg
upon those Reasons <hi>Labienus</hi> had alledg'd, who undertook so to husband
this Silence, as to make it of singular advantage. But alas, this Calm crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Storm against the unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes;</hi> for <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Virtue, by this accident receiv'd so strong an Allarm, that she deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
at whatever rate, to secure her self in the future from a resembling
one; but this determinaton was far more easie to be assum'd, than pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd;
and I had that consolation and infelicity to find 'twas with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
trouble to mine, that she resolv'd on my Banishment. Two
days she was in this conflict, where (as she told me) the Conqueror had
nothing of distinction from the vanquish'd, but the Title; Yet alas, that
very Title it self produc'd as powerful an effect over the Conquer'd, as
perhaps over any which bore that Name. And though <hi>Altezeera</hi> judg'd,
that what she was to perform, might create strange productions in me, yet
she determin'd to moderate their violence, by letting me know my Fate
in some such publick place, that the help of Shame should be added to
that of Fortitude: or if both those were not capable to silence them,
yet by the Scene on which they were represented, they might relish more
of the distemper of Body, than Mind; she did this too, the better to
palliate my design'd remove, which if acted after any private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
might appear rather like an Agreement, than the contrary. 'Twas
therefore one Evening, when she went to enjoy the fairness of it in the
Palace Gardens, she commanded me to wait on her; and though many
others of both Sexes did the like, yet she singl'd me out so artificially
from the rest, that it appear'd not to be so; but though she took much
care not to joyn the Company, yet she took at least as much to keep
in their sight; I observ'd both, and was not more satisfi'd with the one,
than troubled at the other. The Princess having walk'd a while in a
deep Silence, at length interrupted it (having first a little cover'd her
Face with her Vail, to conceal her Disorders) by saying; But <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes,</hi>
What end do you propose to your self by this way of Life? you
can expect nothing from me, which you may not be confident of at a less
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96335:200"/>
hazardous distance; and if by your residence here, you should be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
(for though you may disguise your Person, you can hardly you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Mind), alas, I shall contract such jealousies against my self, that to believe
me vicious, cannot perhaps be more difficult for you, than it will be for
others to do the contrary. This abrupt beginning, and the disorders
which preceded it, made my prophetick Soul soon fancy to what end
they all inclin'd; and though I more admir'd this misfortune did not
sooner arrive me, than that now it did, yet my expectations of it rather
prepar'd my amazement, than contributed to the suppression of it; I shall
not scruple (my generous Friends) to tell you, that I continu'd in as
long a silence after my Princess had spoke to me, as she had before she did
it; and though (it may be) my persevering in silence had been my best
way of Answer, yet I could not abstain from telling her; That (Madam)
which I propound to my self by this course of Life is to evince my Fire
is immaterial; that which lives without Nourishment may properly be
term'd so, and I have no hopes to feed mine with; Your virtue cannot
more absolutely suppress those, than mine does my desires: The gods too,
by your being <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s having left me no greater Ambition than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
your sight and conversation, 'tis no small blessing to possess all that
one is capable of, and that the unfortunate <hi>Artavasdes</hi> does by his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
near his Princess; who cannot apprehend his discovery, his now
Condition has disguis'd him better than Art; for whilst the fair <hi>Altezeera</hi>
affords him the honour of her esteem and civilities, he will be so far from
being known unto others, that he will hardly be so to himself. <hi>Altezeera,</hi>
who found she would need all her Forces to effect her design; and who
esteem'd <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s late proceedings too generous for a concealment, told
me, all that I have told you and then continu'd; Judg, <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> if this
merits not a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>portionate return; and if after this performance I am not
oblig'd by gratitude as well as duty, to that which I am confident upon
either of those scores you will not refuse me. That, Madam (I reply'd)
which <hi>Pacorus</hi> hath done, is fain'd, or real; if the former, he merits not
your care, and if the latter, my continuance here will not create his; do
not therefore my Princess, think upon a Banishment which cannot more
certainly prove the Death of <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> than bring no satisfaction to
him for whom you intend it. That <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Action (she reply'd) proceeds
entirely from the last, is not more certainly my belief, than my belief is
true; neither is there a more handsome way to prove I credit his Virtue,
than to reward it. Ah Madam (said I) can you call that a Reward of his
Virtue which gives a period to the actings of it; when you remove <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmanes,</hi>
you remove that which presents his its existence, and so rather
kill than oblige it; but 'tis not Virtue, but Reason, to believe you inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and consequently 'tis he is oblig'd to himself, not you to him; neither
is there merit to credit, what not to do so is a torment. Yet (said <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera</hi>
in recompencing <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s, I do but imitate the gods: for though
to believe the mysteries of Faith in Religion, is only to believe what we
cannot do otherwise without eternal Sufferings; yet the gods have allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a proportionate Beatitude for duration as the recompence of it;
There are some Virtues, which to put a period to their manifestation, is
to reward them: A General does so to a brave Commander of some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd
place, when not to raise the siege, may be the ruine of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant;
perhaps <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Gallantry is of this Quality, at least is an
Obligation to my self, to hinder my being perpetually oblig'd, which
your retirement will perform. Though, Madam (I reply'd) these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:96335:201"/>
do not convince the necessity of my removal; yet alas! they do, how
intent you are upon it; for Reason and Faith, which are virtues that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have their existence in the Intellect, cannot apprehend a suppression,
or need a relief, as that material virtue, Courage, may and does. When
any thing is fixt in the mind, to resolve to maintain it, is to do so; since no
Enemy can approach it there without its own permission: These being
spiritual, scape those tryals and dangers, which things whose beings are
obvious to sense, are subject to. If (said <hi>Altezeera</hi>) I should allow that
Reason and Faith once fixt in the Intellect, are not to be remov'd, I
should not yet conclude, that you are not to be so; but Chastity is like
Happiness, it must be thought so, to be so: and alas, how few are there
amongst the multitude, who have either of those most noble Prerogatives?
and consequently, how few will think me what I am? yes <hi>Artavasdes,</hi>
'tis upon your score as much as mine, that I am jealous of my honour: I
know you are as much concern'd in it, as I am; and since 'tis from thence
I derive your Friendship; do not repine, I am so nice to preserve that
which affords what I so transcendently value. An ill name would more
remove me from you, than my present Condition does, for I should be
then as unfit for your hopes, as now I am for your desires: we must, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes,</hi>
we must part; I judg what a conflict you have in your self at
this declaration, by what I had when I resolv'd to make it; and though
in my sufferings I read yours, yet in my Conquest I do the like; if my
Sex could overcome this difficulty, yours will much more: for, besides
the weakness of it, I lose more by your Obedience, than you can by
acting it. Alas (Madam, I answer'd) all this proves your Resolution greater
than mine; but my incapability but one way to obey you, proves my love
is perfecter; yes (Madam) I say, I have but one way to obey you, that is
by Death; my Obedience as well as Condition invites me to it;
I shall satisfie you as well as <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> in it, and shall demonstrate, I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
not the Command of going from you, by so well obeying it. Is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
then (she reply'd) so much an Enemy to me, as he will elect no
way to save my honour, but by losing that is almost as dear to me? Oh
gods! (she continued) why do you reduce me to commit a Crime, to
hinder him from acting another? Perhaps <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> your Death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more an offence to the gods, than what I have now told you; 'tis
an acknowledgment, that considering my Condition, is a sin, which to
have thought nothing can transcend, but to publish: but I hope this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
will preserve a life which mine is ty'd unto, which I enjoyn you to
keep, and which if you do deprive your self of, I will not live to lament.
Oh gods! (I cry'd out) I esteem'd you hitherto the greatest cruelty, but
now (alas) I find <hi>Altezeera</hi> is: those that gave me the necessity of Death,
are less Tyrannical, than she that after hinders it; for they but impose on
me a torment, yet allow me the cure; but she inflicts on me the former,
and refuses me too the latter: you cannot Madam (I continu'd) condemn
this Acclamation, for you are not reduced to the necessity of Banishing
me, but reduce your self to it. Alas! 'tis not much <hi>Artavasdes</hi> implores,
'tis but your permission to languish away in your sight an unfortunate
life, and a life which you have render'd so; my sufferings will evince your
Innocence; and <hi>Pacorus</hi> can no more doubt I injure him, than I desire to
do it, or you to permit it: will you then, my Princess, having divested
your self of all power to create my felicity, preserve enough to make me
miserable? so miserable too, that 'tis as impossible for the gods to make

of his being so, must that invite you to punish what you should
reward? The gods forbid! These words deliver'd with a Tone and Action
not ill-suted to them, had too violent an influence on her, to whom they
were addrest; that for a good while she continued in silence; and I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
my self with a hope, that it was a consent to my Petition: But alas,
it proceeded from her not being capable of granting it, and I kept that
hope no longer than she did her silence. Since (she reply'd) that I have
divested my self of all Power to make you happy, whether it were my
fault or my misfortune, I am resolved to punish it; and it may be your
Banishment is as much upon that Account, as on that of my Honour. If
you have not hitherto judg'd of my Resentment by my loss, you cannot
now but do it by my Penance; and you cannot doubt I acknowledg my
self culpable, when I voluntarily submit to such a punishment; should
you kill your self, you rob me of the noblest part of my penance, and
would render the continuation of it as impossible as just. If what I have
told you formerly, does not convince you how precious I esteem your
Life, this that I have now, will certainly effect it: for I plead for yours,
though in doing so, I plead against my own: Neither (<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) can
you justly appropriate to your self what you now did of misery, 'tis I only
that can; for who makes Friend miserable, is more so. You for your
Banishment have the consolation, that 'tis to preserve what you love,
worthy of that Honour; and though I receive a resembling one, yet
'tis you confer the Obligation, whilst I do but receive it. Believe me, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes,</hi>
my sufferings do at least equal yours: but when I consider for
whom I indure them, it gives me the Ability to do it; I cannot expect
less from, than I do for you: I have too a firm belief, that if the gods have
render'd me uncapable to reward your Virtue, it proceeds only from its
being of too transcendent a quality for me to do it; and therefore they
reserve it for themselves; since nothing but what is infinite, can satisfie
what is so; and if all recompences fail, they will gratifie your Desires by
an extinction of them: and perhaps 'tis more fit for their pureness to have
them supprest by Reason, than Fruition. Ah Madam! (said I, interrupting
her) this is rather an Argument to fortifie, than suppress my desire of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
'tis that only, since yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> are deny'd me, can end my desires; which
though they were infinite, as that goodness which esteems them so; yet in
the possession of my Princess, they would find a plenary felicity: for that
which creates, is still more great than what it does create, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
you are more than my desires; when the exquisite variety of my
miseries make me so religious as to think the gods all-powerful, their
having but one way to make me blessed, confounds that belief, and at least
renders it Reason, if it be impiety: no, Madam since you assure me 'tis
upon my score you suffer, and that you know 'tis upon yours that I do,
which is also accessionally encreas'd by that assurance; permit me to put a
period to both our miseries, by putting one to that wretched life which is
the cause of them. Since (she reply'd) you tell me, The gods can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Altezeera</hi> make you happy, why will you seek a Death which makes
her miserable? But I see (<hi>Artavasdes</hi>) you will find Reasons to oppose
mine; and I hope you will find none to oppose my Commands, which
positively injoyn you to live; which to invite you to the more certainly,
I protest I shall judg of your Friendship by your Obedience. Madam (I
answer'd) there is a vast disproportion between being happy, and being
no longer miserable: The first is deny'd me by your Condition, the last by
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96335:202"/>
your Commands, which yet I will obey, having given you irrevocably up
the absolute dispose of my life; this is a Truth you cannot question, since
after your determining of it, I have as little the Will, as the Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
my grant: But, Madam, if by this cruel sentence, my Obedience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove capable of any long duration, be yet so just as to ascribe it
to my want of the Power, and not the desire of obeying you. The fair
<hi>Altezeera</hi> was so sensibly mov'd by the sad teflection on these words, that
I esteem'd it not amiss in the Operations of her Pity, to attempt something
which might give me a rise to lessen it: and therefore with confusions and
tremblings which made a more efficacious Apology for my Confidence,
than my Words could, I told her; But (Madam) may not I (without sin)
to so many miseries you have loaden me with, retain a hope, That if ever
the gods by some strange Revolution, give you as absolutely the disposal
of your Self, as they have of my Fate, that then you will settle it in a feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
whose greatness I only now must know, by seeing of it in another: I
forbid you nothing (she reply'd, with a little Blush), but the becoming of
your own Executioner; Yet (she continued) if ever the gods should Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
the Obligations they have now confin'd me to, I will never be any
ones by C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

said, apprehended, That in those dictates, the merit of my Obedience would
inspire her with, I might seek the reward of it; and that by yielding to my
request, she might prujudice her self; or by denying it, bring an accession
to a grief which was capable of none, but by becoming uncapable of any
thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

the way with Consolations for my Banishment, which though exceeding
preg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t in themselves, yet lost their efficacy with me: For alas! I fear'd
she that could give Consolations, little needed them. But by that time we
were come so near the company, that she concluded, I could address her
no new Petitions, suddenly changing her Discourse, she told me; if <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes,</hi>
the merit of your retirement be susceptile of any addition, it
will receive it by your ordering it so, that it may not appear your Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
As soon as we had rejoyn'd the company, <hi>Altezeera</hi> staid not long
in the Garden but by retiring her self to <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s Appartment, gave me
the lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those complaints I made against the cruelty of my Princess's Commands,
which I then began to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>trive how I should obey; in Prosecution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
some four or five days after, I caused a Letter to be brought me as out of
<hi>Armenia,</hi> from <hi>Artav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into that Kingdom; as being a fitter Scene to Act a reconciliation between
<hi>Ventidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and me, who had given him some overtures of it, and who was
more troubled I had left him, then at that which was the cause of it; and
that the effecting of this atonement would be very advantagious to my
Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> who otherwise would inevitably suffer for a Crime they
never had committed; I fill'd this feign'd Letter with many things of this
quality; and immediately after it came to my hands, I went and presented
it to <hi>Pacorns,</hi> from whom I could procure permission of going to <hi>Armenia</hi>
without any engagement (after having settl'd my affairs) that! would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again; which the better to perswade him, and the better to secure my
self from discovery, I left all my Equipage and Servants at <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi>
I cannot omit telling you, that when I took my final leave
of him, he told me; <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> I hope you are very confident of
<hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Friendship; for otherwise, what you have done for me
(who I believe you are not ignorant, have been his successful
Rival) might invite you to suspect he sends for you to act his
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:96335:202"/>
own Revenge, and not to secure your Friends from that of the <hi>Romans.</hi> I
made him only an answer of my confidence in <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s affection for
me; which I knew he would make good; and then took my leave of him:
But as I was going to do the like to my Princess, I infer'd that <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s so
sudden and visible recovery, proceeded from his having his suspition satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
by evidence not faith; for if his distempers had proceeded from what
he ascrib'd them to, her; the same fears being unremov'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
had continu'd but they only ceasing as soon as <hi>Labienus</hi> by pregnant
evidences had evinc't the Princesses innocence, my opinion of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
appear'd to me, to be no irrational one; I am sure it had been
no unpleasing one, had it appear'd to me, it had been <hi>Altezeera</hi>'s also;
to whose Appartment I was no sooner come, then I learnt, that for the
two preceding days, she had not stir'd out of it, being afficted with
an unusual indisposition; I knew not whether to attribute this to an
Antedated grief for my design'd seperation, or to a palliating of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
which she could not decline, when I came to act it; for I was so
flattering to my affections, as not to impute it to any other Production.
As soon as I was admitted, to my grief, if not to my admiration, I
found the Chamber full of her Servants, and thereby saw my self depriv'd
of all possibility of expressing my sufferings with freedom, or from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any assurances from her, how sensibly she did resent them; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I had in the great operations of my disorders, discover'd what I
had thitherto so Artificially clouded, had I not attributed so many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
at my separation, to her design of restraining the violent motions it
would produce in us both, as well as to leave no impressions of doubts
in <hi>Labienus,</hi> in <hi>phraates,</hi> and it may be in <hi>Pacorus</hi> too. I shall not trouble
you with a repetition of what I said at my departure, since by the so
many Spectators and Auditors of it, you may conclude, there past no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but such Civilities as are usually practiced in resembling-occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
only I observ'd that <hi>Altezeera</hi> invited me not (as <hi>Pacorus</hi> did)
to continue in <hi>Parthia,</hi> or to a sudden return unto it; from whence I
concluded he had not beg'd it of her, either out of a belief it might raise
in her one, that he thought she had a greater influence over me than he
had, by hoping I might grant that to her commands, which I had deny'd
to his; or else concluding she had really that power over me, he was
not very willing to receive so sensible a mark of it; and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the establishment of what perhaps he was not a little concern'd
to remove. I went afterwards to wait on <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who not only made
me the same request his Son had done, but also procur'd from me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling;
ingagement: I found my self also oblig'd by the Laws of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but much more by those of obedience, to my Princess; And of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation,
to wait on <hi>Phraates,</hi> who so admirably countefeited a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for me, and in my remove, that I concluded from thence, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sorrow he had demonstrated when his Brother was wounded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the perfectness of his dissembling, not of his nature; or if it
were real, it deriv'd its being so, not from the danger he had been in,
but from his having avoided it. I omitted not to take leave of the
generous <hi>Labienus,</hi> and the next morning after those duties, I left <hi>Seleucia,</hi>
only attended by one <hi>Parthian</hi> Servant, of whose fidelity I was
not a little confident, having all the time of my residence in <hi>Parthia,</hi>
been so assiduously observant of my commands, that I concluded it was
as much upon the score of inclination, as duty, that he was so; and to
oblige him by a stricter tye than either of those, to a continuance of his
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:96335:203"/>
fidelity: I trusted him with my true Name and Condition, as soon as I
was upon the confines of <hi>Armenia;</hi> where I learnt that <hi>Ventidius</hi> with
all his Army lay at <hi>Corinthia,</hi> in which place he had past the Winter;
which was the time of my residence in <hi>Parthia,</hi> on which he had made as
sharp a Wall, as a season that was so, could permit. The perfect Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
I had for that generous <hi>Roman,</hi> and the proportionate concern I
knew he had for me, made me determine, before I did either wait on
<hi>Lindesia,</hi> or <hi>Vdosia,</hi> to do it on him. This I effected in my disguise, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attended by my <hi>Parthian</hi> Servant. I found <hi>Ventidius</hi> ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his Winter-quarters, in which he receiv'd me with the raptures
of a true Friend; and though they were infinite, yet they could not
transcend his admiration and joy, at his learning the miraculous disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of my Innocence, and the strange Arts which had been practic'd
to conclude it. You cannot doubt of his concern in my felicity, when
it even made him sin against the Laws of Honour, and curse his Mercy
to <hi>Pacorus,</hi> which had hinder'd him from removing the greatest of my
obstructions, as the gods had the least; And which by their having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the latter, made him conclude he had as much sin'd against them,
as my hopes, in not having acted the former. I had much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to make him decline those thoughts for the future, than I had had
formerly; for now in his belief, that there remained no impediment in
my love, but the death of <hi>Pacorus,</hi> he told me, that he would now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the War as much upon that score as upon the score of Honour or
Revenge: I shall not lye, if I tell you, I was not only seemingly solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
against this resolve, but really so; which I did out of a true dictate
of Vertue, though it may be the gods induced me to it, to render my
sufferings the more sensible, by still making me contributary to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But to be short: I did not cease importuning <hi>Ventidius,</hi> till I extorted
a declaration from him, that he would not have any more particular
aims against <hi>Pacor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> than any of his party; and that if he fell, it should
not be by the design, but by the chance of War. Two days I continu'd
with my generous Friend; and the third, beginning his march, I found
my self necessitated to leave him, by an unalterable resolution I had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
not to put it in the power of Fortune, to make me act directly, or
obliquely against whatsoever my Princess honour'd with her love,
though thereby I brought an unimaginable prejudice to my own. I will
not trouble you with those expressions <hi>Ventidius</hi> made me at our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor those vows he sent by me to <hi>Vdosia,</hi> to whom I told him I
would go, to qualify a melancholy which I knew would be as transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as impossible for her to avoid, by the misfortune of his abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce,
and of those fresh dangers he was going to involve himself in; since to
let you know how passionate they were, I have but to tell you, they
were made by <hi>Ventidus,</hi> of whom I took a final leave; he directing his
designs for <hi>Parthia,</hi> and I mine for <hi>Sattala,</hi> where <hi>Vdosia</hi> received me
with a satisfaction, which nothing could excel, but that she would have
relisht, had I brought <hi>Ventidius</hi> with me. 'Twas there I told her all
those admirable adventures had arriv'd me since our separation, and by
my sad example gave her an indelible instruction to believe nothing of
her Lovers change, till his verbal confession was the evincement of it.
At <hi>Sattala</hi> I cast off my disguise, which made my <hi>Parthian</hi> think I had
assum'd one; and who thereby knew me to be his Master, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I assur'd him I was so; But I continu'd not at <hi>Sattala,</hi> by reason
of a violent War kindled betwixt <hi>Artabazus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96335:203"/>
                  <hi>Commagena,</hi> who had not only Usurpt upon the <hi>Armenian</hi> Territories,
but had also entirely cast off that voluntary Subjection he had made u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Romans;</hi> which former, I was apprehensive might induce my
King to invite me to the command of his Armies: an honour I could
not be more unworthy of, than I indeed detested; as indeed I did all
things that suspended my melancholy; and therefore I left <hi>Sattala:</hi> but
before I did so, because of those fresh distempers, I conjur'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of it to have a particular care of his Souldiers, and of his duty
to <hi>Udozia;</hi> who having given me a Character of it very much to his
advantage, as an effect of my believing her; and my being pleas'd with
him, I added to his former Commands, that of the superintendency (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Udozia</hi>) of all Affairs, civil and Martial, within the Province of
<hi>Sattala;</hi>) which the next day I got out of, determining to lead so fluxible
a life, that if <hi>Artabzus</hi> had any Commands for me, by the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my residence, he should not know where to make me receive them:
Therefore by unusual ways I went to <hi>Thospia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and gave <hi>Lindesia</hi> an exact
account of all that had arrived since our last separation: That excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Woman was as much perplext, as I was satisfied with those Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
apprehending that the discovery of that Affection which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Altezeera</hi> honour'd me with, after she had disclosed my Innocence,
would create in me new hopes; and that in the expectation of them, I
would languish away and consume a life, she was too much concern'd
in, to have it so much mis-spent. After a thousand disputes upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
the result of all was, my acknowledgment, that the justice of her
fears could not be greater than the impossibility was to remove them;
and that she might not be by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight convinc'd of those sufferings (to
whose vastness her fancy could hardly attain), I immediatly left <hi>Thospia,</hi>
having extorted the same promise from <hi>Lindesia,</hi> that I had from <hi>Udozia;</hi>
which was not to inquire of me the places of my intended residence,
lest they might be necessitated by <hi>Artabazus</hi> importunity, to disclose
them to him. Some four days Journey from <hi>Thospia,</hi> there liv'd an
old Gentleman, who had had his Education with my Father; and who
in the progress of his life, had so exactly evinc't the indelibleness of the
impressions of Youth, that to <hi>Annexanders</hi> very death, his first contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Friendship had continu'd in one constant height: and the cause why
it receiv'd no accession, was, that its first forming was uncapable of any.
Neither did <hi>Euphranor</hi> (for so he was called) after my Fathers decease,
enjoy any more life than what he could not destroy without a sin, and
what serv'd to punish his wanting the power of having concluded his
with his friend. This generous man had retir'd himself into a strong
Castle of his own, though the benefit he expected to derive from its
strength, was, Not to defend against his Enemies, a life he so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
that he esteem'd his having none, a Misfortune; but to keep out
such as might have so low an opinion of his sorrows, as to think they
were either capable, or desirous of Consolation. This honour so resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
mine, the Gratitude I ow'd him as <hi>Annexander</hi>'s Friend, and the
affection as <hi>Falintus</hi>'s Father, made me address my Journey thither,
where when I was arrived, I had much ado to obtain admittance; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I, till I had told my Name, after which the Draw-bridg was let
down, and the Virtuous <hi>Euphranor</hi> came with tears and embraces to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me: I return'd him his Civilities in the same payment, and after
by many assurances he had made me believe he could neither think <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexander</hi>
dead, or old, so long as he consider'd me: I enquir'd earnestly
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:96335:204"/>
after his generous Son, who he told me but three days before had been
with him, and was gone in continuance of his search after me; I was not
only troubled to miss him, but also to do it in such a way: I therefore
begg'd <hi>Euphranors</hi> permission, and attain'd it, To imploy one of his
Domesticks to seek <hi>Falintus,</hi> and acquaint him, I would wait his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
where I then was. <hi>Euphranor</hi> hearing this message, told me, I
had taken the only course to make him wish for his Sons Civility: He
led me to a Magnificent Appartment, where he conjur'd me to live in the
same freedom, as if I were in my Hermitage, and not constrain my self
for him, since I could not possibly do him a higher satisfaction, than
to act my own. Never man that was uncapable of contentment, relish'd
any thing so near it, as I did whilst I continu'd there; for when my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
began to grow importunate, to suppress that Miracle, I went
immediately to <hi>Euphranor,</hi> from whose charming conversation I receiv'd
a satisfaction, which I thought no words had the power to act, unless deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the fair <hi>Altezeera.</hi> 'Twas above two Moons that I continu'd
there, in expectation of some News from <hi>Falintus;</hi> but at length my
Messengers returning, acquainted me, That my inquisition after him, was
proportionately fruitless to his after me; but though by his search he had
learnt nothing of him, for whom he made it; yet he brought me certain
intelligence, that <hi>Ventidius</hi> in a great Battel had the second time defeated
the <hi>Parthians;</hi> that <hi>Labienus</hi> and <hi>Pharnabates</hi> the two Generals, had lost
their lives with their Armies: That <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Eagles had past the <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> had sent a vast Army hefore him into <hi>Asia;</hi> he
himself remaining as yet in <hi>Athens,</hi> whither the Princess <hi>Octavia</hi> (his
Wife) had accompany'd him, and joyntly Celebrated <hi>Ventidius</hi> his
Victories; where he had not so long continu'd, if some fresh jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
betwixt <hi>Octavius Caesar</hi> and him, had not necessitared him to
compose them, before his advance towards <hi>Parthia;</hi> that they were
now fully ended by the mediation of <hi>Octavia</hi> (who either to continue
what she had effected, or to give the greater liberty to <hi>Antony</hi>'s Amours
with <hi>Cleopatra</hi>) had been sent back to <hi>Rome</hi> by him, and that <hi>Artabazus,</hi>
by several expresses, made a scrutinous search after me, to make me Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the War against <hi>Antiochus.</hi> I can truly say (continu'd <hi>Artavasdes</hi>)
I was almost as much troubl'd at the generous <hi>Labienus</hi>'s Death, as satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with that Victory which had caused it. I know not whether my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intermissive
sorrows, the trouble of failing in any thing was I ambitious
of, which was besides in a more sad evincement, manifested in that fresh
one of missing <hi>Falintus,</hi> or else a concurrence of natural causes, was ti
that cast me into a Sickness, so full of mortal symptoms, that I began to
believe the gods would repair their cruelty during my Life, by the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of a hidden Death. But alas! I found I was more Charitable than
they, since they only shew'd me the Harbour, to increase the miseries of
not attaining it; for I was miraculously sav'd, when I had no more the
hopes than desires of Life. But though the danger of my Fever was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
yet my weakness still continu'd, which was either an effect of a
Sickness so violent, or of grief that it had not prov'd more so; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Physician, which the officious <hi>Euphranor</hi> had sent for in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my indisposition, attributed the continuance of mine to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of those causes: but so much time as is usually allotted for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of strength after a sharp fit of Sickness being effluxt, he plainly told
<hi>Euphranor,</hi> That he suspected mine did not only derive its beginning,
but its continuance, from a distemper of the Mind. As soon as <hi>Euphranor</hi>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:96335:204"/>
had by intent observations, made this his Faith, he not only came and told
it me, but by such pressing Conjurations implor'd to learn what created it,
that I obey'd him; I cannot tell whether the strange Accidents I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him with, made him sympathize in my Affictions: or whether
he did it, as believing it the best way to make his Counsels and Advice
more resolutely follow'd; but I can, that after having told me a long
Story of a Friends Amours of his, so much a parallel to Mine, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from it so much consolation, as to know my self not the most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
of Men: he at length assur'd me, he had deriv'd his Cure and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
from repairing to the Oracle of <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> whither he
advis'd me to address my self, and then conjur'd me to believe he was
not a little confident of my Success; since he could as a conducive way
unto it, not only be content to lose my Company, but to make that loss
an effect of his own solicitation. The miraculous Adventure which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phranor</hi>
told me, had there arriv'd his Friend, and the great Fame I had
heard of this Temple, made me to determine to repair hither as soon as
my health would permit me, which it did not for above three Moons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I omit purposely all those generous Civilities <hi>Euphranor</hi> made me
at our separation, and how pressing he was to have me take some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of his in the room of my <hi>Parthian;</hi> who one Morning after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and Resolution to come hither, was gone out of the Castle, and
had never return'd thither again; which Misfortune, notwithstanding my
diligent Enquiry, I could never learn the cause of. I will conclude all,
by letting you know, That determining to live a Life suitable to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I refus'd <hi>Euphranor</hi>'s offers, resolving, since I could not either
at <hi>Sattala,</hi> or <hi>Thospia,</hi> light upon the faithful <hi>Philanax</hi> (who I forgot to
tell you was gone disguis'd into <hi>Parthia</hi> to learn my Fate) to perform
this Voyage in no Company but that of my Thoughts: of which I was
as unwilling as unable to divest my self. This, and the apprehension
that if I went not alone, <hi>Artabazus</hi> might discover, and thereby neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
me to disoblige him, or my self, was the cause that I left <hi>Euphranor</hi>'s
Castle unaccompani'd; in which condition I travel'd till I came into that
Wood, where the generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi> found me so unequally assaulted,
that I began to fancy <hi>Euphranor</hi>'s belief was true; and that at the Temple
of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> I should find my satisfaction. But though his Sword sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
me from it one way, yet it gave me another, by saving me from a
Death, that would have secluded me from <hi>Artabbanes</hi> Conversation;
which in the condition <hi>Altezeera</hi> is now in, is the highest Felicity the
Cruel gods have made the miserable <hi>Artavasdes</hi> capable of.</p>

               <head>The First BOOK.</head>
               <p>THE generous <hi>Artavasdes</hi> had no sooner finish'd his
Story (which had produc'd no common operations
in the hearers), than <hi>Artabbanes</hi> told him, If the
sin of not-believing <hi>Artavasdes</hi> were not greater, than
the vanity of believing my Sword could contribute
to a victory his was acting, I should not make the
last of those my faith; which since to avoid the first
I must do, I shall to extenuate the necessity of that
crime, protest, That I will no more exclaim against the gods for having
so extraordinarily preserved me from death, since now I find 'twas to
preserve <hi>Artavasdes</hi> from it; for whom I am so justly concern'd, that I
shall cherish the continuation of my miseries, if they contribute to the
continuation of his life; which, though replenish'd with many sensible
misfortunes, yet are as far short of mine, as an unhappiness that time
and many accidents may cure, is of one which the very gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot. If (said <hi>Artavasdes</hi>) my miseries till now were not equal
to yours, this assurance had made them so; for the accession to my past
misfortunes, that yours transcend them, gives mine the Precedency.
<hi>Callimmachus,</hi> who apprehended this generous dispute would suspend him
from learning what would enable him to determine of it; acquainted
them with his fears; to which <hi>Artabbanes</hi> told him: Alas Sir, I shall by
not obeying you, do it; for by not being able to tell you what should
determine it, you cannot but do it on my side; I am also the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in this victory, since by the loss of it, I shall be depriv'd of this
only consolation in my miseries, that my generous friend's are not equal
to them. But the Night being already too far spent to begin a fresh
relation, he not only perswaded them to defer their curiosity till the next
morning; but also to permit <hi>Symander</hi> to satisfie it; whose fidelity had
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:96335:207"/>
render'd him an unsuspected hearer of <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Adventures; and
whose interest in his Princes life, and secrets, render'd him a fit Relator
of them. <hi>Callimmachus</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> having exprest a greater sorrow,
that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was not able to tell his own story, than that he did it
not; and a little time being spent in discourses of that quality (and of
the different opinions they all had, what could make the Prince of
<hi>Parthia</hi> so intent upon <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s Death, as to hire Assassinates to act
it, which he had told <hi>Callimmachus</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> one of them had
confest with his last breath): The generous Priest took leave of the two
Friends, not only to afford them a liberty which he apprehended his
company something limited, but also to perform some ceremonies of
his office, and to be the earlier ready to summon <hi>Symander</hi> of an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
which he in part had already so well satisfied, that it gave
him a just impatience till he had done it entirely. The night therefore
had no sooner resign'd her Empire to the Sun, than <hi>Callimmachus</hi> came
to <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> Appartment, where he found that his
fear of Incivility proceeded from a different cause, than from that he
apprehended; for the latter of them was so far from believing it too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>early,
that he had already expected him above an hour, with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencies
of a concern'd friend; and the former having left <hi>Symander</hi>
to satisfie his promise, was already retir'd into a Gallary contiguous to his
Chamber, to avoid the hearing of his unparallel'd miseries, and of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the influence they would necessarily have over his generous
friends. <hi>Smyander</hi> by <hi>Artavasdes</hi>'s command, seated himself between
him and <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> and there being summon'd by them both, to
continue the Relation of his Princes Fortunes, having first remember'd
the generous <hi>Armenian,</hi> that by his arrival he had been interrupted
from the prosecution of them at their entrance into <hi>Rome,</hi> after the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of <hi>Crassus:</hi> from thence thus began his discourse, addressing it
to <hi>Artavasdes.</hi>

                  <head>The sequel of Parthenissa's and Artabbane's Story.</head>
                  <p>AFter that for the recovery of your health, and the extenuating
your grief for the loss of a Father, which but too justly merited
it, you had retir'd for a few days to <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Palace, and that my
Prince was assur'd by the Chyrurgeons, his wounds were in such unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
places, that for at least two Moons he should be unable to travel:
To oblige the generous <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who was then perfectly recover'd; and
to silence those fears, which so long an absence had doubtless contracted
in the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> but especially in <hi>Lyndadorie,</hi> he conjur'd him to
begin his journey into <hi>Parthia,</hi> and to leave his cure to the help of
time, and of the Chyrurgeons. <hi>Sillaces,</hi> though he were too much a
Lover, not to esteem a separation from his Mistress a misfortune; yet
he was also too much a friend, to leave one that was so to him, in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a place and condition; and besides, fearing <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had
made him that request, more to satisfie him, than himself, he absolutely
declin'd it; but when by many pressing protestations my Prince had
remov'd those doubts, it was not long after, that <hi>Sillaces</hi> (taking the
benefit of a <hi>Roman</hi> Galley, which was bound from <hi>Ostia</hi> to <hi>Tyre</hi>) left
<hi>Artabbanes,</hi> having first concluded amongst themselves of what he should
say and do in <hi>Parthia;</hi> and having receiv'd from him a Letter to the
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:96335:207"/>
fair <hi>Lyndadory,</hi> so fill'd with approbations, and extolments of her
election, and of implorings in his favour, and advantage, that had she
but only lov'd her Brother, she could not but have done the like to her
Servant. 'Twas by my Princes command that I waited on the generous
<hi>Sillaces</hi> to <hi>Ostia,</hi> where having seen him aboard, I return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> the
same day, and passing by the Capitol to go to <hi>Artabbane</hi>'s lodging, I
perceiv'd at the gate of it, a great confluence of people; my curiosity
led me to enquire the cause of it from one who told me, it was from a
<hi>Salapian</hi> Lord, who had begg'd of the Senate the head of <hi>Spartacus,</hi>
which he was then taking down. This information made me imagine
'twas the generous <hi>Perolla,</hi> who I soon after perceiv'd all in Mourning,
in a Chariot that was so, and near him the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> in the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory,
like the Sun in a cloud: I must confess, I had a thousand pains to
abstain from running to acquaint them with a Truth, their ignorance of
which, produced such sad, and noble effects; but the belief that the
discovery of it was fitter to proceed from my obedience, than me, and
would in that quality be better relish'd by them, I went hastily to my
Prince, and having given him an account of what I have you; with all
the impatience which so just a concern could inspire, he immediately
commanded me to go and acquaint the generous Lovers where he was,
and assure them, that had his wounds permitted him to pay them a visit,
no other impediment should have suspended him from that duty. As
soon as I had received this order, I went to obey it; and though I came
immediately after to the place where I had left them, I learnt, that
having taken down the Senate's grant, they were return'd with it to their
Lodging; which having inquir'd out, I went thither, and sent up one of
their Domesticks to let them know a stranger desir'd the honour of seeing
them, who had something of importance to acquaint them with. I
stay'd not long for an answer, or admittance; and as soon as I came into
the Chamber, I perceiv'd the generous Lovers weeping many real tears
over the counterfeit head of my Prince; but after that by the little noise
I made, they had turn'd their sight towards me, and perceiv'd who I
was; the fair <hi>Izadora</hi> by some shrieks, and a more violent weeping, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
that her seeing of me, brought some fresh, and more sensible
reflections into her memory, than a disfigur'd and unknowable part of
<hi>Spartacus</hi> had done; but <hi>Perolla,</hi> whose Sex dispenc'd him from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
excess in those effeminacies, came towards me, and told me,
You see <hi>Symander,</hi> that the cruel gods having allow'd us no other way
but this, to evince our gratitude to your generous Master, we have not
declin'd it; we have now nothing but this part of him, and his memory
left us, which we will cherish at a rate, that those which know it, shall
be convinc'd by what we do, what we would have done, had our
powers of gratitude proportionated our cause, or our desires of it;
which last we cannot more highly, or justly illustrate, than by assuring
you they equal the first; and in our transcendent loss we should receive
some little relaxation, if one who <hi>Spartacus</hi> did so much esteem of as
<hi>Symander,</hi> would so much esteem of us, as to pass his life with those, who
during their own, will eternally deplore the loss of his generous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's.
Sir, (I reply'd) I should be too unworthy so noble an offer, had
I surviv'd him in whose consideration 'tis made; No, generous <hi>Perolla,
Spartacus</hi> lives, and does so, so much the more happily, by how much
he knows his life is considerable to you, and will put a period to a grief
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:96335:208"/>
nothing can repair, or equal, but his, when I shall acquaint him with
yours, and the fair <hi>Izadora's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thereupon I made them that complement my Prince had commanded
me; which they no sooner heard, than in raptures as far transcending
repetition, as imitation, they both conjur'd me to bring them to a
person, who by the obligations of gratitude, and virtue, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
themselves equally confin'd to admire and esteem. 'Twas by this
time, about the close of the Evening, so that without any hazard they
might give my Prince a visit; which when I had told them, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
went in their Chariot (taking me only with them) to my Prince's
Lodging, where the generous Lovers continued their tears, though for
a contrary cause to that for which they had usually shed them. 'Twas
in this interview (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) that <hi>Perolla</hi> acquainted <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,</hi>
how that having heard of his fatal loss at the Battel of the Trenches,
and that a Head as replenish'd with the gifts of the Mind, as of Nature,
was ignominiously fixt on the Capitol; both he and <hi>Izadora</hi> dressing
their Bodies in the livery of their Minds, came purposely from <hi>Salapia,</hi>
and had begg'd from the Senate the remainder of a person, who could
not be more an Enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> than a friend to <hi>Salapia</hi> and them.
The Senate, who always esteem'd of Gratitude, as knowing they had
the greatest power to create it in any; and believing those that had it for
their Enemies, would not want it for them; in one action, to reward
and create ours, granted our request; with which we intended to return,
and to have rais'd such a Trophy to this part of the dead <hi>Spartacus,</hi> as
should have evinced the just and vast esteem we had of the Living.
<hi>Perolla</hi> further told him, That since his leaving of <hi>Salapia,</hi> their Fathers
had as much admir'd at their past differences and cruelties, as others did
at their present friendship, which was so settl'd and perfect, that it relish'd
not a little of what had caus'd it; and that already virtue was so habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
to them, that it appear'd rather an effect of their nature, than their
change. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> by many embraces to the generous <hi>Perolla,</hi> and
retributions to the fair <hi>Izadora,</hi> acknowledg'd their virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and protested he was more satisfy'd with their Father's friendship
to them, than with theirs to him; since he was more concern'd in their
satisfaction than his own; which they could not suspect, since he evinc'd
it in the most pregnant testimony.</p>
                  <p>But after some other discourses of this nature, <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
the pressing desire the generous Lovers had demonstrated to
learn his quality and life, and that by the discovery of the fair <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa's</hi>
Constancy, he esteem'd himself disoblig'd from any longer silence,
he acquainted them with it; who no sooner heard of a Concession his
formal denial, and nothing else, had suppress'd their imploring, by fresh
impatiencies they invited my Prince to satisfie their longing. This he
did, by telling them exactly all his Adventures, in which they so justly
sympathiz'd, that it invited him to do the like, in the joy they assum'd
at that happy intelligence he had so miraculously receiv'd from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Sillaces:</hi> Neither did they after the knowledg of my Prince's
quality, pay him any more respect, or affection; for their Gratitude
and Virtue, had render'd them uncapable of any accessions of that
nature.</p>
                  <p>I will not (said <hi>Symander</hi>) so unnecessarily intrench on your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as to inform you how constantly every day the virtuous <hi>Salapians</hi>
                     <pb n="489" facs="tcp:96335:208"/>
visited <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> nor of the excellent entertainment their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gave him: for 'tis high time we should leave that <hi>Italy,</hi> which had
been the Scene of such discrepant events. To effect this the sooner, I
will inform you, that the generous <hi>Ventidius</hi> being return'd from the
Gulph of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> came to my dear Master, and there acquainted
him of what depriv'd him of the honour of your Company, which his
Friendship for you, made him esteem a greater misfortune, than the
deprivation it self; and indeed, <hi>Ventidius,</hi> to render your precipitate
departure the more excusable, render'd it so dangerously necessary,
that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had esteem'd the Misfortune of your having left him
without cause, a less one. The generous <hi>Roman</hi> upon your score, or
that of virtue, so assiduously visited, and serv'd my Prince, that his
obligations had no unfruitful return, if their design was to acquire him
really his Friendship. At length after two Moons, my dear Master's
wounds were well-enough clos'd, to permit him to think of <hi>Parthia,</hi>
and the Night before his design'd departure, <hi>Perolla</hi> (who apprehended,
in a strange Country he might not be sufficiently provided) came and
brought me the richest Jewels I had ever seen, and desir'd me to carry
them with me, to remedy any misadventure. I was much more satisfy'd
with his care, than he was with my assurance, that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had
enough of them to supply his necessities, and with my protestations
(after he had earnestly press'd me to accept them for my self), that I
would carry away nothing of his, but the memory of his virtue. <hi>Perolla</hi>
immediately after went to <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> with whom he had left the fair
<hi>Izadora,</hi> where he conjur'd him before her to permit his waiting on him
into <hi>Parthia,</hi> since he and the gods had left him no other way to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
his Gratitude, and affection. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> absolutely refus'd this
offer, ` and was much more troubled at the making it, than ever
<hi>Izadora</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>My memory not serving me to repeat the generous Lovers final
Civilities, I will not so much wrong their excellence, as to dress them
in my own expressions: The next day after this separation, they return'd
to <hi>Salapia</hi> with the false <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s head, which (either to disguise the
Truth, or in honour to any thing which bore that name) they caus'd
magnificently to be buried, and ever after liv'd in the unimitable joys
of a virtuous Love; and that those cannot be transcended by any others,
is not a greater Truth than it is, that never any more justly deserv'd
them. The same morning my Prince left <hi>Rome,</hi> he went to <hi>Ostia,</hi> where
the obliging <hi>Ventidius</hi> expected him, not daring, because of his eminent
quality, to wait on him thither, lest it might have prov'd a dangerous
Civility. There my Prince by <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s favour found an excellent
Gally, well fitted and Man'd, ready to receive him, and his Commands.</p>
                  <p>'Twas aboard, that these two great Men took leave, and 'twas in
that separation I discovered charms in the generous <hi>Roman</hi>'s Person
and Discourse, which could be no more resisted, than sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd:
At length having mutually vow'd a friendship as unalterable, as
that they had for virtue, and confirm'd it by many strict embraces,
<hi>Ventidius</hi> returned privately to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the whole Ginge immediately
with chearful shouts and vigorous stroaks, made the Galley run faster
than that River it had so lately abandon'd; but the Wind blowing a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
gale at West, exempted the Slaves from much labour, and so facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
our intended Voyage, that in twenty days we cast Anchor in the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:96335:209"/>
River <hi>Orontes,</hi> which washes the Walls of <hi>Antioch;</hi> whither the same
night my Prince went; having largely rewarded the Slaves, the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and the Officers of <hi>Ventidius</hi>'s Gally. At <hi>Antioch</hi> having furnish'd
our selves with two excellent <hi>Arabian</hi> Horses, and having learnt that
the ways through <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> were much obstructed by
<hi>Crassus</hi>'s Army, which possess'd all the Bridges, and other considerable
Passes, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to avoid any probable impediments, determin'd to
leave those two Provinces on the South, and so by the way of <hi>Armenia</hi>
and <hi>Media</hi> to get into <hi>Parthia.</hi> This was by much the more secure course,
and not very much the longer. We had already performed so much of
our Journey, as to the Banks of the River <hi>Corindas,</hi> which runs through
<hi>Arsacca,</hi> one of the noblest Cities in <hi>Media,</hi> and were not past eight
Furlongs from it, when from the height of a little Hill, we discover'd
a fight; which though not very considerable for the number of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants,
yet it was for those of the dead; for of above forty, two only
remain'd alive; which by the richness and beauty of their Arms, but
much more by their Courages, demonstrated themselves to be the Chief
of either Party. Not far from the Scene where this Tragedy was
acting, stood a Chariot, whose Horses either by design or accident,
were running up and down the field with their Harnesses broken, and
in it was a Lady, who we thought was the Judg, or Reward of the
Victory; and who by what we could discern of her, when we came
nearer (for she was vail'd) seem'd too to be a worthy cause of so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
a Dispute. My Prince extreamly taken with such courages, and
believing to permit them to destroy each other, would be as great a
Crime in him, as in those which endeavour'd it; pulling down the sight
of his Helmet, he rid up and thrust himself between them, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received on his Shield some blows, which their fury intended for
each other, he conjur'd them both, by what they valu'd most, and by
those lives which, by what he had seen of them, were too considerable
to be fruitlesly lost; That unless the Cause of their Quarrel were mortal,
they would desist from a fight, which would give both, or one of them
wounds, which would prove so. He that wore the green Arms, either
inraged to lose that dawning advantage he had over his Enemy, or to
be interrupted from acting a Revenge he was very intent upon, told my
Prince in a furious Tone, Whoever thou beest, that art so over-officious,
know, that did I not believe thy care of my Enemy proceeded from thy
ignorance of his Crimes, I should by thy defending a Person so reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with them, leave the punishment of his, for the punishment of
thine; which out of that belief, I will now omit; but if this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be not sufficient to restrain thy Assistance, thou shalt find thy Death
in thy mistaken Charity. Then clapping Spurs to his Horse, and strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Prince's with the flat of his Sword, he joyn'd again his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and so incessantly prest him, that before my Prince could come to
punish the Conquerour, or defend the vanquish'd, the former had pass'd
his Sword through the latter; who by that fatal thrust, let fall his own
and his Bridle, employing both those hands which had held them, to
hold himself in his Saddle: The Horse finding nothing to restrain him,
ran with his wounded Rider up and down the Field. He in the green
Armour had doubtless made the Death of his Enemy, the end of his
victory, had not <hi>Artabbanes</hi> run after him to hinder it; which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
the Stranger; that leaving his old Enemy for his new, he only
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:96335:209"/>
said, Since by undertaking my Adversaries defence, thou wilt partake of
his Crimes, prepare thy self to do the like of his punishment; and then
with an active rage, he discharg'd some furious blows on <hi>Artabbanes,</hi>
who moved by this fresh accession to his former affront, receiv'd him
so briskly, that the Stranger found he had undertaken a Quarrel far more
difficult than that he had so advantageously and lately decided. I knew
too much the Laws of Honour and my Prince's Courage, to offer him any
assistance from Mine, and therefore only continued a Spectator of a Combat,
which though replenish'd with many admirable things, yet none appear'd
so justly so to me, as that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was so long a conquering. I must
confess, his Adversary's courage gave me inclinations for him, that the
way in which he imploy'd it, might justly have exempted me from; and
I had longer continued my admiration, had not I by chance, casting my
Eye on the South-side of the little Plain we were in, perceived Ten
Horse-men which came out of a Wood which confin'd it on that side;
two of them having observed the dangerous condition the wounded
Gentleman was in, ran to his Assistance; one of them vaulting up behind
him, upheld his tottering Body in his Arms, and the other leading his
Horse by the Head, retook (with their charge) the way they had come;
but the remaining Eight came a-gallop towards that place where my
Prince and the Stranger were prodigally employing their Valours against
each other, which united were hardly able to secure them: Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so intent on each others ruine, made them not consider how near their
own was; which to prevent, I rid up and acquainted them with what their
Eyes immediately did; wherefore the Stranger more concern'd in the
Ladies safety, than in his Revenge or hopes of Victory, immediately told
<hi>Artabbanes,</hi> Valiant Stranger, The difference betwixt us, is not of so
high a concernment, but another time may serve to decide it, and having
found in your Sword a virtue worthy to serve so great a Beauty as these
are coming to ravish from me, I shall not scruple to desire your assistance,
or at least your neutrality; but to invite you to the former, I protest, I
present you with a higher glory by the honour of serving her, than your
victory over me can afford you; and perhaps by this concession you will
conquer me a more certain and a more facile way, than that you have
now undertaken. My Prince extreamly satisfied with this generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
told him, If I receive any trouble from what you motion, 'tis
only left you might think I grant that to your desire which I would to
your condition, or to the Beauty you so resolutely defend; neither
can you doubt by the cause of our present Dispute, that I would not
practice for you, what I did against you. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had not time to
give him any other assurances than what his Sword did; and finding it
necessary and just to joyn with my Prince, I did it; our Enemies, though
they lost at the first charge two of their resolutest Companions, were not
near so much surpriz'd thereat, as to see so strange and sudden an union
against them; but this mysterie some of them had not Life enough left to
unriddle; yet the others made so vigorous a resistance, that the Stranger
had lost his Life, if my Prince by the death of one of his Enemies (which
was come behind him) had not hinder'd it; I had my share in the danger,
and the victory; the first by receiving some slight wounds, and the last by
killing him which gave them me: In brief, our Enemies survived not
their defeat, for the Combat ended not but with their Lives. The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had no sooner done acting towards, and observed this Truce, than he
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:96335:210"/>
came to my Prince, and lifting up his Helmet, told him, Generous Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
since I hold my Sword from you, the gods forbid I should employ it
against you; if I have now any designs upon you, they are not only by
imitating you, to preserve your Life by the hazard of mine; but, if the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
were offered, by the absolute loss of it. The Stranger had scarce
finish'd these words, when he found himself in my Prince's Arms, who by
repeating twice or thrice the Name of <hi>Sillaces,</hi> made me know 'twas that
generous Prince whom he so passionately embrac'd. You may believe
(continued <hi>Symander</hi>) this accident produc'd no small admiration in
<hi>Artabbanes,</hi> which was rais'd to a higher degree when <hi>Sillaces</hi> after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Prince, told him, 'twas upon his score he had then been fighting,
and that it was against <hi>Surena,</hi> When <hi>Artabbanes</hi> consider'd he fought
against his Friend for his Enemy, it rais'd in him some just repinings against
the strangeness of his destiny; but as soon as he reflected on his Enemie's
being the fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s Brother, they were immediately silenc'd; and
if any thing in this encounter afficted him, 'twas, that he had drawn his
Sword against <hi>Sillaces,</hi> and not that he had done it for <hi>Surena.</hi> My
Prince assur'd his generous Friend of this, who could not sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at a Friendship so efficacious, as that it ran in a Blood; when even
one of it had acted as much to create his hatred, as the other was capable of,
for the raising his affection and esteem. But <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of all discourses, but those which tended to the learning of his
destiny in the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s condition, earnestly implor'd from <hi>Sillaces</hi>
an account of what he knew concerning it: Who replyed, that his absence
in his search, had made him but from second hands, and confusedly learn it;
but that the Beauty his Sword had so much injur'd, and so much serv'd,
could give him an exact relation of all. My generous Master, who was
confirm'd by that Zeal with which <hi>Sillaces</hi> had embrac'd her Service, that
it was <hi>Lyndadorie</hi> (though he could not fancy by what strange adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
she had left <hi>Parthia</hi> and needed his Sword) went with <hi>Sillaces</hi> to the
Chariot: But great Gods! what was his surprize when he found the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in it was the fair <hi>Parthenissa!</hi> I cannot tell you with how many tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and prostrations he express'd his joy and wonder, before he could do
either by his words; nor can I tell you with what emotions the admirable
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> found her Deliverer was a more transcendent felicity than
her Deliverance. Never (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) never did any mortal
appear so like those that are not; so that if the gods had not reserv'd
adoration for what only was a Deity, and not for what merited to be one,
my Prince must have converted a flame of Love into one of Devotion.
His Three years absence had so perfected those morning-Beauties, that
the light which sees every thing, never saw any so exactly accomplish'd;
insomuch that had the gods given eternity to her then Beauty, they could
have given it no other accession. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> who receiv'd her Flames as
fast as her Eyes inspir'd them, was so entirely taken up with that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he continued silent as long almost as I have been speaking; but
no sooner had his words the liberty of utterance, than he told the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa,</hi>
You see (Madam) prostrate at your feet, the unfortunate, and
happy <hi>Artabbanes;</hi> the last of these, in having obtain'd your Pardon; and
the first, in having needed it; you cannot (Madam) doubt of your power,
when as an effect of it, after my Crime, I dare present my self before my
injur'd Princess: But may I not fear I receiv'd this command from your
Revenge, and not your Mercy, since to behold the Virtue and Beauty I
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:96335:210"/>
have wrong'd, is one of the most sensible punishments could be inflicted
on me for having done it; and it had been more just (if you had not
esteem'd it otherwise, because it was more easie for me) to have executed
your Revenge, than obey'd your Mercy; Neither is it a small Misfortune,
that by a Crime I come to implore it for one; but yet by having fought
against your Deliverance, you may discover my Sins against the divine
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> are not my Elections, but my Fate; for nothing but so unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable
an impulsion, could have made me either doubt her professions
and constancy, or fought against her Interests.</p>
                  <p>If (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) the generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi> hazarded my Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by his Sword, he has establish'd it by the same weapon, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
repair'd a small injury by what acted it; and if he doubted my
professions and constancy, he was so excellently deluded into that mistake,
that it had been a greater Miracle he had avoided those thoughts, than
that he assum'd them. I may profess too with the same Truth, that I
fear'd as much the disclosing of my Innocency, as he detested my seeming
want of it; for I knew the discovery of his errour would but too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundantly
punish it: and I was more concern'd in his felicity than
esteem, the latter being an advantage I wholly appropriated to my self,
which also I could not but by his extream prejudice. Ah Madam, (the
ravish'd <hi>Artabbanes</hi> reply'd) the more you disclose your Virtue, the more
you manifest my Sin in having doubted it; and you increase the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, by endeavouring to extenuate it: 'Tis upon that score only,
that I receive with joy what you now deliver, as I shall do any thing of
that quality with the same reception, that contributes to a suffering I
cannot more deserve, than I am ambitious to embrace: Yes, fair <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
if I have languish'd so long a Life after the evincement of my
Crime, 'twas because I esteem'd Death rather a Reward, than a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, and because you commanded me to return; which the more
zealously I obey'd, because in that obedience I evidenc'd I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
no other penance could be inflicted on me, this transcending all
others, as much as my offences does. But now, Madam, that I have
effected that command, let your next be to become the Executioner of
your Jnstice; you will prove your Mercy greater in such an imposition,
than in a Pardon, since the first will end a Life which has lost those hopes
which only gave it a relish; and the last, by permitting me to see that
blessing I have lost, and which I can no more aspire unto without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
as high a Sin by my presumption, as by my doubts will involve
me in torments, that but to reflect on will transcend the actual operations
of all others. If (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) I am satisfy'd that you believe your
self so great a Criminal, it proceeds only that by my passing by your
offences, you have the greater obligation to me; I am too-much concern'd
in your Life to continue it in Torment, and the gods have render'd me
uncapable of that Injustice, without equally participating in the effects
of it: I do therefore with your Pardon, return you your hopes, and give
you an assurance that mine cannot have a more pleasing object, than that
you will believe your Life is so undissolubly ty'd to mine, that the cares
or negligence you have of your own, must produce resembling opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s. Great gods! (reply'd <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) you are not so
infinite as my Joy, or the Mercy which has created it; neither of those
know any limits, and your Power does, by being uncapable but by them
to make me value, or cherish my Life: Yes, my Princess (he continued,
embracing her knees, and printing a thousand burning kisses on her
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:96335:211"/>
hand), you have by so obliging a declaration, invited the happy <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,</hi>
almost to approve his Sin, in rendring it the efficient cause of so
transcendent an evincement of your favour; and made him as much in
love with his Life, as with you, or as you are with virtue; and if ever
he employs one moment of it but to celebrate your Mercy, may he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
that Crime which has so abundantly prov'd the vastness of it; or
into higher punishments, if the gods were capable of inflicting on him
any that were so. It was (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) by an infinite Number
of such expressions that these generous Lovers gave each other assurances
of their being so; which being finish'd, the Princess, who till then had
been so intent upon this admirable Adventure, that she had omitted to
cast her Eyes on <hi>Sillaces,</hi> (who so prodigally had hazarded his Life to
revenge and break her imprisonment) then did it, and being convinc'd
'twas he, by his having lifted up his Helmet, she made him retributions
worthy what created them; which fill'd <hi>Artabbanes</hi> with new admirations,
for he hitherto had thought that his Friend, and his Princess (especially
by the former having address'd him to the latter) had seen and convers'd
with one another before (which by a rare accident they had not): but
during the Combat, my generous Master had receiv'd some wounds, which
by the emotions of so passionate a conversation, were so inflam'd, and
had so much bled, that he began to give some symptom of fainting,
which cast <hi>Parthenissa</hi> into one; the care of whose recovery, created
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s: but as soon as she was restor'd to her self because of <hi>Silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
wounds as well as my Prince's, and that it was late, we resolved to go
to <hi>Arsacia,</hi> which we esteem'd a Place of security against the attempts of
<hi>Surena</hi>'s Partizans, should they have any desires of revenge, whilst <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi>
and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> wounds facilitated their acting it; I omit (said
<hi>Symander</hi>) purposely, those favours the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> honoured
me withal; which I had no sooner received and acknowledged,
than I went to a Countrey-house in sight of the place where all that I
have told you happened, and there by good fortune lighted on a young
fellow, who by often driving a Waggon, had some little skill in driving a
Chariot; with his help we got together the Horses, and mended their
Traces; but because my Prince's and his Friend's wounds made it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and painful to ride, by <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s reiterated invitations, they went
into her Chariot, and in that manner came in the close of the evening
to <hi>Arsacia,</hi> where by the help of our young Peasant (who was liberally
rewarded) we got into a private House, the Gates being already lock'd;
and because my wounds were so favourable as to permit me to pay my
duty to those my condition and inclination owed it, I went and got a
Chyrurgeon who lived in the Suburbs, from whom I understood that
the then Governour of <hi>Arsacia,</hi> was <hi>Zenophon,</hi> which was no small satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> whom he had learnt from <hi>Moneses,</hi> had ever been
a faithful servant to all his Family. I must acknowledg my satisfaction at
it was not inferiour to his, for my Father and <hi>Zenophon</hi> were Cousin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Germanes,
and yet had been more united by Friendship, than by Blood;
which obligation never ended but with my Father's life. But before my
Prince would permit his wounds to be drest, he waited on <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to
her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>'Twas there, by a world of reiterated and passionate expressions that
he acknowledged his Crime, and the Mercy that had produced it; which
latter gave him a less ill opinion of the former, by finding experimentally
there could be something that transcended it, which till so obliging an
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:96335:211"/>
evincement, had never entered into his Faith. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Sillaces</hi>
were no sooner retir'd, than they went to the woman of the House, who
they found had been bless'd with an education different to her present
quality, and of no common Beauty; they were not a little pleas'd with
both, as knowing they rendered her the fitter for a Service which she joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
went to pay the fair <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> 'Twas after this, that the two
Friends made use of the Chyrurgeon, who found how great an Enemy
their civilities had prov'd to their healths, and that the paying of their's
(unseasonably) two hours, would render them uncapable for many to do
the like. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was much more troubled at this assurance, than at
the danger which caus'd it. The Chyrurgeon being retir'd, I told the
two generous Friends (who lay both in one Chamber) that perhaps it
were not amiss, if the next morning I went to <hi>Zenophon,</hi> and acquainted
him with their being in his Government, which obligation of Trust would
not only in some good degree recompence his past fidelity, but invite his
future, and thereby procure a powerful Assistant, in case <hi>Surena</hi>'s being
alive, should thrust him into desires of revenge, and of recovery of
<hi>Parthenissa;</hi> or if dead, should infuse resembling ones into his Friends
and Partizans. <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> though he knew exactly the merit of <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>'s
fidelity, yet he consented as much to what I motion'd upon the
score that his Princess would be thereby removed to a place, and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
less unfit for her, as upon any other. This resolve being assum'd,
they endeavoured to take their rest, which the joy of <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> and
the sympathy <hi>Sillaces</hi> had in it as much hindered, as the pain and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of their wounds. The day at length appeared, and I had no
sooner informed my generous Master, that the Princess was awake, than
he sent me to the woman of the House to enquire of her Health, who
returned me word from <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> that he might know hers by his own.
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> found a misfortune in so much kindness, by finding himself
in a feaver. This made me hasten to <hi>Zenophon,</hi> whose power and care I
fear'd my Prince's sickness would need; as soon as I came to his Palace,
I desired one of his Domesticks to bring me where he was; who being
my Guide, I pass'd unexamined through his Guards, and came into a large
Hall, where I found him invironed by a throng of his Officers, and
though with <hi>Moneses</hi> I had left <hi>Media</hi> in a very green Age, yet I had still
some impressions of <hi>Zenophon,</hi> which the seeing him revived; 'twas with
some difficulty I got near-enough to be observed by him; which when I
perceived I was, I looked on him so fixtly, that perhaps it made him the
more hastily dismiss the greater part of his Officers; who were no sooner
gone, than presenting my self to him, I desired to know if he were at
leisure to hear a Stranger, who had some things of moment to inform him
of, and which it was not improbable but he might be satisfied with? I
know not whether he read something in my Face which made him guess
or suspect who I was, or whether the Times which then began to be
strangely confused, made him believe I came to give him some important
advice; but whatever was the Cause, without any ballancing, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to follow him into a Cabbinet, which was contiguous to the
Hall we then were in; whither being come, and the Dore lock'd, I ask'd
him, if he had never seen any thing that resembled me? After having
considered me narrowly, he replyed he had, but that he could not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
recollect where it had been. I thereupon told him my name,
which he had scarcely heard, but I found my self in his Arms, as a reward
of that discovery; and though by many testimonies of joy he acquainted
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:96335:212"/>
me with his, yet they were infinitely short of those demonstrations of
that Passion with which he celebrated the news I told him of my Prince's
being so near him, and in a place under his Power; after I had convinced
his belief of that Truth by many protestations he necessitated me to
make him of it, lifting up his eyes and his hands to Heaven, he cryed
out, Great Gods! you could not create my acknowledgments in a
way I should more willingly pay them, than by granting me the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of serving any of <hi>Monese</hi>'s blood; and if to this blessing you will
add that, of permitting me to see his Son seated in the Throne of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
I shall esteem my self abundantly satisfied for your having deny'd
me one. 'Twas by many resembling expressious that the generous <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
evinc'd to me his fidelity to <hi>Artabbane</hi>'s Family, was not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired;
neither did his desire to the gods in my Prince's favour relish
any thing of an ill subject; since <hi>Tygranes</hi> the then King of <hi>Media,</hi> either
by Nature or choice, was so averse to the fair Sex, that <hi>Artabbane</hi>'s
Passion for one of them, could hardly transcend his aversion for all.
<hi>Zenophon</hi> having put a period to the evincements of his joy and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
conjur'd me pressingly to conduct him, to him which had raised
them; This I obeyed, having first desired him it might be with privacy,
for that my Prince's condition if it did not already need circumspection,
yet it might; it was therefore by water that we went to his Lodging,
which (as the Governour's Palace) stood upon the River <hi>Corindas.</hi> 'Tis
as impossible as needless, to repeat all that past between them of civility;
it is sufficient you know, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> received him with all the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of satisfaction and respect, a person so replenish'd with virtue
and fidelity could either desire or hope; and <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s joy at the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was nothing inferiour to the greatness of what created it. My
Prince afterwards informed him of the quality of <hi>Sillaces,</hi> whom he
saluted, and complemented with much humility: Those ceremonies
finish'd, <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who could not but admire at any man's possessing
so high a Government as that of <hi>Arsacia,</hi> who was so declared a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan
of his Father's, as <hi>Zenophon</hi> informed him of it. To which <hi>Zenophon</hi>
replyed, Though you are (Sir) ignorant of this present Government,
yet you are not, that the past was so unequal and Tyrannical, that your
generous Father quitted not only his interest in it, but in the Kingdom;
and not to be an Enemy to <hi>Tygrane's</hi> Quiet and his own, voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
himself in <hi>Parthia.</hi> It was long before we knew what created
such ungrounded jealousies in our King, and so strange a way of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
them in his Uncle; but now the Mystery is as visible as his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
that has so long hindered it from being so. <hi>Merinzor,</hi> the first
Prince of the Blood (after <hi>Moneses</hi>) aspired by Art and Sin, to acquire
that preheminence which Nature had denied him; and having by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
insinuations made <hi>Tygranes</hi> as much his Subject by inclination, as
he was his by duty; he so successfully represented to him the danger of
having the next and certain Heir (by <hi>Tygrane's</hi> aversion, or disability
for Women) to be in the Government or Kingdom; that at length the
King by some usages which neither were consistent with <hi>Monese</hi>'s quality
or disposition, necessitated your generous Father to an Exilement: This
was no sooner effected on which <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s designs were founded, than
he appears publickly the Favourite of his King, yet so artificially, that
many believed his condition but from thence bore date; whereas some
others (though indeed but very few) concluded <hi>Monese</hi>'s Banishment
was an effect of his having been so before. <hi>Merinzor</hi> (as <hi>Tygranes</hi> has
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:96335:212"/>
since told me) assured him he might now Reign by no Law but his Will,
since the discontented had no head to give their Body; and that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi>
by being kept out of <hi>Media,</hi> would be deprived of anticipating
his Title to the Crown of it; but to leave as little to Fortune as the
nature of humane things would admit, he humbly begged his King's
permission to allow him in publick to be an earnest Solicitor for your
Father's return, which (as he said) would insinuate him in all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
that would be laid to effect it, and consequently enable him to
prevent them. The deluded <hi>Tygranes</hi> condescended to this; by which
concession, <hi>Merinzor</hi> not only cast the odium of <hi>Monese</hi>'s Banishment
entirely on the King; but also acquired to himself those of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Friends, who had not wit enough to discover <hi>Merinzor</hi> was his
Enemy; whereby many designs for his restauration became unfruitful,
and by the frequent Execution of the Conspirators, so weakened his
Party, that now there are scarcely enough left to act a design, though
not prevented by Intelligence. My Fortune, or my suspitions, kept me
out of all those unsuccessful Plots, and thereby I find my self (and some
few Friends, who I had acquainted with, and made approve of my jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies)
in a posture able to serve our generous Prince; for not only this
City, but <hi>Ecbatan, Cyrapolis</hi> and <hi>Europus,</hi> are in the power of those, who
are resolved, they cannot more justly employ theirs, than against <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi>
and for <hi>Moneses</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes.</hi> But Sir (continued <hi>Zenophon</hi>),
<hi>Tygranes</hi> being convinc'd that your Father being removed, all causes of his
Fears were so too, abandoned himself so absolutely to those vices which
unlimited power is aptest to inspire, that partly those exorbitant disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but more particularly his assuming to himself <hi>Monese</hi>'s Banishment,
from whence all our miseries took their original, has so alienated his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Affections, that <hi>Merinzor</hi> by obliging all, by permitting <hi>Tygranes</hi> to
oblige none, and by a seemingly soliciting your Father's return, having
gained those Hearts he made his King lose, began lately so much to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vizard
his designs, that I discovered and disclosed them to <hi>Tygranes;</hi> but
I had much difficulty to free my self from being thought dishonest, for
endeavouring to evince <hi>Merinzor</hi> was so; which I had not effected, had
not the gods (concerned in the discovery of so black an ingratitude),
miraculously evidenced it: For the Court being then at <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> there
came a Packet to <hi>Merinzor</hi> out of <hi>Parthia;</hi> but the day before he was
gone to a House of Pleasure not above 200 Furlongs off; where under a
pretence of passing away his Time, he employed it in gaining of Partizans,
and in establishing a fortune for himself, which should ruine his King's.
The belief I had, that in that Packet there was something of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the knowledg I had, that it lay not in the Power of inferences,
but of demonstrations, to make <hi>Tygranes</hi> revoke that unlimited Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he had so fatally trusted his Favourite with, made me determine to
hazard my own ruine to prevent my King's: I say, hazard my own ruine;
for if in that Packet I resolved to open, there had been nothing which
might have apologiz'd for my doing it, by my inclinations to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Power, I could not have avoided resenting the
most violent effects of it. In brief, I seiz'd upon those letters, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the admirable Art of a Secretary of mine decypher'd them, I
found they came from <hi>Surena,</hi> and discovered palpably a strong and
dangerous conspiracy, which was partly to be acted by some <hi>Parthian</hi>
Forces that Prince had promised him. I believe Sir (continued <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>)
you are not ignorant of <hi>Surena</hi>'s Person, and Power with <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
                     <pb n="498" facs="tcp:96335:213"/>
which hinders me from giving you a Character of either. Alas (reply'd
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>) I am but too-perfectly instructed in the latter, which has
cost me so many troubles, that 'tis no small one to remember them; but
I will another time give you their relation, in the mean while I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you to continue yours. After (said <hi>Zenophon</hi>) I had so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
disclos'd what <hi>Tygranes,</hi> not I, disbeliev'd, immediately I presented
him with what he found a misfortune then to know, but had found it a
greater to have longer ignor'd. Never did I see so sudden and so strange
an alteration; that in his looks was much inferiour to that in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
for he perceived 'twas not now by the Title, but the Virtues
of a King that he must continue one; and that <hi>Merinzor</hi> had but for a
time cast away his fears, that afterwards he might eternally cast him out
of his Throne. <hi>Tygranes</hi> in Tears told me this truth and many an other,
and by great favours convinc'd me his gratitude for my faithfulness and
vigilance, was proportionate to them; I told him 'twas not enough to
discover <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s infidelity, but he must prevent it; that nothing
was more conducive to that end, than without any respite to place men
of high fidelity, and no less resolution, in the principal Towns, which
would not only hinder <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s possessing them, but deter his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
from a conjunction with him, by so prejudicial and pregnant an
evincement, that his Conspiracy was disclosed, and partly prevented;
that if yet the despair of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Faction flung them into Arms, yet
the possession of the Towns would so protract the time, that before all
of them were lost, He might raise an Army not only to recover them
again, but to punish those that necessitated him to do it. That one of
the best advantages in a Civil War, was to secure the Cities, they being
not only Sanctuaries for small Numbers against great, but the Banks and
Magazines of a Kingdom, and without which the Countrey cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
for 'tis those which take off the fruits of the Earth, and return to
the Countrey those of Industry and Art; that possessing them, he would
gain the ablest men, which commonly make their residence there, or at
least hinder the Enemy from that advantage, which is one of the highest
in a Domestick War. I told him many things of this quality which he
approved; and because by what I had done, he was also confident of
my fidelity, he instantly gave me Commissions to place such Governours
in the four chief Cities, for whose Honesty I would answer. In <hi>Ecbatan</hi>
(which you know is Metropolis of this Kingdom) I plac'd <hi>Patafernes,
Symander</hi>'s Uncle; <hi>Arsacia</hi> I elected for my self; and for the other
two, Men of whose inclinations I am satisfied, and for whose abilities I
will more answer for, than my own. This I did with that celerity which
accompanies those actions we embrace with duty and inclination. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batan</hi>
by reason of the King's presence and Guards, we secured without
delay or hazard, and thrust out <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Governour and Creatures:
the other Three with some little difficulty we effected; but the first thing
of all that we attempted, was the seizing on <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Person, whose
intelligence of my taking his Pocket, came immediately to his knowledg,
and so he scap'd me; but so narrowly, that had he been as much hurt as
fear'd, he had not now been in so promising a condition. I believe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Zenophon</hi>) you may think it strange that in the heat of <hi>Tygrane</hi>'s
apprehensions, and of his hatred to his late Favourite, I did not embrace
so obliging a conjuncture for soliciting your Father's return; I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I was a thousand times upon the point of motioning it; but that
which suspended my doing so, was, left it might create some jealousies of
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:96335:213"/>
me, and in them, recall the power he had conferred on me, which I
intended to make use of, to place Partizans of your Family in the most
important Governments; which once being effected, would probably
render my solicitation less unsuccessful, by rendring it more dangerous to
deny, than to grant my request. This reasoning of mine, the event but
too evidently evinc'd was not groundless; for after I had secured the
chief Cities with Governours, declared Servants to <hi>Moneses,</hi> which I
palliated to <hi>Tygranes,</hi> by assuring him I knew none but your Father's
Friends that were Enemies to <hi>Merinzor;</hi> I implored of him by many
reasons and reiterated Prayers, to invite <hi>Moneses</hi> to return; from whose
Courage and Judgment, he would doubtless derive those good Services,
which by <hi>Merinzor's</hi> infidelity he needed, and which thereby he had
been so long hindered from receiving: I added to this, that had <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s infusions of your Father's designs of aspiring to the Crown, been as
true, as they were false; yet by his loss of <hi>Artabbanes</hi> (for alas (Sir) we
then were confident of that misfortune, by your being so long concealed
to the world) there was no danger of any attempts, since by the course
of Nature, <hi>Moneses</hi> was much nearer his Grave than he, and by the
course of the <hi>Median</hi> Laws, the Princess <hi>Lyndadory</hi> was excluded from
the Crown. But though <hi>Tygranes</hi> had cast off his affection for <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi>
yet he still retained those impressions he had planted in him when he
possess'd it; and consequently either as a Complement to our fidelities
upon his own score, or as an unremovable maxime he had establish'd, not
to admit of your Father's return, (for if guilty, he must thereby invest
him with too ample a power to act his designs; and if innocent, to act his
revenge) he not only positively denied me my request, but enjoyned me
never to revive it; and in expressions so violent, that instead of making
him <hi>Monese</hi>'s friend, I once apprehended he was no longer mine. Judg,
Sir (said <hi>Zenophon</hi>), if to motives of justice, having added that of his
interest and fear, I could not prevail; how much more certain I had
been of that misfortune, if I had attempted my request upon the score
only of the former: I was necessitated notwithstanding so sensible a
repulse, to make no publick demonstration of it; yet I was often deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
to betray my King into his advantage, by sending for your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the apprehension I then had, that such a proceeding before
the effect was evidenced for which I acted it, might cast <hi>Tygranes</hi> into an
eternal ruine, by occasioning him to cast himself into <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s power,
hindered me from it; which latter was but too probable: for what <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinzor</hi> did perform, he was resolved <hi>Moneses</hi> would, had he but the
Force; and of two Enemies, 'twas a rational faith, he would elect him
whom he had so recently honoured with his favour, than him, who had
never had any share in it. 'Twas upon many as pregnant reasons as these,
that I determined to expect the leisure of the gods, for the restoration
of your Family, and in the mean time to act what I could for the ruine of
the greatest Enemy of it, which I esteemed much conducive to that end.
In pursuance whereof, the King having honoured me with the title of his
Lieutenant-General, reserving to himself the Superiority over all (as a
King that desires and merits victory, determining to Court her in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
I came by his Command to this City, to raise such forces as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
would fight under the Royal Ensigns; <hi>Merinzor</hi> too, having already
so far advanc'd his preparations, as to have marching out of the Northern
parts of this Kingdom, a Body of 30000 Men, which daily increases and
with which he hopes to settle, what my successful doubts has so much
shaken and indangered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="500" facs="tcp:96335:214"/>
                     <hi>Zenophon</hi> had no sooner done speaking, than <hi>Artabbanes</hi> by many fresh
Civilities congratulated his Command, and his deserving of it; and by
particular expressions, made him many signal retributions for the care he
had of <hi>Moneses,</hi> and his Family. My Prince then let <hi>Zenophon</hi> know
that <hi>Surena</hi> was in <hi>Media,</hi> and near <hi>Arsacia,</hi> how miraculously he had
avoided the generous <hi>Sillace's</hi> Sword; and at last, that the fair <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
the Authoress of his sufferings and desires, was in the same House
with him. <hi>Zenophon</hi> was much amazed at the intelligence of <hi>Surena</hi>'s
being in <hi>Media;</hi> but he was much more satisfied to learn his Prince's
Mistress was in a place where he might serve her, and where he might
see a Perfection, which he concluded could not be but transcendent, by
making so generous a Captive; he went therefore with <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s and
her permission, to the Chamber of that excellent Beauty, which he
saw with admirations and confessions, that my Prince's desires and
sufferings could not equal in degrees that perfection which had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
them. After <hi>Zenophon</hi> by a silent wonder had complemented her
Beauty, by many pressing and humble implorings, he invited her to his
Palace, which he said would be less unworthy of her, than the Chamber
she was in. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> acknowledged this civility in expressions which
acquainted him with hers; and after the Chyrurgeons had assured her,
that the two Princes might without any danger, be removed by Boat to
<hi>Zenophon</hi>'s, she condescended to accompany them thither, where they
arrived undiscovered; which my Prince was much intent upon, lest his
accidental coming into <hi>Media,</hi> might by the conjuncture of Affairs,
relish more of Design than Chance, and consequently prejudice <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
who by the Laws of Hospitality and Gratitude, he was confined
to oblige. As soon as the Princess was retired to her Appartment, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
presented her with the fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> his Daughter and only Child,
who he begged her to accept till she could recover one that was more
capable to serve her; or if she esteemed none could be so, then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
her to accept of her for ever. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was exceedingly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with so obliging a Present; and though <hi>Emilia</hi> at first sight abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
gave her self up to the Princess, yet she could not more do so to
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> than I did the like to her. I cannot, Sir (continued <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>),
but acknowledg a Truth, which if you saw the cause of, you
would perhaps upon her account excuse this digression, whose Character
I would give you, did I not know that in such attempts, either the Lover
thinks he speaks too little, or is thought to speak too much. There is no
doubt, had not <hi>Artavasdes</hi> been too deeply concerned in the hearing
of his Friends Loves, and in the infelicities of his own, to act any thing of
mirth or suspension; he had at <hi>Symander</hi>'s cost, given himself no small
divertisement; for that faithful servant had been so little one to Love,
and so contemned the two Princes assurances, that it was a Fate as
certain as Death, that now this acknowledgment had furnished his
generous Hearer with an ample Theam for Raillery, had not those
former considerations silenced all thoughts of that quality. <hi>Symander</hi>
in expectation of this little war, had continued a while silent; but at
length perceiving, and troubled at the cause that he mist it, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
his Narration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zenophon</hi> leaving <hi>Parthenissa</hi> in her Appartment, went to see the two
Princes's in theirs; who, though his Palace was capacious enough to
afford them distinct ones had determined their Lodgings, as their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
should admit of no division. The residue of that day and the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:96335:214"/>
night, was dedicated to Rest; but <hi>Artabbanes</hi> took so little, that the
next morning his Princess being informed of it, came to visit him; and
perceiving by his indisposition, and the loss of so much blood, that he
was very pale, she became so too, and what misfortune had created in
<hi>Artabbanes,</hi> Sympathy did in his Mistriss, who by the eloquence of her
words as well as looks, acquainted him with her sufferings, which she
said, recived no small accession, that his proceeded from the service he
had done her. If (Madam, said my Prince) my present condition ought
to produce any operations in you, they should be of a contrary quality
to those you ascribe them to; for my Crime upon its own score abundantly
merited a higher punishment than these unconsiderable wounds; I have
therefore much more cause to rejoyce than repine, that what I should
have suffered as an expiatory Penance for my Sin, I do, for the duty of
serving you; your goodness having rendered my punishment needless,
'twas just my services should impose on me what your Mercy declined
the doing; and that a part of that blood should be shed for your safety,
which was all preserved by your forgiveness; but Madam, (continued
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>) may I not again stand in need of it, when I have taken the
confidence humbly to beg the knowledg of your Adventures, till my
wound permit me to acquaint you with mine? This entertainment will
be the best Charm against their Pain; for whil'st I can hear and see the
fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> my other Senses will resign their functions to those. If
(she replyed) the relation of my Story can produce so ambition'd an
effect, I shall find in it an ample recompence for all my sufferings;
which the sooner to receive, I will obey you.</p>

                  <head>The Sequel of Parthenissa's History.</head>
                  <p>After (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) that the generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> by an attempt
to silence our fears for you, had raised them for himself, by ingaging
in so dangerous and unpromising a journey, wherein he evinced the
vastness of his Friendship; (for there is hardly any of so perfect a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as to undertake that upon certainties, which his did but in hopes.)
I continued for a while free from all troubles, but those which both your
absences created, and those I sympathized in of your excellent Sisters,
and the fair <hi>Zephalinda's;</hi> for <hi>Surena,</hi> nor <hi>Arsaces</hi> on his score, did not
renew their persecution; I admired at it, as much as I was satisfied with
it; for though <hi>Surena</hi>'s words assured me not of his Passion, yet his
languishings did; and in all his visits he so pressingly implored my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
that I found he was but too much concerned in the obtaining it;
which having granted to his condition, and not to him; that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
I had also altered my concession; this I did as a necessary justice,
though he gave it a contrary Name: For those prayers which by that
proceeding he employed for obtaining of my Pardon, he would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
(as I apprehended) have imployed for obtaining my affection;
and the obstacle of his Crime being removed, it would have left <hi>Arsaces</hi>
none, whereby he might have continued his solicitations for his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.
It was above six Moons that I remained in this condition; which,
though but too full of infelicity by your absences and <hi>Surena</hi>'s presence;
yet it seems the Gods thought it not full enough; for by the folly of his
Passion he was finally reduced to as dangerous a condition, as your
Sword had done: 'Twas then that <hi>Orodes</hi> passing over all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but those of his Favourite, came to visit me, and not only implored
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:96335:215"/>
my Pardon, but my Love for him. I represented to him, that one which
could stand in need of the former, could hardly merit the latter; that
he was a Person whose Treachery rendered him as unfit for his Friendship,
as Mine; and that his actions rather called upon his Justice, than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
Madam (said <hi>Orodes</hi>) that infidelity you reproach him with,
is that which you should esteem him for; the least production of a
common Passion, is to endeavour the having it rewarded by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and by submissions; but one that could not but prove extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
by the Beauties being so that inspir'd it, you cannot admire at an
effect, resembling its cause; and that your perfections are not common,
is not a greater Truth, than that a Crime in <hi>Surena</hi> is the like. Your
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> himself I believe durst not have done so much; he loves his
Reputation more than <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> and who dares do most for her, merits
most from her. I know (Sir, I reply'd) that the generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
is more a friend to Virtue, than to Love; and I am confident he knows
I am so too; 'tis therefore only on that account I believe he durst not
have done what <hi>Surena</hi> did; neither is it any glory, that he transcends
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> in nothing but Vice; which is a preheminence he will as
certainly resign him, as surpass him in all actions of an opposite quality;
but (Sir) I hope you cannot seriously expect my affection for a Person,
who pretends no title to it, but by one which renders him unworthy of
it. I am (said <hi>Orodes</hi>) so serious in my request, that to deny it me, will
cast me into as bad a condition, as his whose preservation I solicite; my
Fate and <hi>Surena</hi>'s being unseparable. But <hi>Arsaces</hi> finding I was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in my resolves, as his Favourite in his fruitless passion, at length
converted those Prayers for my Affection, into some, for giving him a
visit; and that at least I would preserve his life, if I would not render
it happy. The King's importunities forc'd that from me, which his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
could not; and taking me with him in his Chariot, he brought
me to <hi>Surena</hi>'s Palace: I found the Master of it in a condition that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me. Pity is none of the ways to Love; for had it been, <hi>Surena</hi>
could have been no longer deny'd mine. You know (continued <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>)
that his good meen yields to none but to Two which are in this
Chamber; and yet I found it as remarkable for the change, as it had
been for the perfection. As soon as <hi>Arsaces</hi> had acquainted him I was
come to give him a visit, he raised himself faintly up, and with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
voice told me, I know not Madam, with what design 'tis you
do me this honour; is it either to see the effects of your Power, or to
increase them? 'Tis (I replyed) purely from my King's Commands,
that you derive this visit; and if mine have any influence over you, do
not I beseech you, by continuing so ill, necessitate him to command from
me another. Alas Madam (said <hi>Surena</hi>) why do you then by your
sight give me so great a dis-invitation to obey you? who can see your
Beauty, and resolve to banish himself eternally from it? your Eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
what your cruelty makes me elect; and had I not had the felicity
of beholding you now, my sufferings in few days had made me obey a
command, which your words has not now more plainly told me, than
your usage has. Yes Madam (he continued) since 'tis impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
my Flame but with my Life, I am taking that fatal and only
way of extinguishing it; and I hope in a short time so to change my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that it shall render me as worthy your Pity, as my ill Fate has
rendered me unworthy your esteem. That Death (I replyed) which
you seem to imply, is not to obey, but injure me; and I had rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:96335:215"/>
your importunities, than avoid them at that rate; 'tis your change,
not your ruine I desire. Ah Madam (<hi>Surena</hi> answer'd) the impossibility
that any Beauty can transcend yours, is not greater, than whil'st I live,
that I can decline adoring it; and if I vow'd your Eyes could act all
things, I excepted the impossibility of their quenching fires, which they
themselves inspir'd: that miracle is deny'd them by a power, which
renders that deficiency a greater: so that if you command me to live,
you consequently command my Passion to live with me; and you must
resolve to suffer the effects of the latter, if you enjoyn the continuance
of the former: I tell you (Madam) ingenuously what you must permit,
if you permit me to live, That either I may put a period to my
Torments, by putting a period to my Life; or not be deluded
into fresh Miseries by fresh Expectations, which will vanish as
soon as my sickness does, and add to the Miseries of losing my
Cure, that of losing my Hopes. So resolute a demand (continued <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>)
was so far from inducing me to say more in his favour, that it
made me repent I had said so much; which I had no sooner told him,
than <hi>Arsaces</hi> demonstrated as great a despair, as what I had said, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
<hi>Surena</hi> in. And truly the King by such moving conjurations and
humblings, so far transported me beyond my resolution, that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our visit was a promise I made <hi>Surena</hi> of a pardon for all was
past. But le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t this might invite him to actions that might need it again,
to qualifie my forgiveness, I told him, he derived it only from <hi>Arsace</hi>'s
commands, and his own condition. He prest me extreamly before I
left him, to say he derived it immediately from me; but that I was so
far from telling him, that it made me profess, if he was not satisfied
with what I had already spoke, I should rather recall my concession,
than any way increase it. <hi>Surena</hi> (as he said) by this visit, was in few
days able to pay me one, which he did, and entertained me with retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,
not desires. To invite him to a perseverance therein, I used
him with much more Civility and Freedom than either his offence or my
resentment for it had made me formerly practice: Neither was I out of
hope, but that receiving favours, when he desired none, and none when
he desired any, his reason might invite him then to what it should have
done before. I must acknowledg, I could hardly have been civil to him
upon any other score; and I had had no small difficulty to perswade my
modesty to listen to such constant expressions of Gratitude with satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but that I found it less troublesom to hear his thanks, than his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
and to have him acknowledg obligations, than desire them: For
a quarter of a year <hi>Surena</hi> gave me no other troubles, but those of his
Visits; but then he began to add to them, those of his accustomed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities;
I know not whether he believed, what I had elected to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his addresses, was to invite them; or whether those Civilities I did
him to reward his silence, was to solicite the breaking it; but I know,
if these were his Thoughts, as soon as he reveal'd, he had no reason any
longer to retain them; for I gave him so resolute a reprehension, that he
found I had been kind, but to keep him from imploring my being so;
and that he could not elect a more certain way to be deny'd my affection,
than to solicite it; I cannot certainly acquaint you whether this usage,
or some internal infirmity which then began to manifest it self, was the
cause of his Sickness; but I can, that suddenly after, he fell into a very
dangerous one; and though it were equally so to his former, and that
<hi>Arsaces</hi> did me the honour constantly to visit me; yet he never desired
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:96335:216"/>
I should do so to <hi>Surena:</hi> But the satisfaction I received thereat, I soon
observed, was too dearly purchased; for in some four or five successive
visits, I observed <hi>Orodes</hi> had so incessantly his Eyes fixt on mine, and
uttered such disordered and disjointed discourses, that I began to doubt
what his next seeing me made me but too certain of: for after all the
Court which waited on him, were retired into a Gallery contiguous to
my Chamber, <hi>Arsaces</hi> spoke these words, with as much trouble as I
heard them. Madam, Though you should infinitely admire that I do
not now solicite you for my dying Friend; yet I do as much, that I have
done it so long, and that I should employ those prayers for another,
which your Beauty makes me stand in need of for my self: I believe
fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> (he continued) you cannot so much admire at my making
now this declaration, as that I did it not sooner; and the greatest wonder
next your Beauty, is, that I have so long declined adoring it: whilst
my Love was kindling, my Friendship transcended it; but now it burns,
it has consumed my Friendship, and I fear will consume me, unless you
afford me as much Love, as you inspire. This assurance cannot be more
confident than true; and I esteemed I had no higher motive to induce
you to save your King, than to acquaint you that you have the power
to do it. I believe (said <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> to her generous Auditors) by
your own surprize, it will not be very difficult to perswade you of Mine;
but as soon as the first disorders of it were a little mitigated, I turned
my Eyes towards the King, and sound those I had so lately suppress'd
could not transcend those which were visible in him; and though this
gave me too palpable an assurance of a Truth, which none could have
been more ambitious to have discovered, than I was troubled to have
done it; yet I told him: This discourse (Sir) which you have made
me of your Love, is doubtless to revenge my not conferring mine on
<hi>Surena;</hi> and I consider this Raillery with joy, as my belief, that 'tis the
only penance you will impose on the necessity of my disobedience. I
rather hope (<hi>Arsaces</hi> reply'd) that your esteeming that a Raillery, which
I now tell you in so much earnest, is the only penance you will prescribe
me, for not having told you of it sooner: or if you esteem me so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the honour of your Conversation, as in it to speak any thing
unserious, your Beauty might more justly have made you assume that
thought, when I did implore your bestowing it on another, than when I
do, your conferring it on me: But Madam, if you believe it as great an
injury to your modesty to acknowledg your conquest, as I know 'tis to
your Eyes to decline it; yet your reason cannot be but convinc'd of
your victory, when I assure you I have seen <hi>Surena</hi> languish with as little
reluctancy, as you have done it; when even his silence pleaded for him,
as much as his conditition: for I suspected he kept it, out of a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
that I was become his Rival, which he has discovered either from
my not persevering his Intercessor, or my sighs, which are now more
inflamed than those of grief used to be, has told him, what I had not
the confidence to do. This proceeding, fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> affords you no
low, nor perhaps unpleasing Character of my Passion; for at the same
instant that I but implore your affection, I act your revenge, which gives
me a hope that what obliges you, cannot be detested by you. These
words he animated with so passionate a tone and action, that even those
did also speak: but as I was about to do so, I was relieved by the fair
<hi>Zephalinda,</hi> in whose presence <hi>Arsaces</hi> entertained me a while in words
of a contrary quality, either that he would conceal his Passion from all,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:96335:216"/>
or particularly from <hi>Surena</hi>'s Sister; and though the King continued a
while in my Chamber; yet by the disorders and disjointedness of his
discourse, I found how much he was troubled, that <hi>Zephalinda</hi> had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him. But he could not be more offended thereat, than I was
satisfied; for thereby I procured some time towards the forming my
answers, and the course I was to follow in this new emergency; for I was
hopeful to improve his passion to a better end, than that for which he
had assumed it; and make it the means of bringing <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
which was designed to deprive him of her. As soon as <hi>Orodes</hi>
was retired, <hi>Zephalinda</hi> told me, At last Madam, I believe I shall make
my visits prove what hitherto I fear they did not, a satisfaction to you,
proportionate to that I receive in paying you them; for but even now I
have had the effect of my incessant solicitations: <hi>Surena</hi> has given that
to my Prayers, which he should long since have done to Reason and
Vertue: Yes (<hi>Madam</hi>) he has protested to me by what he ador'd, as
much as now he does but admire, That if he has any Passion for you, it is
only to serve you, and that he will employ as much Care and Art for
your union with <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> as he has done to binder it; and I am come
to implore you from him, to give him a visit, that he may give you those
demonstrations of his conversion, which may induce you as much to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the reality of it, as already I do. I know not (said <hi>Parthenissa,</hi>
prosecuting her discourse) whether it be the nature of all my Sex, to
fear the Truth of what they most desire; but I am certain 'tis mine; and
consequently I had many pregnant jealousies, that <hi>Surena</hi> but seemingly
yielded that to his King, which he really preserved for me; and that
what he now did, was an action of Policy, and not Conversion: I was
often about to tell <hi>Zephalinda</hi> my doubts, but left they might be an
offence (which mine own defects, and <hi>Arsaces</hi> letting me know <hi>Surena</hi>
did not know his Passion, made me the apter to fancy), I did at last,
(more convinc'd by <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s Prayers, than Reasons) condescend to
visit her Brother, into whose Chamber I was no sooner come (for yet
his indisposition made him keep it) then staying his Sister, and sending
all the rest out of it, he told me, with a confidence which I believed
nothing but Truth could put on, at least that a Lover could not, speaking
to his Mistris: That I have had a Passion, Madam, for you, is not so strange,
as that I now divest my self of it; and those hopes which despair should
have made me lay down, I do now, by way of reparation for their having
been so offensive and dangerous; I am also so sensible of having inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
a Passion, which I now as much esteem as I have envy'd; that I
find as transcendent a satisfaction in having mist my desires, as I should
in having obtained them: Those Prayers therefore which I hitherto em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for your affection, I do now, Madam, for your Pardon, which is
now as necessary to my Life, as that was to my Felicity; which you may
establish without being obnoxious to your own; formerly you were to
be vicious to make me happy, now you are but to be virtuous to do it;
your Inconstancy then could only be my cure, but 'tis your Mercy now
that only can be so; which to obtain, I protest by all the gods, and by
those which are more particularly concerned in the punishment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
I will never have any desires for you, but to see you by an Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
union in his embraces, who now, and never but till now, I esteemed
the least unworthy of you. What need I tell you more (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>),
than that <hi>Surena</hi> by such expressions and vows gave a beginning to that
Faith, which in progress of time he so well improved and setled, that
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:96335:217"/>
his change was as absolutely my belief, as desire. But what the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
declined, the King assumed, and I read the greatness of his Love,
by the conquest it had obtained over his Friendship; he gave me besides
some signal evincements of it every day, though I was not a little dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to retrench all opportunities, that by my actions I might acquaint
him with my intentions, which I esteemed the civillest and certainest way
of denial. I must acknowledg I was both satisfied and troubled at a
Passion so replenish'd with respect, as that of <hi>Orodes</hi> was; for though
on the one side, it secured me from those violences, his power and flame
might inspire him with; yet on the other, it hindered me from suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his hopes and importunities. <hi>Surena</hi> being recovered of the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
both of his Body and Mind, gave me as many visits under the
notion of a Friend, as he had done under that of a Lover, and as a fresh
evincement he was no more the latter; he told me one day, Certainly,
Madam, the gods are not a little concerned in the having me lay down
my Passion, by ordaining two things for the reward of that performance,
which I most ambitioned, That of obliging you, and <hi>Orodes;</hi> who has
this morning disclosed to me a Flame I should have wondered at, had he
not told me, 'twas you that inspir'd it: By the experimental knowledg
I have had of your Beauty, I was not so much surpriz'd at that declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as when after he had made it, that he could conjure me to pardon
his being my Rival, and that I would no longer continue his: I esteemed
it strange, that he which resented the influence of your Eyes, could think
me capable of not doing the like; and that I should decline the power
of a God, to obey that of a King; I told him this, but to indear an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
I had prophetically conferred on him; but after I had cast him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Troubles, great enough to let him know those my obedience would
involve me in, I assur'd him of it. Truly Madam, he contracted a joy
so great at the promise I would lay down my passion, that I believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can transcend it, but an assurance that you will accept and reward
his. I did this readily, that he might conclude 'twas with willingness,
that thereby convincing him I was no longer his Rival, I might become
his Confident, and pay you those duties, which one more concerned in
his Interest than yours, would never do; I had also this farther hope,
that since out of a respect to him, I could divest my self of my Flame,
it might upon the generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s return, take from <hi>Arsaces</hi> all
excuses of continuing his; since it manifested there was actually a Power
in your Adorers to decline that Title, which without this President, he
might have alledged was an impossibility. I knew not (continued <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>) whether I had cause to resent this as an obligation; for though
as <hi>Surena</hi> stated it, there might be some possibility of its success; yet
that was so small, as it left it disputable whether there were any, or no;
for examples of virtue are more often commended, than practiced by
those, who promise themselves a higher satisfaction in declining their
imitation; especially too, when the quality of the Person preserves him
from suffering, but in Mens opinions; whereas if <hi>Surena</hi> had still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
an Affection for me, it might have denyed <hi>Arsaces</hi> a liberty,
which this Concession absolutely afforded him; and thereby, by having
two Lovers, have been preserved from having one: I let <hi>Surena</hi> know
this was my opinion; but he was so wedded to his, that he assured me,
were he to act his part again, and had only heard those reasons, and not
that they were Mine, he had followed his own, which nothing could
induce him to believe, were the worst, but my thinking them so. At
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:96335:217"/>
length <hi>Arsaces,</hi> convinc'd that <hi>Surena</hi> was not his Rival, made him really
his Confident, who so artificially acted his part, that he satisfied us both;
and to make his King the less solicite me, he gave him still better answers
from me, than ever were given him by me: I yielded to this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by <hi>Surena</hi>'s advice; who pretending the greatest knowledg in <hi>Orodes</hi>'s
humour, made me esteem him the fittest to manage it: But whilst the
Court of <hi>Parthia</hi> was in this Condition, the Kingdom was engaged in a
bloody War: For the <hi>Tabienians</hi> knowing their Crimes merited no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
neither expected nor implored the King's; your unfortunate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Surena,</hi> having rendered you uncapable to command the
Army, and the generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> having declined that honour to restore
us your Company, it was conferred on <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who you know is
a Prince merits that Title, and wanted success in nothing, but in what
you had too much; I cannot tell whether his desire to serve his King, or
his hopes to become more fortunate in the fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi> by the Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Honour, than he had been thitherto by those of Love, made
him accept that Command; but I can, that he did: and though by the
situation of the Countrey, and the despair of those that inhabited it,
the War was protracted; yet <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had that consolation, that
he never lost an opportunity to fight; and never did fight, but he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious:
In the end his Courage and Conduct made him entirely so
over the <hi>Tabienians;</hi> but at his return from that victory, he found
thereby he had nothing facilitated another, which he a thousand times
more ambitioned; for <hi>Zephalinda</hi> was as uncapable of having a Passion
for any, as all that saw her, were, of declining one for her. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
War concluded; by the advance of <hi>Pompey,</hi> an exteriour one began:
<hi>Orodes,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Pacorus,</hi> with a vast Army marched to the confines
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Phraates</hi> with another into <hi>Syria,</hi> to infest
the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, hoping that by making two Wars abroad, they
should hinder any to be made at home. I purposely omit telling you
what Complements <hi>Arsaces</hi> made me at his departure; and how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
if he ambition'd Lawrels, 'twas only to lay them at my feet. But
by the as strange, as sudden Peace <hi>Pompey</hi> made with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> he
found himself necessitated to advance with a part of his Army into <hi>Syria</hi>
to fortifie that of <hi>Phraates,</hi> which abundantly needed it, by the <hi>Roman</hi>
General's being more concerned to relieve his Friends, than to make any
new acquisitions. <hi>Pompey</hi> by this re-inforcement of his Enemies, or called
home by the dawning confusions in <hi>Italy,</hi> setled his Affairs by Treaty
with <hi>Orodes,</hi> and so returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the King to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> where
he was received in Triumph, his Flatterers alledging he had obtained a
victory, by not losing one to the <hi>Romans; Pacor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> had not so much as
this pretence to a triumphant reception; for he was entirely defeated by
the generous <hi>Artavasdes;</hi> who us'd his success so handsomly, that his
very Enemies did hardly envy, or deplore it. <hi>Surena,</hi> who amongst
many others enjoyed the benefit of his Civility, assured me it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the effect I mention'd. The winter of this year, the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
resided at <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and <hi>Arsaces</hi> as constantly persecuted me, though
I must acknowledg I avoided many importunate days, by <hi>Surena</hi>'s Art
and Friendship. About this time there happened an Accident, which
though for a while it exempted me from <hi>Arsace</hi>'s Addresses; yet soon
after it afforded him a Liberty to continue them with more assiduity and
hope: 'Twas the Death of his Queen; who having been in some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
whilst she was in labour of <hi>Phraates,</hi> had solemnly protested, if <hi>Iuno
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:96335:218"/>
Lucinia</hi> (who you know we acknowledg Guardian of the Genial Bed)
would free her from it, she would wholly sequester her self from the
World, and dedicate her the residue of her Life. This the goddess
granted, and this the Queen performed; and though the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this vow was esteemed a great misfortune; yet it was a greater,
that she had not made it after the generous <hi>Pacorus</hi> Birth. The solemnity
of the funeral being celebrated for one Queen, <hi>Orodes</hi> attempted to make
another, by offering me that Title in such earnest and pressing words,
that I was as much troubled to find they were real, as another would
have been to have doubted it. Whilst the Queen was living, I had
some pretence to decline his Addresses, and to render that an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
from his condition, which really was one from mine: Though he
often told me, That his Queen by having voluntarily banished her self
from his Bed, had given him provocation enough to make another assume
her place: That though it were a custom amongst the Kings of <hi>Parthia</hi>
to have but one wife, yet it was not a law; which though it had been,
yet the cause of his infringing it, would sufficiently apologize for it, and
that my Beauty would render the preserving that practice a stranger
thing, than the violating of it. To this I answered, That it was a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
evincement Bygamy was extream odious, since custom without
law had so long hindered our Kings from it: That there was a sufficient
determent in the very act, since no penalty was imposed on the committing
it: That I should receive more horror from being the cause of violating
so sacred and ancient a Practice, than advantage by the honour I might
thereby derive; and that that custome of our Kings having but one wife,
was so ingrasted in the Hearts of all the <hi>Parthians,</hi> that I should not
only be considered by them, but by my self, as his Concubine, rather
than his Queen: 'Twas with many resembling-reasons, and as many
pressing conjurations, that during the Life of the Queen I preserved
my self from that Title: But now the gods having removed that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
they left me without any, especially since I had always represented
her as the greatest, and indeed as the only obstacle; which I had done,
not only by <hi>Surena</hi>'s Counsel, but by that of my Reason; for I found
none so civilly unanswerable, nor so long like to continue so, as that.
<hi>Orodes</hi> when he made me the offer of a Crown, told me with it, that
doubtless the just gods, who knew the vastness and clearness of his Flame,
had purposely removed all obstructions that might hinder my reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. This unexpected accident, and his so resolute and pressing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
cast me into great perplexities, which I may justly term so, though
they were created not from what I was to resolve, but what to answer.
At length, lest he might esteem my silence a Concession, I told him, By
giving me (Sir) too great an opinion of your Passion, you may create
in me a proportionate fear to receive it; for if as soon as your Queen
is in her Grave, you take another into her Bed, you will demonstrate
how little esteem you make of a Wife, and consequently make me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
being yours; besides (Sir), so precipitate a proceeding, may
induce the World to believe 'twas not the gods, but the King that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
his obstructions; I shall therefore (Sir) conjure you, as you
esteem my satisfaction, or your Kingdoms, protract your desires till I
may without prejudice receive them. <hi>Arsaces</hi> told me I might rather
create inferences of the greatness of his Flame, than Fears of its reality,
by his passing over all considerations which came in competition with it;
but since I did not decline, but suspend the recompence of it, he would
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:96335:218"/>
to satisfie my nice scruples, indure some days of Torment; for so (he
said) he must term all those, which he was to spend in the condition he
then was in. He withdrew himself not long after, and gave me leisure
to reflect on the cruelty of my condition; for if on the one side I reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
acknowledged my affection, and unalterable resolution for <hi>Arta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,</hi>
I should thereby not only eternally confirm his Banishment, and
consequently not only deprive my self of Him, but also of that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which I solely and absolutely expected from him, and so exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Orodes,</hi> that it would inevitably (as <hi>Surena</hi> protested to me, who
was perfectly vers'd in his Nature) make him run to those extreams, which
he could not think on without Horror; and to prevent which, I had
treated him with so little cause of disgust: and on the other side, if I
disclosed not my affection for you, I left my self by the Queens unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Death, not many dayes of disguisement, which would no sooner
be effluxt, than I must absolutely fall into one of those extreams I so
justly apprehended, and thithetto I had so artificially and painfully
avoided. These sad reflexions, though they were much extenuated by
the constant visits and consolations of <hi>Lyndadory</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda;</hi> yet
at length they had so efficacious an operation on me, that by degrees they
cast me into an indisposition, which increas'd as the allotted-time for the
King's mourning expired. The gods shall be my witness, I implored them
with constant Tears and Prayers, to send me some such Sickness as might
ruine this little and unfortunate Beauty, which was so likely else to ruine
me: I did this (generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) out of a true character I had
contracted of your virtue, which I concluded could not despise one that
wanted Beauty, but by having lost it for you; and who apprehended
not the losing your affection, in giving you an evincement as great as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
of her own. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> by an action altogether humble
and acknowledging, interrupted his Princess, to make his words do the
like, which to the best of my remembrance were these: Though there
are not any things I so passionately ambition as the transcendent felicity
of receiving testimonies of my Princess esteem, and of satisfying her,
I adore the Beauty of her Mind at least as much as that of her Face; yet
I had much rather be resolved of the former, and convince her of the
latter, by assurances and by vows, than by so fatal a manifestation;
neither would the gods give so undeniable a proof of their want of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
as to destroy a perfection they cannot restore or repeat; 'twas
better a thousand times the criminal, <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> should lose his hopes, than
the world so unimitable a Beauty; and <hi>Arsaces</hi> could not be so unjust
in having so persecuting a Passion for it, as you, Madam, in wishing it so
dear and criminal a cure. I did not only (said the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) with
it that cure, but rather than he should want it, I would have conferred it
on him by my Death; and 'twas but fit I should act that for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my affection, which only can put a period to it. My Prince
would have made her some proportionate retributions to what had made
him esteem it necessary, had he not esteemed it more so, to obey his
Princess, who imposed on him the keeping of silence; and as a further
confinement to it, she thus continued her discourse: Whilst I was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
away a Time which yet I thought much more too short, than
<hi>Arsaces</hi> the contrary; the generous <hi>Pacorus</hi> never left soliciting his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till he had procured a second Army to repair the disgrace of having
lost the first; which he had no sooner obtained, than he did too a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
against the <hi>Armenians;</hi> which had wanted nothing of meriting
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:96335:219"/>
that Name, had it been won against the same General, to whom <hi>Pacorus</hi>
had lost one; but perhaps had he been present, who should have perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
his success, it might have hindered it. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> thought he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
this Civility from <hi>Symander,</hi> till he had protested he did that
Truth from <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> whose words and Story the Faithful Servant
thus prosecuted. My indisposition (the Princess continued) proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absolutely from that of the Mind, had a languishing and slow ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on the Body, which the Physicians said nothing but time could
render dangerous. <hi>Arsaces</hi> having assumed this belief, the less incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
to pass away the remainder of the Morning Year, or to usurp
the Glory of his Sons success, or (as he protested to me) to avoid seeing
my indisposition, which his sympathy would make him assume; with an
Army raised in haste, he marched so to the siege of <hi>Tygranocerta,</hi> which
<hi>Pacorus</hi> the next day after his Victory had besieged. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> from an unnecessary trouble, acquainted her
how he had from the generous <hi>Ventidius,</hi> received at large the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all those transactions in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which he promised that night
to Communicate to <hi>Sillaces.</hi> I have then (said the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>)
but to inform you, that <hi>Arsaces</hi> came to <hi>Nineveb</hi> before <hi>Pacorus</hi> and
<hi>Altezeera;</hi> which though he alleged was but to render her reception
the more considerable, was indeed to summon me of my inferred engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the last day of his mourning, being that of his return. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of my indisposition gave me an accepted excuse, which I would
have constantly purchased at the same rate. Neither did I despair of
both; and that which gave me those hopes was, the having lost all Mine
of your returns; for now 'twas above two Years, since we had remain'd
in a perfect ignorance of your Fortunes; which made me apprehend <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>'s
affection for me, and his knowledg of mine for you, had made him
destroy what I wanted but the certainty of, to do the like unto my
self: But <hi>Surena</hi> by passionate Oaths of <hi>Arsace</hi>'s innocence, removed my
jealousies of him; but nothing could my fears for you, which I hoped
would have so impaired my small Beauty, that by my loss of it, you had
not suffered the loss of me: But not long after I found the flattery of
those imaginations, which <hi>Arsaces</hi> by a visit entirely banish'd; for after
he had commanded (having first obtained my permission) all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to retire, he told me, That indisposition (Madam) which I did
hitherto consider as my punishment alone, I now do as yours also, for
the just Gods have imposed it on you, to revenge your not rewarding a
Flame as bright and pure as those Eyes, and that Virtue which created it.
The year of mourning, my fair Princess, is now expired; Your so long
declining to be my Queen, made my Mind wear that Livery, as much as
my Body did, for the loss of my other: let not your coldness make me
any longer carry it; neither, Madam, can you do it without publishing
you have not delay'd, but refus'd to reward my Passion; for since to deny
me my cure, you decline your own, that belief will be with more reason
assumed, than it can be rejected. Sir (I replyed) you might rather
infer from the strange continuance of my indisposition, that the gods are
not a little ingaged to prevent an union so unworthy the great <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
and consequently so apprehended by me: Therefore (Sir) you cannot
consider that as my punishment, which is both the gods and my desire;
but could my receiving your affection be as efficacious as you alledg,
judg then, I beseech you, thereby, how much I am concern'd in not
committing that fault, since to prevent it, I decline not only my own
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:96335:219"/>
cure, but my King's. You may, my fair Princess (said <hi>Arsaces</hi>), rather
conclude that your indisposition, if not sent you as a punishment from the
gods, is at least sent you as an evincement my Flame is confined to you,
more than to your Beauty; and that they are not a little concerned in
the manifestation of this truth, since they elect so dear a way to evince
it; and rather than not prove the greatness of the one, impair the
greatness of the other: If, Madam, I had the power to obey your
Commands of a longer expectancy, I should not implore their revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
for the highest honour next to obeying, is receiving them;
do not therefore, fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> expect a testimony of my respect, from
what will give you an ill one of my Flame; and believe it, Madam,
that must be an impossibility, which your commands and satisfaction
cannot make me obey. He entertained me with many professions and
requests of this Nature, before he left me: And a little after, <hi>Surena</hi>
came to visit me; but with a Countenance as full of sadness, as my
Heart, which he brought no small accession to, by assuring me he fear'd
our Griefs had the same source: Alas, I found his apprehensions were
but too justly grounded, when he further assured me, that at his meeting
<hi>Arsaces</hi> as he came out of my Chamber, he had told him, that he now
found what he had considered as a delay, was a refusal; but that he
was determined to make all those that meant to delude him, find in
the end that they did delude themselves. He said this too (continued
<hi>Surena</hi>) in one of those Tones which he uses when he is unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in earnest; which makes me conclude, he will shortly make use of
Power, to obtain what he cannot by Intreaty. Alas, <hi>Surena</hi> (I replyed),
is there no way but Death to avoid a Tyranny I more justly detest? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Madam, he answered, I am confident there is no way of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
left by Flight; for under the Title of his future Queen, he has
already given you a Guard, which is not so much to defend, as to
detain you; and could we deceive their intelligence, or corrupt their
Faith, what retreat could you propound? for all the Kings of <hi>Asia</hi>
would fear the receiving a Beauty, which unavoidably will carry a
War after it as great as it self; and by making a while their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
a Sanctuary for you, render them in a short time none for
themselves; for <hi>Arsaces</hi> will employ all the forces of his Empire, to
repossess what he values more than it; which will hinder any Prince
from so dangerous a Charity. I must then (I replyed) be my own
Sanctuary; and the first insolence <hi>Arsaces</hi> offers me, shall be the
last; for when he loses the respect due unto my Sex, I will lose that
due unto his Quality, and let him know I lived only for <hi>Artabbanes,</hi>
which when I may no longer do in this world, I will go and expect
him in another, where all Power is employed to preserve, not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
a generous Passion. But, <hi>Madam</hi> (said <hi>Surena</hi>) should the gods
call unto them the blessed <hi>Artabbanes</hi> who is the cause of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
would not the effect then cease? and might not <hi>Orodes</hi> expect
your Affection, when you could no longer confer it on his Rival? If,
said I (much offended at so strange a question), the gods call <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
to a fitter residence for him, I shall esteem it so for me, and soon after
give him my Company, either by the help of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rief, or Resolution.
I had scarce ended these words, when I found <hi>Surena</hi> at my Feet, where
in expressions as humble, and moving, as his posture, he implored a fresh
pardon for having persecuted and injured a Flame so pure, that it shew'd
him he had acted a Sin, in only adoring the possessor of it; which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:96335:220"/>
he would leave no means unessayed; and if all others fail'd, he
would involve the <hi>Parthian</hi> Empire in as great troubles, as the King of
it could involve me. This proceeding made me change those words
into retributions, which I intended to have imployed in reproaches;
which his seeming solicitation for the King, made me esteem him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of <hi>Surena</hi> was as much satisfied with my Gratitude, as I was with
the cause of it; and to misemploy no time, he went immediately to
<hi>Arsaces</hi> to search further into his resolutions. All that day, and the
next, I heard nothing either from him or the King; the last consoled me
for the first; but the night of the Third, <hi>Surena</hi> came into my Chamber
somewhat late, and told me, That the cause why he had not so long
visited me, and why he then did it at so unseasonable an hour, was to
do me service, and to bring me the News he had done it. For (said he)
at length, Madam, I have perswaded <hi>Orodes</hi> that your coldness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from your indisposition, of which you might be soon recovered,
did you but change the Air: That the Castle of <hi>Eden</hi> (which stands in
the Island that bears the same name) is a place whose strength and scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was as fit for your cure, as safety; and that if with your Sickness,
you did not cast off your disdain, there would be then no excuse left
you, and a sufficient one given him to act his desires by those wayes he
should imagine soonest feasible and conducive to them: I was, Madam
(continued <hi>Surena</hi>), necessitated to give him hopes of success, to hinder
him from acting it; and 'twas thereby that I have procured your license
to go into this Castle, where I shall have more opportunities to act
your security, than I can have here; for the Garison (as the Castle) is
mine; and if <hi>Orodes</hi> should continue his Passion, I hope so to order
your affairs, that you shall never be the Sacrifice of it. I made <hi>Surena</hi>
many retributions proportionate to the obligations. The next day I had
the honour to receive a visit from the Princess <hi>Altezeera,</hi> who was newly
come to <hi>Nineveh;</hi> in whose Person and Conversation, I found almost
Charms enough to suppress that dissatisfaction I had contracted for her
inconstancy to the generous <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who I knew could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her Love, because he did possess <hi>Artabbanes's</hi> Friendship. I was
disenabled from making her my Retributions at her own Appartment, or
making a greater acquaintance with her, which my first seeing her gave
me a passionate desire of; for the King, intent upon every thing which
might probably contribute to my health, the succeeding morning gave
me a visit, and conjured me, as he condescended to every thing for my
satisfaction, so by a resembling return I would reward his care and
passion. I was exempted from giving him any reply, by the arrival of
<hi>Lyndadory</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> to whom I had given advice of my sudden
remove, and whose companies in my retreat I had desired, and obtained:
<hi>Arsaces</hi> observing by their presence, he could neither continue his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
nor expect any returns to them, led me to a Gally which was
provided for us, and then, as a civility, accompanied us to the Castle of
<hi>Eden,</hi> only (as he said) to see if there wanted any thing for our recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We had not many Furlongs thither; yet our ascending the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
(because the violence of it) took up the whole Day; so that
<hi>Arsaces</hi> continued there all the Night, which (as <hi>Surena</hi> told me) he
spent in giving the Captain of my Guard (that followed me) instructions
to prevent my escape, should I have any such design; and promising to
his care, recompences, such as nothing should transcend but his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
should he neglect it. The day following, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> (taking
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:96335:220"/>
away <hi>Surena</hi>'s Garison, alledging it unfit they should be where his
Guards were) after some assurances of his Passion, and desires to receive
and reward it, returned to <hi>Nineveb;</hi> which perhaps he did the sooner,
from a belief, that his absence would be as contributary to my health, as
any other prescription. The Isle of <hi>Eden</hi> is a place so replenish'd with
all the Beauties of Art and Nature, that doubtless the Jews (a Nation
not very remote), have some reason to justifie it the scituation of the
Earthly Paradice; for I believe 'tis as difficult to find in it a defect, as to
wish it an addition. For some Moons in this pleasing residence, we past
a Life that had no Clouds, but what our fears and sufferings for the
absence of you two, created; but to these not long after we added that of
<hi>Orode's</hi> Company, who one day told me, he could no longer deprive
himself of Mine, and that I must prepare next morning to return to <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi>
to assume a Title I had but too long declined. Though I made
many pressing implorings to suspend a little longer my return to a place
which had so much indangered my health, and my leaving one had so
much restored it; yet he was as deaf to my Prayers, as I had been to
his; for immediately he gave order for my removal next Day, and the
same went to <hi>Nineveh</hi> (as he said) to make my reception the less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of me. <hi>Surena</hi> begg'd his permission to remain in <hi>Eden</hi> that
Night, to do the last honours of his House, and to wait on me in my
return; but <hi>Arsaces,</hi> either from wilfulness, or suspition, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it. They were no sooner gone, than <hi>Zephalinda</hi> and <hi>Lindadory</hi>
came to my Appartment to consult on so great an extremity, which was
the more so, by <hi>Surena's</hi> necessitated and unexpected remove; on whose
advice and promises, I had establish'd my greatest confidence; but alas,
we found in our consultations rather subjects of despair, than relief; for
the more we reflected on my danger, the higher we always found it. At
length I told them, that what confined me from hopes of escaping, taught
me what to elect; and though the cruel gods hindered my being <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>'s;
yet they had not the power to hinder me from not being any
others. This I spoke with a Countenance which did speak my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and this immediately drew some tears into the Princesses Eyes,
which more troubled me, than to have acted the design that caus'd them;
whilst I was giving consolations, where it may be another had needed
them, there came a Stranger hastily into the Room, whom we no longer
thought one, than whilst he kept this disguise; for as soon as he had
cast it off, we knew him to be <hi>Surena,</hi> who in a disordered haste told
me, Madam, the concern I have in your Interests, makes me decline
my own; for only to offer you my service in keeping you from your
Enemy, I have made the King irreconciliably mine; for I have not only
violated his Commands by leaving <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but am resolved to repeat
my disobedience, if the honour of yours enjoyn it me: In a word, Madam,
<hi>Arsaces</hi> told me he can no longer decline a blessing he has as much power,
as will to invest himself in; and since to evince the greatness of his respect,
he has so long delayed it; to evince the greatness of his Passion, he will
no longer do it; that the next day after you return, he will make you
his Queen, or if your coldness do decline so satisfying his desires, you
will thereby invite him to the same end, though by a much differing
way. These, Madam (continued <hi>Surena</hi>), were his very words; which
he accompany'd with so many horrid oaths, that he has rendered it a less
crime to act his sin, than to decline it. I am therefore come to offer
you a Life for the preservation of your Loves, which has been too much
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:96335:221"/>
employed to distract, and ruine them; I present it you as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
my crime, as to hinder my King from acting his, which nothing
but some sudden and brisk resolution can prevent; were we but out of
this Island, I durst promise you a retreat in a Kingdom, where I hope
you may one day Reign; for <hi>Merinzor,</hi> the most considerable Person
in <hi>Media,</hi> now <hi>Moneses</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> are out of it, is so much my friend,
and so much more one to virtue, that were we but there, <hi>Arsaces</hi> must
take that great Empire, before he take you: This I dare engage my self
for; though I have practised the obtaining <hi>Merinzor's</hi> affection, but
only since I apprehended the violence of my King's, would render it
useful and necessary to you. We had (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) after <hi>Surena's</hi>
assurance of a Sanctuary, a thousand propositions how to recover it;
and that which gave me the greatest approbation for that which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
was, that <hi>Media</hi> could not but have many servants to <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,</hi>
who by the Laws of it, and Nature, was one day to wear that
Crown; <hi>Zephalinda</hi> advised, that by some device or other, <hi>Orodes</hi> might
be again drawn to visit us, and then that <hi>Surena</hi> should seize upon him,
and make his liberty the ransom of Mine, and her Brothers; with whom,
and with her, I might retire into <hi>Media; Lyndadory</hi> approved this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
so she might be of the Company; which she alledged might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
bring some security to it, by her being Daughter to a Prince, whose
memory there, was in as great as just veneration; she added too, that by
my taking some Physick, whose operation should be visible when <hi>Orodes</hi>
came to visit me, I might not only confirm him my remove was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
but purchase time enough for <hi>Surena</hi> to draw in force enough to
secure us from the King's: We had doubtless elected this design, had
not <hi>Surena</hi> said, That 'twas a thing impossible to delude a jealous Lover;
that the effects of an indisposition manifested in that conjuncture of time,
would appear rather a Sickness assum'd, than befallen me: That to take
the King Prisoner would raise him an Army, which might make me his;
since many would fight for his liberty, which would not for his obtaining
forcibly his Mistriss; and if I counterfeited an indisposition, <hi>Arsace's</hi>
Love or Jealousie, would keep him perpetually near me, and so render
my Flight as impossible, as desired; but (said <hi>Surena</hi>) if all these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were disputable, yet this is not, That by violating my King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in coming hither, I have so exasperated him, that he will never
trust himself in a Place, where I have both the Power and Provocation
to repeat my Disobedience. Therefore he concluded there was no other
way, but immediately while the Night contributed to their assistance,
under a pretence of giving the Guard their farewel-entertainment, to
give as many of them Wine, as had not reason enough to refuse it; then
to fall upon those who were able to resist, and by their Deaths force
a passage to our Freedoms, which having obtained, to make <hi>Media</hi> the
feat of it. There was nothing (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) I scrupled at in this,
but the destroying those Persons, whose Fidelity to their King was their
only Crime; but the necessity of my condition, made me at last conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to what (next being false to <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) I most apprehended;
only I passionately conjured <hi>Surena</hi> to spill no more blood, than was of
necessity to be shed for our deliverance. To be brief, <hi>Surena</hi> without
his disguise, went to the Captain of my Guards, to whom (he said) <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>
had expresly sent him from <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the next morning to wait on
me thither, which the other easily credited, knowing his King's Passion
for me, and his Friendship for <hi>Surena;</hi> who entertain'd the deluded
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:96335:221"/>
Officer, till some of his Servants had made all those of the Guard drunk,
that had a mind to be so; about Midnight when all was buried in sleep
and silence, but those which knew the Design, and those which had the
Guard, <hi>Surena</hi> with all his Domesticks fell upon them, and though his
Numbers exceeded theirs; yet their Captain, who knew how certain a
Death his defeat would be from his Enemies or his King, so briskly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
his Fate, that <hi>Surena</hi> began to doubt his own; which to decide,
he resolutely Charged the Captain, who he found was the Sould of his
Party, and whom, after a long and bloody dispute, he left dead upon
the place; all the Souldiers Courages fell with their Officers, so that
<hi>Surena</hi> remembring my pressing desires, saved their Lives; <hi>Surena</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Blood and Victory came to my Chamber, and begged me so
to employ the latter, that before <hi>Orodes</hi> could know his action, we
might be where he could not revenge it. I told him, this was a request
fitter for me than him, and that I left the ordering of my liberty to the
Bestower of it; he desired me then by the dawn of day to be ready, by
which some Chariots, and my Equipage should be; to hasten which, he
left me. We were too much concerned in our joy to lose the solemnizing
of it by sleep; and whilst <hi>Surena</hi> was contributing to convert our hopes
of safety into an actual one, his generous Sister, yours, and I, entertained
one another with the rare and high effects of his Friendship; and with
the proportionate obligation I had unto him for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Symander</hi> was in this place of his relation, when it was interrupted by
what made his Auditors think it no misfortune; For 'twas by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
running in of divers Priests of <hi>Venus,</hi> who came to acquaint their
Superiour, that the Dome of the Temple was filled with Lightnings, as
bright as ever their Goddess's Eyes did shoot; that the foundation of
the sacred Vault trembled; and in a word, that all the symptoms of the
Oracles being restored to the liberty of speaking, were so visible, that
none with reason could apprehend the contrary. <hi>Callimmachus</hi> by an
erection of his eyes and hands, acknowledged his gratitude to her, and
his concern in our Hero's, whose Pardons he begged (for <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
by this time was come out of the Gallery to participate in the News) that
the function of his vocation would not permit him to wait on them again
till the morning; to which he added, that he hoped they would the
sooner grant it him, since his absence was necessary to the learning of
their Fate, which the next day he told them infallibly they should.
With this flattering assurance, he left the generous Lovers; who, whilst
<hi>Callimmachus</hi> was employed in preparing the Sacrifices, were in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
what effects they could produce.</p>

               <p>OUR Heroe's, who that Night had slept as little as the Sun,
were too as early up; and he had not long gilded with his
Beams, the Pinacles of the Temple, when the Chief of it,
came to advertise them, That within an hour the requisite
oblations would be ready: He brought in with him the
Chyrurgeons, who assured the Princes, that they had made their danger
the greater, but to render so, the certainty and suddenness of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
and that they might not only go and receive the Oracle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but if it commanded them a journey, they might too perform
it: Neither did they only make these assurances, but by taking off their
Plaisters, evinced their truth; which as much surprized as pleased those
that had received the wounds, and <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> who was no less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them, who conjur'd our Princes to reflect on the cure of the
Body, as an earnest of that of the Mind. <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who was the
most desperate Patient in that sickness, gave <hi>Callimmachus</hi> such a reply,
as he was forced to tell him, Your condition (generous Prince) cannot
be worse than Mine has been; for I have adored a Beauty with a Passion,
both which never knew any Superiour; and though the gods called her
to them in as fatal a way as every they could the fair <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> yet those
powers have demonstrated theirs, in giving me afterwards a quiet, which
made me envy no ones else: They cannot be gods were they not Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent;
and being so, to doubt their goodness, were to invite them not
to manifest it. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> were both extreamly satisfied
to learn an assurance of so strange a truth, from a mouth they could not
doubt; which by demonstrating there were ways of felicity in Love
without fruition, made them no longer believe That an impossibility,
which their having till then done, had created their greatest Torments:
And doubtless they had then obtained from <hi>Callimmachus</hi> a Story which
was so requisite to the ease of their sufferings, as the relation of his,
would probably have proved, had not the Sacrificers come in at the same
instant, to tell <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> That they now expected but his presence
and Commands, to begin their Duties. This Summons placed a suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though not a period to our Hero's curiosities; which they had no
sooner told <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> than he promised, having heard their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to acquaint them with his own. Immediately afterwards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:96335:222"/>
himself to put on his Pontifical Habit; which having done, he
returned to our Princes; who then perceived in his Meen, that Grace
and Majesty, which till his having acquainted them he was of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Society of Lovers, they had not observed; and indeed they were so
entirely taken up with that contemplation, that not only they esteemed
him worthy the high Title he possess'd of Prince to the Priest of <hi>Venus;</hi>
but they had even forgotten in that employment, how that by the duties
of his, they were then to learn their Fate. But <hi>Callimmachus</hi> himself
put them in mind of it, by conducting them down a large Stair-Case,
built of Marble, which delivered them into a broad Walk, bordered on
either side with five Rows of Cypress and Myrtle Trees, promiscuously
planted, which were watered by two Springs, whose pretty murmurings
pleased the Ear, as much as their clearness did the Eye, or their cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the Taste: And though the sides of this Walk were so well
adorned, yet the extremities of it were much better; for at the East
end, stood the Temple it self: and at the West the dwelling of the
Priests, which in a Cressant extended its two Horns to each end of the
Myrtle and Cypress Trees. 'Twas in this vacuity that our Princes found
all the preparatives of a Sacrifice, which was to procure them an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
they had with so many impatiencies expected. The Prince of the
Priests was no sooner seen by the rest, than immediately they directed
their steps to the Temple: The first that moved, were Two hundred
Religious Men, with Garlands of Roses and Myrtles on their heards;
and in each hand the Effigies of a Flaming Heart, to evidence the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
they adored was the Queen and Inspirer of Love. After these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Fifty white Bulls, and as many white Heifers crowned with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
of Annemines, in celebration of <hi>Venus</hi>'s changing her fair <hi>Adonis</hi>
into that flower: These were led by a Hundred young Men in cloaths as
white as those Nature had given the Beasts they held; Fifty Maids in the
same Livery carried in their hands as many pair of Turtles: And after
these, Fifty others carried in Silver Cages as many Swans. These were
followed by the Augurs and Victimares; the former, bearing a Celestial
Globe as a Badg of their Profession; and the others, some Sizers of
Gold, some Sacrificing Knives, and some Axes of Silver, as a Badg of
theirs. Those Youths which carried the Wine and Milk, followed two
and two, in their places and order; and last of all, some Ten paces before
<hi>Callimmachus</hi> (who was followed at that distance by our Hero's), there
went the Virgin who was to deliver the Oracle. She was bless'd with so
much Beauty, that she appeared a fit Servant for the Queen of it; her
Robes were as white as her thoughts; the tresses of her Hair were so
bright, and long, that they merited better to be converted into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation,
than <hi>Berenices</hi> did; they were tyed up with <hi>Delphian</hi> Lawrel,
and wreathed Garlands of the same crown'd her Head: 'twas in this
order the generous troop arrived at the Temple, whose Front extended
it self from North to South a Hundred and fifty Geometrical Paces; at
whose extremities were two Pavilions, whose Pinnacles seemed to lose
themselves in the Clouds. The Walls both of these, and the Curtain,
were adorned with great Branches of Foliage carved in the stone; and in
a large Compartiment composed of Groteskery, were seen Sphynxes,
Harpyes, the Claws of Lyons, and Tygers; to evidence, that within in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
Mysteries and Riddles. Over the Portal was a table adorned
with a larger Compartiment, wherein there was in big Letters of massy
Gold, inchased into a great square of Porphyre, this Inscription: <hi>THE
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:96335:223"/>
TEMPLE OF THE</hi> GODDESS <hi>OF</hi> LOVE, <hi>AND OF WHAT
INSPIRES IT.</hi> On each side of the Portal, there arose from the
Earth two square Basements, the Plinth of each of them was beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with Sculptures of great Relieve; one of them was crowned with
the Statue (in <hi>Pharian</hi> Stone) of the Boy the Goddess brought into the
world: And the other in <hi>Corinthian</hi> Stone, of the Boy she loved best
in it: Our Hero's had hardly leisure to consider these few exterior im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishments
amongst so many others, because <hi>Callimmachus</hi> having given
the Signal, the Sacrificers and Victimaries stopt their march; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ranged themselves and their victims on either side the way, made a
large one for their Prince, who still followed by <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes,</hi>
went into the Quire of the Temple; which immediately ecchoed
with such divers and harmonious voices, that for a while all their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
resigned up their Functions to their hearing; but that Sense at length
resigned its empire to the Sight, which wanting <hi>Parthenissa</hi> and <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeera,</hi>
could not more nobly be entertained, than in the adornings of
the Temple. The first Table was <hi>Venus</hi> ascension out of the Sea, much
more white than that froth the Poets say she was composed of. Near
this was a much larger, where the happy <hi>Paris</hi> stood Judg of those
Beauties, whose perfections came in competition, by that Apple given at
<hi>Peleus</hi> wedding, by the Goddess of Discord. Never any Beauties more
justly merited that name, than those the Painter had exposed to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the happy Son of <hi>Hecuba;</hi> but yet the Artist had so much given
the preheminence to her, to whom <hi>Paris</hi> did, that he could not have
declined doing so, without being as blind as her Son. Opposite to this
Picture was the Goddess's falling in Love with the fair <hi>Anchises,</hi> who
grazing his Herds, little thought how near he was possessing so much
Beauty, and being Father to a Son, whose Sword was to conquer as many,
as his Mothers Eyes. Near to this last Table, was the Beautiful Son of
<hi>Cinyras,</hi> who <hi>Venus</hi> more admired, than he did her; and in the same
Picture was contained all their Amours, how she wept his being killed by
the Boar, or his being drown'd contemplating his own Beauty in the
stream; for of both those some learned Poets have sung. Lastly, her
converting his dead body into an Annemine, which she watered with
her tears, and who by death being rendered uncapable to reward her
weepings by kissing them away, seemed eternally to blush at so unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
an impotence. In a word, all the real or imaginary Loves of
that bright Goddess, were so well represented by the Artist, that if she
had no cause to blush for her electing the originals, she had as little for
avowing them in the Copy; only indeed her unfortunate surprize in the
Arms of <hi>Mars,</hi> occasioned by a Passion as ugly as the Possessor of it,
was there purpofely omitted; but the wound she received from the
cruel <hi>Diomed</hi> was not; esteeming it perhaps a greater glory to evince,
her blood gave a being to the lovely Rose, than a shame or prejudice
that a Deity could bleed.</p>
               <p>But all these representations being rather evincements she was the
Subject, than the Goddess of Love; in other Tables were the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that truth. There our Princes saw the volatile <hi>Iupiter,</hi> courting
and possessing the fair <hi>Io;</hi> the strange Metamorphosis the God made of her
to conceal his Amours from the jealous <hi>Iuno;</hi> how in spight of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
she discovered them, then begs, and obtained the transformed <hi>Io</hi> of
her Lord, who grants what he durst not refuse; how the Nymph was
committed by the suspicious Goddess to the care of <hi>Argus,</hi> whose hundred
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:96335:223"/>
Eyes were too vigilant for the offended god, who to make those Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
sleep eternally, that would not momentarily, sends down <hi>Mercury,</hi>
who by the charms of his Musick, ends his vigilance, then with his
Sword ends his Life; how <hi>Iuno,</hi> having first adorned the train of her
own Bird, with the Eyes of the unfortunate and faithful <hi>Argus,</hi> to let
her god understand she not only knew, but could revenge his Murther,
makes <hi>Io</hi> as frantick as her jealousie had made her; who yet runs with
the same celerity over the world, as she would to the embraces of her
<hi>Iupiter.</hi> The Painter in another side of the same Table shew'd, how
the Heifer flew to her Father <hi>Inachus,</hi> into whose trembling stream she
leaps to quench her heat, and thirst; from thence he makes her run into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> where she resumes her former shape by the permission of <hi>Iuno,</hi>
who had then received an assurance from <hi>Iupiter</hi> to abstain both from the
desires, and acts of love; the grateful <hi>Io</hi> in her true shape returns to let
her Father see it, that he might participate in her joy, as he did in her
affliction, which latter had so operated on him, that he had wept himself
so big, he was unknowable to his Daughter, as she had been to him; but
at length, maugre their new disguises, they knew each other, and <hi>Io</hi> having
performed this charitable duty, returns again to the Banks of <hi>Nyle,</hi>
where her exteriour and intrinsecal Beauties, made the People which
drink of that Flood, elect her for their Goddess, under the name of <hi>Isis.</hi>
In another Table was the same inconstant God fallen in Love with the
fair Daughter of <hi>Lycaon</hi> King of <hi>Arcadia;</hi> but knowing that wars of
Love are different from all other, since in those, the conquest by
yielding, is more pleasing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n that by force; the god lays aside his
power, and finding one day the fair <hi>Calisto</hi> reposing her self after the
chase, under the friendly shadow of some Myrtle Trees, he assumes the
shape of <hi>Diana,</hi> whose Nymph she was, and in that Metamorphosis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
felicities which do more Metamorphose him; nay, he seems to
esteem his power of altering his shape, more than that of being a god,
since the former afforded him transcendenter delights in the fruition of
his <hi>Calisto,</hi> than the latter in the most powerful effect it could otherwise
produce. In the same Table was demonstrated how <hi>Diana</hi> discovered
the loss of her Nymph's pudicity; how she banish'd her from her Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
how the unfortunate <hi>Calisto</hi> was delivered of <hi>Arcas;</hi> all which the
suspicious <hi>Iuno</hi> at last discovered, and in revenge converted her Rival
into a Bear, which <hi>Arcas</hi> once had killed a hunting, had not <hi>Iupiter</hi>
(taking pity of both) caught them up into Heaven, and converted each
of them into a Constellation. It seem'd that the Goddess of Love took
delight to have exposed to the Eyes of Men, how much, and how often
the great <hi>Iupiter</hi> was her Votary; for there was another Table of his
Loves with the Beautiful Daughter of <hi>Acrisius,</hi> King of the <hi>Argives;</hi>
who was so strictly imprisoned upon her Father receiving an Oracle of
his Death by her Son, that the amorous god was necessitated to convert
himself into a Golden shower, to quench his flame. There was display'd
in the same Table, <hi>Acrisius</hi> exposing his fair Daughter with the young
Persons to the mercy of that Element, from whence the Queen of that
Passion which created her fault, had her original; how she and her
Son were cast upon the Coast of <hi>Daunia,</hi> and how <hi>Pilumnus</hi> the King of
it married her: There was in another end of the Pictures, the three
Gorgons, <hi>Medusa, Schenio,</hi> and <hi>Euriole,</hi> with their Tresses of Snakes,
and with their one Eye, with which they Metamorphosed into stone all
they beheld: In the same Table was <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> arming the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:96335:224"/>
valiant <hi>Perseus</hi> against these three Sisters; how he found the eldest of
them, and all her Snakes asleep, whose head he immediately cut off, and
placed in his Shield, with which he turned <hi>Atlas</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania</hi>
into stone, for denying him entertainment. In a word, there were all
the actions of this demi-god, how he conquered the Monster that would
have devoured the beautiful <hi>Andromeda;</hi> and how he himself was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by her; with all those other Fables the Poets have so amply
sung on this Subject. Two other Pictures contained the Passions of the
same god to the fair <hi>Europa;</hi> and his assuming a Beast's shape, to act the
sensual part of Love; and of the Platonick Moon, who to posses <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimion,</hi>
rendered him uncapable to possess her but by dreams: There
was in other Tables the Amours of <hi>Aurora</hi> and <hi>Cephalus,</hi> with the Death
of the unchaste and jealous <hi>Procris;</hi> and to shew the power of Love
indeed, and that the Sea it self cannot quench its flames, there were also
manifested at large, how the god of that cold Element fell in love with
the fair <hi>Amphitrite;</hi> how she fled his Passion, and how he sent a Dolphin
after her, who prov'd a successful Embassador. And though all those
Tables were so admirably represented, that to know the Story, you
needed but to see the Pictures; yet there were two others which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
took up our Hero's contemplation, that after the sight of them,
they esteemed none of the remaining ones worthy of theirs: The first
was of a Beauty which could not but be excellent, since in <hi>Artabbanes's</hi>
own opinion she resembled the fair <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> 'Twas that of the lovely
<hi>Psiche,</hi> she that captivated the god of Love himself; and was so long
taken for <hi>Venus,</hi> that had she been immortal, she had eternally (as she
had for a time) rob'd her of her Votaries and Altars; the Artist had so well
represented this Nymph, that it Authorized <hi>Venus's</hi> Envy, and Mens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.
There was in this representation, how the King of <hi>Milesia</hi> her
Father, by the command of an Oracle, abandoned her to the gods up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Mountain; how the <hi>Zephirs</hi> carried her on their wings into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Island, to the Palace of Love, which till then, nor ever since, could
boast of so admirable an Adornment; how the fair <hi>Psiche</hi>'s two Sisters,
at her request were brought thither by the <hi>Zephirs,</hi> who envying their
Sisters felicity, perswaded her 'twas not a god, but a serpent she bless'd
with her embraces; how the credulous Nymph, contrary to her engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
concealed a Lamp by her Beds side, with which when the little
god had stupify'd his Senses by too much satisfying them, she resolved
her doubts, but by so unfortunate a way, that a drop of Oyl fell upon
<hi>Cupid,</hi> who immediately wak'd and flew away: There were further
represented the tragick Death of the fair <hi>Psiche</hi>'s Sisters; The Miseries
which after that fatal Night befel her; her descent into Hell, and at
length her ascent into Heaven, to marry her god, who now had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
her crime, and thereby derived a more sublime satisfaction from
his mercy, than he could have had in his revenge. The last Picture, which
took up <hi>Artavasdes</hi> as much as the other had <hi>Artabbanes's</hi> attention, was
that of the lovely <hi>Leucothoe,</hi> who as much resembled the fair <hi>Altezeera,</hi>
as <hi>Psiche</hi>'s did <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> This Table evinced, that Art or Nature
were admirable; the last, if it presented the world with such ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals;
or the first, if it could fancy or describe them. This was
the largest representation of any there; for it first contained the
Amours of <hi>Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Clittie;</hi> how that the former having extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
all his Flames in the fountain of Love, lighted them again
at the Eyes of the lovely <hi>Leucothoe;</hi> well did that performance
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:96335:224"/>
prove, that light, like virtue, loses nothing by communication: for her
fair Eyes possess'd still as much light, as they had given the Sun; <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothoe</hi>
seemed to have something of felicity in her Countenance, which
was derived, not so much from having ravished such a votary from such a
Nymph; but that <hi>Phoebus,</hi> who every day beheld all the Perfections of
the world, gave hers by his adoring them, the precedency: 'Twas ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
to observe how the envious Sun, which fades all other Beauties,
did but enlighten hers; how his perpetual kissing her Breasts, and not
melting them, abundantly proved they had only the colour, not the
nature of snow; how it was a perpetual Summer wherever <hi>Leucothoe</hi> was;
how, if she flung her self under the protection of Trees, they soon lost
their treasure, for hindring the Sun from beholding his; and how that
Lover evinc'd by their immediate withering, that he could burn all but
her that did burn him; so constant, and so bright a Servant, could not
eternally be deny'd; <hi>Leucothoes</hi> coldness at length was dissolved, and
<hi>Phoebus</hi> in her embraces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> received more joys, than the world does in his
Light; but alas, those felicities which fruition could not quench, weeping
must; for the abandoned <hi>Clittie</hi> assumes a rage proportionate to the
loss which inspired it, and in the dictates of that Passion, acquaints
<hi>Orchamus (Leucothoe</hi>'s Father) with her stolen Amours; and though
the betray'd Nymph in a posture as moving as her tears, represented the
glory of such an Alliance, and that to please one of the gods, could not
be a sin against the rest; yet the cruel <hi>Orchamus</hi> buries her alive with
her Crimes; the Sun frighted at such a Prodigy, hides his face in clouds,
and weeps such showers of tears, that the world by his sorrow knew his
Love. 'Twas well for Mortals that he was confined eternally to his
Ecliptick; otherwise, to act his revenge, he had descended on the earth,
and reduced all to the same Ashes, his dear <hi>Lucothoe</hi> was; which the
Fates having render'd him uncapable of, he immediately converts her
dead body into an Incense-tree, whose sweetness seem'd to reserve some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its first principle; and though dead, as much to charm the
smell, or when living, the sight. In another place of the Picture was
<hi>Clittie,</hi> who <hi>Phoebus</hi> now hated as much as he had adored, running from
one top of a Mountain to another, to overtake and be near her Lover;
who to deprive her of his sight, as well as Company, or perhaps having
put on mourning for the fair and unfortunate <hi>Leucothoe,</hi> travelled still
in a gloomy Cloud, which he had perpetually worn in revenge and
grief, had not mortals by incessant sacrifices, but especially by those
offered of the new Incense, obtained the gods command to assume his
former brightness, which at least he did; but then <hi>Clittie</hi> found her
self doubly burned by her heat, and by his; you might have seen her
sometimes threatning, sometimes imploring her Lover; now invoking
his power, then his justice; and finally, crying out, Either stay thy course,
or give me the wings of thy Inconstancy to overtake thee; her Prayers,
her Tears, and her Cries, operating no more on <hi>Phoebus,</hi> than that Nymphs
she had betray'd, did on <hi>Orchamus,</hi> she fix'd her Eyes incessantly on
her Lover, and by that Posture, and her unmoveableness in it by degrees
took root, and by the gods were converted into a Marygold; who all
day constantly gazes on the Sun, and all the night turns her head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Earth; as if she strove to force a Passage with her Eyes through
the Centre, to the Antipodes, not to be at any time deprived of seeing
her Lover. Our two Hero's found not only a resemblance in Beauty,
but in Fortunes, betwixt those two Nymphs, and their two Princesses:
*
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:96335:225"/>
For <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was confident the gods had taken his <hi>Parthenissa</hi> from
the Earth, but to marry her to one of them in Heaven, as the lovely
<hi>Psiche</hi> was; and in that Faith he almost apprehended to go thither,
since that could not but be Hell, where he should see his Princess in
another's Arms. And <hi>Artavasdes</hi> thought, that what <hi>Orchamus</hi> had
done to his Daughter <hi>Artabazus,</hi> or misfortune had done to <hi>Altezeera,</hi>
who he considered as buried alive in <hi>Pacorus</hi>'s embraces; the gods
having deprived our Hero's of seeing their Princesses, the best felicity
they could allow them, consisted in seeing what so much resembled them;
on which they had as constantly, and perhaps as eternally fixed their
Eyes, as <hi>Clittie</hi> did hers on her <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bus,</hi> had not <hi>Callimmachus</hi> acquainted
them, 'twas time to offer the sacrifices of Perfumes and Turtles; which
ceremony being ended, they all went out of the Temple; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the Prince of it having given the signal, the essusions of Wine
and Milk were made; some small tufts of hair which grew between the
Horns of the Bulls and Heifers, were cut with golden Sizers, and flung
into the Flame; which had no sooner consumed them, than in a moment
all the Beasts were knocked down by the Victimaries, and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails
torn out, and presented to <hi>Callimmachus;</hi> who considered the
Prophetical part of them with so sublime a joy, that it forced him to
whisper to our Princes, that the gods without a Miracle, and without
ruining the Laws they themselves had established, could not long delay
their felicities; for never were greater promises in Victims, than in those.
This assurance brought our Hero's different Hopes, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was
joy'd in a belief that the gods would command him to act his own
Death, since he could not fancy any other way to quiet. And <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
interpreted he should derive his satisfaction from their removing
<hi>Pacorus,</hi> and placing him in his Felicities: but they were both diverted
from any further reflections, by the Augurs giving liberty to the Swans
out of their silver Prisons, who immediately directed their flight to
Heaven, as to acknowledg their deliverance from thence; and were
intended thither as a sacrifice of quicker ascension than that of Incense.
All these solemnities being finished, those which assisted at them, return'd
again into another Isle of the Temple, where stood a Statue of <hi>Venus,</hi>
which took up as much, and as justly the Beholders admiration, as the
Deity could which it represented; it was all of Mosaick work, and the
peeces cimmented with such excellent Art, that the most critical Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomist
could not have miss'd so much as a Vein, a Sinew, or an Artery.
The Beauties of colours, of Air, and of Features, were as exact, as
those of <hi>Cimmetrie;</hi> and for Eyes, the Statue was imbellished with
two such refulgent Diamonds, that their very lustre, like that of the
Suns, hindered them from being considered, but by reflection: and
thereby rendered the boldly contemplating the Deities face, as great
an impossibility, as a Sin. 'Twas at the feet of this admirable Statue,
that <hi>Callimmachus</hi> prostrated himself, having in the same posture on
either of his sides, one of our Princes, who with perfect attentions, and
equal devotion, heard him deliver this short Prayer.</p>
               <p>Fairest of all Goddesses! thou who first derivest that Title from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and then from Iustice; Thou from whom all other gods receive
their votaries, since only by thy sweet influences, Mankind is created
and continued, and sacrifices too; behold prostrate before thee, two of thy
votaries, who have never offered on thy Altars, False, or double Fires,
but have so constantly preserved those wounds thy Son first made in
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:96335:225"/>
their hearts, that ever since they were, and are fit examples for thy
subjects to continue such; Though even their sufferings have at least
proportionated their Constancy; do not great Goddess so justly deterr
Mortals from that virtue, as to render it the ruine of those who most
perfectly possess it; nor give those who already doubt thy Power or
Iustice, so much provocation to continue their Sin, as thy continuing
the misfortunes of these Lovers will amount unto; but by investing them
in felicities, as great as the Beauties they adore evince, that the tryal of
Constancy, is not the punishment of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callimmachus</hi> having ended his Orizon, gave the <hi>Tripos</hi> to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
who on it was to deliver the Oracle; and then with her and our
two Hero's only, went to the Vault, where they were to receive it;
which was adorned with a Dome, That shot it self so high into Heaven,
that none which doubted not, that was the residence of the gods, could
doubt they inhabited in it. The Virgin at the mouth of the Vault
leaves those three which accompanied her thither; and, after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
were finished, and that she had setled her self on the <hi>Tripos,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the capacious Temple and sacred Grove were covered with
obscure Clouds; from whence strange Lightnings and Thunder derived
their Birth; a surious Earthquake shook suddenly the foundation of the
Temple and Grove; the Delphian Lawrel which crown'd the Virgins
Head, fell off it; her Hair stood an end and star'd; her Eyes roll'd wildly;
her Neck in a thousand turnings kept it self in uncessant motion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> her
Heart beat against her Breast, as if it would have forced a passage there;
her Mouth foamed; and in a word, all the symptomes that the Deity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
and possess'd her, were visible; but that which rendered it no
longer capable of doubts, was a shrill voice which filled the sacred
Vault, and delivered these words:
<q>
                     <l>From <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Ashes I will raise</l>
                     <l>A Phoenix, in whose Flames thou shalt be blest:</l>
                     <l>Wait then about this Temple a few Days,</l>
                     <l>And all thy Torments shall be crown'd with Rest.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then after a short silence, the voice thus continued the Oracle:
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Despair not <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> since the time</l>
                        <l>Predestin'd for thy Sufferings, is but brief:</l>
                        <l>Fortune unto thy virtue shall resign;</l>
                        <l>And perfect joy, succeed to equal Grief.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Go both and sacrifice to that fair Boy,</l>
                        <l>Who did inspire my highest Grief and Ioy.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callimmachus</hi> by a short but passionate ejaculation, acknowledged
his joy and concern in so favourable an Oracle, and then in repeated
Sacrifices did the like; which being finished, they returned from the
Temple the same way they went unto it, and in a deep silence; which
the virtuous Priest observed no more, when they were entered in our
Prince's Appartment: For there by a Thousand embraces he congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
so clear promises from the Goddess of their future felicities. It
seems (said he) they knew your despairs were too pregnant to give
you dark and ambiguous answers; they have now left themselves no
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:96335:226"/>
power to continue your miseries, but by giving men a full liberty to
suspect their Justice; so that next the being possess'd of your desires,
you have the bless'd security of being so. The Oracle (<hi>Artabbanes</hi>
coldly replyed) is very clear; and 'tis as much so, that the Death the
gods hitherto hindered me from acting, they now promise me, by saying,
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> is reduced to Ashes: They would too have said, that all my
Torments shall be crown'd with joy, not rest, had they designed me any
blessings in Life; and the Phoenix they promise to raise from that dead
ones Ashes, is clearly the constancy of my Passion, in which I shall be
bless'd by being consum'd in the flames of it; and you are not ignorant,
but so unalterable and efficacious a love, is as rare as that Phoenix to
which the Oracle alludes. <hi>Callimmachus</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> both, admired
at so strange an interpretation; but the first of them, left their silence
might seem to authorize it, told him, If he which serves the Deity can
best interpret her meaning, or rather her expressions, I can find nothing
in the Oracle, but what is much advantageous for you: before this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
you wrong'd but the mercy of the gods in doubting your Joys;
but now you must their Truth in any longer doing it; for they promise
a blessing to your waiting for it about this Temple: If they meant your
Death should be that Blessing, they would have permitted you to act it,
and not have contradicted themselves, by making your languishings the
way unto it: That word of Rest evidently implyes a cessation from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and fears; and that Phoenix for ought we know, may be <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
her self, who perhaps is but dead to your Belief. Great gods!
(<hi>Artabbanes</hi> cryed out) she is but too certainly dead, <hi>Symander</hi> saw
her so; and therefore if you have no other interpretation of that Passage,
I cannot but determine mine to be the true one: They cannot accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their promise of Rest but by Death; 'tis that only after the loss of
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> can give it me; they do not assure me rest as the way, but as
the end and Crown of my Torment; so that they do not falsifie, but
perfect their Oracle, in giving me no cessation from sufferings, but by
that which confers it upon every one. <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> who observed
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s despair did but increase by his attempting to qualifie it,
only replyed; I have seen those who built their Faith on a more firm
foundation than you do yours, and yet have been (as I hope you will
be) happily mistaken: The Oracle, I am convinced, promises those
blessings to you, which we must leave to Time and the gods to disclose;
in the mean while, I esteem it absolutely requisite, that you both obey
their orders, by sacrificing in the Temple of <hi>Adonis;</hi> They would not
enjoyn you that performance, were it not conducive to that end they
have promised. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> having given some additional Arguments to
the silencing of his Friends despair, and the creating of his Faith in the
best construction of the Oracle, at length extorted an engagement from
him, That without any prejudicate opinion of it, he would expect the
interpretation. The generous <hi>Armenian</hi> extreamly satisfied with this
assurance, began to acquaint him that made it, and <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> That
as soon as he had performed his devotions at <hi>Adonis</hi> Temple, he was
determined to make a voyage into <hi>Parthia;</hi> for one of those Assassines
which had been destroyed by <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s Courage, had confessed as he
expired, that the Prince of <hi>Parthia</hi> had hired them to that attempt. This
(he continued) makes me confident, <hi>Pacorus</hi> esteems <hi>Altezeera</hi> guilty,
when he esteems me fit to be so punished; and believing her so, she
may have occasion to employ my Sword and Life, both which I will go
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:96335:226"/>
and offer her; the gods too seem to invite me to it, by not confining
my residence about this Temple, as they have done <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s, who I
am as much troubled to abandon, as at that which makes me believe my
doing so, necessary; but as soon as I have found whether my suspitions be
rightly grounded, I will not fail to return hither, to be instructed in a
Fate, I am nothing less concerned in, than in my own. The gods (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>) cannot but destine me some transcendent advantage,
by enjoyning my residence here, if they but intend thereby to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the Misery of confining me from waiting on, and serving <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
in his intended voyage; but I am so well vers'd in their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for me, that if he will permit it, I will rather embrace the assured
blessing of accompanying him, than out of some ambiguous hopes,
decline so advantageous a certainty. <hi>Artavasdes</hi> found this as civil, as
<hi>Callimmachus</hi> irreligious; and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> found by their returns, that
these were both their beliefs. The generous Friend having absolutely
declined the offer, and the generous Priest having induced him which
made it, to acknowledg he had been in it as uncivil to the gods, as the
contrary to <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> they began to think on their intended journey
next morning to the Temple of <hi>Adonis;</hi> which <hi>Callimmachus</hi> said was
not above Forty Furlongs from <hi>Hierapolis;</hi> and because the day was not
a little wasted in the precedent Sacrifices, and that some part of it must
be employed in preparatives for the future ones, both he and <hi>Artavasdes</hi>
conjur'd <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to enjoyn <hi>Symander</hi> (who all the while was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
to put a period to the relation he had begun. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> being
satisfied, that in one performance he could oblige himself, and those he
as much desired to do the like unto; to effect both, retired to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of his thoughts, and left them to <hi>Symander</hi>'s, who to obey
their Commands, having first remembred them, he was interrupted
after <hi>Surena</hi>'s success in the Castle of <hi>Eden,</hi> and that still he spoke
the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s words to <hi>Artabbanes;</hi> thus prosecuted her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The sequel of Parthenissa's and Artabbanes's Story.</head>
                  <p>THe day (said the Princess) began but to expel the obscurity of the
Night, when <hi>Surena</hi> according to his promise, came into my
Chamber, to let me know all things for our intended journey were
ready; but he was so pale and weak, that <hi>Zephalinda, Lyndadory,</hi> and I,
began to consider that strange alteration, as the effect of a new Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
but he assured us it only proceeded from some loss of blood in his
late Combat; that he found himself better able to perform a journey,
than he seemed to be; and that by riding in a Chariot, he should feel
no inconveniency, but what proceeded from being in a less fitting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to serve me. I must acknowledg he appeared in so sad a condition,
that I not only thought it less dangerous for him to indure a siege, than a
journey, but told him so; and though we jointly and pressingly conjur'd
him to reflect on his own safety, and that we would hazard ours by a
residence with him, rather than so much indanger his; yet Solicitations
were fruitless; for he protested 'twould be more hazarded by the danger
of my continuing in <hi>Eden,</hi> or by his not waiting on me out of it, and
fetling me in a secure residence, than any other way: His Chyrurgeon too
assured us, he might without any great hazard travel in a Chariot. This
last operated more with us than all the rest; for we knew the Laws of
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:96335:227"/>
                     <hi>Surena</hi>'s Civility obliged him to contemn all danger; but we knew those
of the Artist, as much obliged him to preserve his Patient from any;
we therefore descended into the Court, where we found all things in a
desired Posture, and some fifty Horse for our Convoy. <hi>Zephalinda</hi> and
<hi>Lyndadory</hi> rode in one Chariot, and <hi>Surena</hi> (by my reiterated desires)
and I, rid in another; there was a Third for our Women: but alas, we
were not gone a furlong from the Castle, when some Scouts came in,
and with frighted looks, commanded the Chariot-Drivers to turn back,
if they had a mind to preserve themselves, or those they drove. <hi>Surena</hi>
at this Allarm, inquired the cause of it; which those that brought it,
told him, proceeded from 500 of the King's Horse, which were come a
round Gallop from <hi>Nineveh,</hi> had seized on all the Boats were to ferry us
over the <hi>Tygris,</hi> and were by their help transporting themselves into the
Island. <hi>Surena</hi> amazed at so fatal a Disaster, and as much, how what
he had done could already come to <hi>Arsace</hi>'s knowledg, told me, We must,
Madam, return; unless you will rather indure the Siege of <hi>Orodes</hi>'s
Love, than that of his Force: He had hardly said these words, when
we perceived a cloud of dust, which some of our Convoy that were
most advanced, came running to tell us was the Enemies Troops: this
made us retire hastily to the Castle, into which we were scarcely entered,
when <hi>Surena</hi> fell into a Swound, and his wounds appeared so inflamed,
that a Chyrurgeon of our Convoy, who first at my cryes ran to his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
protested to me, our return was the happiest accident could have
arrived his Prince, for he could not have continued his journey, and
his Life; we had him therefore brought with great care, and no less haste,
to his Appartment, from whence we saw a Body of Horse, which came
a full Gallop near the Castle; where they drew up, and by waving
their bright Swords, seem'd to invite those in it to a Combat which
might change their colour. There was in <hi>Eden</hi> a young Gentleman
called <hi>Arzimin,</hi> to whom <hi>Surena,</hi> as soon as he was restored to his
sences, committed the care of the Siege, till his own health would permit
him to assume it. Four days were spent in preparations for defence; and
the night of the last, there came into the Castle 500 Horse, and as many
Foot; who told us, That more by Art than by Force they had pass'd the
King's Army, which next morning faced the Castle, and sent a Herald
to <hi>Surena,</hi> who not being in a condition to receive his Message, sent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimin</hi>
to do it; who brought his Prince word, That <hi>Arsaces</hi> had sent
purposely to know what provocation he had received that could invite
him to so precipitate and dangerous a design; That though the highest
Revenge would be but a proportionate Justice for abusing his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Favour; yet if he would submit himself to the former, he would
restore him to the latter. <hi>Surena</hi> turning his Eyes towards me, seemed
to implore the answer he was to make; but I told him, I had referred
all things, as well as my protection, to him; he therefore commanded
<hi>Arzimin</hi> to let the Herald know, That by reason of an indisposition
which rendered him uncapable of making any return to the King with
his own hand, he was determined not to send any till he could so do it.
This he did to protract the time, and not to thrust <hi>Arsaces</hi> on extreams,
till <hi>Vixores</hi> (who <hi>Surena</hi> then told me was raising an Army of his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans)
came to his relief. The Herald delivered the King the Message he
received, which <hi>Arsaces</hi> considered rather as an affront than a respect;
and immediately by a Trumpet sent to know where our Appartments
were, that he might prohibit any shooting of Arrows at those parts of
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:96335:227"/>
the Castle; which having learned, he began by approaches to attempt
the winning of a place, which contained in it the objects of his most
predominant Passions, his Love and Revenge. Above a Moon was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in bloody assaults and defences, by which time <hi>Surena</hi> was so
well recovered of his old wounds, that he was in a condition to receive
new ones; which before he did, by a Trumpet, and a Gentleman, he
sent the King a Letter, which he first communicated to me, and which
contained these words:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Surena, to his Soveraign Arsaces.</head>
                        <p>IF I have been so unfortunate, as seemingly to take up Arms against
my King; yet I am so happy as to be satisfied they are really for him.
Your resolves (Sir) to make <hi>Parthenissa</hi> yours, and hers to decline a
Crown of Empire, for one of Constancy, creates my performance, which
I cannot call a crime, because 'tis to preserve you from one. This only
being the cause of my Arming, I esteemed it not fit to divulge it, but
rather appear a Rebel, than manifest your Passion is one to you; when
you can command it, you shall command both me, and those with me;
but till then, I must preserve you from what virtue should; and thereby me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the honour of your favour, if I possess it not.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arsaces</hi> detained this Messenger till he had formed a Reply, which he
was not a little troubled to do; for if he continued his Passion, he must
the War, and perhaps the despair of taking the cause of it; and if he
seemed to decline his Passion, he must violate his engagement, or what
it may be he valued more. Whilst this Dilemma was debating, the Army
and Garison were so too; for there was during the Treaty, no suspension
of Arms; and the <hi>Arsacians</hi> stormed an Out-work, from whence they
were beaten with loss and shame: <hi>Surena</hi> to let his Enemies know
he was well, and could use his success so, With the greatest part of his
Garison, and himself at the head of them, made so resolute a charge
upon three great Squadrons of Horse and Foot, who were to justifie
the Assaliants retreat, that he forced them all to a precipitate one;
and doubtless had carried his Success to a sublimer degree, had not
<hi>Orodes</hi> in person with 3000 select Horse, first put a suspension, and
then a period to his victory. We saw all this from off the Castle, and
that <hi>Surena</hi> did miracles in his person to regain the victory, or it;
but at length most of his Forces being cut in pieces, or taken Prisoners,
he followed the fate of the latter, which he received from a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in black Armour. But we had hardly the leisure to deplore so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a loss, since he that imposed it, did redress it too, by not only giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Surena</hi> his liberty again; but by securing it, till he came to the
Graffe of the Castle: <hi>Surena</hi> had but few wounds for so many dangers
he had been engaged in; but of 1000 Horse and Foot which made the
Sally, only two hundred returned alive, and half of those by their
wounds continued not so six days. Our impatience to learn from whom
both <hi>Surena</hi> and we had received so signal an obligation, made us go
meet him in the entrance of the Castle; where he told us privately,
that it was from the Prince <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who upon his knowledg of
him, desired no other ransom for the restoring his freedom, than to
grant him his Pardon, and procure him <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s, for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him of it. This Gallantry both the Brother and Sister extolled,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:96335:228"/>
in terms as great as it self; and the latter perhaps esteemed her necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
ingratitude to him as high a misfortune, as <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s was to
her. The great loss we sustained by his Sally, reduced us to a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so deplorable, that <hi>Surena</hi> himself began to apprehend it, and to
confess his best consolation was, He should lose his Life in a Service, in
which he had vowed to spend it; and thereby if he could not prevent
my misfortunes, yet he should not live to see them. The morning
which succeeded this sad day, there came a Gentleman from the Camp
attended by a Trumpeter, who telling the Guards he was employed
from the King to their Prince, was admitted and received by him in
the Court, where to conceal our deficiency, all the Garison but the
Centries on the Line were assembled. The Express presented from
<hi>Orodes</hi> a Letter to <hi>Surena,</hi> which without opening he immediately came
and presented me in my Chamber, where <hi>Lyndadory</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda</hi>
were, to learn the effect of it; having there unsealed it, we found 'twas
all written with <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s own hand, and contained these words:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Arsaces King of Parthia, To Surena.</head>
                        <p>THough the condition the gods have reduced you to, might invite
me by resentment, as well as justice, to employ my Power, rather
than my Mercy; yet because you attribute your crime to a service to
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> I shall esteem it one to me, and not only pardon your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given her so bad a character of my Passion, as what you have
acted must make her assume; but to divest her of Fear, and you of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
I do hereby engage my self by all those obligations I esteem most
sacred, I will be so far from forcing her to be my Queen, that I will
not solicite it; and I would even give her leave to seek a Sanctuary
under some other King, did I not know that would but too much cloud
the Government of her own, which could not but be abhorred, when so
much Beauty and Virtue should be necessitated to implore a Foreign
Protection.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>This Letter gave me joys which were uncapable of accession, but by
both your returns; I told <hi>Surena,</hi> that the cause of the War being
taken away, the effects ought to cease; that doubtless <hi>Arsaces</hi> was
real in his promises, since he had (when they were freely made) as much
the power to violate them, as he could have when I was in his; that
probably my coldness had extinguished his flame; which though it were
no common operation in Love, yet it was (as <hi>Surena</hi> experimentally
knew) a possible one; and therefore since <hi>Arsace</hi>'s taking the Castle,
which he had as much the power as the will to do, might inspire him
with intentions, our submission and reliance on him would suppress, I
esteemed it the best course to accept of what we could indeed no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
decline. <hi>Surena</hi> was about to have replyed, when one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
advertised him, That the Gentleman employed by the King, had
a Message to deliver him, which he desired might be without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
I observed him a little surprised at my motion, and it may be
he was glad to cloud his disorder by this opportunity, which he begged
me to permit him to accept, since it was not improbable, but it might
be much conducive to the forming our resolutions. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he thought the making his request was sufficient towards the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but he had no sooner desired my permission, than he took it, and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:96335:228"/>
whilst he was entertaining the King's Express, the fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi> was
entertaining me with some fears she but then had assumed; which
were, That I had avoided being a Prey to one of my Lovers, but to be
one to another. This free declaration made me conclude she had but too
pregnant evincements for the making it; and that it was her knowleg,
not her suspition, which gave me one of her Brother. I acquainted her
with this belief, with as much clearness as she had me with hers; but
when she protested to me her apprehensions had only their being from
the minute of <hi>Surena</hi>'s disorders, and at the overture which had created
them: I began to hope her affection for me, made her suspect her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
having too much; which the better to determine, we jointly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to press the accepting the King's offer. <hi>Surena</hi> by his return,
gave me leave to execute what we had resolved; which after I had by
the pressing'st reasons I could disclose, he told me, The just gods,
Madam, who know how unfit it is for you to put your self into the
hands of one who prefers his Lust before his Faith, have sent me an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
which may so far absolve their Providence, that if that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
must be yours, it shall be your fault, and not theirs: For the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
sent by the King, is employed by the generous <hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi>
who knowing all Intelligence both by Land and Water, is debarred me;
lets me know, that <hi>Arzimin,</hi> who I thought in the last Sally had lost his
Life, has lost but his Liberty; and that <hi>Vixores</hi> is hastily raising an Army
of 30000 Horse, and as many Foot for my relief: so that, Madam, you
have but to assume a few days patience, and you may derive that real
security from my Sword, which will prove but an imaginary one in
<hi>Arsace</hi>'s protestations. The gods forbid (I replyed, much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my Fears, by this answer), that so many thousand Lives should
be sacrificed as Victims for the suppression of my doubts; but allow
they were of so criminal a quality, as that nothing but so much blood
could wash them away; yet what advantage could we propound unto
our selves by a Battel, which we are not more certain of without one;
for you must either resolve to expel <hi>Arsaces</hi> out of his Throne and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
or at length you must trust him, and that too when the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his losses, and our opposition, may give him a rise and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to evince the justice of our Fears, by his acting them: which a
Confidence in him may as much deter him from, as his very oaths; so
that since of necessity we must, to prevent his Crime, act a greater, or
put our selves into his Mercy, when it may be the world may esteem his
conferring it (by our provocation) an injustice; I do not only approve
of embracing his offer, but conjure you we may do it: and this I desire
the more pressingly, because that having a power to oppose his, our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
may appear our election, not our constraint, and thereby have
two obligations on him, that of Religion, and that of Trust; which
latter will confine him, if he considers his honour; and the former, if he
considers the gods. Are you then, Madam (he reply'd), so little vers'd
in the Maxims of Kings, as to think your self secure under him, when
you have demonstrated you have a Power of being so without, or against
him; by shewing that Truth, and then divesting your self of it? we
do not only shew him he is not absolute; but provoke, and which is
worse, enable him to become so: the folly of yielding to an offended
Prince, is greater than the Sin which made him so; and if we must at
length submit, 'tis better doing it when our necessity is the motive; for
the extending his Mercy then, is a greater, as well as safer virtue: Do
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:96335:229"/>
not, Madam (I beseech you) tempt <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s honesty, by prejudicing
his Power and Love: There is no necessity of ending the War by either
expelling him his Throne, or submitting to his Mercy; a successful Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
may procure us such conditions, as it shall not be in his Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
them; or when he sees his Passion or Empire must cease, he will
relinquish the former: which were it founded on Virtue, would be as
permanent as the reward of it; but being on Lust, and meeting such
dangers and obstructions, it will as soon expire, as would the pleasures
of it. I confess this discourse made me tremble, and I could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from replying, Certainly, <hi>Surena,</hi> there are Passions of another
quality than you have now given me a character of, or else you have
given me an ill one of yours, or of your self; for if those which are built
on Virtue never expire, I must conclude, yours had not that foundation,
or else is still existent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Surena</hi> found himself as much surprised at my inference, as I was at
what gave me the rise to make it: But after a short silence, he told me,
There is (Madam) no general Rule but has some exception; and 'tis I
only make it in this: Neither, Madam, should I tell you an untruth, if
I assured you my love for you, makes me not love you; I esteemed it
but an ill effect and character of my Flame to oppose and injure yours;
and since the gods have made the perseverance in my Passion as great a
misfortune, as your not rewarding it; I transplanted that permanency
the gods had given me for a virtuous affection, on a virtuous Friendship,
and they will not so much lessen their obligation in this change, as to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it no miracle; which it would neither prove nor appear, did they
produce in <hi>Arsaces</hi> a resembling operation. I told him, that to repeat
was not to annihilate a Miracle; That I could not esteem a production of
reason, to be one; or if there had been one in his affection, it was in
that he had assum'd, and not declined it; since he could not be more
powerfully invited to relinquish his addresses from the unworthiness of
their object, than from her preingaged Love; which she resolved as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to cherish, as his Friendship, that had so generously contributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
I further told him, That since the extinction of his Flame evinced a
possibility of <hi>Orodes</hi> doing the like, and that the hazard in trusting his
vows, could not be greater than that of a Battel; I conjured him, if 'twere
upon my score, and not his own that he drew his Sword, that he would
sheath it again, and not so far engage himself in hazards, as to find both our
destructions, in what he intended as an argument of a Friendship, I
could not be more desirous, than satisfy'd of. I began my request again
(<hi>Parthenissa</hi> continued) to retrench all discourse of his Passion; which
like a Relique, might lose its respect by becoming common. To this
<hi>Surena</hi> replyed, By what I have done, Madam, I know what will be
done unto me; and that <hi>Orodes</hi> when ever he has the Power, will make
use of it to render me a sacrifice for the fair <hi>Parthenissa.</hi> This being
both my faith, and my ambition (so it may be in a handsomer way, than
on a Scaffold) permit me to stand upon my defence; if that succeeds,
you may command your own desires; and lest it should not, let me
publish, I did but conceal, not suppress my Passion; and do you assure
the King 'tis your constraint, not your inclination detains you here; and
that you will accept of his offer, as soon as I permit you. This (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
will secure you against all misfortunes, for <hi>Arsaces</hi> cannot decline
his Concessions at the very last, because your not receiving them at first
was your misfortune, not your fault. All the while <hi>Surena</hi> spoke, I
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:96335:229"/>
blush'd, and sometimes trembled, in apprehension what he said, was
not his motion, but his resolve; but not to let him know my fears by
my disorders, I told him, The generous <hi>Surena</hi> has already so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
me, that if he is capable of doing it more, it must be by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
not hazarding himself: The latter, he will but too abundantly
do, by performing what he propounds; since <hi>Orodes</hi> will be a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemy on the score of Love, than Power; and will be too suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
we will delude him, not to conclude we do it, in so palpable a
Fiction. It is not impossible too, but such a proceeding may lessen the
heat and affections of your own Partizans; who though they take up
Arms to defend me from being the King's Prisoner, will hardly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them, to continue me yours; which they must believe, or <hi>Arsaces</hi>
cannot long; from whose power you shall not need create any apprehensions,
since before you put your self into it, I will extort as much
for your security, as I receive for my own. In brief (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>)
my requests, or my reasons were so moving, that <hi>Surena</hi> assured me, if at
the end of Four and twenty Hours his arguments could not appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
ones to me, mine should prove so to him; and then he withdrew
himself, to let the King's Express know, That then he might return for
his positive answer, whom (he said) he would not so long detain in the
Castle, lest it might look rather like an imprisonment, than an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
I will pass by the joys we all three assumed at <hi>Surena</hi>'s engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and those reasons we deduced for and against the accepting <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
Concessions, since those for the former, were so many, that they
had exhausted all from the latter. I pass'd that afternoon and the night,
in as much rest, as the thoughts of suppressing so dangerous a War and
Lover, could permit; and the next day I was hardly dress'd, when I
heard a great noise in the Castle, and observed most of the Soldiers
running to the Battlements of it: The two Princesses, and I, did the
like; where, when we were come, we might perceive all those Plains
towards the Sun-rising covered with Troops; we concluded 'twas <hi>Vixo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>'s
Army, because we saw the King's under their Ensigns in the Camp.
This made me apprehend <hi>Surena</hi> had taken those 24 hours of delay, to
put affairs beyond a capability of reconciliation; and that he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
the King's Express, but to accellerate <hi>Vixores</hi>'s march: As soon
as I had told <hi>Lyndadory</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda</hi> my fears, they became theirs;
and because by the help of a Perspective Glass we perceived a Herald go
from the King's Army to the other, and that in all probability he was
employed to let <hi>Vixores</hi> know, how that <hi>Arsaces</hi> expected a return from
the Castle, which might put a period to all disputes, till which were
come, he would begin none: we determined in a conjuncture of time
so pressing, to be so with <hi>Surena</hi> for his positive resolve, since a longer
protraction might engage us in those miseries I was so solicitous to
avoid. <hi>Surena</hi>'s coming to us, seemed to contribute to so necessary and
just an intention: 'twas therefore I immediately acquainted him, That
the longer I reflected on my Arguments for relying on <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s vows,
the more pregnant I still found them: that the resolution I had then
assumed, would be so far from receiving a change by the effluction of
a few minutes, that it would a confirmation: That before the 24 hours
were expired, such misfortunes might arrive, as we might deplore all
those of our Lives: and therefore 'twas, I conjured him by that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he had for me, and by the just value I placed upon it, to permit me
to go out of <hi>Eden;</hi> and that if he could not silence his suspitions, with
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:96335:230"/>
what I did Mine, that at least I might receive the satisfaction of not
being the Authoress of shedding so much Blood, and of involving my
Countrey in a Civil War, <hi>Surena</hi> having commanded all the Soldiers to
their Posts, prostrating himself at my Feet, told me, 'Tis now, Madam,
no longer time to dissemble a Passion which I clouded, but could not
extinguish; I had too unresistable a Rival in <hi>Arsaces,</hi> to continue and
declare my self his; I was necessitated therefore by Art, to supply the
defects of Power: neither did I, Madam, delude, but serve you in this
disguise: I believe you will find I do so too in this discovery, since
without it you must have put your self in the hands of one, who would
be satisfied with nothing but possessing you; whereas you are now in
ones, that if he cannot from a perfect Passion enjoy that blessing himself,
he will never pretend higher, than to keep all others from it. I go now,
Madam, to take from <hi>Arsaces</hi> as absolutely the power of making you
his Queen, as the just aversion you have contracted for him, has already
taken away all means of becoming so, but that; and I hope before the
Sun sets, to evince, by the sacrificing of so many Thousand Lives for
your preservation, how precious 'tis unto me. <hi>Surena</hi> had no sooner
done speaking, than he rose up; and having saluted me, went hastily
away: I had neither the design, nor the power to stay him; the first
proceeded from my aversion from seeing, and the latter from my disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of having heard him; which were so transcendent, that the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Lyndadory</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> were so far from silencing my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that they created it, by believing Mine was capable of being
suppress'd. Oh gods! what did I not utter against so black an infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity!
and how I quarrelled with my self, for having trusted my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to him, who made me need any! But whilst I was in the highest
resentments those reflections inspired me with, they were interrrupted
by many shouts and cryes; and turning about to learn from whence they
proceeded, I perceived it was from a great Body of <hi>Vixores</hi>'s Army,
which were fallen upon one of the King's Guards, that was most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
towards the Castle, which after a bloody dispute they beat up, and
thereby gave <hi>Surena</hi> the liberty of joyning with him, which he omitted
not, for we saw him immediately row over the <hi>Tygris,</hi> and recover his
Army: soon after the Kings was drawn out of their Camp, which we
learn'd, proceeded from <hi>Surena</hi>'s having assured him in a Letter, of all
that he had me; which so filled <hi>Arsaces</hi> with fury, that finding he could
not end the War by continuing the Siege, he resolved to attempt it by a
Battel; and because his rage was of a quality that could not admit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
and there being light enough left for so bloody a decision, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
began it, but it ended not till the day did, which proved a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
one to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> whose Victory was witnessed by the death of
40000 of his Rebels; which number yet had been much increas'd, if
the obscurity had not hindered it. The two Brothers, better followed
in the Flight, than in the Charge, took several ways; <hi>Vixores</hi> to raise a
new Army, and bring their Fates to another experiment; and <hi>Surena,</hi>
who had secured that Post upon the <hi>Tygris</hi> which his Army had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
before the Battel, made it the place of ralliment; where finding
too many for the Siege, and too few for the Field, he selected 2000,
and dismist the rest; who by several ways found several Fortunes, some
scaping, some losing their Liberties, and others their Lives. <hi>Surena</hi>
employed all that night to ferry over his Men into <hi>Eden,</hi> which he did,
though with the loss of a Fourth part of them, who being left to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:96335:230"/>
their Post, were killed in it, by a successful assault of the King's;
so that all the advantage <hi>Surena</hi> derived from the Battel, was to get a
Garison to maintain a Siege. The day after this troublesom one to him,
he made it a resembling one to me, by giving me a visit: but as soon as
he came into my Chamber, without permitting him to speak, I told him,
Traytor, with what Face canst thou present thy self before me, when
thy actions, and the gods by thy defeat, have bestowed on thee that
Name? 'tis doubtless to increase thy Crimes, by the continuing of my
Punishment, which the seeing thee but too abundantly does: Madam,
(said <hi>Surena</hi>) I do now no longer wonder the gods deny'd me success,
when you deny'd me your Prayers for it; 'twas the want of them gave
our Enemy the Victory; which it may be if he had entirely the Power,
he would employ it to act worse designs than you can esteem me capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of thinking; but I have so many fresh recourses of Men, that before
you fall into <hi>Arsaces</hi> hands, he must leave himself as few Subjects, as
now he besieges; and it may be rather than cause the ruine of your
Countrey, you will hinder Mine. Yes, Madam, you will see Armies
again in the Field, which shall invalidate your Prayers; and the gods,
who know how much fitter 'tis to give you your security, than your
revenge, will confer the victory on him, who will less offensively em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it. If the gods (I replyed) should take so strange a Course for
the punishment of <hi>Orode</hi>'s Sins, as to let one of his Vassals act it; yet the
end to which thou believest that Victory conducive, shall be denyed
thee: I have resolutions which no material power can so much as reach,
much less conquer; and if I were not confined to love <hi>Artabbanes</hi> as
his reward, I would do it as thy punishment. Certainly, Madam
(<hi>Surena</hi> coldly replyed), if you love <hi>Artabbanes</hi> still, you sufficiently
evince you are confined to it; his jealousie else had made you deny
him afterwards that honour: and it cannot be but Fate, which makes
you have a Passion for one who suspected your virtue, and an aversion for
him who adored it, though it has proved as cruel to the Latter, as kind
to the Former.</p>
                  <p>Here (said <hi>Symander</hi>) my Prince who had hitherto listen'd with a
wonderful silence, was necessitated to break it, by telling his Princess,
I hope, Madam, you gave him no other reply, than what is the only and
the true one; which is, that 'twas not my jealousie but my reason made
me apprehend the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was too great a Blessing ever to become
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> blush'd a little to have spoke what had neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> to interrupt her Story, and to make so flattering a
justification; 'twas therefore she hindered the continuance of it, by
telling him, I had but too much truth to alledg in your vindication, to
make use of a return, which had nothing of that virtue in it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the answer I gave him was, It would rather appear an effect of Fate,
did I decline a Passion for <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> to confer it on one whose mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
Treachery so Artificially made him doubt mine, that the Offence
of doing so could not be so great, as the impossibility of avoiding it.
Thou canst not therefore mention <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s seeming crime, but thou
must publish thy real one: But to take from thee all fresh occasions to
injure the gods, as well as me, I protest by them, That if their power
know any limitation, 'tis in the impossibility of making me receive
thy Passion, or so much as listen to thy addresses with Patience. There
is, Madam (he replyed) nothing impossible but to him that believes it;
'tis only the Faith of apprehension, not reason; or if there be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:96335:231"/>
my declining the ambition of possessing you, or permitting any
other the doing it, are the only ones.</p>
                  <p>He spake something else, though I did not hear it; for I withdrew,
and lock'd my self up in my Cabbinet, which for six Moons was my
only sanctuary from such importunate visits: But his generous Sister
assum'd at his change so exorbitant a grief, that it even brought an
accession to mine; the fair <hi>Lyndadory</hi> by hers did the like; and though
I both conjured them to lessen the cause of their Tears, by removing
themselves from the subject of them, yet they would never consent to
my request: neither had they, would <hi>Surena</hi> have permitted it, who
one day let me know so much, when I motioned their removal to him,
and who transferred his denyal upon the indecency of wanting some of
my own Sex to be near me. <hi>Zephalinda</hi> a thousand times fruitlesly essay'd
to let <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> know the truth of our condition, which she suspected
her brother had kept from his knowledg, and thereby made that seem an
effect of his Art, which was one of his Treachery: This she was the
more intent upon, knowing that every opportunity <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> (who
was Lieutenant General to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> and condemned his desires on me,
which by the infusions of <hi>Surena,</hi> he considered through a false optick)
sent him constant Intelligence, under pretence of concluding an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of Prisoners, mutually made so by fortunate and unsuccessful
Sallyes, whose retail I decline telling you, since 'tis sufficient you know
they were frequent and bloody. I believe you are confident, that I
was so of <hi>Surena</hi>'s not attempting against my honour, since I solicited
the removal of those, whose presence might have restrained any desires
of so criminal a quality; and truly I must do him that justice, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
he had nothing offensive in his Love, but his Love, which
was as civil, as unsuccessful.</p>
                  <p>Though the violence of the Winter were great, yet it lessened not
that of the Siege, which was so active, as it left no time to feel the rigour
of the Season. But the Spring, which brought weather fit to continue
the War, brought <hi>Surena</hi> news of his impossibility of doing it: for by
the return of a Prisoner (purposely made so) for that end, he received
from <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> the certainty of <hi>Vixores</hi>'s repeated defeat, which
was given him by the Prince <hi>Phraates,</hi> expresly sent by his Father to
interrupt his levies, or destroy them; which latter he effected, though
much of the Glory, and more of the Danger fell to the young <hi>Phraata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
illegitimate Son to <hi>Phraates,</hi> not then above 16 years of Age, whose
Mother by her excellent Beauty had been Concubine to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and who
by him had been presented to <hi>Phraates,</hi> as another was at the same time
of resembling Beauty, and profession, to <hi>Pacorus:</hi> But he returned her
again to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as a fitter present for his restitution, than acceptance.
<hi>Surena</hi> at this fatal Intelligence, found as small hopes to preserve me
from his King, as to obtain me for himself; and I began to assume some,
that what he had denyed to me, he must grant to his necessity. But
<hi>Vixores,</hi> though he had lost the possibility of raising the Siege, yet he
had not of enabling his Brother to continue it; which to effect, with
the reliques of his broken Army, of which he had lost 22000, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
by long Marches and unfrequented ways, with 2000 Foot, which
he had mounted, and by his admirable celerity and silence, came so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
to the Banks of <hi>Tygris,</hi> that the King's Eyes gave him the first
intelligence of his being there; which was no sooner received, than all
the Boats upon the River were drawn to one place, for the ferrying over
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:96335:231"/>
some Horse to cut off this relief: <hi>Surena</hi> to facilitate the entry of it,
made a furious Sally; and <hi>Vixores,</hi> the better to palliate his fiction, made
a brisk one against the <hi>Arsacians,</hi> with Two thousand Horse, with which
he had convey'd the Two thousand mounted Foot, who all this while
having quit their Horses, lay conceal'd in a Grove two Furlongs above
<hi>Arsaces</hi>'s Guard, which was next to the Castle; from whence during the
Allarm, they sent over some excellent swimmers, who fastening Ropes on
that side the River, by Ten Flat-bottom'd Boats, which as many Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medaries
had brought, and which for the conveniency of carriage, were
made of Wicker, cover'd with Hides, without rowing, or driving down
the stream, in one hour, they had transported over all the Soldiers; but
as they were beginning to do the like to the Provisions, which <hi>Surena</hi>
wanted more than the Men; some of the Kings Horse, who by a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
taken from the Convoy had gain'd intelligence of this relief, came,
and by a furious charge render'd themselves Masters of the most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of it. The Soldiers who were in the Island, seeing the loss of
their victuals, and knowing it irrecoverable, lest a longer delay might
render the Castle so too, by a hasty march under the Banks of the <hi>Tygris,</hi>
which by a continu'd frost had left a large strand, and by the obscurity
of the Night (which then had for above two hours cover'd the Heavens)
they safely arriv'd in <hi>Eden;</hi> but <hi>Surena</hi>'s joy at it immediately vanisht;
for by the loss of his Provisions, he found his Brother had sent an increase,
rather than a relief of his wants; who concluding he had given time
enough for the entry of the supply, by degrees began to diminish the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Combat, which finally an hour after, absolutely ceast. <hi>Vixo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
in this performance shew'd himself so much a Soldier, that none which
was so, could not but conclude his precedent defeats proceeded not from
his not being one. That night by a long March, he put himself out of the
necessity of making a second; for he had so far out-gone those Troops
which follow'd him, that by easie journeys he reacht again the Province
of <hi>Hircania,</hi> which though <hi>Phraates</hi> had much destroy'd, yet <hi>Vixores</hi>
despair'd not, but from those warlike people, and that provocation, to
bring again a third Army into the Field, which might render him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of it. <hi>Surena</hi> was constrain'd by his little Victuals, and many Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to make frequent and furious Sallies, where to lose of his own Men,
or to kill of the Kings, were equal advantages. One Evening as the two
Princesses and I, were walking on the Battlements of the Castle, we heard
a noise in the Court, which we learn'd proceeded from the arrival of
<hi>Arzimin,</hi> who having deceiv'd, or corrupted his Guards, had then fled
from the Camp, and recover'd the Castle. <hi>Surena</hi> assum'd a visible joy
at the escape, and return of so considerable a Friend. Three or four
days successively after, I fancy'd <hi>Arzimin</hi> by his looks had some desires
to speak with me; but apprehending he had taken them up upon <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
score (whom I never after our first discourse, permitted to make me
a second) I declin'd all opportunities of facilitating his design; but at
length, having acquainted the Princesses with my belief, and suspitions,
they were jointly of opinion, That I should no longer defer giving <hi>Arzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
an opportunity I had hitherto deny'd him, since if he had any thing
to act for me (which his strange escape from the Camp render'd no irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
belief) by retrenching all discourse vvith me, I did too, all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of serving me; and if what he had to deliver were on <hi>Surena</hi>'s
account, I ought speedily to give him one Audience, to have a just
ground for denying him for ever another. Their opinion was my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:96335:232"/>
which immediately after I had assum'd, I had the opportunity
to put it in practice; for the same day, as we went to take the Air in
the Gardens of the Castle, which because we frequently did, <hi>Arsaces</hi> had
given an obeyed command, that no Arrows or Darts should be shot or
flung that way; <hi>Arzimin,</hi> who waited for me at the Door, came and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me his hand to lead me down, which I accepted; and which I had no
sooner done, than he told me softly, I have something, Madam, of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to inform you of, but I must humbly beg it may be without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
I told him in the same tone, That I would give the opportunity
he desired as soon as we were in the Gardens; whither being come, we
insensibly lost the two Princesses, and those that followed us; which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimin</hi>
being convinced of, by looking diligently every way, he flung
himself upon his Knees, and presented me a little Note, which I opened,
and found was all of <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s hand, and only contained these words,
<hi>Madam, I beseech you believe all he shall tell you, and be satisfied of his
Fidelity, on my engagement for it.</hi> After I had read these few words,
and assured him they had all that efficacy both the King and he could
expect, I made him rise, lest being surprised in that Posture, it might
raise a suspition, which continuing our walk, would prevent; when he
was up, he told me, I believe, Madam, you are not ignorant I was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
hurt, and taken Prisoner in that unsuccessful Battel <hi>Surena</hi>
fought against his King; and that I might not have so noble a fate as that
of dying by my wounds, they were diligently cured, and then my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was, That that Life I had employed against my Prince, I should
lose upon a Scaffold; whither when I was brought and expected the
fatal stroak, I received a Pardon: <hi>Arsaces</hi> making a distinction between
those which fought against him, and those which fought for <hi>surena;</hi> of
which latter quality he was assured I was, from the Prince <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi>
This grace which I as little expected as deserved, produced so just an
effect in me, that I determined to employ my Life for him that had given
it me; in pursuance whereof I obtained a private Audience from the
King, without so much as the knowledg of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who I knew
too much favoured <hi>Surena</hi>'s designs to be trusted with mine. There
'twas, Madam, I told the King a Truth, of which I believe you are yet
ignorant; which is, That <hi>Surena</hi> having long form'd a design of carrying
you away into <hi>Media,</hi> and of living there under the protection of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinzor,</hi> (of which you may be partly convinced, by his having declar'd
himself to you to be, what he never yet but was) finding by those unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
wounds he receiv'd, when he made your Guards your Martyrs,
that he was unable to flie with you thither, and as unable to trust you
there without him; the better to delude your belief, he caus'd one of
his Chyrurgeons to tell you, and the two Princesses, he was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to perform the journey, when he had not the power to do it; and
which to prevent, he caus'd five hundred Horse, he had covertly drawn
together, to be his and your Convoy into <hi>Media,</hi> to appear as so many
of the KIngs; and thereby made you return hither, as if it had been by
misfortune, not design; and if you remember, Madam, a Chyrurgeon of
the Convoy, who knew nothing of his Prince's intentions, told you
when he fell into his fainting, that he could not continue his journey, and
his Life, I remember'd that passage (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) very well, and from
thence concluded <hi>Arzimin</hi> told me a Truth, I had but too many preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Testimonies no longer to doubt. <hi>Orodes,</hi> Madam, (continu'd <hi>Arzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>)
was as much surpriz'd at this intelligence, as I perceive you are;
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:96335:232"/>
and those Troops which were your seeming besiegers, till those of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>
were really so, then became your defenders; and when <hi>Orodes</hi> sent
you an assurance of attempting nothing against the Laws of Honour, in
obtaining that of your Affection, <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> (as you know) sent
<hi>Surena</hi> word, that <hi>Vixores</hi> with a numerous Army was ready speedily to
Attempt his Relief: 'Twas then, Madam, to avoid the spilling of so much
blood, and of not demonstrating any diffidence in the King's so solemn
engagements, that you press'd <hi>Surena</hi> to permit you to rely on them; who
finding your desire was your resolution, begged you to consider of his
Arguments for 24 hours, and then he would obey your election. He did
this only, that in the mean time he might engage both Armies, that if the
victory inclined to his side, he might keep you in his Power as an effect of
his Friendship, not his Love; and if it inclined to the King's, he might
ascribe the Battel, by his being so strictly besieged, to the impossibility of
his preventing it; and then by accepting the King's, offer, reserve the
disclosing his Passion to a more promising opportunity. This, Madam,
was the Cause, that under a pretence of not detaining the King's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
so long, he immediately dispatched him to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> whom
he pressingly desired to let <hi>Vixores</hi> know, That if within 24 hours he
brought not their Fates to a decision, no misfortune could be greater
than that delay. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> did this to serve <hi>Surena,</hi> who has promised
him his Sister; and to end a War, which would as long as it continued,
deny him the felicity of seeing <hi>Zephalinda.</hi> This design had doubtless
succeeded, if the gods (who cannot more convincingly manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be what they are, than by punishing infidelity) had not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
<hi>Surena</hi> to disclose so criminal a fallacy: for though <hi>Vixores</hi> with
all his Army came early enough, and by a Thousand provocations soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the King to a Battel before the 24 hours were effluxt; yet <hi>Arsaces,</hi>
though equal in forces, would not accept it, hoping by the return then
promised, without blood to end the difference: <hi>Surena</hi> by this delay
concluded of the cause of it, and thereby observing he could not any
longer cloud himself, and that so powerful an Army might justifie his
Crime, boldly confess'd it to you, and then went to punish in his King
what he practised in himself; but he soon found in his defeat, how the
gods disavowed his Quarrel; which (said <hi>Arzimin</hi>) I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viced
of, and consequently will no longer defend. 'Tis therefore (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
as an expiation for having done it so much already, that I have
engaged my self to <hi>Arsaces</hi> to deliver you out of this Captivity, or to
lose my Life in attempting it; and as one of your Protectors, become your
Keeper; so to make one of your Keepers become your Deliverer: The
two Princesses, if they know of your escape, must not accompany you
in it; neither is it necessary, for being Prisoners but upon your account,
your liberty will restore them to theirs. I found this rational, but not
kind; and therefore determined, if 'twere not their desire, as well as
opinion, I would repay them the obligation of continuing a Prisoner
with them, as they had with me; but this I told not <hi>Arzimin,</hi> who thus
prosecuted his discourse: To morrow Night (Madam) I have the
Guard, and I have ordered it so, that those which compose it are my
Creatures, especially such as are of the water-gate where the Galley
which belongs to the Castle is at Anchor: In her, Madam, I design to
carry you away, which <hi>Arsaces</hi> approves; and because I suspected <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
has so many Partizans and Spies in the Army, that if the King should
give orders to any of those Guards upon the River, to receive the Galley
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:96335:233"/>
which should come out of the Castle as Friends, it would inevitably
come by the multitude of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, to his knowledg. I have perswaded
<hi>Arsaces</hi> under the pretence of an intelligence, to draw all the Boats on
the River to the upper end of the Island, so that none of the Guards
being able to follow us, we need not trust their Faiths with so dangerous
a secret. And the <hi>Tygris</hi> is of such a breadth, that in the obscurity of
the Night, keeping under the Island-shore, they can hardly discover us;
or if they do, not reach us with their Arrows: I am necessitated too to
let the Galley drive down the stream under the Banks of the River, lest
crossing over it, some of our own Centries on the Towers, might discover
and offend us; for they will know by the smallness of our Numbers,
and by <hi>Surena</hi>'s not seeing, or acting in our attempt, that it is not a Sally;
but a flight. The King, Madam, will expect you at a little Village some
Twenty Furlongs below the Castle; and to secure you from any fears,
that you do but avoid one Imprisonment to fall into another, he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to protest in his behalf, by all the tutelary gods of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and by whatever else he holds in highest veneration, He has ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
all those Thoughts from him, which have so long banished you;
and to take from himself the power of a relapse, if ever he should have
the will, he has already given order for the revocation of <hi>Artabbane</hi>'s
exilement; and to repair his having sent him into it, he will with the
restoring him to his Country, restore him too to his Princess. <hi>Arzimin</hi>
had more particularly acquainted me with the residue of what he was
to deliver, had not he perceived (afar off) <hi>Surena</hi> coming into the
Garden, which made him desire me to hasten my joyning with the
Company; which whilst we were doing, he told me, That the Night
appointed, four hours after the close of the Evening, he would not
fail to come to my Chamber with my disguise, and to have all things so
exactly prepared, that it must be Fate, and not Chance if his design suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not. I had hardly assured him there should be no omission on
my Part, but we had recovered the Company, and suddenly after <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
appeared in the same Walk we were in, which made me quit it, and
retire to my Appartment; where having shut our selves up, I told <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadory</hi>
and <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> all that <hi>Arzimin</hi> had me: To be brief, those
two admirable Women, for all my reiterated Prayers, would not be
sharers in my escape, lest they might prejudice it; and if I condescended
to their commands of going away alone, it was purely from a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that as soon as I was out of the Castle, <hi>Surena</hi> would yield it,
and consequently the Princesses would be restored to a liberty by me,
which they would not accept of with me; <hi>Zephalinda</hi> too, by not going
with me, could leave her Brother nothing but suspitions that she knew
of my Flight; and <hi>Lyndadory</hi> was so apprehensive, that her accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
me in it, might convince <hi>Surena,</hi> 'twas the craft, and not the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of his Sister, detained her, and so pleased with a recluseness, which
both your absences made her cherish, that upon those scores as well as the
former, she determined to remain with the fair <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> who conjur'd
me I would employ that Power I had with <hi>Arsaces,</hi> to procure a Pardon
for her Brother, who had no other Title to my Mercy, than that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it not: I assured her, that what should now be my obedience,
had been my design: and that one so near in blood to <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> could
not but be so, in my care. At length, the so impatiented night
and hour came, and with it <hi>Arzimin,</hi> who brought me one of his
Pages Clothes, which he said was necessary for me to wear, and that
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:96335:233"/>
I should do it no longer than till I were out of the Castle; I joyfully
put on that Livery of Freedom, and having a thousand times embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Princesses, I took my final leave; and only with <hi>Arzimin,</hi> whom
I followed as his servant, came to the Guard of the Water Gate, where
I found the Soldiers sleeping on the Ground, and in so wretched a way,
that I have never since esteemed it courage, but to judgement, to cast
themselves upon whatsoever hazard may finish such miserable Lives,
<hi>Arzimin</hi> immediately put me into the Galley, and taking seven Men to
row, and steer her, without any noise got out of the Water-percullis,
and in the same silence descended the Current for above Three hours;
during which, I had again put on the habit of my Sex in the Cabbin, in
which I had lock'd my self up: when I was dress'd, I came out, and
found of our Seven, but Three in the Galley, of which <hi>Arzimin</hi> was
one, of whom I ask'd, what was become of the rest, and how soon we
should land? he told me the other Four were gone in a little Skiff which
belonged to the Galley, to tell <hi>Arsaces</hi> of my approach, and that it
would be an hour before we should go ashore, because he durst not make
use of his Oars: I retired my self satisfied with that reply; and at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of the hour, <hi>Arzimin</hi> came to let me know I was safely arrived
where he intended; immediately after, one of the Galley carried me out
of it in his Arms to a Chariot, which with some Thirty Horse expected
us. I thought it something strange that <hi>Arzimin</hi> himself did not do it,
or that he commanded not some other fitter for the employment than he
which had undertook it; but I thought it much stranger, when I saw
him too, come only into the Chariot with me, and when I found him
by the help of the Light, which then began to dawn, to be <hi>Surena:</hi> Oh
gods! as soon as I knew him, I knew my self betrayed: I had only force
enough to say so, for all my Senses were so obliging as to cease their
actings, rather than by continuing them, so extreamly to afflict me: But
<hi>Surena,</hi> who had more care of my life, than me, by powerful Cordials
brought me to my self; I pay'd his care with a Thousand Injuries; and
if my hate were as great a torment to him as that Life he restored me to,
was to me, I could neither have desired, nor acted a more sublime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
'Twas either his respect, or his guilt, which all that day kept
him in a deep silence; and if he any way evinced how much my discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was his, it was only in sighs. The first Night (after a very long
Journey) we lay at a Castle which was scituated in so solitary a place, that
I believe it was only built for that end to which <hi>Surena</hi> then employ'd
it: He led me to a Chamber that wanted nothing but his absence; and
that conveniency it soon enjoyed; for without speaking one word, he
saluted me with great humility, and left me to the company of my
Thoughts, which in the condition I was in, was the worst I could keep,
but his. I had not long the liberty to entertain them, for a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
woman came into my Chamber to offer me her Service then, and
if I pleased for ever; I accepted of it in the first limitation, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
it in the latter, lest she should have served <hi>Surena,</hi> and not me.
An hour after, Supper was brought in; and that being ended, my new
woman resigned her place to <hi>Surena,</hi> who kneeling at my Feet, told me,
You see (fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) prostrate before you, one who should not
have the confidence to do it, did he not believe the not imploring your
pardon a greater misfortune than any, but the not obtaining it: If I
have deluded your hopes, I will not your belief; for though I have not
given you into <hi>Arsace</hi>'s power, yet I protest by your self, I will employ
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:96335:234"/>
mine to defend and serve you, which I am confident is your Faith, and
which I assure you cannot be more so, than it is my inviolable resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
'twas necessity, Madam, and not election, made me draw you
from a place, where I had no longer the means to preserve you from
abandoning a Servant, who is as much concerned in your honour, as
you are to put your self into the power of another, who would have
employed all his to destroy, not defend what you value most; I do not
accuse my King, that you may the less condemn me; I am so far from
desiring his crimes, that I would give my Life he had none; for thereby
you had been exempted from inconveniences, which would be unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
were they not in order to the preventing of greater. Your
residence, Madam, with <hi>Arsaces,</hi> I am convinced, would make you
wish, when perhaps too-too late, that you had prevented it by greater
troubles than I hope you will suffer in your journey; for I have so well
deluded him, that you may take your own hours of travel; and that
which will end yours, will be a Castle of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s in <hi>Media,</hi> the first
place to which we intended our flight, had not an unhappy accident
prevented it; and <hi>Media,</hi> Madam, being the Kingdom your <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
must one day possess, I elect to wait on you thither, that your Reason,
if not your justice, may be secured of the innocency of my designs; for
had I any which were criminal, I would not have chosen that place for
the Scene to act them, where your happy servant cannot want hands to
act his Revenge. <hi>Surena</hi> (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) told me many things of this
quality, and so protested, his ambition was to solicite, not force my
Affection; that I determined, since I could not prevent the former, not
to provoke him to the latter, which the uttering of my just resentments,
I apprehended would; 'twas therefore I told him, Though your past
Crimes might invite me rationally to conclude you capable of any,
yet I will not disbelieve your vows and professions; which if ever you
design to violate, I have the power and the resolution to prevent: Do
not necessitate me to owe that safety to my self, which I am not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to derive from you; nor attempt to practice that which you so justly
condemn in another, and which you esteemed so foul a Sin, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, you esteemed Rebellion None. Madam (said <hi>Surena</hi>) did it
not too much wrong the Beauty of Truth to arm it with many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
I should by reiterated ones, bind my self by Religion to that
which I am sufficiently confined unto without it; and were it lawful for
<hi>Surena</hi> to repine at any thing the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> says, he had now
but too abundant an occasion to do it; for she must believe him as wicked
as unfortunate, to conclude he stood in need of any other Argument to
deter him from attempting against her honour, than the greatness of the
Crime; but Madam, my deportment shall be so innocent, that you will
in the future esteem your doubts as great an injury to your self, as I
can now esteem them to me. I found, though his Expressions were
humble, that he was highly mov'd at the cause of my fears; 'twas
therefore I replyed, I hope, <hi>Surena,</hi> you will not much condemn me for
running into an error, where the discovery of its being one, will prove
my satisfaction. Your satisfaction Madam (said <hi>Surena</hi>) shall be still
more considerable to me than my own; and since I have that invitation,
as well as that of virtue, I shall as much apprehend any criminal designs,
as the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> does detest them; thereupon having wish'd me
but as much rest as I could confer on him, he withdrew himself to leave
me to mine. But I took none, out of an apprehension that I had done
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:96335:234"/>
amiss in acquainting him with my fears; for 'twas not impossible, but
to think him capable of that Sin, was to provoke him to it; since the
very performance could not raise in me a worse belief of him, than that
was of fearing he would perform them. This reason, and many ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a resembling efficacy, made me conclude, that my having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
my doubts was a greater prejudice, than those assurances I had
from thence derived, was an advantage. You may believe, in such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
of the Mind, the Body could not but participate; so that I
was earlier up than he that was more concerned in my being so; and
I quitted my Bed, not only because I could take no rest in it, but that I
resolved to add to the obligation of virtue, that of trust, and to go
freely to what else I knew I should be constrained unto; <hi>Surena</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
found me dress'd when he came to tell me all things were ready for
our Journey, if I was; which having told him, he led me to the Chariot,
that had all the Journey the same 30 Horse for Convoy, that it
had at first: <hi>Surena</hi> begged and had my permission to ride with
me in it.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth day after we had left the Castle of <hi>Eden,</hi> we came into
<hi>Media,</hi> which we learned was all involved in a Domestick War. This
made <hi>Surena</hi> travel with more caution than he had thitherto observed;
so that constantly he left a couple of his Guard some four or five Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
behind, and sent half a score before, that he might not be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized.
The third day after he had settled this order, one of those
to whose care all Intelligence which should happen in the rear, was left,
came full speed to acquant his Prince, that his Companion had been
killed by a Party of Horse which followed him a round Gallop. <hi>Surena</hi>
at this Intelligence leap'd out of the Chariot, and whilst he was arming
himself, made me many apologies for so rude a proceeding; but he
was no sooner fitted to receive his Enemies, than he perceived them,
who without any cheapening, charg'd him so roundly, that he found he
might need those Ten Horse for the Fight, which he had sent for Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
one of his Pages went therefore to call them; but two of the
unknown Party having charged through all <hi>Surena</hi>'s, came to my
Chariot, and having beg'd me to pardon a rudeness which was for my
service, one of them immediately killed the Driver of it, and the other
with his sword cut the Traces asunder; but this performance cost them
their Lives, which they lost by Three of their Enemies, who feared
those came not to hinder my flight, but to contribute to it. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
being performed by Men of singular valour, was very bloody;
and in less than half an hour, were reduced to so few, as only the chief
of either Party: He of the unknown one, by his unimitable courage,
had reduced his Adversary to a condition which needed help, when the
generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi> interposed himself for their reconciliation, and
then, from an Intercessor, became a Party, not knowing he that was
vanquished was guilty; but he abundantly repaired that mistake, by
defending (after the return of those Ten Horse which were recalled) a
Life, I am much more concerned to have preserved, than to have <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s destroyed.</p>
                  <p>'Twas thus (said <hi>Symander</hi>) that the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> put a period to
a relation, which had as much taken up <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Sillace</hi>'s wonder,
as attention. I will not tell you how infinitely the first of them exclaim'd
against the perversness of his Fate, for having rendered the acting his
Revenge as great an offence against his Friendship, as the omission of
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:96335:235"/>
it was one against his Love. But the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who desired no
greater punishment for <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s Brother, and who indeed could
wish him no greater than to be out of his protection, and under his
Rivals, conjured him to be contented with that Revenge with which she
was. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was not sorry, that to the invitations of Friendship,
he had that additional one of obedience, for the silencing his designs of
vindicating his wrongs; but they being of too sublime a nature abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to be forgotten, lest his disorders might discover he disputed
whether he should obey <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> with her permission he conjur'd
the generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> to acquaint them, by what strange adventure he
was presented with the blessing of serving her. <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who receiv'd
as sublime a satisfaction in his obedience to <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
as he had in hearing her story, began his own short one, in
these terms:</p>
                  <p>From the time I left <hi>Rome,</hi> till I came to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> there happened
nothing worth relating; but that there happened nothing that was so:
But alas, this calm was but too severely interrupted, for there I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
how that both the Princess <hi>Lyndadory</hi> and <hi>Parthenissa</hi> could not
more want my service, than I did the power of paying it them: My
duty to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> and hope, that by being nearer the Castle of <hi>Eden,</hi>
I might be so to an opportunity of what so extreamly and justly I am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitioned,
made me immediately repair to the Camp, where by the
King I was received with such demonstrations of affection, that I
thought <hi>Surena</hi>'s past favour, and present condition, had thitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
me of that usage, and then conferred it on me; but my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
whether this proceeded from his goodness, or design, made me
keep him in a perfect one of your condition and resolutions; and
though I endeavoured all imaginable ways to serve you, and my self, in
the Princesses; yet the only one in which I did it, was, in perswading
the generous <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to do <hi>Surena</hi> no more services, unless he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an assurance from the fair <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> that in doing them to her
Brother, he did them too to her: This I did out of a confidence <hi>Surena</hi>
had deluded him; and this <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> did, not to shew me in that
confidence, that I was so; but when to many Letters of his to <hi>Zephalinda</hi>
he never received any return, he began to disclose a Truth which his so
long ignoring had rendered obstructive to his King's ends, and his
own: I believe this proceeding hastened <hi>Surena</hi>'s; for with his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he lost his hopes; but whilst I lay languishing in desires and
fears, a Packet came from <hi>Merinzor</hi> to <hi>Surena</hi> and by the Carrier of
it was delivered to <hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi> but by what I have related, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
from his Confident, his Enemy; wherefore opening the Letters,
he found in them a black conspiracy of raising a mutual Rebellion against
their Kings, and of affording each other reciprocal assistance. This I
esteemed our duties to acquaint <hi>Arsaces</hi> with, and this <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>
did so too, as an expiation of having formerly convoy'd some of <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
Letters to <hi>Merinzor,</hi> when he knew not what they imported, and
when he was made believe they only were to preserve a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
which might preserve the latter a sure retreat; but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
was, how to let <hi>Orodes</hi> know of these Letters, and not to let him
know we had seen them before; this at length we did, by causing a
Confident of ours to bring them hastily into the Camp, as having
taken them from one who by the River was stealing into the Castle,
and which by his Death he had prevented. <hi>Orodes</hi> having perused
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:96335:235"/>
them, found <hi>Surena</hi>'s Rebellion the more dangerous, and that a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigner
fomenting it, would render it as long, as hazardous. 'Twas
therefore he immediately called me to him, where after having told me,
That since <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had the next Command under him, all others
in the Army would be under me; and that therefore till he could find me
out a fit employment, he desired I would take upon me that, of being
his Ambassador to the King of <hi>Media,</hi> to acquaint him with this fresh
Treason, and to procure a League between them, That as two of their
Subjects had reciprocally bound themselves to ruine their Kings; so that
they should do the like, to ruine them. This (continued <hi>Sillaces</hi>) I
obey'd, partly because I had no employment in the Army, but chiefly
that my hopes were less, of serving the Princesses in the Siege, than in
my Embassy: For I had understood 'twas <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Power in <hi>Media,</hi>
which hindered <hi>Moneses</hi> from having any; and I had more than a belief,
that this favourite having rendered himself uncapable of becoming so
again, you might assume his place, or at least your Right, which I was
confident to advance, being employed as a publick Minister. I was also
but too certain the Siege would last longer than the journey, which six
days after I began, that time being effluxt in giving me my Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
with my private and publick Instructions: but because I designed
so short a residence in <hi>Media,</hi> I took only Twenty Gentlemen, and some
Servants to wait on me; and being informed on the Confines of this
Kingdom, that it was freshly involved in a Domestick War, I sent a
couple of my Company before the rest, to avoid Surprizes: These it
seemed saw those two of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, who fearing Mine, began a round
Gallop to recover their Companions; but they were so briskly followed,
that one of them was overtaken, and so wounded by a Javelin, that he
not only lost the hopes of his safety, but almost of his Life; you will
believe when I came up, that I was not a little surprised, when I found
this wounded Prisoner was <hi>Palurus,</hi> who had the same employment under
<hi>Surena,</hi> that his Brother had under <hi>Phraates;</hi> I concluded by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
that the Master was not far off: and by threatning to torture him if
he acquainted me not where his Prince was, and by promising to have a
care of his Life if he did: he told me, How you, Madam, had been
deluded by his Prince, and that you were both but a few furlongs before
us. Oh gods! how was I surprised at this strange intelligence! and how
many oaths did I extort from the dying <hi>Palurus</hi> before I could believe
him! but as soon as I did, leaving him to the care of some Peasants
which were present, I ran full speed upon the Traces of <hi>Surena;</hi> two of
my Troop I commanded to kill the Chariot-Driver, and to cut the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
lest during the fight I might lose the reward of it; with the rest I
charged my Enemy, in which, the first that fell was the false <hi>Arzimin.</hi>
You were, Madam, a Spectator of the residue of my Story, and so
was <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who came in when all my Company had killed <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>'s; and when they had had the honour to sacrifice all their own
Lives, in an employment which rather deserves my Envy, than
my Grief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sillaces</hi> (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) having finished his Discourse, all
those which had heard it (and he himself) were of opinion, the fair
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s deliverance, was replenish'd with so many strange conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
that it relished more of Providence than Chance; and that this
effect of it, was but an earnest of a more sublime and obliging one. I
know not whether so pleasing a belief, by having so high an influence on
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:96335:236"/>
                     <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s Mind, had a proportionate one on his Body; or whether so
long a charming of his Prince, as that was whilst his Princess and his
friend were speaking, did qualifie the violence of his Feaver; but I
know, that after some discourses upon the precedent ones (<hi>Partheniss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
being retired) he found so sensible an amendment, that he not only
acquainted us with it, but convinced us of it; and from that day, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly
recovered, that when the generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> was fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Embassy, my Prince's condition was so promising, that no
just apprehension of his Friend, needed any longer to have suspended
it: 'Twas therefore that the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> came to <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he not being able to wait on her in hers; where she found already
<hi>Sillaces</hi> and <hi>Zenophon;</hi> and though this meeting was to consult upon the
managing of their designs, yet I was not excluded. I shall pass over
their debates, to acquaint you with their results; which were, That
<hi>Zenophon,</hi> with those Forces he had then raised, should no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
his advancing, since <hi>Tygranes</hi> stood so much in need of them: That
<hi>Sillaces,</hi> as the <hi>Parthian</hi> Ambassador, should accompany <hi>Zenophon</hi> to his
King, to treat and conclude on that league, which was so requisite and
necessary to the ruining of my Prince's Rivals both in Empire and Love:
That <hi>Sillaces</hi> should employ all his Power as publick Minister, for the
restoration of <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> as being Nephew to his King; which he
might the more safely negotiate, since <hi>Arsaces</hi> had really revok'd his
Banishment, whether to increase <hi>Surena</hi>'s Fears, or to silence <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s:
That if he found any inclinations in <hi>Tygranes</hi> to receive him, he should
then, and not otherwise, acquaint him where he was: That <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
should depute (during his absence) such a Governour in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacia,</hi>
as was entirely to receive and obey <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s commands, and
as much to conceal his so doing. The next day after this resolution was
assum'd, it was put in a way of being practised; <hi>Sillaces</hi> accompanied
with <hi>Zenophon,</hi> whose Troops consisted of near 10000 Horse and Foot,
began their March towards <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> against which <hi>Merinzor</hi> with 15000
Horse and 25000 Foot was advanced, and Camp'd within sixteen Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
of her Walls, under which the King's Forces, which were near
10000 Horse, and as many Foot, were intrench'd. The Governor left
in <hi>Arsacia,</hi> was called <hi>Cloriman,</hi> and had received his education even
from his Cradle under <hi>Zenophon,</hi> who having found him replenish'd both
with Courage and Judgment, had given him a large participation both
in all his Commands and Fortunes. This young Gentleman was so assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
in this duty of his employment, and to <hi>Parthenissa</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes,</hi>
that they could not but commend <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s Judgment in his Choice:
I must confess, I had done so too, had I not observed he was as assiduous
in more than his respects to the fair <hi>Emilia;</hi> but her carriage was such,
that it gave me rather a satisfaction than an Allarm. <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> soon
after his being left alone with <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> never left her so, at least
when he could do it with civility; and my Prince could not be more
intent in increasing <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s affection, than I was in obtaining <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s;
so that all that time my generous Master employed in his Loves,
I did in mine: but whether it were a punishment for having so long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the power of a god, of which I then was sufficiently convinced;
or whether it were the fair <hi>Emilia</hi>'s disposition to behold the effects of
her own Power, which could not be more visible, than in continuing my
Passion without any demonstration of hers, for above three Moons;
though I could not obey my Reason, I found more than I had thitherto
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:96335:236"/>
known, for my detesting of Love; and though at last I received the
felicity of an assurance from the object of my Flame, that she approved
of, and would reward it; yet it was accompanied with the misfortune
that I derived that declaration from <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s prayers,
as much as from my ovvn; yet the belief I had, that <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Judgment,
not want of affection, made her elect to oblige Three sooner than one,
gave me a satisfaction which her words had denied me; but my Prince,
who had already obtained the victory over those tedious formalities,
now happily pretended to a more transcendent one, by successfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
from his Princess, in an Hymeneal Crown, to give his Passion the
lowest, and highest satisfaction it could ambition: But as <hi>Emilia</hi>'s grant
was accompanied with a qualification, so was <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s; for my Prince
derived it from his reasons, as well as from her affection: Those he
made use of were, That he could no more repine at the gods, but at her,
if he were perpetually miserable, since she might hinder his being so, by
a Concession of his request, which would not only prove a reparation
for his past misfortunes, but a preservative from his future: That then
the gods could neither make his Life short, nor unhappy, since the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the felicities would repair their want of duration: That
he concession would put a period to his external, as well as intrinsecal
sufferings; for though his Rivals might have some hopes to conquer her
Constancy, yet they could have none to do so to her Virtue. Here the
fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> interrupted him, by saying, Take heed <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> lest
what you imagine will silence the fury of your Enemies, do not render
it more fatal; for when they find you are from but a probable obstacle,
become a certain one, they will no more scruple to take away your
Life, than I will to take away my own, after such a loss. Madam (said
my Prince) you may banish those apprehensions, for you have by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
my criminal jealousies, so abundantly evidenced the Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of that esteem you honour me withal, that when to that you shall
add a religious obligation, the known Truth, That thereby we can have
but one destiny, will make them have the same care of mine, which they
will have of yours; so that, Madam, to secure me from danger, as well
as unhappiness, what I now implore at your Feet, is absolutely necessary.
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> more satisfied with his Arguments, than his motion (though
she esteemed it not fit to mingle felicities with fears, nor to be in the
embraces of her Prince, whilst those who had been her Companions in
her sufferings, could not be so in her joys) yet at length she yielded to
it, that her <hi>Artabbanes</hi> might not say, she deny'd him any thing with
reason. Oh gods! (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) it is impossible I should tell
you my Prince's transports, how often he prostrated himself before her,
how many thousand times he embraced her knees, and kiss'd her hands:
'Tis sufficient I assure you, his joy was proportionate to what created
it; and that it was impossible the Sence could relish those felicities, his
Mind did: He bless'd a Milion of times the privacy of their then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which admitted no other preparative but a Priest, lest the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Nuptial solemnities might have so long protracted the
celebration of the Nuptial delights: <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> after he had by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
testimonies of his satisfaction, convinced <hi>Parthenissa</hi> of it, retir'd
to his Appartment, whither immediately he sent for <hi>Cloriman,</hi> whom he
acquainted with his joys, and of whom he desired a Priest against the
next day, to put him in the way of consummating them. <hi>Cloriman,</hi> by
an erection of his Eyes and Hands, seemed to participate in my Prince's
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:96335:237"/>
satisfaction, which yet he somewhat clouded, by telling him, there was
never a Priest in <hi>Arsacia</hi> to whose fidelity he durst trust so important a
secret; but that within two days he would procure one, for whose se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
he would answer. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was so transported with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
that he not only esteemed the Trusting of any Priest could not
prove so high a prejudice, as a days protraction would amount unto:
But even would have sent for any one, and have ventered on his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
had not both <hi>Cloriman</hi> and I, by many allegations disswaded him
from it. But at length, those two days expired, which he continually
spent in <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s company, earnestly offering the gods as many years
of his Life, for the cutting off those two days. The Night of the last
he spent in as little sleep, as he would have done the succeeding one,
and as he did the succeeding one, during one half of which, he was kept
waking by his desires, and the other by his fears and danger; for some
Three hours before day he heard all the City in an high Allarm, which
made him immediately dress and arm himself to go and learn the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or prevent it; but as he was running to his Princesse's Appartment,
which his Love and fear made him resolve to defend, and made him
resolve was the place would most need his Defence, he heard the Palace
Gates forced open, and by that time he was come to the top of those
great stairs which lead to the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber, he saw a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Arm'd Men, which were hastily ascending them; he was not
near so much astonished thereat, as to see at the head of them the
perfidious <hi>Cloriman;</hi> who lifting up his Helmet, told my Prince, 'Tis
not my Treachery, <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> but my Love, has forced me to undertake
what I should condemn on any other score: The fair <hi>Emilia</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to scorn my Passion, but to receive <hi>Symander</hi>'s, and even to confer
hers on him; I had the heart to do any thing rather than to see this; and
my despair only has made me listen to <hi>Merinor</hi> and <hi>Surena</hi>'s solicitations,
with whom I have agreed to deliver up this City, and from whom I have
received a solemn engagement, that I shall have the fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> and that
your Life shall run no hazard, unless by your own resistance you cause it.
Traytor (said my Prince), my life has not been so bred up in Crimes, that
whilst it has a Sword to defend it, it should derive its preservation from
Infidelity. No, I had rather lose it to punish thy sin, than live by it;
and either by thy death, and <hi>Surena</hi>'s, I will hinder both your designs;
or by my own, your Triumphs. My Prince's blows began where his
words ended; and finding my self obliged both by duty, affection, and
revenge, to become <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s Second, I assumed that noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and being assisted with some of <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s Domesticks, we soon
drove before us into the Court, those which were come to assault us
in the Palace. 'Twas in this retreat, that the false <hi>Cloriman</hi> had the
honour to fall by a hand, which rather rewarded than punished his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
In my Life I never envied any of my Prince's actions but this; for
I esteemed it but just, that being the Author of <hi>Cloriman</hi>'s Crime, I should
have been of his punishment. Never did <hi>Artabbanes</hi> purchase more glory
by his personal courage, than in this fatal Night; and never the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
so admirable a sight, as then he lost, in not seeing the prodigious
effects of it. The name of <hi>Surena,</hi> and the apprehensions he should again
ravish from him the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> made him act things, which if <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>
had seen, he could not but have as much admired, as feared. The
place where my generous Master and his little Troop, had already made
that of his Enemies less, was under <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s window, which soon
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:96335:237"/>
after was hastily opened by <hi>Emilia,</hi> who cryed out, they were forcing
the Princesse's Appartment. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had scarcely heard that voice,
when he flew from a victory to a fresh danger, with more celerity
than the greatest Courages could to the former, or the greatest fears
from the latter; I followed him as fast as my feet could carry me, and
yet before I could overtake him, he had engaged himself in <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s
out-Chamber, amongst as many Enemies as he had already killed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All
the service I could do him was, by defending the Door, to hinder their
increase, which I did as long as I could use my Sword; but I lost that
and my senses together; yet to hinder that with my Body, which I could
not with my strength, I fell cross the Door, and there lay as some little
impediment. In the mean while <hi>Parthenissa</hi> hearing a strange noise at
her Door, every moment expected when it would be broke open; and
having a while fruitlesly attended that misfortune, she began to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
she was freed from it by a greater; her fears gave her no time to
consult her safety; so that immediately opening it, she discovered they
were but too-too-well grounded: For alas, my Prince, who thitherto
defended it, had received so many wounds, and lost so much blood, that
he was constrained to lean his back against it; so that missing his support,
he fell backwards into the Princesse's Chamber, weltring in a Sea of
blood: <hi>Parthenissa</hi> lost not her judgment, though she did almost her
hopes, at so fatal an object; for in the twinkling of an Eye, she thrust
to the Chamber Door, which by good fortune having a spring-Lock,
was as soon lock'd as shut; our Enemies admired that their advantage
was so soon turned to <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s; but <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who apprehended
they would immediately force so weak an impediment, conjured <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
to permit her to lead him down a back-stairs, which at least
would preserve his Life from the fury of those whom he had so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
incens'd, till the arrival of some of their Superiours, of whom
(as she said) she made no question to obtain it, when she implored it
with Tears. No Madam (said my Prince, sometimes reeling, sometimes
leaning on his Sword, and all his Cloaths dropping with blood) I can
but suffer Death by fighting against your Enemies, but I may deserve
it by avoiding them: Neither, Madam, shall you pay to <hi>Surena</hi> so
precious a ransom as your Tears, for a Life, which by your being in his
Power, is far better lost than sav'd: Do not (fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) deny
me the glory of dying at your feet, and for your defence; since 'tis the
highest and pleasing'st I can (by your present condition) now aspire
unto. My generous Prince spake these few words with as much trouble
as the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> heard them; who so abundantly deplored his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
by this fresh additional information, that she had lost the very
thought of hindring it; neither indeed could she have done it, for the
weak Door was instantly broken, and above a dozen armed Men came
to rob <hi>Artabbanes</hi> of a Life that he then was but too desirous to lose; yet
not to die unlike himself, recollecting that little strength he had left, he
cast himself on the nearest to him, and with his Ponyard (for he had
flung away his Sword, as a weapon his weakness rendered him unable to
use) with two or three stabs, deprived him of Life; but my Prince fell
with his Enemy, and all the rest taking that advantage, had doubtless
acted the revenge of their Companions, if the generous <hi>Parthenissa</hi> (by
flinging her self on <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s body) had not become his Armour,
and preserved him, when he was no longer able to preserve himself;
for as the gods would have it, <hi>Surena</hi> had given such universal and strict
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:96335:238"/>
order for their respecting of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> that his Soldiers could not be
more careful of her, than she had rendered it impossible (they being so)
that my Prince should receive any father harm; for she so covered his
Body with hers, that thereby she had rendered their Fates as insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as their affections; but one of <hi>Surena</hi>'s Soldiers more intent upon
revenge than obedience, threatned the Princess, that if any longer she
became his Sanctuary, she should be so far from hindering his Fate, that
she should share in it. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> with a disdainful look, told him,
What he said was rather an invitation to prosecute, than to desist from
what she had begun: And though so generous a reply should have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
created the barbarous Soldier's admiration than rage; yet it did
the latter: for he began so uncarefully to thrust at my Prince, that
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> had then no more hopes, but to dye with him. The fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Emilia</hi> moved with so horrid a proceeding, and with her Princesse's
skreeks, immediately, as if <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s Soul (which all this while
seemed to have abandoned his Body) were flown into hers, took up his
Sword, and guided by a divine influence, pass'd it through that Monster;
yet the thrust was not so mortal, but that he had strength enough left to
do more mischief, than if <hi>Parthenissa, Artabbanes,</hi> and <hi>Emilia</hi> had been
out of his power, he could have done in all the world besides; and
doubtless had effected it, if a Gentleman all covered with Arms and
Blood, had not come running into the Chamber, and made an end of
that Monster, who otherwise had made an end of Perfections, which
even in degrees equalled his Crimes. All those that were present, knew
him by his Armour to be <hi>Surena,</hi> and <hi>Parthenissa</hi> did so as soon as he
had lifted up his Helmet, which he did to let her know who 'twas, that
prostrate at her feet begged her Pardon for his Soldier's horrid insolency,
whose Sins he could not be thought guilty of, since he had so signally
punished them. <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who till then had esteemed <hi>Surena</hi>'s Passion
as great a misfortune, as he had the unsuccessfulness of it, now began to
hope that the gods would repair the injuries it had done her, by making
of it save a Life, which it had so often endangered; and the sooner to
try her power in so ambitioned an essay, she implored from <hi>Surena</hi> a
Life which she more apprehended was not in his power to grant, than
in his will. <hi>Surena</hi> with much humility protested, he was come to
receive her Commands, not her Intreaties; and to evidence he would
never decline any of them, he would not that; which by how much she
did appear concerned in it, by so much did the desert of his obedience
do so. The Princess having not only received his promise, but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of his Concession, ris from that Posture, which did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> from more wounds, than it did give <hi>Surena;</hi> which he
endeavoured to conceal, lest the greatness of his Merit, might have
made <hi>Parthenissa</hi> question the reality of it; so that with a Countenance
which rellish'd more of trouble for his Rival's present condition, than
that he was going to improve and mend it, leaving the Princess weeping
on her knees by <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s body, he ran and called his own Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
and in her hearing commanded him (the first thing he did) to
dress my Prince's wounds, and with the same care as if they had been
his: But alas, that order was suddenly changed by <hi>Surena</hi>'s perceiving
some blood dropping down <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Arm, which proceeded from a
slight hurt she had received in the shoulder, defending <hi>Artabbanes.</hi> Oh
gods! what did not <hi>Surena</hi> say, when he saw that precious blood spilt by
one which had been under his command! he caused that dead Traytor
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:96335:238"/>
immediately to be carried out, and hung in Chains in the Allarm-place;
and by presenting his Sword to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> implor'd, and gave her the
power to shed all his, as an expiation. But she (more concerned in
<hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s, than all things else) only enjoyed <hi>Surena</hi> the Penance,
That his Rivals wounds might be dress'd before hers; which she assured
him did not so much trouble her, as he seemed to be troubled at it:
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> could not have imposed a more severe Penance on <hi>Surena;</hi>
and doubtless he had not submitted to it, if it had been unaccompanied
with that assurance; besides, imagining she would not expose such
beauties to his sight, as were to be the reward of the Chyrurgeons Art,
he hastily caused his Rival to be dress'd in the Princesse's bed, which
he apologized for, by beseeching her to remove unto another Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
and out of so much blood and confusion. <hi>Pathenissa</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard his excuse, or desires; for the Chyrurgeons, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> strong Cordials, by stopping his blood, and by
binding up his wounds, made him by some deep groans testifie he
was not dead. Never was any of his Addresses or Professions so
pleasing to that fair Princess as were those groans; and never could
she have believed till then, that the gods themselves could have made
her take so much delight in <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s; whose recovery the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
assured her would be infinitely prejudiced (if not worse) if he
were, in so weak a condition, any way disturbed. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> therefore
begging, and obtaining from <hi>Surena,</hi> that her Appartment might be
the next to my Prince's, continued immoveable by him, expecting till
it were made ready, and till he should give some fresh and more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
testimonies, of a Life, she could not be more joyed to recover, than
if it were fled, she was resolved to follow.</p>

               <p>WHilst the Princess was bestowing her Care and Tears
on <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> the fair <hi>Emilia</hi> stole from her to do
the like on me, and found I was not far from the
place in which my strength had so injuriously aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
me: For <hi>Surena</hi>'s Soldiers by believing I had
lost my Life, took it not away, but contented themselves only with
dragging me from that place in which I had prove some little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to them. There 'twas that <hi>Emilia</hi> perceived me; and though
it were in so forlorn a condition, yet it was in as good a one as I could
have ambitioned, since it equalled my Prince's; for whom my concerns
were more transcendent, than for my Passion: <hi>Emilia</hi> by a faint beating
of my Heart, discovered some hopes of Life, at which she assumed as
sublime a satisfaction, as mine would have been, had I been capable of
seeing hers; which received no small accession by the accidental passing
by of one of her Father's Domesticks, whom she knew to be a Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
of as much Fidelity as Art, and who perhaps had derived his own
preservation, from the Enemies knowledg of the latter. To his care
the fair <hi>Emilia</hi> committed me; but in terms so pressing, that he found
my recovery no indifferent thing unto her. With both their helps I was
carried to a Chamber contiguous to hers; where, whilst those Cordials
I had received were operating, she returned to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who she
found in the continuance of a Charity as perfect, as either her that
conferred, or he that received it. She had longer engaged her self in
that employment, had not the Chyrurgeons protested to her it was a
fruitless one; and that as soon as ever <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was in a condition to
know, or receive the honour she did him, they would bring her advice
of it. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> having had a reiterated assurance of this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from those who had made it, immediately went to her Appartment,
which was joyning to my Prince's, and was waited on thither by <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena;</hi>
who more concerned in her Recovery, than her Company, to
evince that Truth, immediately retired himself into an out-Chamber,
from whence he sent in the Chyrurgeons to dress a Hurt, which
though slight to her that had received it, was almost mortal unto two
that had not. As soon as they had performed their Duty, <hi>Surena</hi> came
in to perform his, which he did in these terms: If, Madam, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:96335:239"/>
ness of the Crime of shedding your blood, does not sufficiently illustrate
I am innocent of it, I do protest before all the gods, that had I known
my unfortunate Flame should have had so unfortunate a way of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
you out of my Rival's Power, I had rather eternally have been
denyed that felicity, than purchased it at so criminal a rate: Yes, Madam,
my Respect, and my Passion know nothing superiour to them, but the
Beauty to which I pay the former, and which does inspire the latter;
whose perfections are such, that they necessitate me to things which
would be unpardonable, had they a lasser attraction; but my Sins have
so ample a one, that none (except you and your <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) but by
seeing the cause of them, will rather commend than excuse their effects.
I speak not this, Madam, to invite you by Reason to pardon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
performance; I had much rather receive mine from you, than
from your justice; that what invites your Mercy, may prove a more
transcendent blessing than your Mercy it self. I should be (said <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>) too unjust, did I esteem you guilty of a Crime which you
have so exemplarily punished; but I must tell you, had you been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
of all others, you could not have suspected your self guilty of
this, nor been necessitated to protestations, of whose reality you have
yet a more perswasive way to create my belief: For if (as your vows
would perswade me) your concerns are more for me than your self, you
may obligingly evince it, by restoring both <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and me to a
Freedom, which will make us much more yours, than your force has
done or can do; and create those resentments in me, which nothing but
such a performance is capable to inspire. Oh gods! (said <hi>Surena,</hi> lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Eyes to Heaven) you cannot (Madam) be henceforth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at my Passion, when in spight of your Modesty, you confess
you believe the power your perfections give you over me, to be infinite,
by making such a Motion: Alas, Madam, was it not enough that you
made me save my Rival's life, but that you must command me to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my self almost as miserable, as I make happy? For to give
away my hopes of the fair <hi>Partenissa,</hi> is almost to be curs'd as much,
as to possess her is to be bless'd. I tell you this, Madam, that you may
forgive my justifiable disobedience; nothing but such a command could
make me give it such a name: and I cannot but esteem my self excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
if having so truly profess'd an unimmitable passion for you, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
an obedience, which would but too fatally bring that truth in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
Do not, Madam, I beseech you, invite me to gain your favour,
by what will make me eternally lose the hopes of it; nor condemn a
disobedience, in which you may discover a Flame, greater than the
Sin which discloses it. If (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) I had that high opinion of
my self, that you would infer my request seems to import, I should not
then have made it: but the little invitation you have to continue an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd
Affection, both for the Choice and the Success, and the great
propensity you have to generous things, made me believe, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to you the latter, I might disswade you from the former; and in
one performance invite you to act both according to the Dictates of
Reason and Gallantry. The first of these, Madam (said <hi>Surena</hi>), I
cannot more indisputably do, than in continuing my adoration for the
fair <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> and the last it may be I have already done, in giving
a Life to her satisfaction, which has deprived me of any. But <hi>Surena,</hi>
Who took as little delight in these requests, as <hi>Parthenissa</hi> did in the
condition which rendered her making them necessary, immediately
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:96335:240"/>
withdrew himself; and he was searcely gone, when one of <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s
Chyrurgeons came running into her Chamber, to let her know, that
his Senses being restored, to indear his Patients preservation, he had
told him from whom, and how he derived it; but that had been so far
from producing the expected effect, that it had done the Contrary; for
immediately after the Information, he had imployed that little stregth
he had left, to the tearing off his Plaisters, and to the acting of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
that his Companions had been, and were necessitated to
hold his Arms by force, till he were run to implore her to do it, by her
commands. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> had hardly the leisure to hear so fatal an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
for her sudden running to my Prince's Chamber, whom
alas she still found violently held by the Chyrurgeons and their Servants.
Great gods! (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) what did not that fair Princess do at
so sad a spectacle! she could not see her generous Servant all pale and
bloody, and with looks as full of horror as his Thoughts, but she melted
into Tears; and kneeling by his Beds-side, she told him, Is <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
then become so odious to <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> that rathen than not become her
Murtherer, he will become his own? Have the gods been so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
your Preservers, to make you become as miraculously your own
Destroyer? Have I endangered my life to save yours, and is this the
return you make me? Are we not miserable enough by our Destinies, but
we must make our selves more by our Despair? Cruel <hi>Artabbanes!</hi> if Death
only can give us ease, was there ever any such disproportion in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as should induce you now to believe a disproportionate Fate shall
create a resembling satisfaction? Or do you detest my Constancy, that you
take so sudden and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atal a Course to avoid beholding it? Great gods! (she
continued, raising her voice and her hands) if already my afflictions
have not evidenced my fidelity, give me Tryals of it as great as it self;
and let the residue of my Life be spent in such sufferings as may manifest
that immutability, which it seems my past ones could not. My Prince
(said <hi>Symander</hi>) more wounded with these words, than he was with his
Enemies Swords, having first obtain'd from <hi>Parthenissa</hi> that she would
sit upon his Bed, with as many sighs as words, told her, It is time, my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
it is now time, if it had not been before, to act what you are come to
interrupt; Can I live but in a higher Crime than to become my own
Murtherer, after you interpret a production of my Flame and Care, to
be one of my hatred and jealousie? Alas, those are both equal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
Sins; That I can hate the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> is so egregious a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
that but to name, is to confute it; and to doubt her Constancy,
is to doubt what by a sad and happy experiment I have found is as
transcendent in perfection, as to suspect it is the contrary in an opposite
extream. No Madam, what I was doing, proceeded absolutely from my
love to my Princess, and from my knowledg of her Constancy: The
first of these made me esteem it both just and rational to set a period to
an unfortunate Life, which experimentally I found had hitherto rendered
hers so; and the last, made me esteem it as just and rational, since her
Constancy (by what she had so often and so recently performed) would
confine her to a Fate, which the gods had confined to eternal misfortunes,
to cut off the cause of their Cruelty, and leave them thereby as little
excuse for the continuation of it, as while she so infinitely misplaces the
blessing of her affection, she affords them too much. In brief, Madam,
I was prectising but what you approved in <hi>Surena;</hi> for I was but taking
away a Life, that had indanger'd yours, which is so great a Duty, that
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:96335:240"/>
without a proportionate Injustice you cannot hinder it. Are you then
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> (the Princess replyed) so ignorant of my affection, as to
believe I can survive the object of it? the gods by what they do, but
indanger our Lives; but you by what you design, will inevitably end
them; can an evincement that I love you more, induce you to love me,
and your self the less? We are not miserable enough to despair, when we
can make our selves more so; and what you so fatally design, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
do it: The gods, as they have hitherto tryed our Constancies, will
in the future reward them, if what you intend prevent it not: Do not
therefore, my <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> doubly injure them, by doubting of their
Mercy, and by hindering them to act it; I do not tell you this, that I
decline bearing you company; no, I am ready to do it: By killing your
self, you cannot more certainly go before me to another life, than I will
the same moment follow you; neither can you suspect, that she who has
been your Companion in the sufferings of Virtue, will decline being so
when you go to receive the reward of it. I should never finish my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
(said <hi>Symander</hi>) did I particularize all their discourses: I will
therefore only tell you their, result, which was, That after many reasons,
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s prevailed; but then my Prince's retributions had almost
proved as fatal as his Despair: for forcing himself to make them in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
fitting their condition, not his, a great wound he had received in
the side, unfortunately opened, out of which there issued such a flux of
blood, that the Chyrurgeons could not be more troubled at it, than they
were to stop it; and one of the remedies they prescribed for that end,
was, that <hi>Parthenissa</hi> should leave the Chamber; which she obeyed after
she had received many reiterated protestations, that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> did leave
off all violent designs against his own Life, and consequently against
hers. I will not (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) any longer usurp upon your
patiences, which I fear my just concerns in every particular action of
my Prince's, has already made me do too much: you shall therefore
only know, that my wounds by the fair <hi>Emilia</hi>'s care, were recovered
before my Princes, wherby I was freed (by being enabled to wait on
him) from a greater trouble than they themselves had been. <hi>Surena</hi> not
only knew what belonged to a Gentleman, but practised it by a constant
visiting of <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and by demonstrating as much care in his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
as if it had been to have restored him to hopes, and not to have
deprived him of them. And truly, except his Crimes in love, I never
knew him guilty of any, nor never act what was unworthy the noble
Title of <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s Brother; but in his Flame, he was as criminal as
unsuccessful, though his Partizans alledged, that only therein being so,
it was not his Nature, but Passion which offended. During my Prince's
danger, <hi>Surena</hi> permitted <hi>Parthenissa</hi> unrestrainedly to visit him, either
out of Civility, or Revenge; the first, that he might be denyed nothing
conducive to his health; and the last, that she might see that he wanted
it; but as soon as that was restored, he lost a conversation which made
him think it a misfortune; but this was so handsomly carried, that it was
only in <hi>Surena</hi>'s absence, who went to the Frontiers to receive his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his Army; and perhaps he elected that course to induce <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>
to with for his return; as also in his absence to hinder an union
which had so narrowly been interrupted. The fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> and I, were
the constant Ambassadors between the generous Lovers, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
example of their Passion, learned to form our own. <hi>Surena</hi> having
met <hi>Vixores,</hi> sent him and his Forces to joyn with <hi>Merinzor;</hi> but being
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:96335:241"/>
himself more concerned in Love, than Glory, returned to <hi>Arsacia,</hi>
where he received the intelligence, that <hi>Tygranes</hi> (before sillaces and
<hi>Zenophon</hi> were joyned with him) being impatient at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rinzor</hi>'s, in
some manner besieging him, had put his Fate to a Battel which he had
lost, and with exceeding difficulty recovered the walls of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>batan,</hi>
under which it had been fought; that when the king was reduced to the
last extremity, the <hi>Parthian</hi> Ambassador, with 5000 of <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s Army,
had forced the Guards of the Camp, and flung himself into the City,
which he despaired not to defend, till <hi>Zenophon,</hi> who with the residue
of his Army was retreated to <hi>Crisapolis,</hi> could so recruit it, as to bring
the Destinie of <hi>Media</hi> to a second Field. <hi>Surena</hi> acquainted the Princess
with this intelligence; but so unconcernedly, as if the dissatisfaction it
brought her, suppress'd the contentment it afforded him. But as soon
as <hi>Parthenissa</hi> had desired the permission of visiting <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> which
during his absence had been denyed her, he not only waited on her to
his Chamber, but sent for the Governour thither, whom he reprehended
for his incivility, and punished also, by discharing him from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Arsacia,</hi> which made many believe, their separation had
been his fault, not <hi>Surena</hi>'s; though at least as many concluded, <hi>Surena</hi>
practised the common Art among Princes, of disgracing Servants for
committing of obliging (and sometimes commanded) offences. That
too, which almost turn'd this belief into a certainty, was, that he was
sent to a command, which was rather a Preferment than a Punishment;
and <hi>Surena</hi> never permitted the Lovers to converse but in his presence;
yet so artificially, that none which had not been exceedingly concerned
in it, could have taken notice of it. One Evening, when <hi>Surena</hi> was
in <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber, there came into it a Gentleman of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s,
who presented him a Letter from his Prince, which he read with often
starting, and change of colour, and which he had not sooner perused,
then he presented it to <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s who found in it these words:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Merinzor to the generous Surena.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Rival in Love and Empire must die, both for your security and
mine; and that you may enjoy with felicity what I shall with Envy,
I have given one the charge of his Execution, who you shall not be acquainted
with, but after he has done you an obligation you have hitherto declined
conferring on your self, though I am confident you disrelished nothing in
the performance, but that you were to act it.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>As soon as the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> had received this fatal Letter, he that
brought it, and was the Person mentioned in it, went out of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
into <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s, whom he found all alone, and in so deep a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
that he was almost desiring that Death the other was come to
give him: My Prince, who thought him some Gentleman sent from
<hi>Surena</hi> to visit him, ris from the place he sat on, and went to salute him;
but the other first locking the Door, drew his Sword, and having told
him he was come to revenge his Brother's Death, or to follow him, ran
with it at <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who by the resemblance this Traytor had to him
he had killed in <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber, concluded, and that truly, 'twas
him he meant. But this as unexpected as dangerous an adventure, which
would have disturbed a less Resolution than my generous Master's, raised
his; for stepping two or three paces back, he put by as many thrusts, and
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:96335:241"/>
snatching up the Chair he had sat on, made use of that as a shield; the
noise which this scuffle made was so great, that it was easily heard in
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber, which was contiguous to my Prince's; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
that he which had brought the Letter was gone out of it, and
suspecting the noise she heard proceeded from the cause it did, and which
she so much apprehended; immediately with the wings of Fear and Love,
she flew towards the scene where this Tragedy was acting, and <hi>Suren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
after her; but finding the Door lock'd, the Princess cry'd out, Will you
then, <hi>Surena,</hi> permit <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to be murthered? You shall derive no
advantage from it: for I attest those gods (who cannot be so, if they
punish not this Sin) Whatever by my <hi>Artabbnes</hi>'s fate, I will make it
mine. <hi>Surena</hi> heard not these words, for he was then running against the
Door, which he did so violently and successfully, that he broke it open,
just as <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was so tyred with his unwieldy shield, that his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was giving his Enemy an advantage, which his courage would never
have conferred on him. <hi>Surena</hi> with his naked Sword, and by a great
Cry, made the Traytor turn about; who finding by his new Adversarie's
Posture, his Design, resolved to prevent it, and by a furious thrust, pass'd
his Sword through <hi>Surena</hi>'s body; but not ossending any of the noble parts,
he had strength enough left, not only to interpose himself between <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
(who was fallen down) and his Enemy; but by a happy thrust, to
deprive the latter of his Life. I cannot (said <hi>Symander</hi>) sufficiently
exalt this generous performance; for it was as much above description as
expectation, and almost equally divided <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Tears and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between the generous Rivals, who both by their wounds lay weltering
in a sea of blood at her feet: But the Princess, who feared there might
be more in the Conspiracy, believing she might defer her Gratitude to
act her Care, and thought the latter somewhat express'd the former, ran
out to call for assistance: The first she met was <hi>Emilia</hi> and I, who had
been walking in the Palace-Galleries, in a conversation almost as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
as the action she told us of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, was generous. <hi>Emilia</hi> instantly
ran to call the Chyrurgeons, and the Princess and I, to see what we could
do in their absence; we found <hi>Surena</hi> in a deep swound, and my Prince
on his knees by him, neglecting his own danger, and stopping with his
hand the orifice of that wound which had cast his Rival into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and which had hindered my Prince from being in no worse a
one: Doubtless this Gallantry was the more so, by being conferred on
one insensible of it, and who could hardly repine at his being in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a condition, since it evidenced how precious his Life was to the
most accomplish'd of Men. <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> in expectation of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
arrival, tore all the Linnen she wore, and had the strength to
tear, with which she somewhat stop'd the generous Rivals bleeding, in
a confidence, that what was <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s design, could not be his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
neither indeed was it: for the first thing for which she had his retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
was, for her Care of <hi>Surena;</hi> who suddenly after <hi>Emilia</hi>'s and
the Chyrurgeons coming, was carried on <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s bed, who would
not permit his own wounds to be touched till <hi>Surena</hi>'s were dress'd; and
then having more strength than he, by the help of some Servants, he
exchanged their Appartments. <hi>Surena</hi> (as I have said) having none of
his vitals offended, gave his Chyrurgeons no other trouble than to stop
an internal bleeding, who being perfect in their Art, they successfully
did it: 'Twas then they acquainted him with my Prince's care in stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his wound; and protested to him, 'twas from thence he derived
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:96335:242"/>
his Life; and that if <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s ran any hazard of his own, it would
proceed from his not having done that to himself, which he had done to
him. <hi>Surena</hi> magnified my Prince's gallantry in such pressing terms,
that all those which heard him were convinced, 'twas as much his Truth,
as his Civility which spake; and having learn'd he had resigned his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
to him, he was almost as much troubled at it, as at the cause of
it; and sent to implore his pardon for a fault, he had permitted, and not
acted. Neither did <hi>Surena</hi>'s care extend to the formal, but even to the
essential parts of it: for out of an apprehension, <hi>Merinzor</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what he had but attempted, he commanded his Guard of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Partizans, to become my Prince's, and each of them to answer his
Life with their own. It is almost impossible (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) to
tell you how equally <hi>Parthenissa</hi> divided her visits, and how proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
gratitude and affection governed her; but it is absolutely so, to
express with how much satisfaction <hi>Artabbanes</hi> observed it, and perhaps
as much so, for any which knew him not, to believe it. Some three or
four days after this accident, <hi>Parthenissa</hi> (as she usually did) went to
visit <hi>Surena,</hi> who the Physicians protested might then speak to her with
less prejudice than his silence would bring him. 'Twas then after some
other usual Civilities, and that <hi>Parthenissa</hi> began to deplore his condition,
that he told her, The gods (Madam) which knew how fit it was you
should know that transcendency of my Passion, and how unsit it was you
should know it by that fatal way in which you desired to be convinced
of it, have (I hope) so demonstrated that Truth, that you can no longer
doubt it; which consequently I shall never deplore, since 'twas a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
I would not only have purchased with the hazard of my Life,
but even with the loss of it, had not that loss carried with it a greater;
and knowing, Madam, that you are perfect in all your attributes, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt, but the highest Passion may aspire to the highest reward; and
that mine is so, cannot be a greater certainty, than your not believing it
so, is an injustice. <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who expected reproaches instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
listen'd to the latter with satisfaction; and indeed it was the less
troublesome of the two; for it is so, to have requests made, than to
make them: Her criminal suspitions of <hi>Surena</hi>'s being accessary to, or
at least permitting <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s intended Murther, merited a higher
penance than she then suffered; and concluding it better not to discover
her offence, than to obtain a forgiveness for it, she elected the first of
these, and therefore only answered him, That the generous <hi>Surena</hi> has
as infinitely obliged me, as he has his Rival, cannot be a more indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Truth, than that the strange way in which he has preserv'd <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
for <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> is an evidence how much the gods are concerned
in his being so preserved; so that there wants in the obligation to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it perfect, but that you will make the same construction of the same
performance. Oh gods (said <hi>Surena</hi>)! it is high time to despair, when
even those very arguments which evince the height and pureness of my
flame, are perverted to inferences that I should extinguish it, or resign
my hopes to him that has not so legitimate ones. <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by this reply, that she had touched him in a place he was more
sensible of, than of his wounds, began in her subsequent discourses to
give him her resolutions in such terms, that though <hi>Surena</hi> evidently
read her intentions, yet he could hardly quarrel at those expressions
which acquainted him with them. Whilst affairs were in this condition
in <hi>Arsacia,</hi> those in <hi>Ecbatan</hi> were strangely altered, since <hi>Syllaces</hi> had
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:96335:242"/>
cast himself into it; that generous Prince by his Courage and Conducts,
so raised the Defendant's resolution, that their Fears of preserving the
place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were much less than <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s of not obtaining it; neither was
this the only production of his virtue; for by the unintermitted and
visible effects of it, he had won such an Ascendent over the King of
<hi>Media</hi>'s inclinations, that neither the affection he had given <hi>Merinzor,</hi>
nor the present hatred he payed him, could in degrees either equal the
esteem or Friendship he had so justly contracted for my Prince's Friend;
who so well improved this acquisition, that he had no ungrounded hopes
to render <hi>Artabbanes</hi> at least an equal sharer in this good fortune. And
though <hi>Merinzor,</hi> who had learn'd from whence so successful a resistance
proceeded, did alledge, That <hi>Sillaces</hi> by taking up Arms, had violated
and infringed the duty of an Ambassador; yet it hindered not <hi>Sillaces</hi>
from proceeding in what he had so far advanced, but induced him to
offer <hi>Merinzor</hi> the Combat for the clearing this aspersion; which he
declining, his allegation was answered by a large Manifest; whose effect
was, That being imployed from his King to negotiate a League for the
mutual destruction of their Rebels, he did nothing against his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or Employment, if he contributed to what he came to treat of. But
at length, all the joy of his frequent successes were extinguished in
the fatal news of <hi>Surena</hi>'s surprizing <hi>Arsacia,</hi> which was brought him by
a Spy he had sent into the Enemies Camp, who only could assure him
of that misfortune, but not of any particulars which succeeded it: <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi>
to make his Enemies wear his Livery, by <hi>Tygranes</hi> consent, drew
out all the Forces of <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> but those which were upon the Guard,
and in the dead of Night, made so furious an attempt on <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s
Camp, that he sent some Thousands to sleep eternally, and doubtless
might have raised the Siege, with the Garison, had not an unfortunate
Dart given him so dangerous a wound, that his Soldiers converted their
care of victory into one for him; and the former he himself had so far
advanced, that the latter, forasmuch as concerned his bringing off, was
not difficult; he was met at the Gate by the King, who gave to the
Danger of his Protector, as many Tears as to his own, by so fatal a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation.
<hi>Sillaces,</hi> who (as well as his Physician) thought himself in
the state of Death, desired that his Chamber might be emptied of all
but <hi>Tygranes,</hi> of whom he implored, That he would confer that high
affection he had honoured him with, on <hi>Artabbanes</hi> (if living) and
<hi>Lyndadory;</hi> for whose resentments, fidelity, and esteem of it, he would
give his dying breath for security; and that if he might receive an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this Concession, he should leave the World with as much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as the leaving it in so ill a conjuncture for his affairs, would
permit. <hi>Tygranes,</hi> whom adversity had set into the ways of Virtue by
the dictates of it, and by being sensibly touched by the last request of
so generous and dying Friend, first granted it by Tears, and then by
Protestations; which gave <hi>Sillaces</hi> a satisfaction his present condition
seemed to be uncapable of: But the gods had reduced him to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
but in order to their acting a double Miracle, that of restoring
him to Life, and <hi>Moneses</hi>'s blood to <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s favour and good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
I cannot tell whether the joy of that grant contributed to
or acted the former; but I am certain from the Minute he received it,
as if the body had participated in the satisfaction of the Mind, it began
to amend; but yet so slowly, that <hi>Tygranes</hi> had but too many experienees,
that his success, under the gods, was derived from the generous <hi>Sillaces:</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:96335:243"/>
Neither was the good Fortune of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s without some Clouds: for
as he computed the business, he apprehended before he could reduce
<hi>Ecbatan</hi> to his Power, either <hi>Syllaces</hi> recovery, or <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s increasing
Army, would cast him into the same despair which that generous Prince's
performances had involv'd him in already; but when to these appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
the intelligence was brought him, that not only his design on
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> was destroy'd, but that it was so too, by <hi>Suren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as much troubl'd at the manner, as at the thing; but yet at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of <hi>Vixores,</hi> and the <hi>Parthian</hi> Forces, he began to hope, 'twas out
of too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>much affection for <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and not of too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>little for him, that
he had saved my Prince; and therefore 'twas, he determin'd no longer
to delay an execution which <hi>Surena</hi> could not well suspend without
wronging as much his Ambition, as his own Love. But whilst <hi>Merinzor</hi>
was employing himself to obtain his designs, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Surena</hi> did
their Healths, and <hi>Emilia</hi> by a seeming spy to the last of them, but a real
one to her Father, had learn'd that <hi>Cloriman</hi> had only taken those two
days respite for the sending for a faithful Priest, but to purchase so much
time for his unripe Treachery. But (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) to hasten my
relation, I will no more replenish it with any things but those so essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that you shall be convinc'd, I am as much concern'd in the speedy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
it, as my hearers can be. It was but half a Moon, after the Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
recoveries, that one day walking in the Palace-Gardens, a Captain
of the Guards presented <hi>Surena</hi> with a Packet, which the better to read,
leaving <hi>Parthenissa</hi> with my Prince, he retir'd himself into another Walk,
where opening the Letters, he found the first was directed to him from
<hi>Merinzor,</hi> and contained these words:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Merinzor to the Prince Surena.</head>
                     <p>WEre not that esteem I pay you, built on a very firm foundation,
by having so preserv'd one Enemy, you might have rais'd your
self another, and it may be as dangerous a one as him you protected:
Neither could I but conclude, if I consulted with reason, not friendship,
that I have a very considerable share in yours, since to confer on me the
highest disobligation you are capable of, you use your self at that rate.
Do not, I conjure you, break with your Friend, to preserve your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
nor evidence how little I may expect from you, when to the obliging
me, I only desire you to sit still, and cannot obtain it: I have sent those
who will infallibly secure and revenge us, if by way of reparation, for
having hitherto hinder'd it, you do not undertake it your self; I hope
you will not by neither acting, nor permitting this, give me so much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be your Enemy, that I must find a Misfortune in the too-much
justice of becoming so.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surena</hi> having read this high Letter, open'd the other, and though
it were without address or name, yet by some private mark he was not
ignorant that it came from <hi>Merinzor's</hi> Secretary, whom he had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
both by large Gifts and hopes; it contained these words:</p>
               <p>YOu can no longer have <hi>Merinzor,</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> your Friends: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed can you undertake to defend the latter from death, but
you will more than hazard participating in his Fate by endeavouring
to hinder it; for there are so many engaged in the Design, that your
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:96335:243"/>
desire of preventing it cannot be greater, than the impossibility: believe
it Sir, as a certain truth, that the first attempt you make for your Rivals
defence, will be your last; and that he which is <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Enemy, and
he which endeavours to hinder his destruction, will be consider'd under
one netion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parthenissa</hi> and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> (who concluded by <hi>Surena</hi>'s leaving them
alone, that what invited him to so unusual an action, had an unusual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)
did not walk away from the place he had left them in, but from
thence had fixtly consider'd his actions, and gestures, as things in which
they might discover his thoughts, which they found were very perplex'd:
for having ended his two Letters, he walk'd three or four turns, then
read them over again; and after the third time he had done the same,
pulling down his Hat over his Eyes, and folding his Arms one within
the other, he conntinu'd with as little outward disquiet, as the inward
was great. At length, after an hour so spent, he came again to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and his Rival, and to the first of them presented his Letters, telling
her withal, by whom the last was written, and that he had sent it in his
Prince's Packet, as the least hazardous conveyance. <hi>Parthenissa</hi> whilst
she was reading, both in her looks and gesture, exprest no small disorder;
and <hi>Surena</hi> as soon as she had ended, having receiv'd his Papers, saluted
her with as much humility as sadness; and then went to the Garden door,
where his Guards expected him, and where he commanded their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
immediately to seize upon <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> to carry him close prisoner
to the Castle, and to keep him there in that quality, 'till he received
further orders. <hi>Surena</hi> having given him these Commands, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the Cittadel, whither he remov'd his lodgings, and from
whence he sent two hundred Soldiers to guard the Place, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
none either to enter into it, or to come out of it, without a Pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand. The Captain who had receiv'd direction make <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabbanes</hi>
his Prisoner, being a <hi>Parthian,</hi> and consequently reverencing
the high blood of the <hi>Arsacides,</hi> came even in tears to do his duty, and
protested, he had much rather have lost his own Liberty, than become
the Instrument of depriving my Prince of his; who judging by <hi>Surena</hi>'s
abrupt departure, and by those of the Guards coming towards him, what
their intentions were, went to his weeping Princess, and implor'd her
to support her Faith on the many precedent deliverances the gods had
sent him; that <hi>Surena</hi> had so dearly purchas'd her esteem, and so justly
valu'd it, that it was improbable he would by any Criminal performance
destroy what was so long a perfecting; especially since his fall herein,
would be like a Statesmans, which admits not of a second. He saw in
his Looks a reluctancy to his action; and that he was too much a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to be guided by considerations opposite to reason and honour; or
for the satisfaction of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s hopes, to ruin his own. <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
had further enlarg'd himself in consolations of this quality, had he not
perceiv'd, that already <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s colour began to abandon her, as her
senses did suddenly after; and by falling in his Arms seem'd to tell him,
she expected no consolation but from Death: my Prince, that had given
her hopes for his own condition, could give himself none for hers, which
lasted not long in that extream: for by that time that he, <hi>Emilia</hi> and I,
had carri'd her in our Arms to those Stairs which lead to her Appartment,
her breath, but not her words, were come to her again, so that <hi>Artabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
by pressing, and kissing her hands, took, as we all thought, an eternal
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:96335:244"/>
leave; and in whispers conjur'd <hi>Emilia</hi> to hinder her Princess's despair,
from making her the sharer of his Fate, as she had but too much been of
his Misfortunes. <hi>Emilia</hi> neither answer'd, nor indeed heard his request,
for all the faculties of her Soul had resign'd themselves to grief: My
Prince having spoke those few words, with a languishing look took a
second farewel from his Princess (who by being then insensible, was more
happy than if she had been otherwise), and going to the Guard, return'd
them thanks for their Civility, and desir'd them to do their Duty. The
Captain mov'd with so sad a separation, told him, Would to the gods, Sir,
I durst; for then I should carry you to Liberty, not to Prison. Whilst
this little discourse past between them, I had represented to <hi>Emilia,</hi> that
'twas fit I should wait on my Prince; and had obtain'd not only her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
but commands to do it. 'Twas therefore that I came to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and desir'd his leave for it; which he more readily granted, than
my Prince, and accompani'd his Civility with this Protestation, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which could be condusive to <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s satisfaction, and which
was not positively forbidden him, but should still find the same return.
By this time we were come to the Garden-Gate, where we found a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
ready, into which my Prince made me follow him; the same Officers,
and the same Guard, brought us to the Castle, which is a place as impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
as Art and Nature can render any; the Appartment allotted for
my generous Master was very large and magnificent, to supply his being
deny'd the liberty of the Gardens; and finding he was to be a close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
he commanded me to get a Pallate, and to lie in his Chamber;
where he resign'd himself to so transcendent a grief, that I knew by the
greatness of it, 'twas not for himself, but <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who <hi>Emilia</hi> told
me afterwards, had assum'd a proportionate sorrow, both for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and the cause. My Prince found nothing in his Imprisonment, no not
the very end in order to which it was, so intollerable, as the being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
the sending to, and hearing from his Princess; who as soon as she
had learn'd, she was under a resembling misfortune, concluded <hi>Surena</hi>'s
design was exceeding criminal, since rather than permit her to know his
actions, he elected to give an exact Lover the fears such a relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
inspires, and thereby contracted a worse opinion of him, than
his very worst performance could almost create. Ten days after <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>'s
Imprisonment, (during which time, he never saw or spake with
any, except the Captain of the Guards and me) finding so long a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
as bad as execution, he earnestly conjur'd him to learn what <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>'s
intentions were, and if possibly, what his usage was to <hi>Parthenissa.</hi>
The Captain promised to endeavour both; and about four hours after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
but with a Countenance that spake his intelligence, before his
words did; which acquainted my Prince, That for the last of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
so strict a watch was kept in the Palace, that thereby all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
therein had been fruitless; but as to the first of them, he came
into <hi>Surena</hi>'s Chamber, when some of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Partizans were dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with him, not whether you should be put to Death, but of the way
of it; he alledging, that in regard of your quality, especially in <hi>Media,</hi>
you ought to have so much respect, as not to be a publick Spectacle on
an infamous Scaffold; and that to execute you in your Chamber, would
be of as much advantage, less scandalous, and more secure; for (the
Captain continu'd) the Inhabitants of this City are so great Reverencers
of either the <hi>Arsacian</hi> blood, or of <hi>Moneses's</hi> Family, that <hi>Surena</hi> has
sent for a thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse out of his Brothers Army, to keep
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:96335:244"/>
                  <hi>Arsacia</hi> from Tumults, which he apprehends it will fall into, let the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
be never so private; on the other side <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s servants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that since you were the first Prince of the Blood, the execution
ought to be publick, that the <hi>Medians</hi> might be convinc'd of the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of your Death, and thereby cut off their hopes, with your Life: for
it has been no unusual thing from the obscure Death of Princes, to set up
Counterfeits, which have prov'd as dangerous as the real ones could;
that it would look rather like a Murther, than an execution, were it
done in private; and that by so covert a proceeding, it might give the
<hi>Arsacians</hi> an opinion we want either Justice, or Power; the former will
make them believe 'tis honest to relieve him, and the latter, that it is
safe. Though (said the Captain) I heard the debate, yet I was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to withdraw when they were to form the result; but yet I learn'd
that whatever it were, it would not be put in execution 'till the arrival
of the thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse, who are hourly expected. Any (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
<hi>Symander</hi>) that had heard this Relation, would have thought he
that made it had spoken of himself, not of my Prince, who found more
satisfaction in learning his destiny, than trouble in learning 'twas so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
a one; and doubtless, had not his just apprehensions of the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>'s
despair, or at least excessive grief, ty'd his hands, he had by
one generous stroke, exempted himself from the infamy of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing on a
Scaffold, or composing a publick Trophy for his Enemies: but that
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> might be convinc'd his Life was dear to him, since it was to
her, he determin'd, if it were his fortune to be put to Death, not to act
it himself, that she might not condemn, but deplore his Fall. To the
Captain he gave such eloquent and admirable consolations, that he went
away full of satisfaction, but I cannot say whether it proceeded from an
assurance he thereby received of his going into a better world, or that
the brightness of his virtues render'd him any longer unfit for this. We
had not been two hours alone, which we heard all the Streets of <hi>Arsacia</hi>
eccho with Trumpets, which we knew proceeded from the arrival of
the <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse, who were immediately distributed into several ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Posts in the City, the better to suppress all disorders. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabbanes</hi>
was advertis'd of this by his former Intelligencer, who told him
withal, that a Scaffold was erected before the Palace-window; and though
some said it was for his execution, and that <hi>Parthenissa</hi> might be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, yet he had been assur'd in private, the execution should not
be so, and that the Scaffold being rais'd there, was but the more, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to delude the people; and that <hi>Surena</hi>'s opinion of doing the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
obscurely, had at length been assented to. My Prince was a little
surpriz'd at the first part of this intelligence, not upon his own score,
but on his Princess's, whose grief and despair he apprehended would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no little accession, by becoming a Witness, or a hearer of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
neither could he in so sad an exigent have told how to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
himself; for if he had di'd without emotions, as on the one side
it had eclips'd his Enemies revenge, so on the other it had done the same
to the evincement of his resentments for so sad and fatal a deprivation:
and should he manifest the latter, he could not but have contributed to
a satisfaction, the greatness of which would have proportionately crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his own trouble; but the Captain's assurance was so probable, that
he believ'd it: for though he esteem'd <hi>Surena</hi> would be vindicative, yet
he could not think he would be barbarously so. The Commander of the
Guards knowing how little Time <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had left, thought it unfit by
*
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:96335:245"/>his Company, to rob him of any part of it, and therefore withdrew
himself, but he made me a sign to follow him into the next room,
which I did; where he told me, that for certain the following Night
was destin'd for my Prince's Death, and that he had declin'd acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him with it himself, as believing it an information fitter for my
discovering; I had only words enough to thank his care, for my grief
stifl'd the rest in the very birth. My generous Master at my return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chamber, knew some new Misfortune was come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and constrain'd me, though in as many sighs, as words, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with it, which I did; and which I had no sooner done, than
he only told me, I had obligingly deluded him; since by the excess of
my sorrow, he thought I had assum'd it for some fresh danger of the
Princess's. Whilst things were in this posture in the Castle, those in the
Palace were in as sad a one; for <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s ignorance of my Prince's
condition was more deplorable to her, than the knowledg of it was to
him: she expected every minute the Messenger of her Death in the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of his; and her affection was so high, and perfect, that it needed
not the help of her resolution, to follow his fate; and though <hi>Emilia</hi>
gave her very pregnant consolations, yet they were too weak for so
strong a Melancholy, which necessitated her to keep her Bed, whereby
she was ignorant of that fatal Theater which was erecting within sight
of her Window, out of which <hi>Emilia</hi> unfortunately looking, discover'd
it, and in the consequences that sight inspir'd her with, she sell into a
fainting; the noise of her fall made the Princess look what was the cause
of it, which when she had discover'd, she call'd some of the Servants to
her assistance, which proved so effectual, that it gave her strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to tell <hi>Parthenissa</hi> what depriv'd her absolutely of hers. <hi>Emilia</hi>
soon repented what she had said, and had much more cause to do so,
when after an hours trial of her prescriptions for ending a swound, she
found them all fruitless. But Nature at length did what Art could not:
and the first sign the Princess gave of her recovery, was a sign of her
affection to my Prince, of whose condition she pressingly askt the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
hearers; their silence was not ascrib'd to that cause, but to a more
dangerous one, out of which faith <hi>Emilia</hi> remov'd her, by protesting
they knew nothing of what she demanded, neither of the cause of ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Scaffold, which none of those were about it could tell; and
therein she spoke the truth, for though she often askt out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
for what end those Men were set a work, yet she could never lear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> in the mean time had taken me into a Closet contiguous
to his Chamber, whereby the pressingest conjurations he was capable of,
he enjoin'd me not to give him so pregnant an evincement of my disa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to him, as to deplore his going to a better place. That I would
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cern'dly endeavour to console the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> for the like grief,
on the same cause; and that whilst she would do me the honour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
me near her person, that I would not decline it. 'Twas only in
Tears that I answer'd these impossible commands: and if he thought I
promis'd to observe them, he deriv'd that belief from my silence, not
me. The hour of rest being come, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> laid himself down on
his Bed with as little disorder, as if he had been as near his ordinary, as
eternal sleep; only the fair name of <hi>Parthenissa</hi> stole sometimes out of
his mouth, but never unaccompani'd with some sighs, to demonstrate
for whom he breath'd them: Oh gods! (said <hi>Symander</hi>) it were almost
as hard to describe the fears I was in that fatal Night, as to believe how
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:96335:245"/>
free my Prince was from any; who about the dawn of day was awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
by the noise of some who open'd the doors; and guessing at their
design by what I had acquainted him with, he rose up and told me,
Come <hi>Symander</hi> we must part; but this one Testimony of my Enemies
power and malice will eternally free me from resenting another; let the
rememberance of so high an advantage extinguish all repinings the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of it may inspire: Do me too, I conjure thee, this last obligation,
as to tell my Princess, I di'd with <hi>Parthenissa</hi> in my Mouth; and that
my breath expir'd in repeating the fair name of her, for whom only I
drew it. These words were hardly spoken, when <hi>Surena</hi> (waited on by
some of his Guards) came into the Chamber, whom he commanded out
again, and then came to my Prince and told him: <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
I have twice receiv'd my Life at your hands; the first, when
you had taken from me the Victory; and the second, when you had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from me what I valu'd a thousand times more; and though some
have represented to me, that the former proceeded from your Revenge,
and the latter from your Ignorance; yet I hold it fit to make my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
the giving you both your Life and Liberty: I am confin'd
unto this, if that information be true, by the dictates of virtue; and if
false, by those of gratitude. I know you are not only my Rival, but
even successfully so; and I know how vast a prejudice this will bring
both to my passion, and my affairs. I tell you thus much, that you may
be convinc'd I am not ignorant of what I do: and I tell you no more,
lest I might lessen the merit of the action, by repeating it. Great gods!
(continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) you only know my joy at so unheard-of a Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and you do consequently know, that it was greater than his on
whom it was confer'd. The time, and the strangeness of the thing, made
me suspect I did dream; but it was so pleasing a one, that I apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the doing of any thing which might tell me whether I did so, or no;
I esteem'd it too great to be real, yet was loth to interrupt what gave
me more satisfaction than ever any receiv'd in that which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of dreams. You will pardon (said the faithful Servant to <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasdes</hi>
and <hi>Callimmachus</hi>) my transports, when you remember what
gives them a being; but not to need your pardon a second time, I will
break off what I hope has made me as much deserve, as need it. <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
as soon as <hi>Surena</hi> had done speaking, with a look which seem'd
to be as much pleas'd with the manner of the obligation, as with the
obligation it self, told his Rival, <hi>Surena</hi> is too generous to give me my
Life and Liberty, thereby to confine me from employing either in a
service, for which only they are considerable to me; if that were to
be my Ransome, 'twere such a one as I would never pay: for 'tis a
more pleasing fate to die for the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> than to purchase my
Life at the rate of being ty'd from serving her. I speak this (said my
Prince) not that I have so low an opinion of <hi>Surena,</hi> as to believe he
is capable of selling a generous performance at any price; or that he
could think I would buy it so; but only that those who hereafter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
from whom I derive my Life and Liberty, and how I
employ them, may not condemn my so doing, since I declare when I
am in your power, what I intend when I am out of it. 'Tis no ill pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to acquaint you, I can make you none, since thereby I publish
the belief I have of your virtue, whose highest operation is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
obligations not only where there is no hopes of a return, but even
where there is a certainty of none; my condition makes me more
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:96335:246"/>
grateful, than any other way my fancy could, and were I to judg who
has the happiest share in this performance, I should conclude, the
Giver has. In what I do (repli'd <hi>Surena</hi>) I never expected so much as
I have already receiv'd; to have made what you mention'd the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of my performance, had not been to have given your Life and
Liberty to you, but to me: no, <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> if I confine you unto
any thing, it is only to believe my action is as free from design, as it
is; and if to that obligation you will add this other, of excusing my
disputing <hi>Parthenissa</hi> with the Arms of Honour, as I will not disrelish
your doing the like, I shall receive a satisfaction my condition any
other way cannot afford me. Your performance (said my Prince) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more generous than I believe it; and what you mention, should
be rather my desire, than my grant; and if in it I resent any trouble,
it it proceeds from a latitude I thence receive, of drawing my Sword
against one, for whom when <hi>Parthenissa</hi> comes not in competition, I
would as joyfully employ it, as for her. These Rivals (said <hi>Symander</hi>)
by several passages of this quality, gave each other but too pregnant
evincements how unfortunate they were in being so; and spent so much
time in this employment, that the Sun found them in it. <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
doubtless had interrupted it sooner, to beg a permission of kissing his
Princess's hands before his departure, had he not apprehended, his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
would have esteem'd the increasing of obligations, an uncivil way
of paying them. <hi>Surena,</hi> who it may be knew my Prince's impatiences
by his own (for he had been as long depriv'd of seeing <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> as
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> had been; and knew how unwelcome his visits would prove,
did not he accompany him in them) made that overture to my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Master, which he would not to him: The transports in which he
receiv'd it, were much greater than those with which he receiv'd the
late gift of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, which evidenc'd he was more concern'd in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
than in his Liberty and Life; which it may be invited <hi>Surena</hi> to
commend what he dislik'd. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> suddenly after went out of the
Castle with <hi>Surena,</hi> and in a Chariot from thence to the Palace, where
he sent in a Page to <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Appartment, to beg the honour of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her: She was much surpriz'd at the request, but much more when
having granted it, she found her fears so obligingly deluded; <hi>Surena,</hi>
whilst her joy confin'd her to silence, broke his own, by telling her;
If Madam, I have been seemingly faulty, 'twas only to avoid being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
so; and if I have hitherto occasion'd your hate, 'twas but to avoid
deserving it. I was, Madam, by <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Partizans, so narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
and so much over-power'd, that had they but suspected my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
they had both punish'd and prevented it. You cannot doubt but
to counterfeit was absolutely necessary, when I made your sufferings my
disguise; I know that you were too-too much concern'd in <hi>Artabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s
safety, to let you know I resolv'd it: That might have prov'd
too dangerous a discovery; and your not being sad enough, might have
given you cause to have been so; but as soon as I procur'd a power
to resist <hi>Merinzor's,</hi> I acted that which only the want of it has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hinder'd; and I was necessitated to secure the happy <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
with that with which I pretended to secure his Execution: Yes,
fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> such power the gods have given you over me, that
when my satisfaction and yours come in competition, I consider the
loss of the first, to be the acting of the last; and find I cannot quarrel
with them for rendering me unfortunate, since thereby they make me
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:96335:246"/>
preserve you from becoming so; but (Madam) I am too injurious to
intrench on that little time your <hi>Artabbanes</hi> has to entertain you in;
which that he may the more unconstrainedly, I shall leave him to a
liberty I believe you do as much desire as he. <hi>Surena</hi> having ended
speaking, withdrew himself, and that so suddenly, that <hi>Parthenissa</hi> in
the operations of her joy and wonder, could make no returns to him
that had created them: but when that eloquent silence was expir'd,
she told my Prince, <hi>Surena</hi> may attribute that to one civility, which
I consider as intended to another; for the pretence of his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was to give us the liberty of discourse: but I believe the real
cause is, that he knew mine (if he had stay'd to hear it) would have
come as short of what it ought to be, as this performance excels all
his others. But <hi>Artabbanes</hi> who knew how little time was allotted
him, and how much was allotted <hi>Surena,</hi> acquainted his Princess with
all those particulars I have so largely deduced and magnifi'd his Rivals
Gallantry, in terms which resented their truth in their delivery. This
just duty being finish'd, he told her: This (Madam) is the first time
that I thought I could leave you without regreet; the hopes, that by
going from you now, I shall be the sooner uncapable of repeating the
like misfortune, is my consolation in it; neither can you doubt your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
is less my ambition than duty, when in order to the acting of
it, I can without reluctancy employ my Life and Liberty against the
Bestower of them. The world must be convinc'd your freedom is more
dear unto me than both those, by making it a higher consideration; yet
in that action of ingratitude I shall evidence my self grateful, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
I decline the lesser obligation, but to satisfie the greater. Alas (said
the Princess) are you so low reduc'd, that an act of unkindness must be
an argument of your Love? must I endure a real misfortune, for an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
good? when I consider those innumerable dangers my condition
will engage you in, and those many more which your courage and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
will, I could esteem <hi>Surena</hi> more obliging, if he were less; and
if he converted your liberty into an imprisonment, my trouble then
would extend but to pity, now it does to fear, it may be to despair.
Believe me, my <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> I find more subject for sorrow in the way
you undertake my liberty, than if I had eternally lost it: that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
would but relate to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> but the other does to <hi>Artabbanes,</hi>
who is much more precious to her, than she is to her self. Ah Madam!
(my Prince repli'd) can you then believe, whilst I have an existence,
that your perpetual imprisonment would but relate unto your self? And
can you think the gods have so miraculously given me the Power to use
my sword, to render the Will a sin? No my Princess, these strange and
intricate obstructions, are not to suppress, but try our Faith; neither
can we think them what they are, and believe we shall continue as we
are. I go with a belief of success proportionate to my desire of it; and
if I have any doubts, 'tis not of your deliverance, but that I may be
thought unworthy the acting it; if I be, I will find my Martyrdom
where I expect my felicity; and die in that service, in which I ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to live. These words made <hi>Parthenissa</hi> look pale, and drew some
tears into her eyes, which to take him from considering, she repli'd:
If the gods should esteem <hi>Artabbanes</hi> unworthy the title of my Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
I will assume it my self; my hand shall act my liberty, if in so
fatal a way it be deni'd to his: Do not think I shall need any invitation
to follow you, but the knowing you are gone before, and therefore
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:96335:247"/>
flatter not your self with a belief, that the breaking my imprisonment
can be reserved for any other; for 'tis like my inclinations, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
intirely for <hi>Artabbanes.</hi> Madam (said my Prince) I, consider not
this declaration is to make me less hazardous in your service, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
the gods that I may perform it: I have now an internal assurance
of that blessing; for since your liberty cannot be acted but by me, and
since not to have it acted, were too great a sin to be believ'd, I must be
as confident of the way, as of the end. 'Twas above half an hour (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<hi>Symander</hi>) that these generous Lovers entertain'd themselves in
resembling-discourses, which had not so soon receiv'd a period, but
that they consider'd <hi>Surena</hi> was in an anti-Chamber expecting their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which was so passionate, and sad, that the relation of it
would rather prove your trouble, than the omission. My Prince in the
same Room he found his Rival in, would there have taken leave of
him; but he did not permit it, and accompani'd him to a Pass some 20
Furlongs from <hi>Arsacia,</hi> lest the Treachery of <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s Partizans might
have render'd that place the Scene of a Tragedy he was so concern'd to
prevent. After many Embraces and Civilities, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> told his Rival,
If the employing my Life and Liberty against the generous <hi>Surena</hi> for
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> may be excus'd, by my employing them for him, where her
service comes not in competition, I dare truly profess, I shall deserve to
be so: For I will out of Gratitude repeat dangers as high as those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
which confine me to mine: neither can I but be convinc'd by
what you do to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> of what you will do to <hi>Artabbanes;</hi> for
your Passion makes you think it sit (at least pardonable) to act against
your Inclination; and your Love for the Princess, makes you do things
which might even call that Love in question, did not the knowledg of
the cause seemingly apologize for the effect. That Adoration I have
for the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> has the same production in me: I know I should
give you that Life and Liberty I receive from you, but I have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
above my flame, and the inspirer of it: that which causes my fault,
does yours; neither can you consider what I must do in the future, but
if you reflect upon what you do at the present, you will acknowledg, we
are both innocent, or both excusable. This is all (continu'd my Prince)
that I beg of <hi>Surena,</hi> unless it be to furnish me with an occasion of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him, though as full of danger as my resolution is of contemning all;
which may evidence a gratitude, whose greatness hardly knows any
thing equal, but my desires of manifesting it. <hi>Surena</hi> was ready to give
my Prince a reply, when about two hundred Horse came a full Trot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Rivals, as they were in each others Arms. This unexpected
accident broke off their Civilities, and made them gallop to the head
of a hundred <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse, who were <hi>Surena</hi>'s Guard; his Servants,
and some of my Prince's (for then I was not come up, having stay'd
sometime to kiss the fair <hi>Emilia</hi>'s hands, and to settle a course for a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Correspondency) made themselves a reserve to this little Body,
which resolutely advanc'd to give those a Charge who were coming
precipitately to give them one. <hi>Surena</hi> as they march'd, told <hi>Artabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
I have too good an opinion of you and of my self, to think it fit to
give you an assurance that I am innocent of this Infidelity; but if what
I have done, has not rais'd in you that belief, what I am going to do
will. My Prince had only leisure to tell him, that what he had really done
was of so clear a quality, that what he was now going to do, would not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,
but increase his obligations: For the Enemy was come so near, that one
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:96335:247"/>
of those Two which lead them, cri'd out, 'Tis not <hi>Surena,</hi> but <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
we seek. To which <hi>Surena</hi> repli'd; Traytor, in seeking the one, thou
seekest both; and in attempting the one, thou shalt find the revenge, or
act the death of both; and thereupon piercing like Thunder through a
Battalion of the Enemies, he made so lage a passage for those which
follow'd him, that they found it as easie, as others found it strange. My
Prince made a proportionate charge, for the resolution and the success;
and twice that day saved a Life, which had not been hazarded but for
him, nor preserv'd but by him. The inequality of the numbers render'd
the Dispute equal; but by my continuing behind to kiss the fair <hi>Emilia</hi>'s
hands, I had weaken'd our Party of a small force, on whose arrival with
me, the Enemy that were then wavering, fled; and found that death in
their flight which they had endeavour'd to avoid by it. The two gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Friends and Rivals celebrated their victory and deliverance by
many embraces, which were given with so good grace, that it created
a general quarrel to Fortune, for having so long defer'd it, and which in
the future was to break it again: One would have guest by my Prince's
retributions, that his Life had been precious to him; but those that
knew <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was in <hi>Surena</hi>'s hands, knew withal, that it was to his
Gallantry, not his own safety, that he paid them. I amuse not my self
to particularize those signal expressions those two generous Enemies
made one another before their separation, which was perform'd by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
contracting too good an opinion of his Rival for their unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
condition: But <hi>Surena</hi>'s was at least silenc'd, if not supprest, by his
return that day to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> to whom my Prince by a private Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
gave so ample and handsome an account of that days proceeding,
that his reception relish'd more of having assum'd <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s felicity,
than of having been his Protector; and his ignorance from whence so
obliging an usage was deriv'd, inspir'd him with hopes which could not
have a more flattering than false foundation. My Prince in the mean
time, with a Guard <hi>Surena</hi> had fore'd him to take for his Defence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his journey by a hasty Travel towards <hi>Chrisapolis,</hi> where he heard
<hi>Zenophon</hi> was levying Forces to relieve his King, and to bring the Fate
of <hi>Media</hi> to a more equal dispute, than <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s precipitation had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
allow'd it. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was no sooner arriv'd at <hi>Chrisapolis,</hi> than
he discharg'd <hi>Surena</hi>'s Convoy, with rewards more proportionate to the
Giver, than Receivers. He made his entry into the City by night, only
waited upon by me; and having taken up a retir'd lodging, enquir'd
of the Master of it, the News that was then stirring: who told him,
That <hi>Zenophon</hi> but six days before had receiv'd an express from <hi>Tygranes,</hi>
which told him, their chiefest Magazine of Victuals in <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> had
been destroy'd by a Traytor that had the Care of it; which had reduc'd
him to such extremity, that if not immediately relieved, his hopes were
not to live, but die a King; that he despair'd not but by a small accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
relief, to revenge his former disgrace in the same place in which it
had befallen him; and that therefore <hi>Zenophon</hi> with whatever Force he
could make on the place, should advance by incessant Marches towards
<hi>Ecbatan.</hi> This was so true and pressing an Intelligence, that <hi>Zenophon</hi>
having formerly appointed a general Rendezvous, too late for this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
took of his Army about Eight thousand Horse and Foot, which
were the nearest and readiest Forces, and with those two days since ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the relief of his King, having left order that the residue should
follow with an expedition, which might evidence the cause from whence
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:96335:248"/>
it proceeded. My Prince was very pensive at this information, and much
more sorry the destiny of <hi>Media</hi> should be decided without him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it. Whilst he was engag'd in such thoughts, mine were employ'd
how to remove their cause; and at last resolving that in so emergent a
necessity, he ought publickly to avow himself to see what influence
<hi>Moneses</hi>'s blood had over the <hi>Medians,</hi> and to have Arms in his hands
to oppose <hi>Merinzor,</hi> should the gods make him the Instrument of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<hi>Tygranes</hi>'s Ingratitude to my Prince's Father; as also to dispute
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> with <hi>Surena</hi> with more equal Arms than those by which he
had lost her: I concluded too, that <hi>Zenophon</hi> would not intrust so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a concern as <hi>Chrisapolis</hi> into any hands but those whose incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
he was as confident of as of his own; and therefore <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
ought not to apprehend the disclosing himself to the Governour of it,
and to head those Forces which were embodying, as Seconds to <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi>'s
flying Army. These reasons were so pregnant to me, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
my generous Master with them, to whom they appear'd the
same, and who therefore immediately commanded me to invite the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
to give him a visit, which he would have then paid him, had
he not esteem'd it fitter to receive his advice in private, than go and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
render himself uncapable of observing it, by desiring it first in
publick. I went with joy to obey these orders; and being without much
difficulty admitted into the Governours Chamber, I drew him aside, and
told him the cause of my doing so. He receiv'd the Intelligence with
great astonishment, but I soon found his was deriv'd from an obliging,
not a dangerous Cause, for 'twas in eloquent and passionate returns,
that he thankt the gods for sending, and me for bringing him such
News; he went therefore (follow'd by all the Gentlemen and Officers
then about him) to my Prince's Lodging, but by the way the Flame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diffus'd over the City, there was hardly any in it but those that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the Governour, or that went upon the same employment. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
omit the exceeding deep submissions, and the proportionate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
this throng of Friends made my Prince, and utter'd for his
return. The Governour (an old and unalterable friend to <hi>Moneses</hi> and
his family), told him, The gods, Sir, have doubtless reduced this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to so low an ebb, to evidence your restauration was of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
than the quiet of it, since they have depriv'd it of the last, to
act the first; and it is more than probable that they will acquaint us
'twas your absence involv'd us in Wars, by making your return give a
period to them. We are therefore come, Sir, to offer you our Swords
and Lives, which we doubt not under such a General will vanquish grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obstacles than your courage will now encounter, which has already
acted too many things to leave us the least pretence of doubt it is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of performing any. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> in words and actions altogether sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and obliging, made them find their affection and civilities were
not unfruitfully placed; and to let them know he ambition'd nothing
more than to engage his Life in that Country, in which he found so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
willing to adventure theirs with him; as also to give <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s first
infusions the lye, in a way which also should punish it; he conjur'd
them that the next Morning all such Forces of Horse as they thought fit
to honour him with, and as could be rendezvouz'd by then, might be so,
with which he despair'd not to overtake <hi>Zenophon,</hi> and to share in his
Countrys Fate. The Governour immediately commanded all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to see those Orders obey'd, and in the future to receive theirs from
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:96335:248"/>
                  <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who that night he permitted not to continue in those Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but brought him to the Castle, where his reception spoke the heart
with which it was made. The Sun the next morning was not risen, when
all the streets of <hi>Chrisapolis</hi> eccho'd with the noise of Trumpets and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions;
and not above an hour after, a great Plain on the North side of the
City was covered with Three thousand Horse, whereof a third part
were Voluntiers, which the only Name of <hi>Artabbanes</hi> drew under his
Colours: The other two parts were of such as had been drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s orders before his hasty depart: The Body (though
small) was not unconsiderable, having my Prince at the head of it; and
this they were all so sensible of, that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> found they were so by
their very looks. After a short speech, rather to let them know he knew
their resolution, than to raise it, he embraced the Governour, whose
age dispenc'd him from the field, and began his March towards <hi>Ecbatan:</hi>
Three days with wonderful celerity he follow'd the traces of <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s
Army without overtaking it; but the fourth from the high mountain of
<hi>Dormus,</hi> he discover'd afar off the Walls of <hi>Ecbatan;</hi> that sight refresh'd
his almost wearied Troops, and made them so to accelerate their pace,
before the Sun was five hours from his set, they were come near enough
to perceive both Armies were join'd, and were disputing their hopes,
and desires by the Sword; on which they were so intent, that his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
nor his little Armies saluting their Friends by a shout, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
by a menacing cry, could not in the least measure so much as suspend,
or lessen the fury of either side. My Prince was much more pleas'd with
the resolution of his friends, than with their number, which with the
addition of his Forces, did not equal the one half of the Enemies; whose
multitudes he observ'd were so long hinder'd from prevailing by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in blew Arms, whose Helmet was shadowed with a Plume of
Feathers of the same colour. This generous Warrior carried victory to
his side where ever he was, but his friends lost it where ever he was not;
so that not being ubiquitary, the <hi>Armenian</hi> Royal Army was giving
ground before my Prince could join it. I design'dly pass over the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of this great day, to tell you the conclusion of it, which was,
that though <hi>Artabbanes</hi> did like <hi>Artabbanes</hi> both in courage and conduct,
yet by the fall of the Gentleman in blew Armor, and by being necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
twice to save the King of <hi>Media</hi>'s life, and remount him, it was almost
dark before the gods had put a period to the Battle, and he to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
in which the Traytor <hi>Merinzor</hi> fell, and above Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of his side; so that my Prince's Revenge and his Victory were both
concluded in one action: such signal events could not but produce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
joys in him, who return'd from the pursuit with his victorious
Troops, to present them and himself to <hi>Tygranes,</hi> whose Tent he found
inviron'd with tears instead of acclamations, which was occasion'd by a
fatal wound the King at the conclusion of the day had receiv'd by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
shot at random; <hi>Artabbanes</hi> (by an excess of generosity) at the news,
assum'd a grief as real, as great; and learning the faithful <hi>Zenophon</hi> was
by <hi>Tygranes,</hi> he went without any interruption where he lay. The King
(though extream ill, no sooner saw my Prince's Arms, then he cri'd out,
'Tis to that generous person that I owe twice a Life, which the gods are
resolv'd no longer to lend me; but I desire that the last action of it may
be to embrace and acknowledg my Deliverer. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> at these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
words pull'd off his Helmet, and <hi>Zenophon</hi> no sooner saw his face,
then he cri'd out, 'Tis <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> 'tis <hi>Artabbanes:</hi> Who prostrating
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:96335:249"/>
himself before his King, told him, The gods (Sir) are my witnesses, that
I had long since the ambition to pay you those services, which you are
now pleased so much to overvalue, had not the Traytor <hi>Merinzor</hi> by
false suggestions brought you into so great a diffidence of that truth, that
the danger of coming to manifest it, was almost as great as were my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to do it; but those Powers which vindicate Innocence, have at
length brought <hi>Merinzor</hi> to that Fate he would have impos'd on <hi>Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and have made one a Contributor to that Justice, which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
suffer'd by his having occasion'd the suspending of yours. This free
and generous declaration made <hi>Tygranes</hi> believe 'twas my Prince, as
much as <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s naming him; for he had never known him but by
that Character the faithful <hi>Zenophon</hi> had given of his Person and Mind.
<hi>Tygranes,</hi> who found the hand of death upon him, believ'd he could not
more excuse the Crimes of his Life, than to silence that hatred which had
been the highest offence in it, was beginning to manifest a Conversion
which had nothing of imperfection in it, but that it had not earlier shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
when some Gentlemen brought in one into the Kings Tent (for there
was never a one set up but his, neither had that been, but for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of carrying him to <hi>Ecbatan</hi>) who though almost cover'd with blood,
yet some internals disclos'd that his Arms before they had been so fatally
stain'd, were of Azure; which made <hi>Artabbanes</hi> not only know 'twas
that gallant man, the want of whose assistance had so long suspended his
Victory, but deplore his loss at a rate which even countervail'd his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
These were the dictates his inclinations to generosity inspir'd him
with; but as soon as the wounded Gentleman's Helmet was taken off, he
saw in his dying-looks the charming features of the Prince <hi>Sillaces:</hi> Oh
gods! what did not my afflicted Master utter at so sad a sight! without
so much as considering <hi>Tygranes,</hi> (whose tears were so obliging, as a while
to interpose between his sight, and the object which created them) he
fell on his generous friend, and exprest by groans, when his words fail'd
him, such signal and pressing sorrows, that it even divided those of the
spectators, and made them think him as just an object for their grief, as
he had esteem'd his friend for his: I will not determine whether the air
which <hi>Sillaces</hi> receiv'd by the opening of his Helmet, or <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s
tormenting him, or the mercy of the gods, who thought it unjust to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
two so exactly united, that restor'd the generous Prince to life;
but this is most certain, that before the Chyrurgeons had given him a
Cordial, he was almost in a condition not to need one; and had been
intirely so, if after having a while faintly opened his Eyes, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<hi>Artabbanes,</hi> he had not embraced him so passionately (fearing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never to do it again) that all his wounds opened, and by a second
flood of Blood cast him into a second fainting, <hi>Tygranes,</hi> whether out of
sympathy, or a precedent weakness, fell into the same condition, which
so divided the care and tears of all that were present, that never any
Victory was esteem'd so dearly purchas'd, or so ill celebrated. It was
about half an hour before the Chyrurgeons brought either the King or
<hi>Sillaces</hi> to that life which had seemingly abandon'd them; but the last of
them return'd to it much sooner than the first, for his wounds were of a
far less dangerous nature; and being bound up, as also forbidden any
more such unfortunate demonstrations of his friendship, as his late embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had prov'd, he began to ask of <hi>Artabbanes</hi> his Adventures; but in
so confused a way, that the disorder could not be greater than his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in them, thereby appear'd: The ones curiosity, and the others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:96335:249"/>
were a time suspended by <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s temporary recovery, this
was but a lightning before death, which made such violent and rude ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
that he needed not the Chyrurgeons Art to learn his Fate;
which he first told the two friends of, and that with a constancy which
equal'd their sorrows. The generous <hi>Sillaces,</hi> whether as a friend to
my Prince, or <hi>Tygranes,</hi> so successfully made the latter sensible of the
wrong he had done <hi>Moneses</hi> and his whole Family, that he seem'd more
afflicted for that, than for his present condition, which receiv'd no small
refreshment by <hi>Artabbanes</hi> protesting he was extreamly afflicted that his
first service should be his last; and that he would wrong <hi>Moneses</hi> more
than he ever had, if he believ'd not to have found out his mistake, was
the greatest reparation he ever expected for it. <hi>Tygranes</hi> confused with
many such flattering expressions, publickly declared, <hi>Moneses</hi> was his
legitimate Successor, and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> after him, which was received with
more joy than there were open expressions of it. Then turning a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
look towards <hi>Sillaces,</hi> he told him, And you generous Prince
cannot you furnish me with some occasion before my death to evidence
the esteem I have of your friendship, and of those signal obligations you
have confer'd on me? <hi>Sillaces</hi> was so struck at that fatal question, that
he had not the power to make it any return; which <hi>Tygranes</hi> observing,
he commanded all in the Tent but my Prince and <hi>Zenophon,</hi> to leave it;
which being obey'd, addressing his discourse to my generous Masters
friend, told him, It was with no small satisfaction, that I learn'd one of
my blood could captivate <hi>Sillaces;</hi> though I have seem'd ignorant of
your affairs, yet I am not so much a stranger to them, but that I know
<hi>Lindadory</hi> is honour'd with a passion you have for her; and her Father
has declin'd making her the reward of it, upon considerations which
will more extenuate my usage towards him than any thing I can say in my
own justification; I conjure you therefore (<hi>Tygranes</hi> continu'd speaking
to <hi>Artabbanes</hi>), that you let your Father know my last request, which I
even deliver with my dying breath, is, That your Sister may be allowed
the liberty of her own election: and that he may not be entirely dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of what is requisite for the maintaining of both their qualities, I
hereby confer on <hi>Sillaces</hi> all the false <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s forfeited Estates, and
the Estates of all those who have adher'd to him: Had the gods been
pleas'd to have given me the fair <hi>Lindadory,</hi> I would thus have given
her: <hi>Moneses</hi> cannot suspect a counsel I would my self have practic'd,
and in which he will receive as much satisfaction as I should, were I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
he would observe my desires. The generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> at the end of
these words, would have flung himself at <hi>Tygranes</hi> feet, as some expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his satisfaction, which could hardly exceed the Kings, when <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabbanes</hi>
assur'd him in <hi>Moneses</hi> name, of an exact obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Never was there a Tent at once so replenish'd with tears and joy
as this, and perhaps never was there more cause for either. It seems the
gods had protracted the King of <hi>Media</hi>'s life, that the expiration of it
might repair the faults in it; for, some two hours after, he died, in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
so constant, that the manner of his death consol'd the beholders of it:
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Sillaces</hi> having given their tears to so great a fall, <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
took care to have <hi>Moneses</hi> proclaimed King throughout the Army
and City, which was receiv'd with acclamations so loud, that in the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them there was evidenc'd a proportionate joy. The Funerals of
<hi>Tygranes</hi> were the next day celebrated with a Military pomp, his body
being afterwards Inter'd in the Tomb of his Fathers, over which my
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:96335:250"/>
Prince erected so proud a Monument, that his goodness was known in his
Magnificence. Whilst these requisite duties were paying, <hi>Sillaces</hi>'s reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
was so much advanc'd, that the doubt of it was no longer <hi>Artabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s
fear, who every day with <hi>Zenophon</hi> acknowledg'd him the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Media,</hi> and restorer of <hi>Moneses,</hi> who by a solemn Embassie was
invited from a Solitude to a Crown, the greatest and least extreams. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did <hi>Artabbanes</hi> omit the Gallantry of his Friend, nor <hi>Tygranes</hi>'s last
request for him, and his engagement on it. Things of a civil concernment
put into this posture, the forming of a considerable Army was my Prince's
next care; which he was more troubl'd how to employ, than how to
raise: for his interest, and the many peoples hopes which depended on
him, and served under him, were very rational inducements immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to march and cut off the roots of so dangerous and so near extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
a Rebellion; but the going to attempt <hi>Arsacia,</hi> and to force
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> from <hi>Surena,</hi> were more powerful inducements to flie with
his Army to so glorious and ambition'd a design: for the undertaking
of which he fortified his inclinations with these reasons, That no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
should transcend that of a generous and fruitful flame; That an
occasion of conquering a Kingdom might every day be offer'd; but that
of releasing the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> seldom or never; who could not be more
troubl'd at the cause of the continuance of her sufferings than at the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
themselves; and that thereby he would more injure her than
<hi>Surena</hi> had: That entirely to extinguish the Rebellion, there needed not
a War, but a progress over the Kingdom: That <hi>Zenophon</hi> with such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as the joy of this Change would draw under his Colours, would be
more than sufficient to finish what was so far advanc'd; and that by the
dictates of Reason as well as Love, he ought to employ his courage,
where it was probably to meet with the brightest resistance; and that
was where <hi>Surena</hi> was in person, who was not only the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enemy for power and resolution; but being a foreigner, and having
<hi>Parthia</hi> to befriend him, ought first to be attempted, and dislodg'd. The
generous <hi>Sillaces</hi>'s opinion and reasons concurring with my Prince's
herein, he assum'd the resolution, and that too firmly to admit of the
least shadow of variation. The next morning therefore in a general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the Officers, my Prince acquainted them with his design, which
he fortified with such pregnant reasons, and deliver'd in such an accent,
as made many believe he rather summon'd them to approve his Counsel,
than to receive theirs; so that partly out of judgment, partly out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
the result of the meeting was an unanimous approving of the
motion. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> therefore immediately gave <hi>Zenophon</hi> Commission
to Command an Army for the reduction of <hi>Media</hi> to <hi>Moneses</hi>'s power;
and three days after had a general Rendezvous of all his Forces under
the Walls of <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> which he divided into two equal parts, giving
<hi>Zenophon</hi> the one, and taking the other to himself. <hi>Sillaces</hi> was yet so
ill of his wounds, that he was not capable of undertaking the Command
of <hi>Zenophon</hi>'s Army, nor of so much as accompanying my dear Master in
his: I omit the sad words at their separation, which was no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid,
than that time took up which was employ'd in the last embraces,
and in <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s leaving his generous friend the Command of all things
behind, and of the whole Kingdom, in case the fortune of the War drew
him out of it. My Prince too, found some consolation in <hi>Sillaces</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> That being the Metropolis of <hi>Media,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the place which <hi>Moneses</hi> would reside at; whereby he might not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:96335:250"/>
have the opportunity of being near the King, and it might be of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadory,</hi>
but that also by the inevitable charms of his conversation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from the former the latter. My impatient Master having thus disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangl'd
himself from all obstacles, which might any longer protract his
so passionately ambition'd March, began it the next day with an Army,
which though not consisting of above Fourteen thousand Horse and Foot,
yet in the quarrel it had assum'd, he thought unresistable. The next day
after we had left <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> our spies brought us in word, that <hi>Vixores</hi>
(<hi>Surena</hi>'s brother) had safely recover'd <hi>Arsacia,</hi> with all those <hi>Parthians</hi>
that had escaped <hi>Merinzor</hi>'s defeat, which with some other Reliques of
that Party, had so encreast <hi>Surena</hi>'s Troops, that learning the weakness
of ours, he was determin'd to bring the dispute to a Field, and had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
away <hi>Vixores</hi> for all those Forces, which yet continu'd an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estine
War in <hi>Parthia;</hi> that if the gods blasted his first hopes, he might not be
divested of all, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> with unequal'd satisfaction receiv'd this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for he thought every thing a felicity which avoided protraction:
And lest <hi>Surena</hi>'s second thoughts might prove less obliging than his first,
my generous Master so precipitated his March, that in eight days he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
those happy and fatal Walls within which the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
made her involuntary residence; not far from whence he discover'd
<hi>Surena</hi>'s Camp, which was scituate in a most advantageous and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place. Never (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) did I observe in my Prince's
looks so much of contentment and sorrow intermingl'd; the first was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from his vicinity to his Princess, and from the power he had to
dispute her by Arms; and the last was from the reluctancy he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted

               <p>My Prince at the same time he receiv'd this Letter, saw <hi>Surena</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
march from their Camp into a Plain, which he judged the General
of it had elected for the Scene of the Battel. I cannot tell you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
he was in at his Rivals Resolution, which forc'd him to evince his
Love by the suspension of his Gratitude. This noble trouble resign'd its
Empire to his joy of having brought the redemption of the fair <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
to so immediate a trial. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> having view'd <hi>Surena</hi>'s Army,
found by his Computation, that their numbers and strength were resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
to all judgments but his own, who thought any force inferior to
his, when he consider'd the occasion and recompence of his quarrel.
Neither was <hi>Surena</hi> void of the like belief; and in those dictates both the
Generals began the Battel, which though it merits a retail'd Relation,
yet I shall only acquaint you, That the two Rivals having a hundred
times rally'd their broken Troops, and as many times turned the Victory,
that the reward of it could hardly transcend the courages which dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it; at length they met, which as soon as <hi>Artabbanes</hi> discover'd, he
ended the Combat by avoiding it. 'Twice that day he repeated the same
action on the same score. Oh gods (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) what an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
has a transcendent Gratitude on a generous mind? <hi>Artabbanes</hi> flies
from an enemies sword, when even that enemy was as much so to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa</hi>
as to him, or rather more so the the latter, by being equally so
to the former; but fate forc'd my Prince to what his Inclination would
have avoided; and indeed <hi>Surena</hi> so solicitously courted my generous
Master to the Combat, that it may be what did induce him to avoid it,
now did to embrace it, since 'twas Gratitude to act his friends desires.
Never, never was there a Combat resembling this; for it transcended
all others as much in the effect, as it did in the cause. Here <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
by so fighting, evinc'd what was not the cause of his having so often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
it; and <hi>Surena</hi> by the largeness and unintermissiveness of his
blows, what had made him so ambition that decision, and what he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
would be the reward of it. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was mounted upon the
proudest Horse in <hi>Media,</hi> who seem'd to know whom 'twas he carri'd.
<hi>Surena</hi> had under him a <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse, which yielded nothing to my
Prince's; and indeed both of them seem'd not only to know, but act
their Princes design. The Rivals, whose Armors in the beginning of the
day were of a different colour, now began to wear one Livery by the
many fountains of blood which sprung out of them. If <hi>Parthenissa</hi> had
beheld so fatal a sight, she could not but have deplor'd a Beauty, which
at the same time that it evidenc'd, destroyed Courages as great as it self,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:96335:251"/>
and perhaps a friendship too. Twice already the generous Combatants
had grappl'd, because their Horses grown furious with Heat, made
many of their blows only wound the air, which to avoid in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they clos'd so strongly, that their Bridles being abandon'd, and
their Horses left to their own dispose, the Riders forc'd each other
out of the Saddle, and fell on the dust in those cruel embraces; as
their design was, so were their advantages, for they saluted the ground
with their sides, only <hi>Surena</hi>'s Sword falling between his and the earth,
inconvenienc'd him, but so little, that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had only the internal
satisfaction of resolving he would take no advantage of it: for before
he could manifest that generosity, his enemy was in a condition not to
need it. Their Horses (as I have said) sympathizing in their Masters
concerns, were no sooner eas'd of their burthen, then they also began
a furious sight, which ended not but with the life of <hi>Surena</hi>'s; but
then the survivor fetching two or three groans over his dead enemy,
fell down eternally by his side. You may think it strange (continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
<hi>Symander</hi>) that any could so misimploy his sight, as to be able to
give this relation; but it is certain, that the rareness of the spectacle,
and the general belief that the Riders fates would be seen in their
Horses, drew the eyes of many from the dispute of the former, upon
the latter. The two Generals already so weakned by those streams
of blood they had mutually lost, that 'twas no more their strength,
but their resolution which continu'd the Combat; this being observ'd
by many of both Armies, they advanc'd to separate them, as they were
leaning on the Hilts of their Swords to take breath. Those which
came to my Prince, had only these words, Do you fear my Courage,
or my Quarrel? But they had a look which told them more. <hi>Surena</hi>'s
had a resembling entertainment; and to take from their Armies the
opportunity of the like offence, they renew'd the fight again with
so much strength, that those which fear'd they had too little left, now
did, they had too much by the fatal way they employ'd theirs in:
You will dispence with me, generous Hearers, (said <hi>Symander</hi>) if I
tell you not every blow in this fatal relapse, since I know so well
your concerns for <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> that in so relating the Combat, I should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
act it, by wounding him afresh in your sorrows; 'tis enough you
know, that both of them so prodigally spent the treasure of their
Breath and Blood, that if <hi>Parthenissa</hi> had been a spectator, she must
have confest her self too well disputed; and in brief, our Heroes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perform'd actions even as worthy our wonder as grief, <hi>Surena</hi>
fell, and afterwards <hi>Artabbanes;</hi> but then their knees serv'd them for
feet, as if their hearts, the throne of their Courages, had been strong
forts, and were to be won by approaches. Who can tell how much
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> was hated for being so much lov'd? and how many a
Curse was utter'd against her, for that which was the greatest to her
self? and that which she more participated in, than any of her Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers?
To finish this fatal Dispute, I shall acquaint you, that their
knees being not so active as their feet, only serv'd them to receive
wounds, not avoid them; and their mutual weakness made them so
apprehend they scarcely should have life enough left to act their deaths,
that it extinguish'd all thoughts of avoiding them. <hi>Surena</hi> like a blaze
before the extinction of a Lamp, united his expiring forces with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in one blow to perform what so many had but too far advanc'd;
but as his Sword was in the air, his body fell on the ground, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:96335:252"/>
seem'd to tell him, that his life was more just than he, by abandoning
him when he intended so fatally to employ it; his eyes also, as needing
no more the light, after the gods had decreed <hi>Parthenissa</hi> from him, shut
their lids, as if they intended to impose on themselves an eternal night.
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> employ'd not that moment of breath which was left him, to
ascertain a success which he feared was too much so already; but he
resolv'd, since <hi>Surena</hi> by his Letter had left the least unworthy title to
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> to the gods decision, that he would employ his fading
strength to declare, not act his victory; so that having waved his sword
over his dead Rivals body, he fell down on it, and by embraces seem'd
to beg pardon for an insulting, which his own declaration had necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
him unto; and which he could not have perform'd in a less crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
way.</p>

               <p>OH gods! (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) who can tell you with how
many acclamations and tears this fatal Victory was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in by the <hi>Median</hi> Army; which being fill'd with
those two most predominant passions of joy and grief, in
the dictates they inspir'd, flew on the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who
being possest only with the last of them, which rather stupisies than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
the Courage, lost the Victory with their General, and left his
body as one manifestation of it. For my part (said <hi>Symander</hi>) I contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
nothing to it; for taking with me an experimented Chyrurgeon,
I ran to my Prince's body, which I found too large a subject for the
evincement of his Art; his wounds being bound up, though with no
signs of life; we erected his Tent over his body, and laid him on a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
And because I knew if the gods would restore him to life, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would more accelerate his recovery than my assurance that <hi>Surena</hi>
had wanted nothing for his; I caused the care of them to be as equal
as their danger, and carri'd <hi>Surena</hi>'s body to a neighbour-Tent, left
their being in one, might have been prejudicial to both. It was at
the least three hours that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> continu'd in his Swound, for
his recovery out of which he had no water but my tears; at length
the gods were pleas'd by the opening of his eyes, to dry up mine;
which joy was increast by his speaking, and the first occasion of it
was (though with pain equal to the generosity which caus'd it), to
enquire after <hi>Surena.</hi> I gave him a true account of what I had
done, for which he embrac'd me; one part of his strength being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to enquire after his Enemy, and the other to reward the care
of him. The ensuing night was given entirely to rest; by which he
receiv'd so high a refreshment, that next morning he had perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the use of speaking. The first employment he sent me upon,
was to visit <hi>Surena,</hi> who I found (by resembling miracle to my Prince's)
had no one wound that was mortal, and health enough recover'd to
acknowledg that civility which sent to enquire after his. When <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
knew this happy truth, he askt of his Chyrurgeons whether
the removal of <hi>Surena</hi> to <hi>Arsacia</hi> might be effected without any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
or inconvenience? to this he was answer'd affirmatively; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:96335:253"/>
commanding all but me out of his Tent, he told me, Go <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>
from this step to <hi>Surena,</hi> and tell him, That his Liberty
which the gods have given me as a punishment for having deni'd
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> hers, I do restore him; and had not continu'd that Combat
in which he lost it, had not our dispute been so equal, that any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ending it by words, might have relisht more of a care of my
self than of him; but now that I can evince my solicitousness for him,
proceeds from a clearer principle, I embrace this way of serving him
with more joy than I assume at what gives me the power of doing
it. Tell him withal, that he must now offend the gods if he offends
any longer <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> and that the former have so miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
his life, to give him so large an occasion to repair the errors
of it. But I fear (said <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) I speak so much of this, as it
may invite him to believe I am grateful, but in expectation that he
will be more so; therefore convey him to <hi>Arsacia,</hi> and tell him only,
I am at least as much troubled that I cannot pay him that duty, as at
what hinders me from it. I was (continu'd <hi>Symander</hi>) as much asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
at this Command as <hi>Surena</hi> was when I went to obey it; who
in generous retributions accepted of an obligation, he could neither
have desir'd nor hoped. <hi>Surena</hi>'s being convey'd from the Army to
<hi>Arsacia</hi> couldnot inspire the last with more joy than it did the first
with wonder. When he came to the gates, which was the place where
I took leave of him, he made me many Appologies for not having
been able to wait on my Prince, to have acknowledg'd a Gallantry
which nothing could proportion but the value he plac'd upon it, and
his ambition of repaying it. Five days <hi>Artabbanes</hi> continu'd in more
trouble from <hi>Surena</hi>'s silence than from his own wounds, which had
clos'd themselves much faster if the distempers of the Mind had not
hindred the cure of the Body. I must acknowledg I did not only
believe that <hi>Surena</hi> had conveyed both himself and <hi>Parthenissa</hi> into
some more remote place, but told my Prince so; which thought of
mine he resented as ill, as he could have the performance; and though
I told him, that by what <hi>Surena</hi> had formerly done, my now conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was not irrational, yet I could not make my opinion his; but
the sixth day all our suspitions and doubts were resolv'd by a Letter
which <hi>Surena</hi> sent by a Trumpet. The words, to the best of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance
were these:</p>

                        <hi>THough I had written as soon as I had received my wounds, they
could not have prov'd a higher trouble to me than my friendship
and gratitude now do; for the clearness of what I ought to perform, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be greater than the impossibility: I have pleaded your cause with my
self against my self, and have said so much for you, that could I but
do half as much to you, you would have admir'd what I fear you will
condemn. But alas, I cannot resign up</hi> Parthenissa <hi>but with my Life. The
gods knowing this Truth, have put me into a posture of evincing it, and
I shall conclude they never mean you her, whilst they perform not that
to me. Come then, generous</hi> Artabbanes, <hi>to the assault, and you shall see
how willingly I will put my self in the only capacity, by which I can
present</hi> Parthenissa <hi>to you, who perhaps the gods have not yet adjudg'd
from me, since I can dispute her in a way in which I may find my felicity,

act another; and yet the end of the last could not be more pleasing, than
the way was the contrary. After the disorder these reflections infused,
were vanished, he returned this answer to his Rival.</p>

                  <hi>Artabbanes</hi> having returned <hi>Surena</hi>'s Trumpet with this Reply, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ordered <hi>Arsacia</hi> to be invironed with his Army, which was
so numerously increas'd with the Nobility and Gentry which thronged
to his Ensigns, that his hopes had now no Cloud, but the protraction of
them. I believe I need not tell you that my Prince when he was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
performed hourly the part of a General, an Engineer, and a
Pioneer, leaving no function unpractised, which might accelerate his
approaches, and put him into a felicity, for which he had lost so much
blood, and fought so many Battels. In brief, one Moon had so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
our hopes, that we had strong ones, another would convert
them into Certainties; and though <hi>Artabbanes</hi> gave many an assault to
taste the resolution of the Defendants, yet he always returned with such
pregnant evincements of their greatness, that he concluded the reduction
of <hi>Arsacia</hi> was not more a work of Courage, than of Time. And
though this knowledg did often suspend his joys; yet the remembrance,
that only a few days separated him from <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> hindered them
from being suppress'd. But, great gods! (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) how
fallacious are the Thoughts of Man? and how often do you take delight
to act things improbable, and to destroy those which are not? For my
Prince, who to hasten the Siege, made the Soldiers work at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
so assiduously solicited their Labour, that by the excess of it
a raging Feaver invaded our Camp, and at length the Pestilence, and
that in so fatal a way, that it turned Epidemical; and to add to this
misery, at length it seized on my Prince too, and so dangerously, that I
apprehended the loss of his Life, in that of his hopes. Oh gods! (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Symander</hi>) what Prodigies did you perform in that poor Army?
and had you no way to manifest your Power but by your Cruelty? Yes
(generous Hearers) never was there a greater Mortality, than that in
which the offended Deities visited the <hi>Median</hi> Camp: Our Ensigns were
no longer guarded by those, which notwithstanding did not abandon
them; the Living had no employment but to bury the Dead; and our
Trenches had no other Defence, than what had rendered them void of
any: In the horror of this Condition, the remaining Commanders ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Meeting, where whilst they were advising of what course to
elect, their Intelligencers came in with reiterated assurances, that <hi>Orodes</hi>
                  <pb n="580" facs="tcp:96335:254"/>
with all the Gallantry of <hi>Parthia,</hi> was come within 300 Furlongs, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to raise the Siege, which <hi>Surena</hi> had invited him to: This assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
taught us what to do, so that the ensuing Night, whilst <hi>Artabbanes</hi>
was so weak that he knew not what he did (which was a happy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
we put him into a Litter, and with the Fragments of our Army,
convey'd him so far before Day, that we only feared his safety from his
sickness, not his Enemies. The first of these continued, till the arrival
of the generous <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who being in more pain not to be near his
Friend, than his wounds gave him, came from <hi>Ecbatan</hi> to my Prince's
retirement; this was a happiness we owed not to our own precaution,
and yet we knew none but such a Friend durst disclose to him how much
the gods were his Enemy. And had we ignored that Truth, we might
have discovered it by inference; since if being acquainted with it by
<hi>Sillaces,</hi> accompanied too with reasons as much as the Subject could
bear, he fell into such expressions and actions of Despair, that we thought
his very grief would prove both his Misfortune, and his Cure; what
would it not have amounted unto, if neither the Speaker, nor the things
spoken, had been what they were? These miseries had this accessional
one, that our intelligencers brought us certain advertisement, <hi>Orodes</hi>
had been received at <hi>Arsacia</hi> with as much joy, as he received <hi>Surena</hi>
within it, whose invitation had brought him thither, having lost all
hopes in his precedent Battel, but of continuing the Siege till this Relief
came, which he solicited by so powerful a Reward, as the Resignation
of <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> only with this Limitation, that <hi>Orodes</hi> should oblige
himself by solemn oath only to implore, not constrain her affection; to
which was added, that <hi>Surena</hi> should be restored to his former Power
and favour; and both he, and his Partizans have a plena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y Act of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.
My Prince at this Intelligence cryed out, Ungrateful Rival!
could'st thou divest thy self of a Flame for <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> but to repair
the injuries thine had heaped upon her? Can Fear and Allegiance make
thee abandon what a higher Duty and Generosity could not? and
couldst thou hope relief from an action, which rendered thee unworthy
of any? Whilst Love was thy fault, it was thy excuse: but now thou art
as criminal in the very abandoning thy Passion, as in the assuming and
continuance of it. I should never finish, did I particularize all the
evincements of my Prince's despair, which truly was so transcendent,
that I believe we could hardly desire his recovery so much, as he detested
it. <hi>Sillaces,</hi> by what <hi>Surena</hi> had done, concluded of what he had not
done, I mean not abandoned his Passion, by his having deposited the
object of it in the hands of so unsuccessful a Rival, and one who would
unavoidably continue that Name, if he performed his engagement to
him. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> at length found so much Reason in what was his Friends,
that he began by little and little to qualifie a hatred he then thought he
had assumed upon a wrong score; for he could find his Rival no way
excusable but by that, in which his Friend accused him, which was, that
his Passion had the Ascendant. Whilst <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Sillaces</hi> were
reasoning upon the mutation of their Condition, and how to act thereon,
there came certain deputed Citizens out of <hi>Arsacia,</hi> who being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
told my Prince, That <hi>Surena</hi> had procured for them from <hi>Orodes,</hi> a
Liberty to dispose of themselves, and their City, as their Interest and
Inclinations should lead them; which as soon as they knew, they had
acquainted <hi>Surena,</hi> that both those bound them to offer up themselves
to their legitimate Prince; to which <hi>Surena</hi> reply'd, that had he not
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:96335:254"/>
concluded they would have so employed the Concession, he would
never have obtained it; and that since they were so well determined,
he had nothing to impose on them, but his desire to assure <hi>Artabbanes,</hi>
that to evidence 'twas not ambition, but Love, which made him disturb
his Kingdom; as soon as the latter had ceas'd, he designed by the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so considerable a Place as <hi>Arsacia,</hi> to evidence the former; and
he further begg'd, that his leaving <hi>Media</hi> in a perfect Quiet, might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize
for his having broken it; which if any other should attempt,
he would return with more considerable Forces to restore her peace,
than ever he had brought to interrupt it. The <hi>Arsacian</hi> Citizens, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus performed <hi>Surena</hi>'s part, on their Knees did their own, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> with their Keys, and by imploring him to believe,
they had been long since so disposed of, had they had the disposal of
them. My Prince having raised them up, granted them a Pardon for a
fault which indeed others had committed, and promised them in the
Future, an affection which should recompence their Present. He then
enquired of them how <hi>Surena</hi> had disposed of himself, since he concluded
by the interest he himself had now in <hi>Arsacia,</hi> that 'twas no longer the
place of his residence. The <hi>Arsacians</hi> reply'd, That both he, <hi>Orodes</hi>
and <hi>Parthenissa</hi> were returned with the Army into <hi>Parthia;</hi> and though
many had advised the employment of it against an Enemy whose wrongs
and Power would inspire him with Desires and Actions of Revenge;
yet by <hi>Surena</hi>'s perswasions, all preventative thoughts of hostility were
silenced. The <hi>Arsacians</hi> having a Governour given them of their own
Election, were dismissed: And then the Two Princes after a private
debate, resolved, that <hi>Sillaces</hi> being now perfectly recovered, should
return into <hi>Parthia,</hi> both to act his own Interest, and countenance my
Prince's; who concluded, nothing by way of force, but a Conquest of
<hi>Parthia</hi> could recover <hi>Parthenissa</hi> out of it; and that such a way was
both too tedious, and uncertain; that therefore as he lost his Princess
by Arts and Slight, so he should attempt the recovering of her; the
very way of his loss, instructing him how to repair it: and therefore
as soon as his strength would permit, he would follow his Friend in a
Disguise, that if he regained not <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> yet at least he might see,
and converse with her, which was the next Blessing. The Prince
<hi>Sillaces,</hi> having his Friend's Interest mingled with his own, did that
with joy upon both those scores, which he could not without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy
have undertaken upon his own; and before he began his journey,
he had the satisfaction of hearing from <hi>Zenophon,</hi> that though his Army
had found little resistance, yet the benefit and largeness of his Progress,
repaired the little Glory he acquired in it. <hi>Sillaces</hi> was safely arrived in
<hi>Parthia</hi> two Moons before my Prince could leave <hi>Media;</hi> which forc'd,
and necessary continuance there, gave him time to settle that Kingdom,
which his Passion otherwise would not have allowed him: And learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his first Ambassadors to <hi>Moneses</hi> were miscarried, he employed
others, who passing successfully in their going, and return, through
various Dangers, the very same day my Prince was beginning his
so ambition'd Journey, they presented him with this ensuing Letter,
whose Address was as strange to him, as the Contents was to us.</p>

               <p>This generous Letter was no sooner finish'd, than my Prince found how
true the contents of it were, by losing a Father the first hour of his putting
on a Crown: He gave to that loss those retributions which the best dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are capable of: And learning from those which brought him the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of his sadness, that <hi>Moneses</hi> was unalterable in his resolves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the World, as much as now it courted him: as also, that they had
brought Letters thereof to the Nobility of <hi>Media;</hi> which too, imported the
resignation of his Crown to him, and his desires and Commands to them, of
accepting him for their King; He resolv'd to defer his Coronation, till
things of a higher concernment were brought to some issue, and till he
could present that Crown which was presented him, to her who in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
better deserv'd it, and for which end only he rejoyced to have it.
This new alteration suspended his journey, but it was only so long as the
deputing the generous <hi>Zenophon</hi> Chief Governour in his absence did take
up; so that the next morning abandoning the glories of a new Crown, and
so many thousands of people who ambition'd to invest him in it; he set
forwards for <hi>Parthia,</hi> only taking me with him, and both of us so disguis'd
that we were hardly knowable to each other. All the time of our long
journey, my King entertain'd himself in designs how to accomplish
his Princess's liberty, and if at any time he interrupted his own silence,
'twas to communicate some stratagem to me, or to enquire if I had found
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:96335:255"/>
out any other worthy his knowledg. This being our only employment,
we thought on so many Plots, that we hoped all of them would not be
fruitless. We had already so far conquer'd our Voyage, that we were come
to the top of the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> when from thence we might discover
the adjacent Plain covered with Armed Troops: some of the wild Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the place from whence we took our Prospect, told us, they were
<hi>Parthians,</hi> which was the utmost of their knowledg. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent down one of the least irrational amongst them to bring him a
more clear information. This Messenger, about the break of day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to us again, with this assurance, that two <hi>Parthian</hi> Princes, <hi>Sillaces</hi>
and <hi>Surena,</hi> were joint-Generals of that vast body, which was going to
fight the Roman Army, which lay near the City <hi>Charres,</hi> and was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by one <hi>Crassus.</hi> This news surpriz'd us, and made us believe our intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer
was mistaken, by his joyning <hi>Sillaces</hi> and <hi>Surena</hi> in one Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which we concluded <hi>Orodes</hi> could never do; but he was so positive
in his repeated relation, that my Prince resolv'd to mingle himself with
the <hi>Parthian</hi> Army (who were then pulling down their Tents for a
March), and learn the truth of what he had so much cause to doubt. This
was not difficult for us to effect: for going a little aside in those rude
places, till some of the first Troops were past us, we join'd the others
without being suspected, or examined. We had not rid a quarter of an
hour in that manner, when we perceiv'd the generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> riding
from one division to another, animating the Soldiers against the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the way, and making of them keep their Ranks as much as the illness
of it would permit. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> thinking this was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it time to disclose
himself to his Friend, and to learn from him his own Fate in the fair
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s, took the opportunity to do it, when he was gotten on a little
hight to view his Armies march, and only attended by a couple of his
Domesticks. <hi>Sillaces</hi> had well-nigh, at my Kings naming himself, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
who he was, by a passionate embracing him; and 'twas with no
small violence that he kept himself from doing it; but having sent on
some employment those that were near him, and gotten into a retir'd
place, he there permitted his Arms to take with usury, what he had till
then suspended them from. Here the generous Friends having finish'd
that part of their entertainment which might have been dangerous if visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and as troublesome if not performed; lest <hi>Sillaces</hi> absence might be
observed, he put himself at the head of his Army, where all out of respect
kept themselves at so great a distance, that calling <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that days March, they had ample and secure leisure to acquaint each
other with what had happen'd since their separation. <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who knew
my Kings impatiency, told him, that at his return <hi>Orodes</hi> had receiv'd
him with large and open demonstrations of affection, and with many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
for what he had acted for <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and against <hi>Merin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor:</hi>
That he assiduously visited the fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> which both his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and affection oblig'd him to, since that after her escape out of the Isle
of <hi>Eden,</hi> the Princess <hi>Lindadory</hi> and <hi>Zephalinda</hi> returned to <hi>Nineveh;</hi> and
since <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s coming thither, they three had been inseparable;
That <hi>Orodes</hi> continu'd his Passion for my Kings Mistriss with as much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and unsuccessfulness as ever. That he was daily more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in a confidence, that <hi>Surena</hi> had not extinguish'd his flame for <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa,</hi>
but resign'd her to <hi>Orodes</hi> as being a less dangerous Rival. That
the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> being told of some misunderstanding between <hi>Surena</hi>
and him, had publickly desir'd, and enjoyned their reconciliation;
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:96335:256"/>
and to perfect it, had made them joint-Generals against <hi>Crassus;</hi> who
having spent too much time in robbing the <hi>Iews</hi> Temple at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
was now come loaden with Wealth, and Sacriledg, to invade
<hi>Parthia,</hi> and was not distant above three days march. Lastly,
The generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> told my Prince, that the fair <hi>Lindadory</hi> was
constant in her blessings to him, which left him no shadow of fear,
but that the King of <hi>Media</hi> would think (what he confest) that
they were too-unworthily plac'd. The King of <hi>Media</hi> (said my
Prince) thinks they are so justly, that if his love to <hi>Lindadory</hi> were
capable of accession, her choice and constancy would inspire it.
Oh Gods! (reply'd <hi>Sillaces</hi>) am I then in so transcendent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition!
You are (said <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) if the truth of what I tell you
can make you so; and that you may no longer doubt it, <hi>Lindado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
is at my dispose, and consequently at her own, and yours: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he told him of <hi>Moneses</hi> preferring a Solitude before a Crown,
and of his having conferr'd that of <hi>Media</hi> upon him, with the care
of his fair Sister. These extacies of joy made the March not tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
though the way might have render'd it much so: This was the
cause that before <hi>Sillaces</hi> thought the Sun had run half his course,
he was near his set. Those therefore which were trusted with the
Camping of the Army, came to advertise him they had found a fit
place for that end, and desir'd his Orders: For he and <hi>Surena</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army by days, after the Consullary manner. <hi>Sillaces</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
viewed and elected a fit Camp for so large a Body, and given
the Orders for that nights discipline and security, withdrew himself
to his Tent, that he might the better enjoy an entertainment which
he valued much, yet not more than it deserv'd to be so; but having
the place emptied of all but <hi>Artabbanes, Surena</hi> came to visit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with a design he had put in execution, of drawing <hi>Crassus</hi>
out of the Straits and Mountains of <hi>Ballissus,</hi> into the Plains of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia,</hi>
where the <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse would have an advantage, which
gave him more than hopes of a Victory. I cannot tell you (said
<hi>Symander</hi>) with what emotions and surprizes my King consider'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so near <hi>Surena,</hi> and how many times he had his hand upon his
Sword, to demand a final reason of him for all those miseries he had
involv'd him in, and (which was much more sensible) the fair <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenissa.</hi>
But the respect he pay'd <hi>Sillaces,</hi> and the apprehension he
had, how great a hazard the quarrel of his Country might run, by
so unseasonable a decision of his own, which probably would engage
an Army too-much against it self, that had already but too-much
against it; suspended his resentments: but lest his looks might one
way occasion, what he had supprest in another, he withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
till <hi>Surena</hi> by returning, had left <hi>Sillaces</hi> alone; who told my
Prince, that his Colleague had so well deluded the Roman General,
by the Arts of <hi>Ariamnes,</hi> a <hi>Parthian</hi> of excellent dexterity in such
negotiations, that <hi>Crassus</hi> elevated too by the fresh arrival of <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Crassus</hi> (his Son) with one Thousand men at Arms, sent him by
<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> had quitted the fast Countries where his Legions were
invincible, and was marching so precipitately to the Plains of <hi>Carres,</hi>
which he had elected for the General Field, that if we make not
haste, he will possess himself of all the advantages of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our arrival, which makes us (continued <hi>Sillaces</hi>) resolve so to
accelerate our march, that the Roman Courages by their attendance,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:96335:256"/>
shall not cool. This News stirred <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s blood, and made him
determine before he presented himself to his Princess, to let her know,
the Arms with which <hi>Crassus</hi> had beaten him, were not by those of
honour. <hi>Sillaces</hi> with raptures of joy, received this assurance, and
could not doubt of the Victory, since my Prince would solicite and
court it. In brief, two days after the <hi>Parthian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Army saluted
each other by sight, but the day was so far spent, that they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
there would not be left enough for a decision, which would be
so well disputed. That Night then was given to rest, and preparation
for the ensuing Day; which no sooner dawn'd, than <hi>Surena,</hi> whose turn
it was to Command, drew out his Army, and the better to delude the
<hi>Romans,</hi> he covered the Armour of his Men at Arms (which were all
of pollish'd Margian Steel) with the Skins of Beasts; which made <hi>Crassus</hi>
say, he was going to a hunting, not a Battel: His right Wing was led
by the generous <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who was accompanied by my disguised Prince,
richly Armed, and advantageously mounted; but the first concealed by
an obscure Coat: The Battel <hi>Surena</hi> led, and the left wing <hi>Vixores,</hi> who
as his Brother, was restored to <hi>Orodes</hi>'s favour. <hi>Publius Crassus</hi> had the
conduct of the right wing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> of the
Battel, and <hi>Cassius</hi> of the left: The Nations of which these Armies were
composed, was evident by the first encounter, which was so furious and
bloody, that one might have concluded of the Progress by the beginning.
<hi>Publius Crassus</hi> routed <hi>Vixores</hi>'s wing, whose Horse unfortunately going
to the Charge, had rendered him uncapable of performing it; which
fall, more inconvenient than dangerous (for it but amazed him) gave
<hi>Crassus</hi> not only the liberty of acting what he did, but also of hindering
them from rallying; this unhappiness arrived at the same time that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Crassus</hi> gave a bloody impression on <hi>Surena</hi>'s Battel, and so much
disordered it, that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> casting off what covered the beauty and
richness of his Armour, flew where his Courage and Conduct were but
too necessary. His first relief was given to his Rival, who till it came,
fought more in despair, than hope; but my King having metamorphosed
his condition, went to relieve <hi>Vixores</hi>'s Troops, who were both the
<hi>Romans</hi> Chase and Quarry. The heat he was in, made him lift up his
Helmet, which being shaded with Carnation Plumes, brought so large
an accession to his natural good Meen, that those which beheld it, were
as much pleased with it, as with his assistance; which he then afforded
those of that routed wing, by heading a small party, with which despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all Enemies but the Chiefest, address'd his main charge to the young
<hi>Crassus,</hi> who at the head of his Troops he killed with his own hands; and
some <hi>Parthians</hi> according to their barbarous custom, cutting off his
head, and carrying it on the point of a Launce, it brought as much
Terrour to his Party, as so lately it had success. This was the first
dawning of the glorious event which that day shined upon the <hi>Parthians;</hi>
and this was so generously followed by him which begun it, that though
some fatal wounds he received in the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> own Battalion, rendered
him uncapable of finishing what he had made so large a Progress in;
yet the Victory remained entirely to the <hi>Parthians;</hi> by which you may
imagine how far he had advanced it, when they could conclude it
without him. In that bloody day my Prince so repaired the wrongs of
Treachery, that he wanted nothing of an entire satisfaction, but that
<hi>Crassus</hi> knew not he had done so. The generous <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who with his
Sword had made many wayes to Glory, in the pursuing of it, received
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:96335:257"/>
from me the fatal News, that my King was able no longer to do so, which
made him abandon all designs, but those of returning to serve <hi>Artabbanes;</hi>
whom I had carried into his Tent, where he found him in a condition
too-too sufficient to cloud, and make him deplore that days success: For
alas the turning of the blood after the dressing of his wounds, had cast
him into a swound, which <hi>Sillaces</hi> had like to have accompanied him in:
But the gods by restoring him to himself, did the like to his generous
Friend, who gave such signal demonstrations of Joy for that blessing,
that had not the high performances of my Prince that day, rendered
them only upon that score legitimate, by the greatness of the effects,
those which were present might have judged to whom they were paid.
But <hi>Sillaces,</hi> that he might not be separated from <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> sent
<hi>Surena</hi> word, that some hurts rendered him uncapable of prosecuting
the success, which therefore he left entirely to his care; neither indeed
was this an absolute fiction, for he had received five wounds, yet none
so dangerous as to have produced that detention which a nobler impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
did. In this great day there fell above 20000 <hi>Romans;</hi> and the
next we learn'd, that <hi>Surena</hi> by many slights had first gotten <hi>Marcus
Crassus</hi> out of the City of <hi>Charres,</hi> and then into his Power, by promises
of Life to him, and his remaining Army, if they would embrace <hi>Orodes</hi>'s
mercy. Though the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers forced their General to this, yet
he repayed their great Crime, with a proportionate Generosity: For as
he was going to <hi>Surena,</hi> turning about, and addressing his speech to
some <hi>Patricians;</hi> he told them, If any of you, O <hi>Romans,</hi> survive this
ruine, tell the Senate, 'twas not my Soldiers necessitated me to go into
the <hi>Parthians</hi> hands, but my Fate; which being confident to receive
from them, I go to embrace with joy, as believing my blood will prove
a Ransom for the rest of my Countrey-men; who, if they saw me die
by my own hands, might have as much provocation to imitate, as they
will have to revenge me. These words, when contrary ones were both
deserved and expected, drew Tears into many Eyes, and drew <hi>Octavius</hi>
and <hi>Petronius</hi> along with their General, who as the <hi>Romans</hi> say, being
brought before <hi>Surena,</hi> was immediately murthered with those which
accompanied him; and as we say, some high language passing between
<hi>Surena</hi> and him, <hi>Octavius</hi> drew his Sword to vindicate the <hi>Triumvir,</hi>
which occasioned all their Deaths: howsoever it was, <hi>Crassus</hi>'s head was
cut off and sent to <hi>Orodes.</hi> I may not omit (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) to
let you know, that the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who had unanimously observed they
derived their Glory from the ubiquity of the Courage and Conduct of
one whose good Meen and Arms rendered him also exceeding remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
came to <hi>Surena,</hi> and implored the sight of their Deliverer; which
he also acknowledging him to be, to satisfie Justice and Them, made a
diligent but fruitless enquiry after my Prince; but this ignorance of
whom he was, and where to find him, conferred on him an honour
greater than their knowledg of both would have produced: For the
admirable effects of his Courage, his abandoning them when they no
longer needed it, and the declining of a Glory which no Mortal could
have so great a resignation as not to own, led some of them to think it
might be the Tutelary Angel of <hi>Parthia:</hi> This particular opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
published, became the general Faith, in the dictates whereof, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
together all the combustible Arms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
Army casting themselves into a Ring, set Fire to the Pile, and
accompanied the ascension of the Flame with loud shouts of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:96335:257"/>
and Gratitude to his residence, who was the cause of both.
This high retribution of the <hi>Parthians</hi> to my Prince's Valour (whose
ignorance could not render them so much as suspected of partiality, and
whose enjoying the benefit of it, made them the more competent Judges
of its greatness) brought not near so much satisfaction to him, as his
wounds (which rendered him uncapable of paying his Duty to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)
did the contrary. The generous <hi>Sillaces</hi> gave him all the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was capable of, by begging him to believe the Glory of the
Cause ought to apologize for the effect, and would even in <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s
own judgment, though perhaps not in her affection. My Prince, who
protested it could do it in neither of his, conjur'd <hi>Sillaces</hi> to return with
<hi>Surena</hi> to <hi>Selutia,</hi> there to receive and participate in a Triumph, which
he deserved entirely to engross, and to supervise their mutual affairs; as
also to have a Care lest this accession of Glory to <hi>Surena</hi> might not
thrust him into attempts, which <hi>Sillaces</hi> himself was of opinion he wanted
but the Power and opportunity to undertake. That generous Prince,
who by this time (which was fifteen days after the Battel of <hi>Charres</hi>)
found <hi>Artabbanes</hi> in a mending condition, and himself in a travelling
one, obeyed <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s incessant solicitations, having first received
a reiterated assurance of his following him as soon as he was able; he
would have also left him some trusty Domesticks; but my Prince would
detain none but a Chyrurgeon, of whose fidelity he was as confident
as of his Skill. <hi>Sillaces</hi> and <hi>Surena</hi> being gone to <hi>Selutia,</hi> we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
<hi>Artabbanes</hi> from the Camp into a Neighbour Village, where
there was less ill-accommodation than in the Field, and where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained two Moons before he thought himself in a posture fit to make
use of a Horse: During our residence there, we heard frequently from
<hi>Sillaces,</hi> whose Letters were still confirmations of his believing <hi>Surena</hi>
had silenced but not extinguished his Passion; and that that was <hi>Orodes</hi>'s
Faith as well as his, who therefore seem'd to be more troubled than
pleased at his success, and who every day disclosed some such symptoms
of his being not well satisfied with him, that it was generally thought
those signs would turn into effects, which <hi>Surena</hi>'s high Carriage would
not a little contribute to the accellerating. <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who knew
<hi>Surena</hi> had almost as much discretion as Love, concluded he would not
so far incense his King, as that it should be publickly taken notice of,
unless he were prepared for some high Design, and sought but a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to begin it. This rational belief put the possessor of it upon an
irrational resolution, that of beginning a Journey to <hi>Selutia,</hi> before he
was well able to walk in his Chamber, and against the advice and Prayers
of the Chyrurgeon, who protested it would at least more than hazard a
Relapse, longer than his first indisposition: But my King, though he
were deaf to us, yet after his first days journey, he could not be so to
his Pain and weakness, both which told and made him believe what he
would not from us. And indeed his Indisposition was so great, and so
long like to continue so, that we removed him to a private Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
that we then were in, being too common of it self, and seated in
a Road that was so. <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s removal from his first residence, and
his then taking so retir'd a One, made him justly apprehend he should
be deny'd the satisfaction of his Friends Intelligences; he therefore
commanded me to go to <hi>Selutia</hi> to acquaint <hi>Sillaces</hi> with his removal,
and perfectly to learn all the transactions and intricacies of the Court,
which he said, he thought could no way be safelier nor better effected,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:96335:258"/>
than by employing me. To obey this Command immediately I took
Post, and upon the Third Day towards the Close of the Evening, I
came to the end of my Journey; but as I past along the Streets to a
Friends House, whom I durst only, and whom I did entirely trust, I saw
strange murmuring Crouds of People, and amongst others so deep a
consternation, that I concluded 'twas no common Cause which had so
extraordinary a production. On my arrival at my Friends, whom I
happily found at home, I enquired what created these unusual effects.
He was as much surprized at my Question, as I was at his Answer, which
was, That <hi>Orodes</hi> having assumed some high Jealousies of <hi>Surena,</hi> either
upon a score of Love or Power, had that day seized on him; and after
a short hearing and Sentence, had but even then put him to Death,
which so strange and sudden a proceeding was the cause of those unusual
Crouds in the City, the very Commonalty admiring the vicissitude of
Fortune, which in few hours produced so strange a revolution, that
he for whom so recently Scaffolds were built to behold his triumphs,
now had some to behold his execution. Neither is this the only
cause of what you enquire the reason of, since 'tis firmly reported,
That even in this moment <hi>Orodes</hi> is forcing a Felicity from <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
which her Constancy has so resolutely deni'd him; but this is so
improbable a Crime, that many believe 'tis divulg'd by <hi>Surena</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans,
to make his Martyrdom appear the clearer, and the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to have it reveng'd. You may believe I was not a little surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at this relation, which the more I reflected on, the more I found
cause to conclude, that the latter part of it was true, because the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was; and that <hi>Arsaces</hi> would not so precipitate his Favourite's
Execution, but for an end which was more considerable than that loss:
and I knew nothing could appear so to him, but the satisfaction of his
Flame. 'Twas therefore, that hastily abandoning my Friend, I went
up so to the Palace, resolving by my own Death, or by <hi>Orodes</hi>'s, to
prevent a Misfortune I much more justly apprehended than either. But
oh gods! as soon as I came within the Guards of the Court, I found
them melting in tears, from whence I concluded, 'twas some strange
thing which had so proportionate an influence. This general Grief
produced so general a neglect of all things but of the celebrating it,
that without so much as being question'd, I came (by the knowledg
I had of all the Palace) to <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Anti-Chamber, from whence
I heard in the Room where she lay, so many and so high evincements
of sorrow, that I concluded, that which then invaded me, was but
too-justly grounded. The first operations of mine being a little miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
I took the confidence to look into that sad Chamber: But
great gods! I had no sooner done so, than I fell into it, my spirits
abandoning me at the sight of the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s being dead on a
Couch, and <hi>Zephalinda</hi> by her. The fair <hi>Emilia</hi> too, with disshevel'd
hair, drown'd eyes, and wringed hands, acting grief so passionately,
that I concluded 'twas more easie for her to have been dead, than
to live in a Misfortune which render'd the being so, so necessary.
The noise I made in my fall, made some of the Princess's women run
to learn from whence it proceeded; one of them in charity flinging
some water on my face, wash'd off that colour with which I was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd,
and thereby discover'd who I was, having formerly known me:
My senses being return'd, she that had been my Physician, went and
told the disconsolate <hi>Emilia</hi> of my being there; who in a languishing
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:96335:258"/>
pace came towards me, and with a voice which was so, told me, At
length, <hi>Symander,</hi> at length the gods have wearied themselves with
having persecuted a Virtue as great as the Cruelty which has done
it; and made the Tyrant <hi>Arsaces</hi> know, that when they deny a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
to Innocence, Death will afford it one. His not believing this
Truth, hath forc'd the Divine <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to act it; the effects of
whose high Constancy for your Prince, is yet clouded by a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the fair <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> who thought Death so unconsiderable, if
it came in competition with her Friendship, that not to have the last
suspected, she has embrac'd the first. Here the fair <hi>Emilia's</hi> sighs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what they had so often attempted, I mean, cut off her relation,
which yet was as efficaciously continued by her tears, which spake both
the sadness of the Story, and evidenced what was due unto it. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Symander,</hi> at the remembrance and repetition of these fatal passages,
so sympathiz'd in the grief of which he was making a description, that
it hinder'd him from continuing it, which was a performance both <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavasdes</hi>
and <hi>Callimachus</hi> could not condemn, because they sympathiz'd
in it. It was almost a quarter of an hour before the Auditors could
beg the Speaker's continuance of his Narration, or that he could obey
them; which at length he thus did: My impatience (said <hi>Symander</hi>)
was too high to continue any longer ignorant of the Cause of our
Loss, especially when what was the impediment as to me, was the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of it: I did therefore conjure the fair <hi>Emilia</hi> to acquaint
me, by what strange ways the gods had effected so strange an end:
To which she told me; <hi>Arsaces,</hi> since the delivering up of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
to him by <hi>Surena,</hi> so augmented in his Passion, and she in her
Resolves of declining to reward it, that many foresaw such extreams
could not but produce proportionate effects. The News of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
defeat divesting <hi>Orodes</hi> of Fear, Desire took so absolute an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
over him, that in the criminal dictates of his, he so importunately
press'd the Princess to reward his Flame by a Hymeneal Crown, that she
declining it, he vow'd by all the Oaths his fury could invent, That if in
five days she alter'd not her inclination, he would satisfie his in a way so
fatal, that she should be convinc'd, 'twas not for want of power that
he so advantageously perswaded her to his bed. This he esteem'd a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
warning; for amongst his Domesticks he solemnly protested, He
would have that by Force, which he could not by Composition; and to
evidence this was his resolution, immediately he sent all his Guards to
inviron the Princess Appartment with this strict Injunction, That none
without a license under his own hand (but his Menial Servants) upon pain
of Death should speak with her: And lest her Resolution might frustrate
the designs of this, he permitted not any Instrument which could act
Death, to be either in her, or any of her Domesticks power. Three days
of the five were expir'd in the punctual observance of his Orders, when
towards the evening the Princess <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> by the permission of the
Guards, came into <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber; and after she had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with her Friendship, and her own sad condition, by her tears, she
told her, The permission, Madam, I have obtain'd of paying you this
duty, is upon a score I am so far from making use of, that could I fancy
you capable of listning to it, I would employ it to an opposite end: for
<hi>Arsaces,</hi> but upon the pretence of my coming to solicite you to be his
Queen, would not have permitted it; I was forced to promise what I
never intended to perform; though it is probable, by that Friendship
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:96335:259"/>
he knows I pay <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> which too it may be he mistakes for a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he thought my interest concurring with his in depriving you of that
generous Prince, might render me a fit Agent for such an end: but that,
Madam, of my coming to wait on you, is to know which way I may
prevent it: there is no difficulty which my Zeal will not deprive of that
Name, and I shall find none in my own condition but to live to behold
you any's but his. This generous declaration (<hi>Emilia</hi> continu'd) had
a proportionate retribution, and this further Answer: I have not, fair
<hi>Zephalinda,</hi> so misemploy'd the time of my confinement, as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
'tis secur'd with so much force and care, that I am not now to seek
an election, but how to act mine; your assistance, in which is the only
and the highest obligation you can confer either on <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> or me:
I find Abstinence is a Sanctuary I cannot reach: if I had known it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
what I am fully convinc'd of now, I should not have implor'd from
you so dangerous an obligation: but my ignorance which causes this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
will I hope procure your Pardon for my making it; and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
will invite you to grant a request, which you cannot deny with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being accessary to a guilt nothing can equal but your Repentance
for not having prevented it. Madam (said <hi>Zephalinda</hi> in a Flood of
Tears), I conjure you to suspend any violence against your Life, till my
next visit, which shall doubtless present you with your deliverance, or
with the power to act it. I will obey you (<hi>Parthenissa</hi> reply'd); but
remember, if you violate this engagement, you assume <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s Crimes.
Which if I do (she answer'd) may I suffer the punishment due unto
them. <hi>Zephalinda</hi> immediately left us; and from the time she did so,
till her return (which was the morning of the last day) <hi>Parthenissa</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
it all in finding some expedient to extinguish her life, should her
friend by some strange accident be hinder'd from bringing of her one;
and at length elected that fatal and only remedy, of stopping her breath
with her Linen, which by the countenance <hi>Zephalinda</hi> put on at her then
entrance, she concluded would be absolutely necessary: and in those
resolves she told her, I observe (Madam) by the sense you have of my
condition, that Death only can change it; the necessity of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
will I hope invite the gods to pardon it, they would not leave me
but one way to avoid a transcendent sin, if that it self were a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
one: A Martyr acts his own death, and yet thereby acquires that
glorious Title. My affection for <hi>Artabbanes</hi> has been confirmed by as
many vows, as my zeal has been to the gods, who might too justly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I would decline these, were I capable of declining those. I alledg
not these reasons to confirm my self in my resolution, but you; that you
may receive as much consolation in the Cause, as I shall in the acting of
it. These fatal words were deliver'd with much less emotion, than
they were heard with; and the Divine Princess evidenc'd the certainty
she had of another Life, by the little disorder she resented at the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
of this. The fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi> having silenc'd her tears and sighs
(too just retributions not to be repay'd either to <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the resolution with which she bore it) thus reply'd, Since I last
had the misfortune of leaving you, time has been strangely active; and if I
gave you any hopes of your deliverance, 'twas because I had assum'd
some pregnant ones of it. For <hi>Surena,</hi> who had some few days past ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up a firm belief that <hi>Orodes</hi> would more than solicite your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
began some private levies of men to prevent it; which <hi>Arsaces</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
discover'd, either by intelligence, or by the probability of the
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:96335:259"/>
thing, took so short a space for the reception of your positive Answer,
that it prevented your intended relief, with that certainty with which
it was design'd: yet when I informed my Brother of the Kings resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yours; in the Dictates of Rage and Pity he went to him, and
told him, with a countenance which spake his heart, as much as his words
did: When I resign'd up the Princess <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to you, 'twas, Sir,
upon terms you confin'd your self to by so many solemn and reiterated
vows, that though it be the common Faith you intend to violate them,
yet it cannot be mine, till it be confirm'd by your own avowing it.
<hi>Arsaces,</hi> who had then but one of his Domesticks about him, and who
judged by <hi>Surena</hi>'s countenance and abrupt Question, he was in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fit to attempt any thing that was desperate, if your condition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to be so, return'd him this Answer: I believe so many's assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that faith, proceeds from the as many knowers of <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s
usage of me, which is such, that it may with too much reason perswade
them to believe, I am sooner capable of any thing, than of such a neglect.
I hope, Sir (<hi>Surena</hi> reply'd) though this may be other mens belief, yet
it is not your resolution; for that sacred contract you made with me,
was not conditional, but absolute: so that no ill usage of hers to you,
can render legitimate a resembling return of yours to her. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
I had of your Passion, and of the impossibility of her receiving
and rewarding it, made me intently careful to leave you no way of
violating your engagement, but by violating your oaths, which will
raise more to revenge such a performance, than your Power can to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it. This resolute and true reply, so incens'd the cruel <hi>Orodes,</hi> who
(by the then coming into the room of many of his Guards and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
to learn the result of their meeting) now no more apprehended
to disclose what he was confident could not be prevented, and which
he only fear'd the discovery of; upon that score, told my Brother with
a furious Look and Tone: Traytor, that canst have reason enough to
make thy Kings actions appear as Crimes, and wantest it when thy own
are more undeniably so. The Tyes thou hast to <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> are but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental;
and those thou hast to me, are natural: yet in thy late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
thou couldst with lesser scruple violate thy Allegiance, than thou
now reproachest me with violating my Promise. Thou didst in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
leave me a latitude for the acting of mine, and canst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
me but with that for which thou art my Example: Nay, that
Contract thou hast so often mention'd, and by which thou wouldst tye
my hands, sets them at liberty, especially to the punishing of thee for
having attempted it: For 'twas thy Rebellion gave thee that seeming
Power of making one of my Vassals confine me from acting my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon another; now that force being dissolv'd by which thou didst
this Crime, I have much more reason to punish thy having extorted such
a promise, than thou hast to demand the performing of it, since I but
assume a Power I indisputably had before thy Treason eclips'd it: but
thou canst not exact the performance of a forc'd engagement, but thou
must remember what thou didst to procure it, and that will vindicate
me for not observing it: Thou, by cancelling the first obligation, hast
taught me to punish thee in the repetition of thy fault; and by making
Force to be Justice, thou hast render'd that Art which destroys Thine, to
be much more so. <hi>Surena</hi> sensibly wounded with this language, reply'd:
You reproach me, Sir, with your own Fault; for 'twas you, not I which
cancell'd the first obligation; and though this was but then evident to a
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:96335:260"/>
few, yet by what you have since menac'd the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> with, you
have render'd it now so to all, and made my performance as clear to the
world, as it was then to me. The obligations between you and your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are mutual; they promise you obedience, and you them protection;
you then first broke your Engagement, before I did mine; and I never
drew my sword against you, but to keep you from a greater Crime than
that it self was. And though you alledg my confinement to you was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and to the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> accidental; yet when you consider up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what score I ty'd my self to her Interests, you will find it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from a Duty, unto which that you challenge is much subordinate.
'Tis the Duty I owe the gods; and that obliges me more to preserve the
Innocent, than my birth does to obey you; especially when your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are of a quality that carry in my disobedience the justification of
it. Whilst you govern'd within your own Laws, I gave you that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
due to you in them; and was more prodigal of my blood to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and encrease your Power, than when you misemploy'd it, I was to
oppose it. Nay, after you were seemingly converted, I brought you
home a Victory from a people that hardly ever knew what it was to lose
one: I was in hope the gods, by shewing how successful my Sword was
for you, would have invited you to Actions which it can only be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in. But I now fear you will render me unavoidably guilty: for
drawing my Sword against you, for her, cannot render me more criminal
in your esteem, than the not doing it will render me so in the judgment
of the gods, and of men. Here (continued <hi>Zephalinda) Arsaces</hi>'s fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was uncapable of a longer silence, which made him interrupt <hi>Surena,</hi>
by saying, Traytor, Thou hast not only the wickedness to run into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
but to declare that performance a greater Duty, than the not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
acted it. That Power which thou shalt know and feel is absolute,
thou wouldst make conditional, that it might not punish thee: but that
Sin thou shalt be convinc'd is one, even in the punishment of it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou alledgest thou never drew'st thySword against me, but to keep
me from a higher crime than that it self was; I will repay thy kindness
in the imitation of it, and by thy Death hinder thee from a greater Sin
than the commanding of it is: yes, I will punish in thy intended Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
what thou tiedst me from in thy acted Rebellion; and the gods,
who knew how unjust that concession was thou extortest from me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
thee in new Crimes, that thou might'st be rewarded for the old.
My Justice only is clouded with this misfortune, that thou hast but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Life to appease it with, since thy relapse deserves the deprivation of
that, and consequently thy first Sin will continue unpunish'd. <hi>Orodes</hi>
at the end of these words turn'd to the Captain of his Guards, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to seize on <hi>Surena;</hi> who seeing his Life was lost, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
yours, or your Honour; resolv'd whilst it lasted, to act some
such performance as might repair the shortness of it, and the length of
those Miseries it had so unfortunately involved you in: Therefore as the
Captain of the Guards came to take his Sword, he drew it, and past it
through his Body; then crying out to <hi>Arsaces,</hi> You shall go with me,
Sir, into another World, to learn this great Truth, That to kill you is a
less Sin than that you intend against <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> or the permitting it;
he ran furiously at him, and though so many hands endeavour'd to stop
him, yet all they could do, was to put his thrust so much aside, as that
what was intended to the Body, only pierc'd his Clothes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Surena</hi> more
troubled that he had mist his design, than at the punishment he knew
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:96335:260"/>
attended his having assum'd it, was returning; and though with a fury
but equal to his former, yet certainly had had a superior success; when
all that were present flew upon him, and forced his sword out of that
hand, which if any longer left, had doubtless acted a greater piece of
Justice, than the Guards did in preventing it; and that which so much
contributed to this easie Victory, was the deep consternation amongst
those few friends of <hi>Surena</hi>'s which were present; who not fancying he
would have put things to so precipitate and high an issue, fell into an
amazement, which prov'd as fatal to him, as if it had been their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.
The pale and trembling <hi>Arsaces,</hi> observing <hi>Surena</hi> was disarm'd,
and that some of his Guards were going to revenge his danger, and
their Captains death, by the acting of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, cry'd out to them, Hold;
I command you on your Lives not to touch him: for the inflicting of a
sudden Death will relish more of Passion than of Justice; and his Crimes
make him a fitter Sacrifice for the last, than the first. Then commanding
a Gentleman (who he made in that instant Captain of his Guards in the
room of him that had freshly lost that Office with his Life) to look to
<hi>Surena,</hi> as he would answer it with the loss of his own; he forthwith
gave order for a Scaffold to be erected before the Palace-Gates, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protested, That on it, before the Sun-set, <hi>Surena</hi> should lose his
Life. He heard these last words as he was carrying away, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
turning about with a Countenance altogether quiet and serene, he
told <hi>Arsaces,</hi> I thank you Sir, and I conjure you to keep your vows;
for the next satisfaction to the prevention of <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s dishonour, is
not to survive it. <hi>Arsaces</hi> only reply'd by a shaking of his head; and
by a second Command having made <hi>Surena</hi> to be carried away, forthwith
sent to the chief Tribunal of Justice in <hi>Selutia,</hi> to sit and condemn him.
This Order was no sooner publish'd, but a Proclamation was also, That
whosoever appear'd in the Streets with Arms (except those of Guard)
should dye without Mercy: and those that any way related to <hi>Surena,</hi>
which were found in <hi>Selutia</hi> after the expiration of one hour, should be
liable to the same penalty. This so precipitate and brisk a proceeding,
with the securing of <hi>Surena</hi>'s person, and the placing of Soldiers in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
convenicnt Post, so terrified those Partizans of his already in the
Town, that wanting a Head to employ their Swords, they pay'd an exact
Obedience to the Proclamation, and involv'd such of their Companions
as they met coming to <hi>Selutia,</hi> in the same Crime. <hi>Surena</hi> therefore was
tamely brought before his Judges, before whom he only would say, That
all the ill he was guilty of, was, That he had not acted what they were
condemning him for having attempted. This short Reply made the
Trial the like; so that immediately he was adjudg'd to lose his Head;
and by <hi>Orodes</hi>'s command, who all the while was present, was sent to the
Scaffold to have the Sentence perform'd, This advertisement being
brought me, I went to the cruel King, not to beg <hi>Surena</hi>'s Life, but
only the permission of seeing him lose it. <hi>Arsaces</hi> granted my request,
either not to disoblige his pretended Solicitress, or to punish my being so,
in the sight of so fatal a spectacle. I found my poor Brother on the
Scaffold, who seeing me there, assum'd a joy I thought his condition
uncapable of: but I soon observ'd from whence it proceeded; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
he told me, You see, Sister, I am now going to lose my Life
for her, to whom I had given it: and if the now cause of my Death
could but extinguish the just provocations she has had so often to wish it,
I should esteem it at a higher rate than she can deplore the loss of it. Tell
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:96335:261"/>
her, I conjure you, that with joy I embrace my present condition, since
I consider it as inflicted on me for having obstructed her desires; and
from thence I cannot but conclude, That since the gods so exemplarily
punish a Passion which never had any other design than to be voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
approv'd of, and rewarded; they will doubtlesly act much more to
the magnifying of their Justice upon a Flame which already is burnt
into desires of Lust; and they will as certainly perform it while <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s
desires are but desires; lest if once they were turned into action, they
might be as uncapable of a fit punishment, as he of a resembling sin.
Conjure her, <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> to make this use of my Death, that it may
bring both her and me a satisfaction, which it may be any other way
will be deny'd to both. I confess the gods have made me so miserable,
that all my performances have hitherto evidenc'd my adoration was not
a debt to her, but to my self. I do therefore beg you by that Friendship
and Relation which is between us, and by my last Breath, That upon my
score you will pay her all the services you are any ways capable of; that
one of the Family may in some degree repair the Sins of him that was
the chief of it; that <hi>parthenissa</hi> may thereby know (what my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
performances have not clearly manifested) that my Care of her
was for her; which I hope she will not doubt of while I lived, since the
effects of it will continue when I am dead. My last Request is, If ever
you see the generous <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> beg him, when he remembers what
I have done, that he would also remember what 'twas invited it; and
then he cannot judg the fault greater than the inducement of it: he
will be too generous to hate me in my Grave; and I more than hope
his resentments will dye with the object of them. <hi>Surena</hi> having thus
spoken, embrac'd me, and took his eternal leave. Then going to the
other extremity of the Scaffold, he conjur'd the people to prevent their
King's Sin, since they could not but participate in the punishment of
it: for the gods would consider every Accessory as a Principal; and
esteem those as guilty which hinder'd not <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s dishonour, as
him that acted it. This was all he said to them, lest a longer discourse
might have been interrupted. His Soul, after she had thus disburthen'd
her self, seem'd to have more than a knowledg of those happy Fields
whither she was taking her eternal flight; for when he was laying down
his Life, he did it with much more resolution than he had that took it
from him, who perform'd it by separating the Head from the Body at
one stroak. The Spectators at that fatal blow gave one common groan,
and by killing the Executioner, shew'd how much they detested the
Execution. Their Grief too had not contented it self with so mean a
Sacrifice, had not <hi>Orodes</hi> in person at the head of a thousand of his
Guards, come, and by killing some of the Multitude disperst the rest.
The poor <hi>Surena</hi>'s Body I carry'd away with me in the same Chariot I
came in, and lay'd it in the Sepulcher of our Family. Here (said <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>)
the fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s weepings put a period to her words; in
which just duty the sad <hi>Parthenissa</hi> kept her such faithful company, that
one might have concluded she reserved no Tears for her own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
she gave so many on <hi>Surena</hi>'s. Happy <hi>Surena,</hi> that in one single
performance couldst so efface the Crimes of thy Life, as to have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
of it so nobly deplor'd, and even by her which had most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to rejoyce at it. The first that interrupted the silence, though not
the weeping, was <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> who told <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> I have (Madam)
been so unfortunate to your Family, that if you will not grant me on the
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:96335:261"/>
score of Charity, the means of that Death which I implor'd, confer it
on me at least on that of Revenge; my Misfortune and my Condition do
equally require it; and you cannot in the performance more oblige your
resentment, than you will me. It may be that the greatest misfortune <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>
relish'd at his Death, was, that he left me behind, and the eminent
danger too he concluded I was involv'd in by <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s Lust. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of my Life will also redress those apprehensions in him, and it
may be afford him a proportionate joy, when I shall carry him the news
how faithfully you have observ'd his Desires. 'Tis not Madam (said
<hi>Zephalinda</hi>) upon these invitations I am come to pay you my engagement;
'Tis upon your own and <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s account that I do it: for I find
your condition is uncapable of all remedy but by that which will in the
future exempt you from needing any other: Thereupon taking out a
little vial, she presented it to <hi>Parthenissa</hi> with more Tears than would
have fill'd it; and told her, In this, Madam, you will find that Sanctuary the
gods have deny'd your Virtue; which I should have offer'd you sooner,
but that my Brother's Physician, who compos'd it, was so near death him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the hearing of <hi>Surena's,</hi> that he could not earlier give me this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of his Art: He assures me it is of a nature so subtil, that it conquers
the Vitals as soon as it touches them; and will afford you as little pain in
the operation, as you will resent after it. This is a Present (said the fair
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> wiping away her Tears, and kissing it) which I have too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time remaining to acknowledg sufficiently: but if in the other World
our Condition admits the paying of services, I will present you with those
there, which mine here denies me the power of retributing; and as a
signal earnest of this Truth, I leave you the generous <hi>Artabbanes</hi> as a
Legacy: she deserves him best, that does most for him; and you in this
last performance have so clearly done so, that the very Party is also the
Judg and Acknowledger of it. You, that when the gods cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> fit for him, can do it, do become more so your self;
and it may be those Powers had no other way but this, to absolve <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s
Constancy from becoming so much his punishment, as to prefer
<hi>Parthenissa</hi> before <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> who in all perfections is as much my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
as in a perfect Flame I am at least her Equal. The fair <hi>Zephalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
was about to reply, when one I had plac'd to discover when <hi>Arsaces</hi>
was coming, came running in to tell me so, which set a period to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
they were engag'd in, and made <hi>Parthenissa</hi> uncover the little
Glass, and say, 'Tis now no time to think of any thing, but by Death to
prevent what is much more to be fear'd. With these words in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
she drank the fatal Poyson, with a Constancy great as our Grief. I
was (continued <hi>Emilia</hi>) so drowned in Tears and Sorrow, that though
the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> spake many things as remarkable as her very perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
yet all I can remember she said, was, a deploring the invitation of
her death; which was such, that her hate for the infamous <hi>Arsaces</hi> might
seem to have an equal share in it to that of her Passion and Constancy
for your Prince. <hi>Zephalinda</hi> in the mean time went to a window, as if
it had been to discover how near <hi>Orodes</hi> was, but alas it was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbedly
to pledg <hi>Parthenissa</hi> in a resembling Liquor, which as soon
as she had perform'd, she return'd to her, but with a serener countenance
than that with which she had left her; and holding up the empty Vial,
told her, This, Madam, will be my witness, that I serv'd not my self, but
you, in acting what the gods had left you but one way to perform. Your
Virtues shine so clear, that whilst I have them for my Guides, I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:96335:262"/>
be mistaken in the way to felicity, nor the end; and though this be
a high Truth, yet it cannot Transcend this other: That the obliging.
Poyson I have drunk will not more certainly make me wait on you
now, than the beholding of <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s Grief, would have made me do
it hereafter, when it may be the Then performance, would have relish'd,
of what the Now will absolve me of. I had looked like your Murtherer,
not your Friend, had I not thus waited on you; so that what my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
leads me unto, my Reason and my Interest do; which are Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that none can condemn with so much Justice as that with which
I obey them. The fair <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> for a while only in Tears and in
embraces acknowledged the disobligingness and gallantry of this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
in which latter, <hi>Zephalinda</hi> held her company so strictly, that I
thought they would prove as unseparable to each other, as misfortune
had been to both. She which last drank the Poyson was the first that
spake, and to the best of my remembrance these were her words:
Having now paid the Just and Antedated sacrifice of our Tears to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabbanes</hi>'s
condition, when he shall be informed of ours, let us abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in the future silence them, lest the Tyrant should ascribe ours
to his being one; and thereby, though he be actually denyed the
Triumph of his Love, he imaginarily possesses that of his Revenge.
The Cruel <hi>Arsaces,</hi> said <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> cannot so Transcendently delude
himself, as to ascribe my Tears to his being so to me, when he sees
what the fair <hi>Zephalinda</hi> has done, which is of such a Quality, that
he will find his Triumph, though we are never so intent to cloud it; for
I am resolved he glories as much in the destruction of Virtue, as of
Feminine Honour; so that what my resolution has denyed him in the
Latter, yours has conferred on him in the Former. Had I been single
in my suffering, I should have retrench't from him that Victory; for
to have been denyed his hopes, would have as much eclipsed his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as the Destroying of Innocence and Constancy would have
created it. I may, said <hi>Zephalinda,</hi> as justly alledge he is not the cause
of my Tears, since a Death which I esteem so transcendent a misfortune,
as to believe the acting of my own after it, is a less one than to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
it, may well peculiarize my Weepings to that solarie cause: But
whilst we continue ours, he may at least have some shadow for Insulting;
whereas if we intirely silence them, and in their Place assume an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded
serenity, he may consider the Way in which we evade his
Power, to be as sublime a Trouble as the End. Here the fair <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
was interrupted by the arrival of two of <hi>Arsaces</hi> Guard, whom
he had sent to clear <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber of all, but her self: These
barbarous Men could not terrifie those whom Death did not; all the
effect they produced, was a Joy that their sanctuary was so near and
certain, and that they had so timely resolved upon it, that the burning.
Lust of the Tyrant could not be more surely a sin, than that thereby
they had put him out of the Capacity of acting it. To render
that yet the more so, <hi>Parthenissa</hi> began to protract the time, that
the Fatal poyson might conquer so much of her Life, as to exempt
her as well from the beginnings as conclusions of <hi>Orodes</hi>'s Insolence,
by reasoning with these infamous undertakers of a resembling imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And though what had begun, too pregnantly evinced the temper
of their Souls, yet the Eloquence of innocence conspiring with the sight
of so many admirable and growing Beauties which were so near an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fading, operated so efficaciously, that they retired (dissolving into Tears
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:96335:262"/>
unto their King, and acquainted him with the cause thereof,
which alas was so far from having a proportionate Influence on Him, that
what had converted them into Water, turn'd him into Fire: For judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Cause by the production, they could not assume a higher
Pity, that those Beauties were to be gathered, than he did a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
that he was to gather them. Nay, his Reason was so obscur'd,
that he concluded they wept not that such Perfections were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
but only that They were not to do it: so that having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them an high reprehension for what deserv'd the contrary, he
went hastily to <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Chamber, in whose countenance there
was less disturbance than in his; which being a Truth as visible as
the occasion was not (at least as to him), he told her, At length,
Madam, I hope the greatness of my Flame, and Perseverance, has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Victory, which cannot be higher in it self, than my desires
were of it; and your Face gives me a satisfaction which nothing can
hardly augment, but your Words giving me the same assurance which
your Looks do. If my Looks, Sir, (said the Princess) gives you any
other assurance than my Words have still done, they hold no correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with my Heart; so that either you are mistaken in my Looks,
or my Looks in me. If (said <hi>Arsaces</hi>) I am mistaken in the signs of my
Felicity, I am certain I will not be so in the fruitions of it: and what
the Power of my Love cannot effect, that of my Authority shall. Yet
I must confess, I much rather ambition to derive my happiness from the
former, than the latter: and therefore I again prostrate at your Feet
my Crown, as well as Liberty; either deserves the retribution I but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
for both: your denying me my right, authorizes me to take it;
and therefore you render force legitimate, if you necessitate me to it:
My passion is as uncapable of Delay, as Change: and had my Promise
given you a longer time to form your Resolution, my love must have
contracted it; so that I am come to know my Fate, which cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of the least suspension, because my Life cannot, if now deni'd that
alone which can give it a relish, as well as continue it an existence. In
short, Madam, this is the hour I must receive or take my Felicity; and
the gods have as little the Power, as I, of altering this Resolve. I
know (said <hi>Parthenissa</hi>) you will be as much mistaken in your hopes,
as you have been in the signs of them. The gods could not call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Protectors of Innocence, and refuse a Sanctuary to mine:
Know, Cruel <hi>Arsaces,</hi> I have one above your Power to violate; which
it was high time to ascertain, when what should have been the cure of
your Lust, you consider'd as an Authority to act it: Know further, I
despise your Crown, and Death to avoid it; which is a Resolution I
might derive from a double cause; for had not my Constancy been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
enough to engage me to assume it, your usage would be; which
cannot with more necessity invite me to that performance, than I will
act it with joy. The degenerate <hi>Arsaces</hi> believing <hi>parthenissa</hi> had some
fatal weapon in her power, that thus authoriz'd her to threaten an enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
King (for he knew her too well, to have so much as a suspition of her
thus proceeding upon any other score), suddenly seized upon both her
hands; and after commanding one of his Guards to search her, and to
take the cause of her Confidence away, he told her with a furious Look;
The certainty of that Sanctuary which made you with such insolence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
me, and my Flame, is not in your Power, and you are in mine; so that
what you refus'd with scorn, if you implor'd with tears, I would now deny
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:96335:263"/>
to you in the same manner you declin'd the acceptance of it from me;
nor can the contempt you have endeavour'd to throw upon my Crown,
be justlier revenged, than by the Power of it, which by all that's Holy,
shall no longer beg what it can take. Thereupon with a countenance
which relisht nothing but of Fury and Lust, he commanded those
which waited on him, to clear the room of all but <hi>Parthenissa;</hi> which
was going to be put in practice, when he that <hi>Arsaces</hi> had commanded
to search and Disarm her, told him, there was nothing about her which
could destroy her Life, for the certainty of which, he engaged his own.
This strange assurance made all the Tyrant's other Passions resign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into Admiration, and that suddenly yeelded it self unto Joy; for
he believ'd <hi>Parthenissa</hi> had acted the part of Despair, as a last essay,
and then was resolv'd to yeeld to what she could not resist. This flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
faith was created in him, by her having no visible means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
his Power, in a time when he had solemnly sworn to conquer
her with it, if by his Passion and Perseverance he did not do it by
then. Neither did the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s silence all this while a little
contribute to this belief: but alas! hers proceeded from another
Cause; for by this, the Poyson had made its fatal Approaches so near
the throne of Life, that the hand of Death began to draw an obscure
vail over the vital spirits, and so greedily to seize on the Noble dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a Nobler soul, that <hi>Arsaces</hi> had scarcely prostrated himself on
his knees, to make <hi>Parthenissa</hi> those retributions, the joy of his last
faith had made him esteem so just a Debt, when she began to retire to a
Pallet, which she had no sooner reach'd, than she fell on it; and having
breath'd a sigh, and indistincty pronounc'd your generous Prince's
Name, the Beauties of Vermillion resign'd their Empire to the colour
of Innocence; the fairest Lights which ever did or shall shine, became
eclips'd with an eternal Night; and the admirable Soul of a Body that
was so, took her flight to another, but could not to a fairer Dwelling.
Here the faithful <hi>Symander</hi> was so vanquish'd with his own Relation,
that he had not the power to continue it; neither had his generous
Hearers that of desiring him to do it: for they were so sensibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this deplorable and fatal part of his Story, that their Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
resign'd its room unto their sorrow, to which they so justly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confinedly
abandon'd themselves, that they fully justified the vast grief
of <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> since they resenting so much only by their being Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Loss, they could not but expect much more from him that
was the sufferer of it. At length they were so much friends to their
Grief, that they conjur'd the afflicted <hi>Symander</hi> by a continuance of
his Story, to divert them in some degree from being so intent on that
sad part of it. <hi>Symander,</hi> to obey this Command, by many struglings
with his grief, finally obtain'd so much the victory over it, as thus to
prosecute what he had brought so near to a conclusion: This relation
of the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s death, which invaded you with so high a
sorrow, had so resembling an operation on the unconsolable <hi>Emilia,</hi>
that it was above an hour before her tears and sighs would permit her
to continue her relation, which she did in these terms: As soon as the
Barbarous <hi>Arsaces</hi> saw the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi> pale and breathless, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so too, and continu'd so long in that condition, that I began to
think Grief had perform'd the Office of Justice, and had alone pay'd
that debt to the Tyrant, which all the world does owe him: But he
soon return'd again from his seeming Death; but it was to act such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:96335:263"/>
on himself, that I thought his recovery was a more signal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment,
than his dying could have prov'd. In a word, whoever had
seen the demonstration of his sorrow, would have concluded he was
the sufferer, not the Author of the Loss. At length (tir'd with the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his grief), he continued quiet for a time, and then ran to <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalinda,</hi>
at whose feet prostrating himself, he conjur'd her to tell him,
Whether the fears of his violence hast cast <hi>Parthenissa</hi> into a seeming,
or had made her cast her self into a real death. But this fair Princess
gave him an Answer by a Demonstration; for in that moment of
time the fatal Poyson had so far conquer'd her heart, that she had only
life enough left to recover the Pallet on which the dead <hi>Parthenissa</hi> lay,
and in embracing and kissing her, to expire; as if she ambition'd in
the last act of her life, to evince the perfect friendship she had pay'd
her through the whole course of it. At this second death, <hi>Arsace</hi>'s
grief turn'd into Fury; he began to believe himself so horrid a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
that whoever he spake unto, was instantly struck with Death;
which though true, had been a punishment inferior to his Sin: And in
this belief, he ran frantick up and down the Chamber, crying in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
accent and voice of horror and despair, Gods! give me <hi>Parthenis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
again, give me <hi>Parthenissa</hi> again: And after a thousand fruitless
offers of seizing on the Swords of some of his Guards, he at length ran
his head with so much violence against the angle of that great Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
which stood by the Pallet on which the dead <hi>Parthenissa</hi> lay, that
he thereby not only receiv'd a large hurt, but fell speechless and sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
at <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s feet; where he continued grovelling in his blood,
till his Guards carried him into his own Appartment to have him drest.
Here (said <hi>Symander</hi> to his generous Hearers) the fair <hi>Emilia</hi> ended
her Relation, and began again her weeping in such excess, that it even
brought an accession of grief to that which invaded me by her fatal
Relation: Neither do I believe she would have ended her Tears,
but with her Life, had not the care of <hi>Artabbanes</hi> been greater than
any she had of her self. For remembring one of her Princess's last
injunctions to her, was to let <hi>Artabbanes</hi> know her last to him, was,
A passionate desire of pardoning her Murtherer, and a more passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
one of surviving her Murther; that as she carried into the other
World the highest Model and Example of a perfect Love; so that
he would continue the like in this: and that <hi>Parthia</hi> was misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough in suffering her Kings Sin, without the addition of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
the punishment of it: she conjur'd me to assume that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whilst she would pay the dead Princesses the duty of Funeral
(if her grief left her life enough to do it, which she hoped, yet fear'd
it would). <hi>Emilia</hi> further enjoyn'd me, by an immediate return to
<hi>Artabbanes,</hi> to prevent the fame of <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s death; and by my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
him with her last desires, endeavour to prevent his. This I
esteem'd so necessary, that after having at <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s and <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s
feet, pay'd the tribute of my Tears, and as much as I was capable of, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to lessen the fair <hi>Emilia</hi>'s, I went to <hi>Sillaces,</hi> and after to <hi>Lynda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dory</hi>'s
Appartment, where alas, I learn'd, that in the confusion of the late
disorders, she had been carried away by some Arm'd and unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and that the generous <hi>Sillaces,</hi> with what friends he could assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in so short a warning, was gone after her Ravishers. With these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessional
griefs, of the unhappiness of my Prince's sister, and of my fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so necessary and powerful. Consolers as I was confident <hi>Lyndadory</hi>
                  <pb n="600" facs="tcp:96335:264"/>
and <hi>Sillaces</hi> would have been to <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> I directed my steps to him,
but with a heart so replenisht with sadness, that nothing could in degrees
equal it, but the justice with which it was so. You may (generous Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
in some proportion imagine the strangeness of my then employment,
when I knew not whether I ought more to apprehend that any other
should give my Prince the fatal Intelligence of his Misery, or that I
should: but the second day I came to the place of his residence,
where the horror which possest me, by the perfect knowledg I had of
what his sorrows would be, at the information I was to give him, so van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
all those resolutions I had assum'd during my journey, that
not only I invok'd death as a pleasing expedient to have declin'd it,
but would have made use of it, had not I fear'd that <hi>Artabbanes</hi> by
my that way of avoiding telling him his loss, might have receiv'd it
worse, than by a verbal doing it. But though this faith tied up my
hand, yet by those sudden and various emotions which did agitate
me, I felt a burning shoot into my veins, and that at first with such
violence, that I was in hope the Fever would confer that obligation
on me which my affection to my Prince hinder'd me from conferring
on my self: or at least if his despair for the deprivation of <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
were greater than his obedience to her, my sickness would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
me to wait on him, without the help of my resolution or duty.
At length (generous Hearers) at length I came into <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s
Chamber; and though it were in high tremblings, with a pale look,
and in vast disorders; yet they hardly equal'd my Prince's at the
sight of mine: That generous Courage which had so often outbrav'd
Death in all its Horrors, which had so often unmoved endur'd, nay,
courted the highest Dangers, was now conquer'd, and yeelded unto
the bare signs of sorrow in another: but alas, they were signs so
clear and evident, of the only way in which fortune and the gods
had power to invade him, that in my being uncapable to tell Him
his Loss, he did but too plainly read it. But at last, when <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
perceiv'd that I had the power by words to acquaint him with
what my emotions made him apprehend was the cause of them; He
told me; Are not the gods yet (<hi>Symander</hi>) weary of persecuting
the miserable <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> by the punishments they have impos'd upon
him, but that they must also afflict him more cruelly and sensibly through
<hi>Parthenissa?</hi>
For doubtless thy grief is too great for any misery
which can wound me, but through her. Has any of my Rivals by force
or delusion got her again into their power? Or has her Justice now
discover'd those defects in the over-valu'd <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> which her mercy
so long hinder'd her from seeing and punishing? Speak, I conjure thee,
for thy looks have as much of misery for me, as my Fate can impose upon
me. Alas Sir (I reply'd) I must confess your Ryvals have at length
got the success; but 'tis not your old ones have done it, they have been
but Instruments to convey her from themselves, as well as you. Your
present Rivals are such, that 'tis as great a Sin, as Impossibility to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
them: In the infelicity of your Love, the excellency of your choice
is manifested; and in the highest misery of Love, you have the highest
occasion of evidencing yours hath been the most pure, and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
for if in your Passion, you were only concern'd in the object of
it, she is now in joys; which will be so far from clouding yours, that they
will be as uncapable of encrease, as of change. You have now, Sir, no
more the occasion of repining for the unequal'd <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> since the
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:96335:264"/>
gods, who deni'd her you, but to possess her themselves, have thereby
taken from you the justice of such a proceeding; and have confin'd
you, if you grieve, to evidence 'tis for your self, not her; who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you were of a contrary principle, and that her felicity would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
yours, staid not till your new Rivals called her, but elected to go
to them. Thereupon I told him particularly all that I had seen, and all
that I heard from <hi>Emilia;</hi> but I had no sooner ended this fatal relation
(what through the indisposition which then invaded me, what through
the horror and grief which I saw invade my generous Prince) then I fell
at his feet; and though my senses at that instant did not abandon me, yet
it was but to be the more cruel, and the more tormenting; for I saw and
heard, that after <hi>Artabbanes</hi> had fetch'd a groan from the bottom of his
heart, which shewed the greatness of it, by its being capable to contain so
much, he cri'd out; You are dead fair Princess, you are dead! and you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for <hi>Artabbanes:</hi> Ah too great, and too ungrateful heart, which canst
know this, and yet canst live after it; but I will punish thee for need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any help but thy own to act thy duty; yes ungrateful heart, thy
debt to my Princess shall be paid, though not by thee; My Resolution
shall have the glory of that performance, since thou hast declin'd it,
or at least art so long in acting it. Thereupon he ran furiously to his
sword, and having drawn it, resting the hilt upon the ground, and
leaning the point to his Breast, he cri'd out; Divine <hi>Parthenissa!</hi> what
you have done, leaves the miserable <hi>Artabbanes</hi> nothing to do, but to
admire and follow you: the first he has still perform'd, and the last he
now performs. These words were no sooner utter'd, than by falling
on his sword, I saw the fatal point of it, having pierc'd his body, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
all bloody, as if it blush'd at the sin it had acted. Oh Gods!
(<hi>Symander</hi> cri'd out) why did you give me life enough to see, and
not life enough to prevent it? and yet it might be just in them, that
for my being griev'd they were happier than my Prince, I should
behold and not hinder his despair. But <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> who knew how
requisite Death was to his condition, and how opposite I would be to
that only cure, as if having opened two doors for his Soul to free her
self from that dark Prison she had been confin'd unto, were not enough;
he striv'd to employ that little life was left, to take even that little
totally away; and doubtless had repeated his wounds, if my horror
thereat had not given me a supernatural strength, and enabled me on
my hands and knees, to crawl to him, and to seize upon the hilt of his
Sword, on which I took such sure hold, that spight of all his struglings,
I kept him from additional wounds, and by my loud and reiterated cries
drew some of the people of the house to my assistance; who with me,
by meer force wrested the fatal weapon out of his hands: which being
effected, my Prince with a look in which a crowd of different passions
were distinctly visible, told me, And is <hi>Symander</hi> too become my enemy?
ah! if thou hast a hatred for <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> canst thou more signally satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it, than to see him send himself out of the World? and if thou hast
a Friendship for him, why dost thou retard his following <hi>Parthenissa?</hi> with
that fair Name his Senses abandon'd him, and left his Body inviron'd
in that deluge of blood which had flow'd out of it. This Swound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which at first made me tremble, soon after made me rejoyce;
for thereby the Chyrurgeons (who then came) without resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
search'd and drest his Wounds; and having laid him in his
bed, they there endeavour'd by powerful Cordials to recall
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:96335:265"/>that life, which seemingly had forsaken him. I caus'd them to lay me
in a Pallet contiguous to my Prince's bed, where in expectations which
ravish'd from me all sense of my own condition, I waited for the effects
of the Chyrurgeons Art and Prescriptions. But alas, the fear I assum'd
that death had eternally closed his Eyes, could not transcend my grief
when that apprehension vanquish'd: for the first proof he gave of life,
was an action which sadly demonstrated how intent he was on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
of his: for finding his wounds bound, he tore away all things
the Chyrurgeons had apply'd to them, and endeavour'd to make his
hands finish what his cruel Sword had but begun: But those I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to watch and hinder the effects of his despair, by plain force, and
by my command, held his hands; at which he assum'd so high a rage,
that in words deliver'd with much more strength than I thought he had
been Master of, he told me; Cruel <hi>Symander,</hi> and much more cruel than
Fortune, yea than <hi>Arsaces</hi> himself; they but make the highest cure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
but thou after it is so, do'st deny it me. I conjure thee by that
love thou once did'st pay me, by that adoration I pay my Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
who I now behold cloathed with more Glory, than she has been
with misfortune; and by those Tears (unusual Advocates for me) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to follow her: with that he shed such a shower of them, that
I was for a time unable to answer him in any other language; which
my Prince perceiving, he told me; Canst thou then, <hi>Symander,</hi> give
me the highest signs of pity, and deny me the least Act of it? and
canst thou be sensible of my miseries, and deny me their only Cure? Ah
Sir (I reply'd) what is become of that Fortitude which in all the
strangest and intricatest Revolutions and vicissitudes of Fortune, has
always made you triumphant over her? Has it abandon'd you, or have
you abandon'd it, in a season where it was most necessary? What will
the World believe to your prejudice, when you your self act so much
to it? your Virtue, which now is the admiration of all, will be believ'd
the mistake of all; for when any thing can befall it greater than it self,
'twill be thought it hath acquired its glory, not from its own strength,
but from the weakness of its opposers. Hold thy peace (said my
Prince, interrupting me) hold thy peace; 'tis no wonder thou hast lost
thy concern for me, when thou hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost thy reason; which if thou
hadst not, thou couldst not but see, but that the fortitude thou so
flatterest me with, never aspir'd at so certain a felicity, as thy cruelty
hinders her from possessing: That which thy madness terms despair,
my reason terms fortitude; which high vertue is not given us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
our miseries, but to overcome them: Mine are of so peculiar a
quality, that if my fortitude should continue my Life, 'twould act against
it self, as much as against me: No <hi>Symander,</hi> my Fortitude never so
well deserved that Name, as now that it has made me chearfully elect
to act my own Death, which certainly cannot be a sin, since 'twill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
me to the Divine <hi>Parthenissa:</hi> had the gods design'd me Life,
they would not have taken away hers; and the duty of not killing
my self, by which I must be banish'd from my Princess, cannot be so
great as that of killing my self, to be restor'd unto her. But Sir (I
repli'd) what Face can you present your self to your Princess with,
when to act your satisfaction, you decline your duty? and leave this
world without revenging your self on him, who sent her out of it,
and divested you of all felicity in it? This (said <hi>Symander</hi>) I spake
in expectation that such a duty might qualifie for the present the</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="603" facs="tcp:96335:265"/>violence of his despair, and that time might silence it in the future; but
alas, I soon found the vanity of that hope, by my King's thus answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me: If I were not certain 'twere a higher Mercy to kill one of my
Princess's Votaries after her death, than not to do it, I would not beg,
the blessing to become my own executioner; and therefore I will not
so much oblige the Tyrant, as to become his: The gods, who know
the greatest Crime merits the greatest punishment, do now evince that
truth on that Monster; for the certainty that to be the fair <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s
executioner, is the greatest Sin, cannot be a greater Truth, than after
having acted it, 'tis the greatest punishment to want fortitude to be his
own; and since Life is the torment of my Princess's Murtherer, how
can it be the satisfaction of her Adorer? besides, I am confined, and I
believe on this score of her last commands, from embruing my hands in
his Blood. So you are (I replyed) from embruing your hands in your own;
and that request, nay, rather command, imposed with much more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
than the other; ah Sir, consider how much your despair offences
your Love, and how unlike this proceeding is to any other of yours,
where your Princess's commands have acted you? you can decline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the executioner of her Murtherer, to obey her; and you will
not decline becoming your own, when you have a higher confinement
to it: this is not to obey her, but your self, or rather your despair, by
going to her in the other world, when she orders your continuance in
this; and when that order was pronounced with her last breath, you
shew you value something above her commands, which is a crime
you have hitherto declined with so much care, and she has acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
with so many Elogies, that your now running into it, evinces
nothing so pregnantly as that her Memory has not the same Ascendant
over you, which her Life had, though she lost hers, but to continue
the more gloriously in yours; consider too, I beg you Sir, that the
more painful the obedience is, the more meritorious 'tis; that common
obeyings are not fit sacrifices for <hi>Artabbanes</hi> to offer, or <hi>Parthenissa</hi> to
receive; and that the crime of disobedience cannot be the way to so
admirable end, as is your reunion with her: Yes, Sir, I tremble to
think how she will receive you, when the last act of your Life is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the last command of hers. Thou dost delude thy self, <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi>
thou dost delude thy self (said my King, interrupting me); the
Divine <hi>Parthenissa</hi> knew too well the greatness of her loss, and the just
sense I should have of it, to enjoyn me the impossibility of surviving
it: I rather ascribe that to thy cruelty than her commands; or if she
imposed that on me which thou sayest she did, it was but the better to
illustrate the vastness of my Love, which by contemning my own Life,
her Revenge, and my duty to her commands, manifests it is superiour
to all those; so that by my Death I shall but evince a truth I most
ambition'd in my Life; nay, which at any time I would have laid down
to witness; which is, that my Love was as much above all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
as the Beauty which inspir'd it was above all which ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
that Passion: Let not then thy cruelty deny my Flame the
most glorious manifestation of it; nor let me derive that from Time
and from Torments, which my resolution is so obligingly ready to
confer on me without any; nor flatter thy self with believing Time
can change a resolution, which is as irrevocable as that misfortune
which has made me so justly assume it: no, <hi>Symander,</hi> thou mayst tye
my hands, thou mayst hinder them from acting my Death, but thou canst
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:96335:266"/>
not hinder me from dying; for I here solemnly protest by the highest
powers, and by my Princess who has increased their number, that I
will neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, till the want of those confer that
felicity on me, which thou hast so barbarously deny'd me. Then
turning himself from me in a shower of Tears, he seemed to continue
those reproaches which they had interrupted. I cannot (generous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
continued <hi>Symander</hi>) acquaint you with what grief I entertain'd
this vow of my Kings; I knew his resolution too well, and the power
he thus had to act it, not to tremble when he pronounced it; and if at
first I had any consolation, it proceeded from an unremoved resolve of
sharing in his despair, if at last I could not silence it; but this being a
thing which related to my self only, was soon expelled by a throng of
cares, which my duty to <hi>Artabbanes</hi> introduced, who continued so
cruelly true to his vow, that for four and twenty hours after he had
made it, not all my Prayers and Tears could invite him to take any
refreshment by food or sleep; by which he was so extreamly weakened,
that he had not life enough so long again to repeat his abstinence: which
when I told him in sighs and weepings, he answered me only in smiles,
and by them seemed to tell me, that though his way of dying were not
so expeditious as that I had denyed him, yet it was as certain. In this
unequall'd misery, when both my reason and my hope had resign'd
themselves unto despair, the gods inspired me with an invention which
till now I never did discover, and which but to you I would not.
<hi>Symander</hi> having nicely looked whether any were in the Chamber,
and whether his Prince were within hearing in the Gallery, and being
satisfied negatively of both, thus resum'd his discourse; I knew too well
my King's despair was so great, that no remedy which was not so, could
suppress it, and that his vows were not to be cancel'd, but by those to
whom they were address'd; 'twas therefore, that calling to me a Youth
which belonged to the house in which we lay, and who during <hi>Artab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>'s
indisposition, had shewed so much concern in it, and care for
him, that I concluded him sit for any employment conducible to his
recovery, I enjoyned him in the blackest hour of Night to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
behind the hangings, which was next my Prince's bed, and by
unripping a part of it, to convey a hollow Cane as near <hi>Artabbanes</hi>'s
Ear as he could, without putting it within the reach of his hands, and
then in a counterfeit hollow voyce to speak thrice (and with some
good interval) these ensuing words, Artabbanes, <hi>go to</hi> Hierapolis, <hi>there
consult and obey the Oracle.</hi> The time to execute this being come, which
was three hours after it was design'd, and indeed my Prince's condition
could not well admit of a much longer delay, the faithful Youth had so
well fitted all things, and so excellently disguised his voice, that I almost
began to believe the gods (who knew nothing but themselves had the
power to suspend that despair they had involved him in) had undertook
that Justice: As soon as <hi>Artabbanes</hi> heard the voyce, he called me, and
told me, <hi>Symander,</hi> does my Fancy conspire with thee, and with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
or do I really hear a voyce, which commands me an obedience
more cruel than thy late usage? I was about to reply, when the second
time, the first words were repeated, and they were no sooner ended,
than I cryed out as surprized: At length, Sir, at length, you see my
endeavour to hinder your despair, was not my Sin, for if it had been
one, the gods would not have imitated me; nor can you any longer
doubt their care, when to evince it they make use even of a Miracle:
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:96335:266"/>
He was about to have reply'd, when the voyce the third time enjoyn'd
what it had twice before; after which, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> cry'd, No, <hi>Symander,</hi>
I never doubted of their care, nor of their making use of Miracles to
shew it; but then that care, and those Miracles were only to torment
me: Ah gods! how can you, having done so little for me, expect
so much from me? and why do you enjoyn me life, when you have
not only taken from me all the Felicities, but also left me all the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it? Ah Sir! (I reply'd) the reason of Man is too short and
dull to reach and pierce the Ways and Providence of the gods, which
commonly delight to contradict, and cross what we do seem most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of; partly by shewing us the uncertainty of humane things, to
wean us from them; partly, to have us center wholly in their power,
which such a dealing is no ill way unto: Thus have the greatest Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
been as often cur'd, as the greatest Joys have been extinguished.
Whilst <hi>Parthenissa</hi> was alive (said <hi>Artabbanes</hi>), that is, whilst there
was a possibility I might be happy, I did undergo all my afflictions with
a silence great as themselves, and with a resignation which shew'd I knew
the ambition of my Flame deserved those sufferings, which I alone ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to that cause: But now the cruel gods have made my miseries past
their power to cure; With what justice can they hope to retain so much
Empire over me, as to expect I should act a performance they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot reward? and how can the destroying of so unfortunate a
Life be esteemed a crime? for where an obedience is above recompence,
the disobedience cannot merit punishment: No, <hi>Symander,</hi> I rather
believe they command me to continue in this Life, that I may not
see my loss in the next; for what <hi>Surena</hi> and <hi>Arsaces</hi> have been to me
in this world, the gods are in the other. If they are, Sir (I reply'd),
then <hi>Parthenissa</hi> governs them, and consequently she would not permit
them to command you a fruitless Misery. Alas (said <hi>Artabbanes</hi>), dost
thou not know, that though my earthly Rivals did adore her, yet they
did persecute me? why may not I expect from Heaven the like effects,
from the like Cause? No, Sir (I answered), for whilst the fair <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>'s
Soul was inviron'd with an earthly dwelling, she could not see
so cleae as now she is all Spirit; so that now you need not doubt her
knowledg to foresee your ills, nor her power to prevent them; and
therefore you have nothing to do in this command, but to obey it: I
am confident, Sir, this miraculous injunction proceeds entirely from
your Princess's care; your now Rivals, if you made your own exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
the way to her, might deny you the end you thereby expect,
and that too without making any new Laws, but by their observing
those to which all Mortals are confin'd; perhaps she has represented so
truly your Miseries, that she has procured a command to the Oracle
of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> to ordain you by death to put a period to them, that
thereby the guilt of the performance may be taken away, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the punishment, which doubtless she apprehends as much
upon her own score, as yours. If that were so (said my King), why
did not the same voyce which enjoyned me to seek my Death (for
that only can be my cure) at <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> command, or at least permit
me to act it here? The cause, Sir (I reply'd) is evident; every common
Lover, in the first dictates which his Mistriss's death inspires him with,
would fly unto that cure you now are so intent upon: But when you do
evince, that Time which heals all others griefs, does but increase yours;
and that every moment your Princess's death makes you willing &amp; ready
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:96335:267"/>
to act your own, that will evidence your Love and sorrow equal their
causes, and that the effects of your Passion are as peculiar, as the
Beauty which inspir'd it: Even <hi>Arsaces</hi> would, in the first fury of
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Loss, have done as much as you: shall the deprived hopes
of a vicious Flame, have as high a production as those of a virtuous one?
Ah Sir, provoke not the world so much to mistake the nature of your
grief, as to give them but equal illustrations: shew us what was but
fury in the Tyrant, is Reason in you, by acting your Death for <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>'s,
when he has forgotten hers: The highest production of grief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to dye; and he having elected that, you have no way but by Time to
make the difference: It would cloud the beauty of your performance,
if it were in the heat of your Loss; and make that look but like the
greatest Rage, which is the greatest Love.</p>
               <p>I should be endless (generous Hearers) did I tell you all our reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
'tis enough you know, that at length I obtained the victory; and
that which chiefly gave it me, were the two inducements I mention'd
last. I must not omit acquainting you, that I elected the Oracle of
<hi>Hierapolis</hi> for the place where my King was to learn his Fate, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because it was the most celebrated in all <hi>Asia;</hi> but also because it was
so distant from the place we then were in, that it would necessitate
him to a perfect recovery, to enable him to perform the journey. Never
any man lost his health with more unwillingness than <hi>Artabbanes</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his; and those things prescribed him he took in such a way,
as manifested Life was his obedience, not desire: Should I tell you
all his extravagant reasonings, his vows of acting his own death, if the
Oracle gave him any ambiguous answer, and his high repinings against
the gods, for having kept the power of punishing, when they had
lost that of rewarding him, I should injure your patience too much;
in apprehension I have done so already: I shall conclude all by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qainting
you, That I wondered he had so much obedience for those
Powers for whom he had so little respect; to whose Providence he yet
owed the recovery of his wounds; which being so well clos'd as to
permit him to ride, we began our journey, which was the saddest
that ever was perform'd; for my King for the most part kept a deep
silence, and when at any time he broke it, it was in sighs and groans,
or in repeating the fair Name of <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> evidencing thereby, that
she only occasion'd them. The third Night we came into a Village,
whither after <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was gone into his Chamber, there came
certain Gentlemen from <hi>Selutia</hi> all in mourning, of whom I had
the curiosity to enquire what News that place afforded; one of them
told me, That the Death of the Princess <hi>Parthenissa,</hi> and the Princess
<hi>Zephalinda,</hi> took up all the sorrow and business of the Court; and that
<hi>Arsaces</hi> continued in as deep a Melancholly, as if the cause of
it had been recent; that he had lately celebrated their Funerals
distinctly: That though <hi>Zephalinda</hi>'s was with much solemnity and
State, yet <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s was with much more: and that in imitation of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Funerals for <hi>Hephestion, Arsaces</hi> had caused all the Spires,
the Pinacles, and the Battlements, both of the Temples and the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in <hi>Babylon, Niniveh,</hi> and <hi>Selutia</hi> to be beaten down; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that all in his Empire (which were able) should for the
revolution of twelve Moons wear close Mourning: That he had caused
<hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s Statue to be made by an admirable Artist, which he had
erected at the end of a large Gallery all hung with black, which had no
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:96335:267"/>
other light but what it received from One hundred Chrystal Lamps,
whose flames were continually fed by an artificial oyl, which hardly
admitted of any diminution: That at the feet of this Statue, he had
placed his own, kneeling, weeping, and fixing his Eyes on that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who seemed to have communicated to the Alablaster her living
insensibility: That every day when <hi>Arsaces</hi>'s grief gave him strength
to visit this Gallery, he constantly spent half of it at the fair Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess's
feet, and imitated or relieved his Statue. This Gentleman further
told me, that though these Deaths, and this strange way of deploring
them in <hi>Orodes,</hi> left little room for other sorrows or discourses; yet
some there were who did both grieve and wonder at the strange for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the Princess <hi>Lyndadorie</hi>'s Palace, at her being carried away
by unknown persons, and at the not hearing since what was become
of her, or the Prince <hi>Sillaces,</hi> who the same Night had follow'd
her Ravishers. This News (continued <hi>Symander</hi>) I thought unfit to
communicate to my Prince, lest it might bring an accession to that
grief, whose extinction was my highest care. The next morning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we continued our journey with our accustomed silence; but
when we came within a days journey of this Palace, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
an accident which I cannot but acquaint you with. Not far
from the Road in which we travelled, near the side of a little Grove,
we discovered eight Horsemen, who assaulted a Gentleman that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himself with so much resolution, as shewed the difference of
the numbers did but render the Combat equal. My Prince moved with
the generous Strangers Courage, and apprehending at length he might
stand in need of his, pulling down the sight of his Helmet, with his
Sword drawn he gallop'd up to him just as one of his Enemies had
killed his Horse; by whose fall he was so much disordered, that
had not <hi>Artabbanes</hi> by a furious blow killed one of those who press'd
him the most, the Stranger undoubtedly had exchanged Fates with his
Enemy: <hi>Artabbanes</hi> having thus reliev'd a danger which was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any other way to be effected, suspending his Sword in the Air, and
commanding me to do the like with mine, address'd himself to one
who seem'd to be the chief of those who had begun so unequal a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and told him, Though I am ignorant in the cause of your Quarrel,
yet I have some reason to suspect it is not just, because you depend upon
your numbers for your success; yet if you please to acquaint me with
it, I will ingage my self no longer to defend your enemy, than I
find my self confin'd unto it by the duty of Justice. Whoever
thou art (the other replyed with an insolent tone) who hast made
thy self my Enemy, and then wouldst have me make thee my Judg,
know, our difference does not concern thee; but since thou hast
made thy self so much a Party, I will make my self the Judg, and
do condemn thee to share in that death thou vainly endeavourest to
hinder. Thereupon he darted his Javelin at my Prince, who received
it in his shield, and then charged him so briskly, that he found his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
proportioned his insolency; this usage had no unfruitful return:
and though it deserved a signal punishment, yet he received an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that was so, dying by the hand of <hi>Artabbanes.</hi> By this time the
Stranger had mounted himself upon the Horse of the first man that was
killed, and furiously thrusting into the midst of his enemies, by two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable
blows, lessened as many of their number; the rest amazed at
our assistance, and at those admirable deaths, made so faint a defence, that
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:96335:268"/>
the Combat soon ended with their Lives. The Stranger then lifting up
his Helmet, which was shaded with a great Plume of Feathers of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora
colour, as his Armour was of the like, and garnish'd with such
refulgent Stones as sufficiently manifested their Master was of no small
Quality, came to <hi>Artabbanes</hi> with so much Grace and Majesty, that
I was charm'd with it, and told him; Generous Stranger, I owe you
my Life, and will at any time pay you that debt with as much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
as I contracted it: but I must beg your pardon if a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
much higher than my Life does now force me from you, which
I should acquaint you with, did I not justly fear the time it would take
up, would hinder me from paying a duty to a Princess, who before the
obligation you placed on me, merited all mine, and even yet does merit
the most of it: But that I may not hereafter be guilty of that ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
which my highest concern makes me seem guilty of now, I must
desire to know my Protector's Name, that when the Beauty I serve has
no further employment for my Sword and Life, I may know where to
offer both to him to whom I acknowledg I owe them, and for whom I
will with much more joy employ them. <hi>Artabbanes,</hi> extreamly satisfied
with this Gallantry, and as much mov'd with the Cause of that haste
the Stranger seem'd to be in, repli'd: My Name, Generous Stranger,
is as inconsiderable as the little Service you are pleas'd to think I did
you: But were it as great as your acknowledgments, I should yet
conceal it, lest you might thereby believe I pretended to a debt you
have but too abundantly satisfi'd already. You retribute so much for
so little, and you thereby appear so worthy to be oblig'd, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but offer you my service in the relief of that Princess you are so
intent upon; the inequality of your late Combat, makes me believe
your Enemies are not acted by the Principles of Honour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if not for your own sake, yet for hers you so much value, and who
perhaps sets a greater value upon your Life, than you do on your own,
refuse not the assistance of a Sword which has been fortunate enough
against all, but him that wears it. This strange conclusion had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
given the Stranger a curiosity of desiring to know what occasion'd
it, if the great haste he was in, had not supprest it; which was such,
that it hardly gave him leisure to make this Reply: You cannot be so
unjust to your self, and me, as to conceal your Name upon the score
you mention; and therefore I believe some high Cause invites you to
it, which shall suspend my desire of learning it: Your Virtue I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
will guide me to you, as certainly as your Name, and upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
considerations; that way of enquiring after you, will be more
noble, and as sure. I confess I have the high Felicity of being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by the Beauty I adore, and the misfortune of having an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and Rival, who cares not by what ways he reaches his ends; but
by your valour you have cut off his chiefest assistance; and his Crimes
are such, that I should injure the Justice of the gods, if I thought
a single Sword which strikes with Justice, were not able to act my
Revenge, and my Princess's Deliverance. Besides, I am so much your
debtor both by act and offer, that I should give my self a greater
trouble by becoming more so, than by undertaking alone the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of those few Enemies your Courage has left me. That is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
(said <hi>Artabbanes</hi>) which your civility only has rais'd; but your
Valour is such, that by those effects of it which I have seen, I can hardly
doubt of any other: I wil therfore only beg your pardon for having done
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:96335:268"/>
your Rival more service by delaying you, than I have done you, in
endeavouring to assist you; and that you will give me so obliging a
Proof of your having granted it me, as the acquainting me with your
name. I should obey you (said the Stranger) if it were not to make
my self fruitlesly known unto you, which would be a manifesting of my
self too low, both for the obligations, and the sense I have of them:
Permit me therefore to decline that honour, till I derive it from my
services, which I will seek you over all the world to pay you, as soon
as I am put into a capacity of doing it, by having paid mine unto my
Princess, the necessity of whose condition I beg may appologize for my
now leaving you, which nothing else could make me hope for, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
me to. Thereupon saluting my Prince with much humility and
haste, he turn'd about his Horse, and followed the Tract of a Chariot
with such celerity, that we soon lost sight of him. <hi>Artabbanes</hi> was so
much taken with the good Meen and civility of the generous Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and so sympathized in his concerns, that he suspended his usual
melancholly to entertain me with them, which yet he did but for a
little time, and then in his accustomed manner, continued his journey
hither, where we arrived without meeting any thing else worthy your
knowledg, and where my King has received an Oracle; which makes
me hope what I considered as an invention of mine, was an inspiration of
the gods.</p>
               <p>'Twas thus <hi>Symander</hi> ended the History of his King's Life, and then beg'd
Pardon from his generous Hearers for the length of his Relation, and for
all those faults he had been, or those omissions he might be guilty of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artavasdes</hi> and <hi>Callimmachus</hi> having both took notice with much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
of <hi>Symander,</hi> and acknowledged how well he had acquitted
himself, went to <hi>Artabbanes</hi> in the Gallery; who, though they found in
an excess of sadness, yet by the knowledg of its cause, they were
so far from condemning, that they participated in it. But the good
<hi>Callimmachus,</hi> who knew the gods promises to him, and their power
of performing them on those two Subjects, endeavoured by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> to change his sorrow into Faith, which yet prov'd
but a fruitless attempt: For <hi>Artabbanes</hi> knew the utmost extension
of Faith, was to act above reason, not against it; and therefore found
in his own condition, two high a certainty of its admitting a change.
Several days were spent in such successless employments, and to
recover the two Princes out of a dangerous relapse into which they
were fallen, whose cure had retarded their intended Sacrifice ordain'd
them by the Oracle: But <hi>Callimmachus</hi> finding the Princes in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
health, and esteeming it high time to obey the imposition of
the gods, as also believing the Beauties of a little Forest in which
the Temple of <hi>Adonis</hi> and the Vestal Nuns stood, might be some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to their sorrows, invited them thither: It was not above forty
furlongs from the Temple of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and a place of so much
delight, that a Melancholly which was capable of ease might be
certain of receiving it there. <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> who burnt with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to make a journey into <hi>Parthia,</hi> to offer his Sword and Life
unto <hi>Altezeera,</hi> which the words of one of his dying Enemies made
him apprehend she stood in need of, would before this invitation have
gone whither his love and duty called him, had his health permitted it;
but now it did, and <hi>Artabbanes</hi> also (who he was unexpressibly troubled
to leave:) a new difficulty arose which was like to interrupt his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:96335:269"/>
for a few days, which was, that those Arms he had wore at his
coming to the Temple were too rich, and too well known to his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
Enemies (as by a fatal experiment it had near been demonstrated)
to travel with them into a Countrey where his only safety would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in his not being discovered: To redress which inconveniency, he
was forced to bespeak less-rich Arms in the City of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> (which is
not above Ten furlongs from the Temple) and those not being like to be
finished in a longer time than this journey would take up, he joyn'd his
desires to <hi>Callimmachus</hi>'s, which were so prevalent with <hi>Artabbanes,</hi>
that he Promised to accompany him in that little journey, so that during
it, <hi>Callimmachus</hi> would engage to acquaint them with his Story, which
having done, he took leave of them for that Night, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
early, he waited on them again. Though the way was but short,
being yet too long to be performed without Horses, the generous Priest
provided some for them as good as ever <hi>Arabia</hi> produced; and mounted
on one of that Countrey himself, they set forth. They had not gone a
Furlong, when the two Princes summoned <hi>Callimmachus</hi> of his promise,
which he found a much easier thing to have made than to perform, and
having testified this Truth by a few sighs, which a reflection on those
fatal accidents he was going to relate extorted from him, he at length
with a deep Melancholly, began the Relation of his Adventures, in
these terms.</p>

               <p>THE gods, who manifest they are absolute, as well over
Kings, as private Persons, and if they evince not their
being so as often on the former as the latter, it is only
because there are many more of the one Quality than of
the other (for in degrees of proportion, they have as
frequently, if not more, evidenced it on Monarchies and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
as on their subjects) have so clearly acquainted me with this
Truth, by those signal miseries they have involved that unfortunate
Family in, from whence I have the honour to be descended, that if my
words would not acknowledg their power, my condition must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though
by the Laws of a legitimate succession, I should now wear a Crown as
flourishing as most in <hi>Asia,</hi> yet I am limited to the governing of a few
Priests; which change I could never have digested, had not my fate
inflicted on me another loss of so peculiar and transcendent a quality,
that the loss of Empire is absolutely drowned in the fatal remembrance of
it. Great gods! (continued <hi>Callimmachus</hi>), had you only cast me from
the Throne of my Predecessors, and from all the joys and fruitions of an
early Monarchy, I had submitted to that fate with as perfect a resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as you could have expected from an Offendor, whose crimes
could not but be infinite, since his punishments are so; but alas!
why to this high misfortune would you add that higher, of seating me
in a noble Throne, only to precipitate me from it? But why do I repine
at the last unhappiness, when you thought me worthy of the first?
and how could I fancy you would inthrone me in the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s
heart, which was the highest blessing, when you would not inthrone
me in my Father's Right, which was but a common Justice? Here <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limmachus</hi>
breast was so contracted with grief by a reflection on what he
was engaged to relate, that it necessitated him to a small silence; which
his generous Auditors would have made use of, to procure his pardon
for their not having paid him those submissions due to his Real quality,
which their ignorance was guilty of, and consequently could only apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:96335:271"/>
for; but <hi>Callimmachus</hi> would not so much as listen to their
intentions when once he guessed at them, which absolutely to retrench
he made the greater haste to suppress his disorders; and having effected
it, he thus continued:</p>
               <p>I shall not scruple (Generous Princes) to acknowledg I am descended
from <hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Hunter;</hi> That <hi>Prusias,</hi> who
to all his other crimes, added those of betraying the great <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and of sending <hi>Minas</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> expresly to murther his Son the Prince
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> whom he had married very young unto the daughter of <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
then King of <hi>Pergamus;</hi> which Nuptial was no sooner celebrated,
than he repented it; for finding how much the young <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was
justly admired by all the <hi>Bithynians,</hi> and that his Son's virtues did but
render his crimes the more visible and detestable, he resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him by poyson, whilst he yet resided with him; and to this he was
the more inclin'd, by having the same belief of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> that he had
of himself; which was, that where the power of winning a Crown was
not wanting, the will of doing it was the like; and therefore he feared
the affection <hi>Attalus</hi> paid his Son-in-Law, would invite him to employ
his power for him, to which <hi>Prusias</hi> knew he must submit; not that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia</hi>
could not bring as many to resist, as he could to invade, but that
he knew his Tyranny had lost him his Subjects hearts, and consequently
he could expect no safety from their Arms. But <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to make good his Father's fears; yet having miraculously discovered
his intention of poysoning him, and avoided it also (for he that should
have given him the fatal Cup, mistook it, and by drinking it himself,
converted his sin into the punishment of it) he thought to put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a condition of ending both his Father's and his own fears, and knew
nothing could better effect the design, than by absenting himself from
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> which he did after his Princess had presented him with a Son,
which he also called <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> whom with his Mother he sent to <hi>Attalus;</hi>
whither he would not retire, lest the place of his retreat might raise those
jealousies, which he intended thereby to suppress. He therefore went to
<hi>Rome,</hi> not only as it was the fittest place to form and fashion him; but as
believing it a Sanctuary which <hi>Prusias</hi> durst not violate: for it was from
the <hi>Romans</hi> he had received his Kingdom, which he had forfeited to them,
by that assistance he had given <hi>Perseus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whose Sister he
had married. But nothing being able to suppress the Tyrant's cruelty,
when the dictates of Nature could not; he sent <hi>Minas</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to destroy
that life there, which the gods had so miraculously preserved in <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>
But <hi>Minas</hi> when he was to act his treachery, and had on purpose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagled
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> alone to walk on the banks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> was so overcome
with the Majesty of his Person, and the charms of his Virtue, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of executing his crime upon his Prince, he revealed it to him; and
afterwards made him so clearly sensible of the great hazard he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
be in of losing his life, if <hi>Prusias</hi> had power enough left to
destroy it, that he at length perswaded <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to go to <hi>Attalus,</hi> and
implore an Army able to bring <hi>Prusias</hi> to Reason; <hi>Minas</hi> assuring him
that as soon as he entred <hi>Bithynia,</hi> he would bring him forces so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that <hi>Prusias</hi> should not be able to resist. In brief, all this was
performed; and after a long and intricate War, <hi>Prusias</hi> scorning all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
was reduced to be King of nothing but the City of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi>
in which <hi>Minas</hi> had so good intelligence, and so many friends,
that they admitted <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and his Army by night, who before his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:96335:271"/>
prohibited all violence or incivility to his Father upon pain of
death. But <hi>Prusias</hi> at the alarm, fled in disguise towards the Temple of
<hi>Iupiter</hi> for Sanctuary; and being by the way met by some of <hi>Nicomede</hi>'s
Soldiers, though he told them who he was, was yet kill'd. This news
brought to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> he ran to the dead body, embraced and wept over
it, punish'd exemplarily all the Soldiers which had had a hand in his death;
then gave him a Regal funeral, and afterwards languished away his own
life. To him succeeded his Son <hi>Nicomedes</hi> sirnamed <hi>Philopater,</hi> who no
sooner came to the age of relishing a Scepter, but his was forced from him
by <hi>Socrates,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irnamed <hi>Chrestus,</hi> his only brother, and thereby necessitated to
seek protection in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> under <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> the King of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
whose daughter he married; and when she had presented him with a
Son also called <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> she engaged her Father in the War against
<hi>Chrestus,</hi> who being a greater Soldier than either <hi>Philopater</hi> or <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes,</hi>
not only, after a ten years War, drove them out of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which
they had invaded, but also out of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> and forced both the Kings
with the young <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to fly to <hi>Rome,</hi> where some years they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
imploring a <hi>Roman</hi> Army for their restauration, which they at
length obtained. The Generals were <hi>Mannius Aquilius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius
Cassius,</hi> whose Armies being small, they were ordered to demand an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
force from <hi>Mithridates Eupater,</hi> who having privately agreed with
<hi>Socrates</hi> to have <hi>Cappadocia</hi> if he would not assist the <hi>Romans</hi> in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> deny'd <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Mannius</hi> his assistance; who yet by
that influence the banished Kings had over their Subjects, defeated and
killed <hi>Socrates</hi> in a furious Battel, and re-seated <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
in those Thrones, of which they had been so long and so unjustly
deprived. But the poor <hi>Philopater</hi> had no sooner received his Son from
<hi>Rome,</hi> whose youth was as promising as either his Parents or the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynians</hi>
could desire, but that his Queen died; and that loss had so strong
an operation upon him, that he soon accompanied her, and left <hi>Bithynia</hi> to
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> my Father. I have given you this little account of my family
(the crimes whereof, though but inherent to one, yet the misfortunes
were to all) to let you see that such as are eminent in Title, are often so
in afflictions; that the gods by ruining the highest earthly felicities, teach
us thereby, that they are not too solicitously to be prosecuted by those
that want them, nor to be rely'd on by those which possess them; but that
they ought to be considered as things which will leave us, or must be left
by us: that we should be no more moved with the fruition, than with the
deprivation of them: and that these just considerations might instruct us
to fix upon that place where Fortune has no Empire, and to which Vertue
only has the title.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Bithynia</hi> knew few Superlours in extent, in fertility,
in the beauty and greatness of Cities, or in the multiplicity of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Inhabitants, when <hi>Nicomedes</hi> my unfortunate Father came to
govern it; and though he were a person replenished with all the
realities and ornaments which makes one worthy to ascend a Throne,
and to be setled in it; yet those Powers who from occult causes raise
some to a Crown that deserve it not, and tare the Scepter from some
who deserve to hold it, esteemed the unhappy <hi>Nicomedes</hi> a fit Subject on
which to manifest the last of these truths; and it was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that they acted their decree: When he came to ascend the throne, by
his Father's death, it was in so early an age, that he had a higher desire to
observe how other Kings did rule their Subjects, than he then had to rule
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:96335:272"/>
his own; or else he believed, by having a personal inspection into
the advantages and defects of the Regiment of others, he might the
more perfectly know how to carry on his own; but from whatever
principle it proceeded, and whatever danger he incurred; yet he was
unmoveably fixt to visit in a disguise the Courts of such Princes in <hi>Asia,</hi>
whom same had most celebrated; and therefore having intrusted his
affairs at home to the Prince <hi>Astyages</hi> his Uncle, and then apparent
Successor (a Person as eminent for the honest, as the politick part of
Government; but so strict a Justiciar, that he put his only Son to
death for having violated a Law whose infringement was to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with that penalty), he began his travels in an equipage fit to
cloud the greatness of his real quality, and yet sufficient to manifest he
was of no inconsiderable one. In brief, after he had fruitfully visited
all places fit for his curiosity, or benefit: he at length came to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
Court, then the most considerable of all others in every respect;
for though as then the Prince <hi>pharnaces,</hi> the Prince <hi>Ataphernes,</hi> the
Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and the Princess <hi>Roxana,</hi> were not come into the world;
yet there was such a confluence of other illustrious persons and beauties
which composed it, that <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was often heard say, That, to be
one of that Court was as good as to be the chief of any other. But
that which raised this opinion in my Father was, that the <hi>Pontick</hi> King
(who all the world knew was as violent as inconstant in his loves) had
then newly assumed a passion for the Princess <hi>Fontamyris,</hi> who was
only Heir to <hi>Cephines,</hi> a Tributary-Prince unto him; yet very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for his power and wisdom. This <hi>Amour</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Mithridates</hi>
youth, made his Court the most delicious place, not only of <hi>Asia,</hi> but
of the whole world. My Father too, being in an age very susceptible
of all the charms of such a place, it was not strange he had so high an
opinion of it, since all sort of gallantries shined there in their greatest
lusture. The next night after <hi>Nicomedes</hi> came to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> then the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> he was informed that the ensuing one the King
presented <hi>Fontamyris</hi> with a magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ick Ball; the great discourse of such
a meeting, and the greater of that beauty who was the cause of it, gave
my Father the curiosity to be a looker on; but he no sooner saw the fair
<hi>Fontamyris,</hi> than he became one indeed; and what his curiosity had
extended over the whole Assembly, a more pressing cause confined
to one of it: And though <hi>Nicomedes</hi> the more unob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervedly to gaze on
his new Conqueror, had retired himself into the throng; yet his good
Meen, and the advantage of his stature was such, that amongst many
who considered him upon those scores, as well as for his being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the fair <hi>Fontamyris</hi> did it so intently, that not only <hi>Nicomedes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and was concern'd in it; but <hi>Mithridates</hi> did the like too; and
they had both much more cause for both; when the fair <hi>Fontamyris,</hi>
by the rules of the Ball was to elect one to dance with, she chose my
Father out of the throng, who as much confounded as joyful at it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with a deep humility acknowledged the honour she did him (in
the <hi>Pontick</hi> tongue also, which he spake as naturally as his own) he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acquitted himself with so much grace and unconstrainedness in the
Dance, and observed the Cadence with so much justness and regularity,
that the Courtiers, who found how much his having done so, disgusted
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> could not find in their envy and malice the least rise to
manifest either; for the more curiously and nicely they examined what
he had performed, the more cause they found to esteem and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:96335:272"/>
it. And that <hi>Fontamyris</hi> might have as much occasion to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied
with his civility, as he had to be with hers, whilst he was
leading her to her place, he again made her so many handsom retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
for the honour she had done him, that if she had reason to
be pleased with what he did in the Dance, she had at least as much to be
so with what he had done after it. <hi>Nicomedes</hi> being obliged by the Rules
of the Ball to take out another Lady, he took one who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate next to <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamyris,</hi>
with whom he Danc'd, and then having saluted <hi>Mithridates</hi>
and all the company with much humility, but <hi>Fontamyris</hi> with much
more, he retired into the throng, where he continued as long as the Ball,
and in distempers, which till then he had never been acquainted with:
But (said <hi>Callimmachus</hi>) not having undertaken <hi>Nicomede</hi>'s story, but
mine, I will be as brief in his as I can, with obedience to what you have
commanded me concerning mine own: and therefore I shall in short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that my Father was so far engag'd in his passion to <hi>Fontamyris,</hi>
and so successfully made his Court, that at length it was not only her
opinion, but confession, that the difference between the Kingdoms of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was not near so great, as that between their
persons; for my Father had informed <hi>Fontamyris,</hi> and <hi>Cephines,</hi> of his real
quality, though he and they had conceal'd it from the <hi>Pontick,</hi> King, who
never knew thereof till <hi>Nicomedes</hi> had secretly carried away the Princess
into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which he did both by hers, and her Father's consent, who
yet durst not publickly own it, lest <hi>Mithridates</hi> resentments might have
vented themselves against him, who only was in his power. Soon after
in <hi>Nicomedia</hi> the Nuptials were re-solemnized openly, and with all the
magnificence a young King and a successful Lover could invent: But
alas! those joys were but of short duration, and like glorious mornings
which are the soonest over-cast, and turned to tears; for the lightning
of this Nuptial-Torch, was the flame which set all <hi>Asia</hi> on fire, was the
original of that fatal war which afterwards the world too well knew
by the name of <hi>Mithridatick;</hi> and was the occasion or pretence of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles out of <hi>Europe</hi> into the East, where they have
since extended their wings into the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> over which 'tis believed

proud Citizens done more for <hi>Asia,</hi> than the blood and swords of all her
Inhabitants. This great people jealous of their glory, or thirsting after
a pretence to encrease it and their Empire, so highly resented <hi>Mithridates</hi>
not assisting <hi>Mannius Aquilius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Cassius,</hi> in the recovery of
<hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> that they commanded those two Generals to
invade <hi>Pontus,</hi> and to make the loss of that great Kingdom the Penance
of the King's disobedience: But knowing the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was too
small for so great a design, by a solemn Embassy they invited <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
to joyn his Arms to theirs, and to suppress the Enemy both to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and Person. <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> who owed his Crown to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
who knew <hi>Mithridates</hi> Resentment would proportion his Loss, That
if he omitted this opportunity of depressing him, he would probably
never meet with such another; and perhaps in a heat of youth, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to mingle Laurels with his Myrtles, invited by Gratitude, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and Glory, added a <hi>Bithynian</hi> Army to the <hi>Roman,</hi> over both
which the Senate made him General; which they the more confidently
did, because his Education was <hi>Roman;</hi> and this Action made them
believe his Inclination was the like. <hi>Nicomedes, Mannius,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi>
found <hi>Eupater</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Pontus</hi> with a vast Army, which he had
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:96335:273"/>
raised to invade his Rivals Kingdom; but now to his grief and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

of this War would be endless: I shall therefore omit all the battels,

against <hi>Nicomedes</hi> Army, than all <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s besides. These great
Forces were led by Commanders, whose Gallantry rendered them
as formidable as their Numbers: besides <hi>Craterus,</hi> there was <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
who led a Phalange of Foot, so considerable both for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

that his Army only consisted of forty thousand Horse and

Fifty thousand foot, and six thousand all natural <hi>Bythinians:</hi>
and that the Empire of the Sea, as well as of the Land, might

to his own Subjects, he only told them: 'Tis this day, O <hi>Bythinians,</hi>
that you will decide from whom you derived your Originals; For
if you seek your safety in any thing but your Valours, your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

will not only stay, but even your King will believe, and you will
prove, That you are indeed descended from those Cowards which
the unfortunate <hi>Rhesus</hi> led to the relief of <hi>Troy,</hi> and which <hi>Diomed</hi>
the first Night conquer'd and dispersed: But if by your courages
you successfully court Fortune and Victory (for 'tis only by Valour
those are won), the world will know you draw your extraction from
the Lineage of the gods, and that <hi>Bithis</hi> the Son of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and
<hi>Thracis,</hi> was the noble Source from whence you are descended. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
said no more, neither indeed needed he; for the <hi>Bithynians</hi>
were so jealous of their pedigree, and so offended at their enemies
saying, they were descended from those <hi>Grecian</hi> Fugitives, that they
esteemed Death a much less misfortune, than to be denied their true
Original, or to have that false one imposed on them; upon both
which scores only, they had often in ancient times begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
bloody Wars.</p>
               <p>The Military Musick was beginning to invite the hearers, to drown
it in their shouts: when a Post came to <hi>Nicomedes</hi> from <hi>Fontamyris,</hi>
to acquaint him, that the gods had given him the unfortunate <hi>Callim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
(which name <hi>Arsamnor</hi> my Governour gave me at <hi>Athens;</hi>
it signifying in the <hi>Bithynian</hi> language, as much as unhappy at the
Birth; my own being <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> which yet I never wore, being but
too much known by the misfortunes of it). But with this desired
news my Father begun the Battel, having first communicated it to
the <hi>Bithynians,</hi> whose joy made the Enemy mourn; for carried on
with so high an Addition to their Valours, they acted things which
both the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi> admired. Neither did <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
performances exact a less debt; for having now a successor, he was
the more prodigal of himself, whereby all that durst resist him, soon
found the bloody punishment of that confidence. But alas! what
certainty is there of humane things? When the poor <hi>Nicomedes</hi> in
the height of his Glory, and at the head of a conquering Army,
from a single unknown hand, received a Dart, which piercing through
his Body, deprived him of speech and sense. The <hi>Bithynians</hi> by a
general groan solemnized his fall, and the <hi>Mithridatians</hi> imagining
what alone in so fair a way to Victory, could produce so strange an
effect; by a shout of joy acquainted the sad <hi>Bithynians,</hi> they knew
what made them so. But the passion of grief at the <hi>Bithynians</hi> loss,
being greater than their fury for it: and at the same instant <hi>Craterus</hi>
charging into their greatest Body, with his armed Chariots, brought
so general a disorder to <hi>Nicomedes</hi> subjects, that they scarce could
carry off his wounded Body; and the <hi>Romans</hi> with their Auxiliaries
seeing the <hi>Bithynians</hi> flie from that Victory they had so generously
courted, and almost obtained, despaired of recovering the day; which
they had much more cause for, when <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Arcathias</hi> charged
<hi>Cassius</hi> in front and flank, as <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> and <hi>Archilaus</hi> did <hi>Mannius,</hi>
and as <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an opposition, that I may therefore truly say, They got not the glory,
though they got the field. Some affectionate Servants of my Fathers,
believing when his side lost his assistance, they would also the Battel,
carried him away in a Litter past the fury of the execution, and then
by easie journeys brought him to <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> so happy he was in his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as to find by experiment, that the Fate of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hundred thousands had depended on his sword and courage; for whilst
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:96335:274"/>
those did act, Victory followed his side, and abandoned it when they
did not. Nor was <hi>Mithridates</hi> obliged only to one Element for Victory;
for his Fleet had triumphed on the Sea, as his Army had on the Land.
<hi>Betuitus</hi> presented him with the heads of <hi>Minutius Ruffus,</hi> and <hi>Caius
Popilius,</hi> the two <hi>Roman</hi> Admirals, who elected to share in their Navies
Fate, rather than to out-live it. And that <hi>Mithridates</hi> might have no
cloud to obscure his Glory, though the number of his Army exceeded
his Enemies, yet the number of those which fought, did not: for eighty
thousand horse and foot, which composed his last Battalion, obliged the
rest of his Army only, by their not contributing to their success. Ten
thousand <hi>Bythinian</hi> Officers and Soldiers, who that fatal day had lost
their liberty, were the next brought before <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who sent them
all as a present to <hi>Fontamyris,</hi> and as he said, as so many witnesses of the
error of her choice. <hi>Nicomedes</hi> as soon as he was recovered, rallied
of all his Armies, some Forty thousand Foot, and Four thousand Horse,
with which he attempted <hi>Mithridates</hi> Army, which was divided and
secure by their former Victory: But this Battel fought on the Banks of
<hi>Gargarus,</hi> was an exact Repetition of the former: My Father had the
Victory, till by wounds he was disabled from prosecuting and keeping it.
This second de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat depriv'd him of all hope of bringing his Fate to a third
trial, especially it being accompanied with the loss of the <hi>Roman</hi> forces;
for <hi>Quintus Appius, a Roman Praetor,</hi> was betrayed by his own Soldiers
to <hi>Mithridates;</hi> and <hi>Mannius</hi> was taken, and brought to <hi>Pergamus,</hi>
where after many derisions he was put to death, by melted Gold being
poured down his throat, thereby to reproach the <hi>Roman</hi> avarice. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
now seemed rather to make a Progress, than a War. The Cities
of <hi>Magnesia, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Mytilene,</hi> received him in triumph. By his
Lieutenants he conquered <hi>Licia, Pamphylia,</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> and at
length cross'd over the Mountain <hi>Scoroba,</hi> which separates <hi>Bithynia</hi> from
<hi>Pontus.</hi> It was then, the unfortunate <hi>Nicomedes</hi> found he could no longer
resist his Conqueror, and therefore having sent for the chiefest Nobility
of his Kingdom, and the chiefest Inhabitants of his Cities, he generously
commanded them to submit to that Fate he could not oppose, and not
to exasperate <hi>Mithridates</hi> by a fruitless fidelity to him.</p>
               <p>This rare and noble care, strangely affected those which were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the effects of it, who in tears and other signal expressions evinced,
they were not desirous, nor therefore unworthy of it; so that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> was necessitated to make use of his Authority, to absolve
his subjects from their Obedience to it, and thereby rob'd his Enemy of
a full triumph, by deposing himself.</p>
               <p>This great business being performed with as much sadness as solemnity,
he retired unto <hi>Fontamyris</hi>'s Cabinet, where they both sent for <hi>Arsam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Gentleman that had been Governour to my Father, and had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
that trust with so much fidelity, merit, and success, that they both
resolved he was a fit person to be intrusted with me. As soon as he was
come, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> told him; You see, <hi>Arsamnor,</hi> the gods for the present
have cast down the House of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> but perhaps they may restore that
Scepter to the young <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> which they have thought his Father
unworthy to hold; had we still continued in the Throne, you should have
had as great Demonstrations of our Bounty, as now we give you of our
trust, which is the care of our only Son; let him never know his name, or
his real quality, unless he appear worthy of both, and unless the gods rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him to a probability of recovering that right which we have lost. I will
not tell you <hi>Arsamnor</hi>'s joy at this high trust, nor the Queens grief, when
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:96335:274"/>
at once she was forc'd from the Kingdom and her Son: You shall only
know, that the next day after, the King and <hi>Fontamyris,</hi> having loaden
<hi>Arsamnor</hi> with Jewels, made him take a solemn Oath, never without
their consent to acquaint me who I was; and privately provided him
with a swift Galley in a Creek opposite to the shore of <hi>Greece</hi> (in
which Countrey <hi>Nicomedes</hi> enjoined my Governour to give me my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation)
they both left <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and not long after <hi>Bithynia,</hi> with
much less trouble than it occasioned in their subjects. The place which
my Father chose for his retreat, was the City of <hi>Celena,</hi> the Metropolis
of the greater <hi>Phrygia,</hi> whose King was a person deserved that title, and
so much his friend, as he was confident he would appear so, even when
fortune was not. <hi>Nicomedes</hi> would not take me with him, either from an
apprehension that he might infect me with his infelicity, which he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
was contagious; or else if <hi>Mithridates</hi> by force or treachery should
ever get him into his power, yet his ignorance where I was might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
me for more happy times, &amp; make me one day recover that Crown
he had so fatally lost. I was therefore by <hi>Arsamnor</hi>'s care and sidelity car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with safety to that Galley which was provided for us under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
of <hi>Posidum,</hi> from whence the wind favouring us, blowing from
the North, with Sails and Oars, we soon crost the Sea called <hi>Propontus,</hi>
and past through the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> memorized by the famous death of <hi>Hero</hi>
and <hi>Leander,</hi> whose Cities <hi>Seftos</hi> and <hi>Abydos</hi> crown'd the shoars of the
guilty waters. Then crossing the <hi>Aegean</hi> and <hi>Icarian</hi> Sea, we cast anchor
under the Promontory of <hi>Panormus,</hi> where <hi>Arsamnor</hi> dismissed his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and leaving me in a little Village near <hi>Athens,</hi> went thither to seek
a Sanctuary, which he easily obtained by the favour of <hi>Ariston,</hi> the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest
man in that City: for the <hi>Athenians</hi> were jealous of the growing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> left the loss of their City might have composed a
part of it. <hi>Arsamnor</hi> then form'd himself an equipage fit for a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which he said he was; as also that he was forced out
of his own Countrey by the prevalency of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Arms; and for
his fidelity to his own Prince, assuming also the name of <hi>Telamon,</hi> which
had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and other ornaments and vertues, soon gained him so considerable an
interest, not only in <hi>Ariston,</hi> but in all the other <hi>Athenians,</hi> that he spent
his time there in as much safety, as if it had been in <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and with as
much satisfaction as the remembrance of his Kings affairs would admit.
But whilst I thus past my infancy at <hi>Athens, Mithridates</hi> had conquered
all <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and was near forming as great an Empire in
<hi>Asia,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> had in <hi>Europe;</hi> which great people, though extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexed by the sad discords of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of their own City; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as careful of their glory, as of their being, desiring the last but for the
first, they elected <hi>Cornelius Scylla</hi> General of the <hi>Asian</hi> War; under whose
conduct they promised themselves a revenge as great as their desire of it;
his earliest actions rendering that belief a rational one. But <hi>Scylla,</hi> who
feared <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> gave him this power in <hi>Asia,</hi> the better to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
their own in <hi>Rome,</hi> delayed going to the War so long, that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Cities, who at first more apprehended the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, than <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>'s,
and therefore gave <hi>Scylla</hi> some promises of joining their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

as the greatest danger, join'd with the <hi>Asian,</hi> as thinking it their
best interest, when doubtless Honestly only was; and the two first Cities
which were guilty of this change, were <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> to whom the

                  <hi>Pontick</hi> King granted many priviledges; and to enable them to be his
friends, or to secure their not being his enemies, he sent them a vast

                  </hi> who did him such
memorable Service on the banks of <hi>Amneus. Mithridates</hi> in person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the City of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> to celebrate his Nuptials; for finding
<hi>Fontamyris</hi> preferred banishment with <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> before Empire with
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> Hate invaded the place of Love, and to let the late object
of his, know, resentment had performed what it may be she thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but time could, solemnly married in the Metropolis of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamyris</hi>
Kingdom the fair <hi>Calamis,</hi> whose beauty gave her what her
birth could not. The <hi>Pontick</hi> King thinking himself sufficiently reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on <hi>Fontamyris</hi> by expelling her out of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and by making
another Queen of it, in it; exchanged his love of beauty, into love of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and so assiduously followed the War, that in few days all the <hi>Asian</hi>
Princes had drawn their Swords in his quarrel, or had given him Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not to employ them against him, so that nothing was more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed, than that <hi>Greece</hi> would be the Scene of the War, and that
<hi>Mithridates</hi> would save <hi>Scylla</hi> the trouble of invading <hi>Asia,</hi> by meeting
him half way. <hi>Telamon</hi> finding how deeply <hi>Athens</hi> was engaged in the
<hi>Pontick</hi> quarrel, would have chose some other Retreat, fearing he was
too considerable to be unknown, if <hi>Arcathias,</hi> or <hi>Archilaus</hi> came into
the City; and fearing also if he were taken, it might be my ruine; but
<hi>Ariston</hi> hindered it, who assured him no <hi>Asian</hi> General, or Garison should
ever enter <hi>Athens,</hi> unless the <hi>Romans</hi> came to besiege it, which if
they did, he would not fail to send into some place of safety him and
his Son; for I was not only thought to be his Son by all the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
but I also thought my self so, so strictly <hi>Telamon</hi> kept <hi>Nicomedes</hi> command.</p>
               <p>This promise made my Governour continue me in <hi>Athens,</hi> where
we learned that <hi>Rome</hi> awakened with the Revolt of <hi>Greece,</hi> with the
great Army <hi>Arcathias</hi> had brought thither, and with the greater <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
was to bring, had hastily ordered <hi>Scylla</hi> to his command, who had
in this mean time so well fetled his affairs in the City, as he doubted
not but to end the <hi>Asian</hi> War before they could receive any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
alteration. But that great people were then reduced to so low
a necessity, that to furnish <hi>Scylla,</hi> they were constrained to give him
those sacred golden Vessels which <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> had consecrated to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities; thereby evincing, glory was their greatest God.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> now understanding that <hi>Scylla</hi> only wanted a fair wind to
cross the Adriatick Gulph; and that the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> which that Sea
did confine, was now covered with Soldiers, jealous lest so many <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>

and to reserve one half of their goods to his use, the other half
to distribute amongst themselves. Oh gods! (continued <hi>Callimmachus</hi>)
what sins could the unfortunate <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Fontamyris</hi> be guilty of,
that you could cast them from the throne of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> to place such a
Monster in it? and why would you give so much wickedness so much
power to act it? or permit so many millions to be governed by one, who
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:96335:275"/>
was so unable to govern himself? But yet it was fit that Subjects which
could obey such an Order, should be governed by such a King: Yes
(generous Princes) the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> observed their Prince's command, and
on the fatal day shed a Sea of <hi>Italian</hi> blood, the slaves and the free, the
young and the old, the male and the female, the poor and the rich, found
no Sanctuary in their conditions, no, nor even in the Temples, nor in
the very embracing the gods of them: The Temple of <hi>Artemisius</hi> in
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and the Temple of the
Goddess <hi>Vesta</hi> in <hi>Caria,</hi> were hardly able to contain the bodies of those
who were murdered in them: And as if their fury had ingross'd or
drown'd all other considerations, they had not discretion enough so to
act their wickedness, as to leave themselves the shadow of an
excuse for it; since they killed these poor creatures with so much
relish, that it appeared to be as much their delight, as it was their
cruelty.</p>
               <p>But this could not so much lessen the <hi>Roman</hi> interest in <hi>Asia,</hi> as it did
encrease their title to it; for the gods could not protect the <hi>Asian</hi>
quarrel, without protecting the <hi>Asian</hi> crimes. Those of <hi>Delos</hi> (subject
to the <hi>Athenians</hi>) either apprehending to be engaged in a quarrel which
the effusion of so much innocent blood assured them would be unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful,
or hoping to cast off the <hi>Athenian</hi> yoak, declared for <hi>Scylla</hi>
before he came into <hi>Greece,</hi> against whom <hi>Ariston</hi> went; but being too
weak, had the assistance of <hi>Archilaus,</hi> and thereby soon reduced <hi>Delos</hi>
to her former obedience; in which expedition <hi>Archilaus</hi> so flattered <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
and so elevated his ambition, that it was concluded between them,
<hi>Mithridates</hi> should make <hi>Ariston</hi> Prince of <hi>Athens,</hi> and that <hi>Ariston</hi>
should do fealty for it to <hi>Mithridates.</hi> Yet this was not done with so
much secrecy, but that <hi>Telamon</hi> had some suspicion of it, which afterwards
he was the more confirmed in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the actings of <hi>Ariston,</hi> which transcended
what a free State could suffer: But though the <hi>Athenians</hi> were sensible of
it, yet they wanted the power to redress it; for besides the interest <hi>Ariston</hi>
had in <hi>Athens,</hi> he was so openly countenanced by <hi>Archilaus,</hi> that the
discovery of his design was a greater trouble to the people, than the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
could have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Telamon</hi> at length so well acted his part, that <hi>Ariston</hi> permitted him
to retire to <hi>Miletus</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Caria,</hi> and sent some <hi>Athenians</hi>
to convey us thither: this place he elected, as being by the situation of
it, likely to avoid that War which now threatned <hi>Greece,</hi> and like to
oppose any War which should threaten it, by the great obligations it
had to Art and Nature. It was there that <hi>Telamon,</hi> as soon as I was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of learning, began to instrust me in Philosophy, that on the score of
Reason I might contemn that power and glory, which misfortune was
but too likely to deny me. In this calm retreat we learnt those bloody
revolutions which happened in <hi>Greece;</hi> how at last <hi>Scylla</hi> Landed
there only with five Legions, and certain <hi>Cohorts</hi> and <hi>Turmes,</hi> in which
small Army there was yet so exact a Discipline, that it made all believe,
those which had acted the highest conquest, the conquest of themselves,
would hardly be denied any other.</p>
               <p>This belief not only brought <hi>Thebes</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> power, without
<hi>Scylla</hi>'s employing it to procure that end, but also deterred <hi>Arcathias</hi>
and <hi>Archilaus</hi> from determining the War by a general battel. But <hi>Scylla,</hi>
after having fruitlessly essayed to provoke them out of so protractive
and cold a resolution, elected at once to besiege <hi>Athens</hi> and the Port
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:96335:276"/>
of <hi>Piraeus,</hi> believing if the <hi>Asians</hi> would not attempt relieving of those places,
he should soon win them; or if they did, he should soon win a
victory. He farther concluded, That if they were so ill Protectors of
such friends, it would deter the <hi>Grecians</hi> from continuing, or at least from
assuming that name.</p>
               <p>This resolution being known to <hi>Arcathias,</hi> and <hi>Archilaus,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
that the first of them should keep the field with half their
Army to obstruct <hi>Scylla</hi>'s supplies, and the last should fling himself
into <hi>Piraeus</hi> to obstruct his conquests; and that the <hi>Grecians</hi> might see
they had not invited them into dangers which they declined participating
in; <hi>Ariston,</hi> who in person continued in <hi>Athens,</hi> having a considerable
Garison, performed things with it, which were so; and never any Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
gave the builder of it more fame, than the walls of <hi>Piraeus</hi> gave <hi>Piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clion</hi>
an <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain, who had raised them during the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi>
War, and which in this <hi>Roman</hi> War rendered all <hi>Scylla</hi>'s assaults invalid,
and the battering Ram unworthy that name; yet <hi>Scylla</hi> was not at all
dejected hereat, but elevated himself with the glory of besieging at
once the greatest Army in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the greatest City of it: for by
this time the gods had taken away the young Prince <hi>Arcathias</hi> by a
sudden death as he was raising an Army to relieve his friends, or not
to have survived the unhappiness of having been unable to do it;
so that those forces wanting a Captain fit to employ them, were by
<hi>Archilaus</hi> orders come into <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Piraeus</hi> by Sea, which they did
safely by the help of the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> Gallies, <hi>Scylla</hi> having none to
dispute the Empire of that element with. I must confess (continued <hi>Callim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>)
the first actions of War which ever gave me envy, and a desire
of imitation, were those of this siege; for never was there more Art
and courage manifested in so small a compass, as within the <hi>Athenian</hi>
walls, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp. But famine put a period to the besiegers
pains, and the besiegeds glory; But yet even famine it self for a time
lengthned the siege, the death of some continuing the life of others;
for the living fed upon the dead.</p>
               <p>But in conclusion, there was no hands to justifie the walls of <hi>Athens;</hi>
and then <hi>Ariston</hi> retired into the Castle, glorying that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had
left <hi>Athens,</hi> rather than that the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken it; but the same mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
which had reigned in the Town, soon did the like in the Castle;
where <hi>Ariston</hi> endured death with as much resolution, as he had oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it; proud with the knowledg that <hi>Athens</hi> and his Dominion over it
found their period in one day, and that the noblest City of the world
accompanied his fall. <hi>Scylla</hi> being thus Master of <hi>Athens,</hi> rewarded his
Soldiers patience and courage with all things sacred and prophane; and
by the great severity he practised upon those <hi>Athenians</hi> which had
escaped the War and the Famine, made them know it had been an act of
more honour, and more ease, to have expired with their Countrey, than
so to have out-liv'd it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archilaus</hi> burning with desires of revenge, or else to evidence by some
high performances after <hi>Arcathias</hi> death, that his having been General,
had hindered many great actions, drew all the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> Forces into
one body, determining therewith to place a period, or bring an acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to <hi>Scylla</hi>'s glory. The <hi>Roman</hi> General received this Intelligence with
Prophetick Raptures, and in his high Joy before the Battel, manifested
his confidence of winning it. The Country near <hi>Cherovia</hi> was the Scene
of this Dispute, from which City the Battel took its name. <hi>Murena Galba</hi>
                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:96335:276"/>
and <hi>Hortensius</hi> for a time drew all the <hi>Romans</hi> admiration, till <hi>Scylla,</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
that those under him should act above him, performed such prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of valour, that the <hi>Romans</hi> esteemed it more unjust not to give all
their wonder unto their General, than to have deny'd before a part unto
three such men. <hi>Archilaus</hi> in this defeat lost upon the place One hundred
and ten thousand men, and the hopes of ever having so many together
again in <hi>Greece,</hi> which by an Express he advertised <hi>Mithridates</hi> of; who
to keep the War out of <hi>Asia,</hi> forthwith sent <hi>Dorilaus</hi> and the Prince <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi>
with Eighty thousand Foot into <hi>Greece,</hi> to re-inforce <hi>Archilaus,</hi> and
to enable him to make one other experiment of Fortune in the Field.</p>
               <p>At the same time also he assembled all the Princes and Tetrarchs of
<hi>Asia</hi> which he suspected, or was not confident of; and having them in
his power, put them, their wives and children, to death; his past cruelty
rendering this an act of wisdom: for he had so offended all mankind, that
he could not kill any but such as were his enemies. Many Noble Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he used as ill by <hi>Zenobius</hi> a Lieutenant of his, whose natural cruelty
equalled his Kings; this was the last place he acted his Massacres in, and
then went to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> expecting like reception, and designing the like
Tyranny. But the <hi>Ephesians</hi> finding that resistance could not be worse
than submission, resolved on the first, though <hi>Philopomenes</hi> was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
thereof, and made so by <hi>Mithridates.</hi> This example had so good
success, that the Cities of <hi>Thrales, Hippapes,</hi> and <hi>Mesopolites,</hi> follow'd it:
which made <hi>Mithridates</hi> think, that though cruelty was pleasant to him,
yet it was not wise [<hi>I have not acquainted you with so many Tyrannies
of his, because he was my enemy, but to let you see that 'twas not only to
punish the unhappy</hi> Nicomedes, <hi>that this</hi> Mithridates <hi>was raised, but to
punish all the civilized world</hi>]: To these great revolts, he received the
certain advertisement, that <hi>Archilaus</hi> and <hi>Dorilaus</hi> had been defeated in
a furious Battel by <hi>Scylla,</hi> who derived his victory from his personal cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
for when his Army fled, he ran to the first Eagle, and taking it up,
flew with it into the midst of the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> crying out to his Soldiers, <hi>If
any ask,</hi> O Romans, <hi>where you have abandoned your General, tell them
you left him fighting in</hi> Orchomenia: which expressions and action raised
their shame above their fear, and made them return to the Battel, in which
they did things that defaced the sin of their aflight, and presented <hi>Scylla</hi>
with the Victory, which though that day far advanced, yet it was not
till next day perfected; for then assaulting and entring <hi>Archilaus</hi> Camp,
few scaped out of it but himself. But to qualifie the joys of such
signal Victories, <hi>Scylla</hi> received advertisement from <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
Cinna,</hi> and <hi>Caius Marius</hi> having usurped the power of the City,
and over the Senate, had declared him an enemy to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
had raz'd all his Houses, and had proscribed all his Friends and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans.
<hi>Scylla</hi> at this so fatal intelligence, loses not his courage, but resolves
by it to form himself as great an Empire in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> as his enemies
design'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> and then in a fair Field to decide who should have
both. But <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> who knew he had so high an ascendent
over his Army, that, what they could do, he could perswade them to do it
for him; and believing no other design could proportion <hi>Scylla</hi>'s courage,
and judgment, elected <hi>Flaccus</hi> one of the Consuls, and sent him with two
of the best Legions to supply <hi>Scylla</hi>'s Office, or to force it from him. But
<hi>Flaccus</hi> being no Soldier, they sent for his Praetor <hi>Fimbria,</hi> who had by
many exploits in Arms rendred himself justly famous. This new <hi>Roman</hi>
Army being come to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> part of it with the Fleet which carried
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:96335:277"/>
them, was taken by <hi>Mithridates</hi> Fleet; part of them perished in a storm;
part that were landed in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> went to <hi>Scylla,</hi> not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<hi>Flaccus</hi> his insolen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies; and the rest had done the like, had not <hi>Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi>
by Reasons and Clemency hindred it, which yet more incens'd <hi>Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
than if they had all abandoned him; for by their so staying, he found
one that served under him, had more power over his Army, than he; which
engendred such animosities between them, that <hi>Flaccus</hi> not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Fimbria</hi> back to <hi>Rome,</hi> but elected one <hi>Termus</hi> in his place; which
so enraged him, that he took away the Fasces and Rods (which were the
Praetorian Ensigns) as they were carried before <hi>Termus,</hi> who fled to <hi>Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
for reparation. The Consul hereupon commands his Soldiers to seize
upon <hi>Fimbria,</hi> who experimented their love was a better commission,
than the Senate without it could give; for all the Army abandon'd <hi>Flaccus,</hi>
who was forced to fly to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> whither <hi>Fimbria</hi> followed, and at length
found him hid in a Well, from whence being taken out, though he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<hi>Fimbria</hi>'s pity even in tears, yet he caused his head forthwith to
be cut off and flung into the Sea, though <hi>Flaccus</hi> was both Consul and
General, and <hi>Fimbria</hi> but a private Citizen. But to repair so signal an
affront to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he vigorously prosecuted <hi>Mithridate</hi>'s
friends, which were the greatest enemies of it, which he said, was the end
why the Army was sent out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and which had thitherto been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the executed Consul's impertinency. Amongst his many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
one I cannot but mention, which was his cruelty and treachery
to the <hi>Illians;</hi> for finding their strength might give his <hi>Romans</hi> as long a
trouble, as it once did the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he left off force, and flattered them
so successfully under the name of Fathers of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they admitted him
into their City with his Army, which he soon became Master of, and
destroyed all that was living in it, thereby making crueltly silence many,
who would have otherwise reproached him with it; nay, the Images of
the gods, and the Temples in which they were adored, participated of his
fury, which some thought they deserved for not better defending their
votaries. Only the <hi>Palladium,</hi> which was sent the <hi>Trojans</hi> by <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
was preserved by miracle, a Vault of the Temple giving it at once both a
Tomb and safety; so that <hi>Troy</hi> was more unhappy in her children, than in
her enemies; <hi>Fimbria</hi> being worse unto her, than <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> or else her
first death having given life to the greatest Empire in the World, <hi>Fimbria</hi>
would in gratitude thereunto make her still continue in that condition.
But <hi>Mithridates</hi> after the last signal defeat given <hi>Archilaus,</hi> finding
though <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Fimbria</hi> were enemies to each other, yet they were
both so to him; and believing the first of them wanted but an honourable
pretence of leaving the <hi>Asian</hi> War, to dispute the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> with
<hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna,</hi> and to appease the <hi>manes</hi> of so many of his friends
as had been murther'd by them, as also fully convinced such a series of
defeats had disenabled him from much longer continuing a War; sent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to <hi>Archilaus</hi> to endeavour a Peace with <hi>Scylla,</hi> which after many a
meeting, at length at one between <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> was concluded,
but on such advantagious conditions for the <hi>Romans,</hi> that even the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the agreement were the manifestations of his conquest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Scylla</hi> having
so prosperously put a period to his <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War, to leave all clear
behind him, went against <hi>Fimbria,</hi> and summoned him to deliver up him
his Armies, being Proconsul of <hi>Asia;</hi> to which <hi>Fimbria</hi> returning an high
answer, <hi>Scylla</hi> immediately besieged him, and reduced him to so low a state,
that <hi>Fimbria</hi> hired a Slave to murther <hi>Scylla,</hi> which being discovered, all
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:96335:277"/>
                  <hi>Fimbria</hi>'s Army were so scandalized at it, that many abandoned him and
went to <hi>Scylla,</hi> against whom <hi>Fimbria</hi> had done too much to expect his
mercy, and therefore contemning it when 'twas offered, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of his departing into <hi>Italy,</hi> and resigning up his Army, he stole
to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where in the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> he ran his Sword through
his own body; but finding the wound was not friendly enough to afford
him a sudden death, he commanded an infranchised Servant of his to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him, which he did, and then with the same Sword followed him.
Thus <hi>Fimbria</hi> died, whom the gods permitted to be as cruel to himself
as he had been to others; thereby manifesting, to be so was as much his
nature, as it was his crime. Immediately after his death, all his Army
yielded themselves to <hi>Scylla,</hi> who received them with so much huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that they found <hi>Fimbria,</hi> in killing himself had obliged them, as
much as <hi>Scylla;</hi> who having appointed <hi>Curio</hi> to resettle <hi>Nicomedes</hi> in
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> (which was one of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Peace), and having, the best he could, calmed the differences
in <hi>Asia,</hi> and raised five years advance of tribute in all the Cities of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his dominion, which so impoverish'd them, that they were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to pawn their Amphitheatres, their Town-houses, and all their other
publick places, to enable them to pay it; by the assistance of <hi>Mithridate</hi>'s
Galleys (which also on the Peace were resigned to him) he transported
his Army first into <hi>Greece,</hi> and thence into <hi>Italy,</hi> which he filled with
such confusions, and with so many horrid murthers and proscriptions, that
to such as loved their Countrey, death was no ill expedient to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the miseries of it. The Heavens by many Prodigies seemed to
foretell those many others which men should act. A Woman in <hi>Rome</hi>
was delivered of a Serpent in stead of a Child. The Earth by a
furious shaking, flung down many Statues and Temples of the gods:
And the Capitol, that proud Fabrick, built by so many Kings, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
by lightning.</p>
               <p>These and many others of the same nature, were the actings and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that part of the World in which I spent my infancy and earliest
youth, which were the only times of all my life that I was free from the
sense of misery, which too I derived from Nature, not from Fortune,
who had provided infelicities for me against my coming into the World,
sufficient to make me for ever detest it. But having hitherto entertain'd
you with accidents at large, I shall now confine my relations to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
limits; being by this conjuncture of time arrived to an age
capable of relishing happiness and misfortune, to which latter only my
stars had de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign'd me.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Miletus,</hi> the place of my then residence, there were several young
Gentlemen of my age, and believed-quality (for I past still in the opinion
of the World, as well as in my own, for the Son of <hi>Telamon</hi>) with whom
I learnt all those exercises, as well of the mind as the body, which <hi>Greece</hi>
and the lesser <hi>Asia</hi> placed any value upon; in which I had the happiness
to surpass my companions, whose stupidity only I fear gave me that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency.
But sometimes to divert our selves, we used to hunt the wild
Boar; which was a Game that Countrey was but too fruitful in: for
often those furious Beasts, when press'd by hunger, or by those which
pursued them, would accompany their own deaths, with some of their
Hunters; which made <hi>Telamon</hi> very unwilling to afford me often so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
adivertisement; neither would he ever permit it me, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by most of those young Gentlemen, over whom my larger profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:96335:278"/>
and the rate at which I lived (which was eminent) gave me
some superiority; He himself too keeping always by my side. One day,
a hunting-match being agreed on, we found a Boar of so immense a size,
and so largely arm'd with Tusks, that the boldest of our Huntsmen would
have willingly resign'd the hopes of the quarry, to have avoided the
danger of the chase, had not the fear of shame been more prevalent than
the fear of the Boar; who having cast off all his followers, but me (for
<hi>Telamon</hi>'s Horse had strained himself so unhappily, that he could no longer
gallop), the inraged beast took along a High-way which came out of a
neighbour-wood, at the next extremity whereof, I perceived some
Gentlemen and Ladies, by the magnificence of whose equipage I easily
judged were of no mean Quality. The Boar not deterr'd at the sight of
so much company, boldly runs into the midst of them, and thereby so
terrified all the Horses, that they fled back into the Wood, where one
of them cast his rider, which the Boar no sooner perceived, than he ran
furiously to her; Her great danger, and her greater beauty, invited my
assistance, which without balancing I ran to pay her; but finding my
Horse might offend her, whom I intended to protect, I leap'd off of
him, and with a Javelin in my hand I placed my self between that beauty
and the danger which threatned her, and darted my Javelin so happily
at the Boar, that piercing him through and through, it put some stop to
his course, and gave me leisure to draw my Sword, with which, during
his amazement, I ran him in at the mouth, and sheath'd the blade of it
in his body; which though it gave him his death's wound, yet before he
died, with one of his Tusks he struck me into my left side so deep, and
so very near my heart, that his not having done me more harm, could
not be so strange as the grief which invaded the beauty I had delivered
was, that he had done me so much. I had that consolation and
misfortune together, to observe she was more concerned in my dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than she had been at her own, thereby evincing I had freed her
from one trouble, but to cast her into a greater. Never beauty had
so many surprizing charms as that of the fair <hi>Monyma,</hi> which yet
received some little accession by the condition and dress she was in;
For her shape, and stature, which was capable of no addition, was perfectly
discovered to the obliged and ravish'd sight, by the clothes she then wore,
which were such as the goddess <hi>Diana</hi> is represented with in her cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Temple of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when in dreams she manifested her self on
<hi>Latmus,</hi> to the sleepy <hi>Endymion:</hi> that little paleness which her danger
and disorder disobliged her with, was yet so well repaired by the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of some falls of carnation-feathers which shadowed her face, that
she seemed to be no loser thereby.</p>
               <p>In a word, she was such as made me more apprehend a wound from
her, than that I had already received. In the amazement of that silent
Fear, the fair <hi>Monyma</hi> came to me, and perceiving my clothes all
bloody, she told me: I fear, Sir, your highest civility has involved you
in a resembling danger; but believe me, your having so freed me from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
has made me a great sharer in yours. Madam, (I replyed, sensibly
moved with so much obligingness) you might much sooner ascribe the
small service I have paid you, to my duty, than my civility; for 'twas but
just I should free you from that hazard I only had occasioned; and if any
thing troubles me in this performance, 'tis only from its looking so much
like my debt, that it leaves you no rise to attribute any part of it to my
inclinations, which (Madam) are such for your service, as they would joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:96335:278"/>
manifest themselves by courting danger, though it were as high as
that goodness which makes you so sympathize in mine. I had hardly
strength enough to speak these words, neither was I able to make an end of
them without leaning upon my Sword, which being too weak a support,
I fell at <hi>Monyma</hi>'s feet, who by a great shriek acquainted me her trouble
at it was the like. As soon as her grief permitted her reason to act, she
perceived a spring of blood issuing out of my side; and believing that
ebullition occasioned my fainting, she tore off some of her linnen, and
by holding it to the orifice of the wound, endeavoured to stop the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But though her care was strangely kind, yet it had been fruitless, if
her reiterated cryes had not drawn a Gentleman to her assistance, who
having learnt the cause of her concernment for me, afforded me so much
of his, that by it, and the help of a Chyrurgeon, which happily
waited on him, my wound was dress'd, and my senses restored. The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
whose care and civility had so largely contributed thereunto, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
came and made me such signal and handsom acknowledgments
for what I had done for the lovely <hi>Monyma,</hi> that I concluded by the
greatness of his gratitude, his concerns for her were not little; and
though his riper years might well have exempted me from certain emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I never till then was acquainted with, and knew not whilst they
disordered me, what they were, or from whence they proceeded; yet
after they ceas'd (which they did not till <hi>Monyma</hi> her self told me, he
was her Father) I found they proceeded from a small jealousie, to the
cause of which I was so meer a stranger that I knew not, even enduring
the effect of love, that I was at all engaged in that noble passion. But as
soon as ever I understood <hi>Philopomenes</hi> relation to the beauty I admired,
I made him such humble retributions, that he protested my civility
had as much confin'd him to be my friend, as the service I had done
his daughter: and to manifest his care of me, was greater than mine of
my self, he forced me from an entertainment, which I esteemed more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
than that recovery the Chyrurgeon assured him it was an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
and putting me into his Chariot (for though he and the fair <hi>Monyma</hi>
rid when I met them, yet it was only the better to enjoy the fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the morning) he accompanied me to my House in <hi>Miletus,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all my reiterated Prayers to hinder it. By the way I met
the afflicted <hi>Telamon,</hi> who by the immense sorrow he assumed at my
danger, had then made me conclude him my Father, had I formerly
doubted it.</p>
               <p>I will exempt you from the relation of those visits I received
from <hi>Philopomenes</hi> during my indisposition, or from those many
inquiries made after my health by his fair Daughter; on whom,
when I was restored to mine, I waited so constantly, that <hi>Tela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
began to fear I did it upon some more pressing invitation than
bare civility. That which made me the more openly make my
addresses to <hi>Monyma</hi> was, the then believed equality of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for she was the Daughter of an <hi>Ephesian</hi> Lord, who had so
detested <hi>Mithridate</hi>'s cruelty, that though by his Commission he was
made Governour of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> yet he had invited and perswaded the
City to declare against him; which injury he apprehended <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
would revenge, being enabled thereunto by the fresh agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concluded with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who for the most part were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with <hi>Scylla</hi> to rob <hi>Italy</hi> of that peace they had left <hi>Asia</hi> in: And
that his Countrey might not be involved in his misfortunes, or occasioned
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:96335:279"/>
by him, he had left <hi>Ephesus</hi> and retired to <hi>Miletus,</hi> whose strength he
thought would prove a better Sanctuary. But if <hi>Telamon</hi> had cause to
suspect I had a passion for <hi>Monyma,</hi> this which I am now telling, gave
him a certainty of it.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Miletus</hi> was in ancient times besieged by a barbarous
Prince, who having by their obstinacy endured much loss, resolved to
repair it by the ruin of the place; but being informed that amongst the
besieged there was a Virgin of such excellent beauty, that Nature never
had obliged the World with the like; this Barbarian desired and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a sight of her from off the Walls; which so inflamed him, that
he esteemed to conquer her, was a happier Victory than to conquer <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus:</hi>
so that when the Citizens despaired of safety, he sent them word,
If they would deliver up to his pleasure the fair <hi>Cyaxara,</hi> he would
forthwith raise his Siege, and never more present himself before their
Walls.</p>
               <p>This Nymph having as much Resolution as Beauty, devoted her self
as a Sacrifice to save her Countrey, and only tied the Tyrant to suspend
the acting of his lust, till she was out of the Territories of <hi>Miletus,</hi> that
her people might not behold, but only enjoy the advantage of her
shame.</p>
               <p>This Contract being made, the fair <hi>Cyaxara</hi> was delivered up to her
Ravisher, and abandoned her friends with more constancy and resolution,
than they were Masters of, when she did so.</p>
               <p>The next night after he had got out of the agreed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on limits, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to enjoy the reward of the War; but instead thereof, the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Cyaxara</hi> had prepar'd for him the reward of his sin: for when he
was come into her bed in the height of his Wine and Lust, with a Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
she had conceal'd, she pierc'd his heart; at which unexpected stroke,
he utter'd so loud a cry, that many of his chief Officers who were in the
next room, ran to his assistance; but it was too late: for his black soul
had forsaken his guilty body. And <hi>Cyaxara</hi> hearing a throng of people
coming into her Chamber, with the same weapon all reeking with the
Tyrant's blood, with which she had preserved her self from the lust of
one of her Enemies, she preserved her self from the revenge and fury of
the rest.</p>
               <p>The death of this Monster occasion'd so many divisions in his Army,
that thereby <hi>Miletus</hi> was preserved from the fury of it: whose Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
in commemoration of the fair <hi>Cyaxara</hi>'s Gallantry, ordained a
yearly Festival should be for ever celebrated for their deliverance, and
for those eternal joys her Virtue had invited the gods to crown her with:
and that this day might be observed with more solemnity, the Magistrates
of the City gave the fairest Diamond they could buy, to the best Tilter,
who was to present it to the greatest Beauty in the Assembly, and who
during that year was to be called <hi>Cyaxara.</hi> This signal day being come,
and believing my self able enough to manage a Horse, and handle a
Lance, I begg'd <hi>Telamon</hi> to permit me to be one of the <hi>Tilters;</hi> which
he assented unto: and it being the first time of my appearing in arms,
he so beautified mine with Jewels of inestimable value, that they drew
the eyes of all the people on me at my entrance into the Lists, as much
as my success did when I went out to present the reward of it to the
fair <hi>Monyma,</hi> who was seated upon a Scaffold with others of her Sex,
who were of highest quality at that meeting. As soon as I came to
the foot of that Scaffold, I allighted from my Horse; and having begged
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:96335:279"/>
and obtained the Ladies permission to ascend it: I presented <hi>Monyma</hi>
with that Diamond I had won, and told her; This Madam, which
my Fortune has given me, my Justice humbly pays unto you; I should
be as blind as that power from whom only I derive my Victory, did
I any other way employ the acquisitions of it; for 'tis so much your
Right, that to have declin'd presenting it to you, had been to have
broke the Laws of this solemn meeting.</p>
               <p>This little Complement put <hi>Monyma</hi> into a small Disorder: which
having something conquer'd, she repli'd, That <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> which
your merit has given you, your civility has presented me; but indeed
you had but this way of imploying your success, to make me think
you deserved it not: All these Ladies (turning to those that were
near her) will have cause to desire the perpetual extinction of this
festival, when it furnishes an occasion of acting so high an injustice;
for 'tis as much so to decline making your present to any of them,
as to confer't upon me. I shall never Madam, (I repli'd) have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
opposite to the fair <hi>Monyma</hi>'s, when her modesty does not form
hers; but then I must beg her pardon, if to avoid the greater offence,
I commit the less: neither do I think these Ladies can esteem me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just;
the most they can believe is, that I am unfortunate in having a
success which confined me to disoblige so many, to do right to one;
since none could have had my power, that could justly otherwise
have imploy'd it. Whilst I was thus discoursing, a Gentleman called
<hi>Diocles,</hi> who that day I had dismounted in the Tilting, came to the
Foot of the Scaffold where his Mistris was, to whom he apprehended
I would have given the prize (for 'tis none of the least miracles in
Love, that every one believes the Author of his is the handsomest)
where finding himself deceived, his jealousie turned to anger, and he
was no more troubled at his first belief, than he now was at what had
displaced it. The beauty he serv'd was called <hi>Irene,</hi> who yielded to
none but <hi>Monyma;</hi> she was blest with as many graces of the mind, as
of the body; and therefore had no inclination to receive the addresses
of <hi>Diocles,</hi> who had nothing considerable but his extraction, his riches,
and his courage; the last of which had been so often, and succesfully
tried, that duelling seem'd to be one of his recreations.</p>
               <p>The great affront he had that day received in his person, and the
higher he thought he received in his Mistris, made him with a loud
voice tell me; <hi>Callimmachus,</hi> could I have fancied you would have
given the prize of this days Tilting to any, but the fair <hi>Irene,</hi> I had
by my Sword hindred you from acting that Crime, and her from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
it; but since I find you guilty thereof, I cannot but punish
what I should have prevented; which I would have done in a privater
way, could I have supprest my resentments so long: And yet it is but
just that the injury being before so many thousand witnesses, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
should be the like. I had no sooner heard these words, then
saluting <hi>Monyma</hi> and the rest of the Ladies, I descended from the
Scaffold, and having flung off my Armour as <hi>Diocles</hi> had done his, I
told him; That which, I confess, my Fortune has given me over all
the rest, my Courage has given me over thee, which I am come by
a repeated experiment to convince thee of, and to let thee feel I have
been much more just in paying the prize to <hi>Monyma,</hi> than thou hast been
in presuming to own thy self a Servant to the fair <hi>Irene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the end of these words we drew out our Swords, and observing
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:96335:280"/>
that not only all the Ladies, but the Magistrates of the City were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to part us, we ran at each other with as much fury, as if our Mistresses
had not only been the beholders, but were to have been the reward
of the combat. My thrust was more fortunate than his, for it pierced
him through the body, but his only pierced my left arm; so that in
the close having flung him down and disarmed him, I bid him ask his
life; He told me, since it had been so unsuccessful, 'twas not worth the
pains. My resentment being a little over, I told him, Though thou
wouldst perswade me, by representing thy life is not worth the asking,
that it is hardly worth the taking; yet I believe it much more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and therefore for <hi>Monyma</hi> and <hi>Irene</hi>'s sake, I give it thee; by this
time these two beauties with many others, as also <hi>Telamon,</hi> and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
were come, who forthwith caused both our wounds to be dress'd;
and because mine was in my Arm, the Chyrurgeons sent for a scarf to
support it in, which staying for too long, the fair <hi>Irene</hi> took off a rich
one she had on, and bid them make use of that; this sight wounded
<hi>Diocles</hi> more than my Sword had done; which taking notice of, I
told <hi>Irene</hi> that he wanted it more than I, and though it were
strangely obliging to me, yet it might prove more so to him, whose
condition made intercessions for him, by his being uncapable of making
any for himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irene</hi> immediately, either pitying <hi>Diocles,</hi> or to be revenged on me,
permitted me to present it to him; which he refused, saying, He never
willingly received a favour from an Enemy, nor would not his Mistrisse's
derived from such a mediation, and conveyed by such a hand. This
rudeness made me repent my civility, and I believe revenge it, by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he had declined.</p>
               <p>I will exempt you (continued <hi>Callimmachus</hi>) from the relation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma</hi>'s
little Triumph, from <hi>Telamon</hi>'s discontent at my quarrel, from
his trouble at my wound, and his care of my recovery; which was
much earlier than that of <hi>Diocles,</hi> who languish'd above a year before
he was able to pay a visit to <hi>Irene,</hi> and to beg her pardon that he had so
ill defended her right. During all which time, I was so assiduous in
my addresses to <hi>Monyma,</hi> that I had pregnant cause to believe they had
not been fruitless.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Irene</hi> also had contracted so strict a friendship with her, that
she became her confident, and at length my advocate, from whose inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
I received more than I could have expected from any one; so
that now my greatest fears were from <hi>Telamon,</hi> who always manifested
so inveterate an aversion to my Love, and one day so expresly prohibited
my continuing it, that not being able to divest my self of it, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to carry it with so much secrecy, that <hi>Irene,</hi> and at last <hi>Monyma</hi>
her self began to think that was my design, which indeed was my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I had not the confidence to acquaint her with what made me so
rarely visit her; but when ever I got the opportunity of paying her
that duty, I was so passionate in my expressions and looks, that I hoped
my actions would acquaint her with what I durst not, which I esteemed
the least unhandsom way of disclosing my misfortune, and of evidencing
my constancy. But whether she did not, or would not, understand this
way of proceeding, she not only began to use me at a rate, which might
manifest a less concernment for me than she had once honoured me with,
but also conjur'd <hi>Irene</hi> to decline interceding for a person who declined
interceding for himself. This that obliging friend informed me of, which
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:96335:280"/>
occasioned a violent dispute between my duty to <hi>Telamon,</hi> and that I
owed the fair <hi>Monyma;</hi> in which, though they could not vanquish each
other, yet they vanquish'd me, and cast me into so deep a melancholly, that
the last admired it, and the first did pity it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irene</hi> concluding there was something of mysterious in this, resolved
to break those con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inements <hi>Monyma</hi> had imposed on her, and to know
of me what occasioned my sadness, and then to impart it unto her. In
this resolve she so artificially ordered things, that once in the Temple
(which was the only place I visited) she conjur'd me to acquaint her
with the occasion of my change, and grief; which she only asked, that
she might contribute to the cure of it. So generous a proceeding from
a person which I knew was so, made me resolve to be rather known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
than to be believed guilty; I therefore fully informed her
with what strict prohibitions <hi>Telamon</hi> had made me of ever visiting <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma</hi>
again, which had occasioned my seeming coldness, but had really
so punish'd it, that it had produced those visible effects she so obligingly
deplored, and endeavoured to remove. I had not in so publick a place
leisure to say more, or she, than that the next day in the same place and
hour I should meet her again.</p>
               <p>This command the succeeding morning I observed, and had not been
long in the Temple, but <hi>Irene</hi> came into it; and whilst others were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in their devotions, she told me as I kneeled by her, that <hi>Monyma</hi>
was neither worthy of my Love, nor her friendship; for she was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and so unkind, as not to believe the too great truth I had told her,
and she had told <hi>Monyma,</hi> who thought 'twas but a design to cloud my
change and passion for her self, and therefore that I must no more make
use of her solicitations, since they were so far from acting that cure, that
they made the disease.</p>
               <p>This information added wonder to my grief, both which so intirely
possess'd me, that I had hardly strength enough to acknowledg that
friendship, whose effects had so wounded me; which yet having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the best way I could, I immediately retired to entertain my
thoughts, which but too much contributed with fortune to torment me:
For now I had not only two Enemies to contest with, <hi>Telamon</hi>'s aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and <hi>Monyma</hi>'s jealousie; but the latter was so unhappily placed, that
what occasioned the ill, rendred it incurable, since she had a suspition of
her, by whom only I had hopes to cure it.</p>
               <p>This accessional misfortune conspiring with my <hi>Melancholly,</hi> cast me
into a languishing feaver, which so mov'd <hi>Telamon,</hi> that one evening he
came to my beds-side, and told me, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I cannot be mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

that I am the occasion of your sadness and indsposition, than I
am, that you would excuse it, if I durst acquaint you with the reasons;
which being confined by tyes too great to be broken, but by those
which only can absolve me from them, I am resolv'd to make a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
expresly to obtain their leave; provided before I go you will so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protest unto me, that during my absence, which shall be but
two Moons at most, you will make no engagement of marriage to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma;</hi>
and if by some accident I cannot foresee, I should miscarry in
the Journey, you will then before you make her any promise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
observe what is contained in this Paper, and not open it till that
time is eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as I know will invite you to believe I am as just, as you now think me
cruel; and that I had more wronged you in yielding to your desires,
than I do in opposing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="634" facs="tcp:96335:281"/>I shall not (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) tell you my amazement at
these words; my endeavours to disswade him from a Voyage which
I despaired not my obedience, and the sense I had of his goodness,
might in some short time exempt him from; nor those holy vows I
made him, when I could not divert him from his intended Journey,
that I would not make any such engagemeet to <hi>Monyma</hi> during those
two months, nor after, till first I had observed his commands in the
sealed Paper.</p>
               <p>Three days after, when <hi>Telamon</hi> found my health was in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
restored; after he had once again made me reiterate my former
vows, he brought me a Cabbinet, in which he told me there were
Jewels enough to continue for some years the Equipage I liv'd in;
then having imbraced me, and kist my cheek, he told me, Perhaps
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> you are much more than my Son; and then hastily went
aboard his Galley (for his Voyage was to be performed by Sea)
that I might not see some tears which were stealing from him.</p>

                  </gap>ture was qualified,
in few days I was able to pay the fair <hi>Monyma</hi> a visit
(which was not prohibited me). When I came into her
Chamber, I found to my amazement, none with her but
<hi>Diocles,</hi> who was kneeling by her. I believe my sight
surprized them as much as the company I found <hi>Monyma</hi> in, and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
posture did me: after we had express'd so much by a silent contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
one another; he rose up, and told me, I hope <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you are
glad to find the fair <hi>Monyma</hi> has made me your Rival, and that on my
knees I beg pardon for not having been earlier convinc'd of a Truth,
which I did never so much doubt, as now I joyfully acknowledg.</p>
               <p>This precipitate declaring himself my Rival, made me in spight of
that respect I owed <hi>Monyma,</hi> thus answer him: If your becoming my
Rival does no more please the fair <hi>Monyma,</hi> than it does trouble me,
you will be as unsuccesful in your submission, as you were in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance:
And I cannot but believe, had you a year sooner acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
so clear a truth, you had saved more thereby, than now you
will get.</p>
               <p>This reply so incens'd <hi>Diocles,</hi> that with an inflamed look he told
me; since any wounds were received, for not acknowledging <hi>Mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s
beauty was the highest, I shall repine at nothing therein, but
that <hi>Callimachus</hi> hand did give them, who owed his success to his
quarrel, not his courage. That I owed my success (I answer'd) in that
dispute, to what you say, I shall as freely confess, as that in any other
my Courage will give me the like over <hi>Diocles:</hi> which if this moment
I did not convince you of, 'tis only that all my passions yield to those
I have for the fair <hi>Monyma;</hi> which if yours did, we had not so long
cast off that respect we owe her; and which your rudeness shall not
make me be any longer guilty of. Whereupon having whispered a
word or two unto each other (which was an assignment where we should
meet an hour after), <hi>Diocles</hi> immediately saluted <hi>Monyma,</hi> and went
out of the room; she all this while was so astonish't, first at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to visit her, then at her being found at unwares, and lastly at our
quarrel, that she had not the power to command <hi>Diocles</hi> not to go
away, though twice she opened her mouth to do it. I was not a little
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:96335:282"/>
satisfied to have so favourable an opportunity of acquainting her what
had so long hindred my waiting on her, and what had now given me
the happiness of doing it: I will not by retail tell you all the particulars
of this day, nor of some subsequent actions; it being enough for you to
know, that I so well convinc'd <hi>Monyma</hi> of my passion, and how unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
I should be in it, that she at last freely permitted me to make her my
addresses again; and then she inform'd me, that a little before I came to
her, <hi>Philopomanes</hi> had brought <hi>Diocles</hi> into her chamber, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to accept of him as her servant, and as one whom he had
fixt upon for her husband: That <hi>Diocles</hi> had told her, he now perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a fault he as much gloried to confess, as formerly to be guilty of; and
that my visit had obligingly interrupted his saying more, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
her enduring more.</p>
               <p>This free proceeding rejoiced me as much as my res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>auration to her
favour, and made me believe what I had told my new Rival by way of
resentment, he would find a Prophecy. 'Twas then also she acquainted
me, how that her ignorance of what had invited me so often to visit
<hi>Irene,</hi> and so seldom her, had given her a little jealousie, which had but
too much punished it self by making her feel how sensible my supposed
change was to her, which she ingenuously confest was more so upon the
account of her having lost me, than that <hi>Irene</hi> had got me.</p>
               <p>These ravishing assurances left me no fears, but those which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from an apprehension of what <hi>Philopomanes</hi> authority might act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me; and that they were spoke to gain a power over me, which
might suppress that design I had against <hi>Diocles,</hi> over whom thereby
I might believe my advantage was sufficient, without seeking any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from my Sword.</p>
               <p>Whilst I was thus evincing my gratitude, and entertaining my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
<hi>Monyma</hi> went out of the room, as she told me, to call
one of her Women, left <hi>Philopomanes</hi> by finding us alone, might not
only suspect the cause of <hi>Diocles</hi>'s going away, but prohibit her recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any visits from me, to prevent his receiving the like disgust in
the future.</p>
               <p>Her return with what she went for, was so sudden, that it then si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd
one of my doubts; and because I had received as much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
as I could have promis'd my self from that day's waiting on
her, that I had a witness which deni'd me the liberty of those discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which I took most pleasure in, and that the hour of meeting <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
drew near; I kist the fair <hi>Monyma</hi>'s hands, and went not long after
to the place we had agreed on; where instead of finding <hi>Diocles,</hi> I
found a guard of Soldiers, who convey'd me to my own house; and
by their placing themselves at my Gate, made me know it was my
prison: soon after a friend of mine came to advertise me, that <hi>Diocles</hi>
had preceded me in the like usage.</p>
               <p>At first I repin'd against <hi>Monyma,</hi> who I knew was only acquainted
with our difference (and who, I learnt afterwards, went out of the
Chamber purposely to send notice thereof to the Officers of Justice)
apprehending she denied me the repetition of a Victory my Sword
had once conferr'd on me. But then my thoughts changing, I began
to believe (as Lovers still are apt to flatter themselves) that her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more a friend to my safety, than my honour, had occasioned this
proceeding; and in that faith I found in my trouble, my satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="637" facs="tcp:96335:282"/>But (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) to continue this part of my Story in that
brevity which I have hitherto practised, I shall tell you, That after the
Magistrates had declar'd we should not be freed till we had mutually
sworn never to fight against each other, and that all our friends had long
and unsuccessfully endeavour'd to extort that promise from us, wearied
with our confinement, more with our not waiting upon <hi>Monyma,</hi> but
most of all to obey her command, we past that assurance before her,
and continued as much friends, as persons which had so little cause for
it, could be. The next day after this reconciliation, <hi>Monyma</hi> sent to
me to meet her at <hi>Irenes</hi> (with whom she was perfectly reconcil'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
discover'd her mistake) where she told me, she had received a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
command from <hi>Philopomanes,</hi> never to admit any of my visits; and
therefore henceforth those I pay'd her must be where I then was, and that
too both privately and seldom, left the priviledg of going to see her
friend, might be also denied her. She further told me, she was confident
this had long since been resolv'd, though but that morning only enjoin'd:
for her Father knew too well how much an alliance with so considerable
a person, and so vastly rich, as <hi>Diocles</hi> was, would be to his advantage and
settlement in <hi>Miletus,</hi> not to prosecute it with his utmost endeavours:
and that had he given her that command before the reconciliation, it
would for ever have hinder'd it: for knowing I should have been eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
depriv'd of her company, I would probably have declin'd that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
which must have involv'd my Rival in the like infelicity: she
then too acquainted me with that which her disorders at my former visit
had made her omit, which was, that before <hi>Diocles</hi> made any expressions
of his passions to her, he had conjur'd her to acquaint him, whether
she had any inclinations for, or engagements to me; that if she had, he
might not be so rude as to give any interruption to a person, whose satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
should always form his. To which, she assur'd him she had not;
which then was a real truth; my not waiting on her having made her
believe I had supprest my inclinations for her, which had invited her to
silence any she honoured me with. This information made me much
lessen that aversion I had for <hi>Diocles,</hi> who I till then thought had design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
endeavoured to be my Rival; but on the other side I was struck with
so deep a sadness, foreseeing those obstructions my passion would contend
with, that neither some fresh favours of <hi>Monyma</hi>'s, nor <hi>Irene</hi>'s promising
me all her assistance, could any way divest me of my melancholly; which
made the first of them tell me, she thought my affection was not near so
high as I represented it, since she too visibly found my fear was greater
than my love; and that the apprehensions of things to come, were more
prevalent to make me sad, than her friendship was to hinder me from it.</p>
               <p>I was much asham'd to have this reprehension, but much more to have
deserved it; which to do so no longer, I forced my self to divert those
two persons, I so justly esteemed, which yet I did so constrainedly, that
I gave them more cause of pity, than satisfaction.</p>
               <p>I had some time the happiness of thus waiting on <hi>Monyma</hi> at the fair
<hi>Irene</hi>'s, and of receiving reiterated assurances from her, that neither <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s
address, nor <hi>Philopomanes</hi> commands, could any thing prevail to the
prejudice of my passion. And as she was determin'd not to give her self
to any without his consent, so she would not be given to any without her
own.</p>
               <p>'Twas by such entertainments as these that at length my grief was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
and almost the two Moons of <hi>Telamon</hi>'s absence, during all which
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:96335:283"/>
I had not heard any thing of, or from him, which gave me occasion
both of trouble and wonder. But alas, not long after this tolerable
condition I was told by <hi>Monyma,</hi> that her vigilant Father having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
these hours of entertainment we enjoyed at the fair <hi>Irene</hi>'s,
he had so expresly prohibited her ever to speak to me again, that now
there was no way left of communicating our minds, but by Letters,
which too must be manag'd with much circumspection and art, lest
that Expedient of acquainting each other with our thoughts might be
also denied us.</p>
               <p>But now I must make a little digression, to inform you of what brought
as great, as unexpected a change, not only in my then passion, but in
all the subsequent Actions of my life. When <hi>Sylla</hi> had pacified <hi>Asia,</hi>
and made conditions with, or rather impos'd them on <hi>Mithridates;</hi>
two of which were, that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> should be restored to <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
and <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to <hi>Bithynia,</hi> he shipt his Army for <hi>Italy</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed-up
Fleet of the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, and left <hi>Murena</hi> and <hi>Cotta</hi> with
two Legions only (either to shew how absolute his conquest had
been, or that he could spare no more from his intended one) to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
those Princes in their Thrones, and to order those other affairs
which his precipitate departure had denied him time to effect.</p>
               <p>These two <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders summon'd <hi>Mithridates</hi> to withdraw
his Garisons and Army out of those two Kingdoms; which at first he
seem'd to send Commands to have done, but the Governours made so
many delays, and frivolous excuses, that the <hi>Romans</hi> began to believe,
his intentions and his promises were different. And the truth was,
<hi>Mithridates</hi> did but protract the time, till he could hear what <hi>Sylla</hi>
did in <hi>Italy,</hi> resolving (as the event manifested) if <hi>Rome</hi> was engag'd
throughly in her domestick differences, he would not part with two
Dominions which had cost him so much Treasure and Blood, and
which were to be restored to persons he had too sensibly wrong'd,
to trust them with a power to right themselves; it being also much
easier to keep them out of their Kingdoms (if <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> were
plundg'd into a civil War) then having restor'd them, to keep his own.
The apprehension <hi>Murena</hi> had of this (for <hi>Cotta</hi> then returned for
<hi>Italy</hi>) made him send <hi>Mithridates</hi> word, that if by a set day, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
set apart, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had not right done them
by fair means, they should have it done by the Sword, and he should
be declared an Enemy for ever to the people of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This brisk message made the <hi>Pontick</hi> King find, that the day <hi>Murena</hi>
had set down for the restitution of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> if he did
not perform it by then, was the space he had allowed him to prepare
for War, which he cheerfully did; because the same time he received
certain intelligence, that <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> were so throughly engag'd
in Blood, that even <hi>Rome</hi> was become a humane Shambles, and that
they neither had the time, nor the power to mind any differences but
their own. But because he had experimented how advantageous it
was to the Land-war, to be Master of the Sea, and that he had resigned
to <hi>Sylla</hi> all his Fleet, as an evincement he was once conquer'd, and
as a greater, that he should not put him to the trouble and charge of
doing so again: He us'd all means imaginable to recover a second Fleet;
And though by the endeavours of <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uitus</hi> his Admiral, he had engag'd
many Pirates under his pay, yet he found so loose a discipline amongst
them, and consequently so uncertain a help, that their pay was more
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:96335:283"/>
considerable than their Service: and therefore he discharged them,
resolving to compose his Naval-forces of such only as should give him
hopes to repair the smalness of their number, by the exactness of their
Order and Obedience. This was the reason why he sent <hi>Betuitus</hi> to
visit the Maritime Towns of <hi>Caria,</hi> there to entertain such Ships of
War, as the free people of that Province would permit him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
               <p>And because <hi>Betuitus</hi> had unsuccessfully endeavoured to win the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
of those of <hi>Miletus,</hi> who were much more powerful at Sea, than
any Town in <hi>Asia;</hi> he at length (having corrupted some of the chief
men by large <hi>Presents</hi>) was advised by those to invite his King to
come personally thither, as the only, and then the certain way to effect
his desires.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pontick</hi> Admiral found this advice so probable, that he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his King to that Journey, who came with a very small retinue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
twenty Furlongs of the City, and from thence sent a couple of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to acquaint the Magistrates thereof, that they might not be
Alarm'd thereat, and to desire admittance and audience in a business
which was of such importance, that he would be himself the deliverer
of it.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Miletus</hi> though exceeding jealous of their safeties
and freedom, being truly inform'd of the small Train which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> esteemed it less hazardous to grant his desire, than
to deny it; since the affront might provoke him to a War, which could
not but be much more dangerous than his visit. They therefore sent
some of the eminentest amongst them to complement him, to desire
him that night to rest himself where he then was, which was a house
of pleasure belonging to the fair <hi>Irene</hi>'s Father, that the next day they
might be better prepar'd to give him a reception, which should have
more relisht of their respect, and of what was due to so great a King,
had not the shortness of the time hinder'd it.</p>
               <p>There was none unsatisfied at the sending of this message but <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomanes,</hi>
who apprehended <hi>Mithridates</hi> took this as a pretence, and
meant indeed to be revenged on him for his having delivered up
<hi>Ephesus</hi> to his Enemies.</p>
               <p>But these fears were soon supprest by the Senates assuring him, they
would all dye before their City should be no Sanctuary to such as fled
into it, as one. The same evening it was resolved, that two of the
greatest unmarried beauties of <hi>Miletus,</hi> should the next day be drest
like Amazons, and hold a silk Cord cross the Gate the <hi>Pontick</hi> King
was to enter at, which they should not loose till he had solemnly sworn,
he would attempt nothing against the liberty of the City; which when
he had done, then they should admit him, and the Magistrates should
be ready to wait on him.</p>
               <p>This they esteemed the eivilest way of exacting such an engagement,
which they could not think was more necessary, than they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
how without cause of disgust they might desire and receive
it.</p>
               <p>The performance of this ceremony was placed upon <hi>Monyma</hi> and
<hi>Irene,</hi> who the next morning in the clothes of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and drest
to perfection, went to <hi>Diana</hi>'s Gate, atteded by the Magistrates, and
all the Principal persons of the City; to which place <hi>Mithridates</hi> soon
came, only followed by his own Train, and many of the young Nobility
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:96335:284"/>
of <hi>Miletus,</hi> which went to wait on him into the City. When he came
to the Port, those two Beauties drew their Barricado cross it; and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma</hi>
with an action and tone altogether charming, told him, Sir, the
people of <hi>Miletus</hi> have for many ages been so justly jealous of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
freedom they enjoy, that they never admitted any Prince within
their Walls, till he had solemnly sworn, not to act any thing to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
or lessening of it.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, which their care has made them practise to all others, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
only invites them to make use of towards you; of which they all
hope you will be clearly convinced, by seeing what till then denies you
admittance into their gates, and what sex and number they have elected to
defend them with. <hi>Irene</hi> having spoken some words to the like effect, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
after a little silence fixing his eyes on <hi>Monyma,</hi> and addressing
his words to her, repli'd: A desire from a person of so much Beauty, and
so obligingly made, cannot be but obeyed; and therefore I swear by
all the Gardian-Angels, I will not at my now entring <hi>Miletus,</hi> attempt
or design any thing against the freedom of her inhabitants; and I swear
by you, Madam, speaking to <hi>Monyma,</hi> That what I bind my self from
now, I will abjure for ever for your sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monyma</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> to whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> also made some little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
at this assurance let fall the Cord, which made <hi>Mithridates</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
alight, who having saluted them both, told the first of them,
with a visible emotion; That (Madam) which you have desired from me
out of custom, I must beg of you upon a stronger motive; for doubtless
your City cannot have so much cause to apprehend losing their liberty
by me, as I have to lose mine by you: And therefore as I have sworn to
you to leave it in as perfect a freedom as I found it in; permit me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
you, the promise that I shall receive no worse usage from you. And
if after having seen so much beauty, I could have had any room left for
wonder, I should have entertained no small proportion, to find that a
people jealous of their Liberty, should yet permit a person to reside
amongst them, who is so certain a Conqueror of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monyma</hi> was so highly disorder'd by this unexpected entertainment,
that she was not a little oblig'd to the Magistrates, who by coming to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, detained her from making any reply.</p>
               <p>But after <hi>Mithridates</hi> had performed the uneasie Ceremonies due to
such people, he went again to <hi>Monyma</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> and leading of them
both, he desired some to shew him the way to their Houses, that he
might wait upon them thither; which he performed, though they and
the Magistrates often and earnestly beg'd of him to decline it.</p>
               <p>This was not thought strange by those who knew him; since he was so
great an admirer of Beauty, that he had twice already only upon that
account, married Ladies of less quality than either <hi>Monyma</hi> or <hi>Irene;</hi> of
the first of which, before he left her, he desired the permission of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
waiting on her whilst he resided in <hi>Miletus:</hi> And having learnt
whose daughter she was, he went to <hi>Philopomanes,</hi> embraced him, and
told him, for her sake he pardon'd all that was past, and promis'd him
as large a share in his esteem, and trust as ever.</p>
               <p>The morning of this ceremonious day, I had received a Letter from
<hi>Monyma,</hi> (all other ways being rigorously forbidden her) wherein
she acquainted me, she was assured I had some new dispute with <hi>Diocles,</hi>
which many apprehended would be decided by the Sword, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she conjur'd me, to secure her that day from those fears that belief
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:96335:284"/>
had raised in her, and that if she had an interest in me, I should evince
it by not exposing to any hazard a life which was as dear to her as her
own.</p>
               <p>This information had some little ground; for <hi>Diocles</hi> and I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
the night before at a Ladies house, some words, which doubtless
had occasioned a duel, had not our pre-engagement hinder'd in both any
thought of that nature. But finding her concerns of a quality, that it
was both a duty and kindness to silence them as soon as I could, I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
writ her a Letter to ascertain her of my obedience, and went with
it that evening to <hi>Irene</hi>'s, where I was confident to meet her, or at least
to get the Letter convey'd unto her.</p>
               <p>I had not been there long, when <hi>Monyma</hi> came in, accompanied by
<hi>Philopomanes</hi> and <hi>Diocles,</hi> the first being very vigilant over her, having
had some noise of our renewed quarrel.</p>
               <p>I am now (continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> changing his voice) come to the
relation of an accident that befel me, and which I believe never had,
nor never will have a parallel.</p>
               <p>The time of <hi>Telamon</hi>'s promised return, was that evening to expire;
and therefore I then carried about me the Letter which he left with me.
that was to tell me such strange and unexpected things, in case he came
not back by the time limited; this Letter by chance was about the
same bigness with that I was to deliver <hi>Monyma,</hi> and put into the same
pocket; so that by a sad misfortune, whilst <hi>Diocles</hi> and <hi>Philopomanes</hi>
were discoursing together at one end of the Chamber, and <hi>Monyma</hi> and
<hi>Irene</hi> were doing the like by the fire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> side, thinking I had found a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
opportunity to deliver my Letter, I took out the wrong one, and
walking carelesly to them, I stole the Letter into <hi>Monyma</hi>'s hand, who
being intently speaking to <hi>Irene,</hi> and not minding me, finding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unexpectedly touch her hand, she shriek'd out, and let it fall; which
noise made both <hi>Philopomanes</hi> and <hi>Diocles</hi> turn about, who perceived the
cause of it, as well by the Letter which lay on the ground, as by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<hi>Monyma</hi> and I were in; but she soon coming to her self again, took
up the Letter hastily and scornfully, and sealed as it was, cast it into the
fire, which immediately consumed it.</p>
               <p>This proceeding made my satisfaction rather than my trouble, knowing
she had no better an expedient left to remedy what had happened, than
thus to use me. And the better to contribute to this delusion, I went away
abruptly, and in a seeming high discontent. At which her Father and
her Servant were so pleased, that they both acquainted her with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, by passionate and sensible expressions: And the obliging <hi>Irene</hi>
following and overtaking of me, made me know the true cause of <hi>Mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s
proceeding; and offer'd, if I had any thing to acquaint her with, she
would perform the duty of that unhappy Letter; which I did: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
acknowledg'd the unmerited friendship she honoured me with, I
went to my own house, joyful that even misfortune it self had more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>guising of our Loves, than our inventions could; and
troubled at nothing but at <hi>Telamon</hi>'s absence, which perhaps I might
learn the occasion of, in reading the Paper he had left me, which I then
might lawfully do, the time he had limited being then eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uxt.</p>
               <p>But, O gods! what was my astonishment, when having open'd it, I
found it was the Letter I had writ to <hi>Monyma,</hi> and consequently 'twas
<hi>Telamon</hi>'s Paper which she had burnt! I cannot tell you what a throng
of several thoughts came into my fancy, and how many misfortunes this
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:96335:285"/>
one made me apprehend; sometimes I fear'd <hi>Monyma</hi> would believe I
had discover'd something in that Letter so much to my disadvantage,
that my fatal mistake was but to conceal it from her. Sometimes I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to think, that by my oath to <hi>Telamon,</hi> being obliged to perform
a journey mentioned in the burnt Letter, before I made any engagement
to <hi>Monyma,</hi> by that sad loss I was confin'd from an Hymeneal union,
should she condescend to one; and not temporarily, but eternally, should
<hi>Telamon</hi> be lost; which I was more than apprehensive he was, his last
assurance to me being, That if he liv'd he would be with me by the
time limited. Sometimes (so ingenious I was to torment my self) I
fear'd he affection'd me so exceedingly, and disgusted so much my alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with <hi>Monyma,</hi> for whom he knew that I had an unextinguishable
passion, that not having any means able to suppress it, he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
away, or banished himself, thereby to confine me (in observance of
those solemn Oaths I had taken) from that union.</p>
               <p>These and many resembling considerations I suggested to my self, against
my self; besides the vast trouble I was in for the loss of <hi>Telamon,</hi> as well as
for the ignorance of my own condition, which his last words obscurely
made me imagine, was more elevated than till then I had believed it;
all which concurring, or else my body of its own constitution, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clind'd
to sickness, cast me into so dangerous a one, that for six days
I gave my Servants and Physicians as little hope, as I had desire of life;
but the seventh day, the malignity of my fever was mitigated, and in
as many days more, I was in so promising a way of recovery, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
one of <hi>Monyma</hi>'s Pages desired to give me a Letter from his
Lady with his own hand; I gave him admittance, and he presented me
with the Letter, whose superscription was this:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>To the generous CALLIMACHUS.</head>
                     <p>And knowing the hand to be <hi>Monyma</hi>'s, having kist it with trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
I found it contained these words:</p>
                     <p>That same duty which first necessitated me to decline your visits, and
then your conversation, now makes me give my self away to the
<hi>Pontick</hi> King. When it was so powerful, as to make me do that for
<hi>Diocles,</hi> 'tis not strange it could make me do this for <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who
transcends him as much in merit, as in quality: believe me, <hi>Calimachus,</hi>
I am troubled to wear a Crown, since 'tis not from you that I receive
it; for whom I had such inclinations, that had the gods render'd it no
sin to follow the dictates of them, I should have prefer'd a private
condition with you, to the greatest Empire of the World without you:
And since you can no longer legitimately continue that affection you
once honour'd me with; Nor I, that which your merit and my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
made me once pay you; permit me at least still to continue in
your memory and esteem, as whilst I live you shall be the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thing (as far as honour will permit) in the thoughts of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Monyma.</hi>

               </floatingText>
               <p>As soon as I had done reading this fatal Letter, I look't distractedly
upon all my Servants which were present, and upon him that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
it, who, I knew, was one that <hi>Monyma</hi> repos'd a peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in, thereby endeavouring to ask that from the company by my
looks, which my words could not.</p>
               <p>At first I believed the reliques of my fever had distracted me, which
when I found it had not, I Wisht it had; then thinking I had read by a
false light, I made them open the Curtains of the bed and windows,
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:96335:285"/>
and re-perus'd those killing words, which finding the same I had found
at first, I sunk down into my bed, and fixt my eyes upon the youth which
had brought me the cause of these disorders, and seem'd by a silent,
mournful contemplating him, to reproach his having assumed so cruel
an employment: but when I observed him weeping so bitterly, that it
made me give him some of that pity his Message render'd him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, I fancied there was something of mysterious in it; and in that
flattering imagination, I commanded all my Domesticks out of my
Chamber, and then conjur'd the disconsolate youth to inform me, why
he would assume an employment which could not but occasion that
grief in which he so sympathized? and what could invite his Mistris to
so precipitate an inconstancy, if what was in the paper he had brought,
was a real truth, and not to palliate some necessitated proceedings of
hers, which I hop't he was sent to acquaint me with?</p>
               <p>Alas Sir (the Page reply'd), what you have read, is but too sad a
truth; and my tears are not shed upon that account which you seem to
ascribe them to, but to <hi>Monyma</hi>'s electing of me for so unthankful a
message, and to the grief which invaded her at the writing of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and you at the reception of it: yes Sir (he continued) had you but
seen how cruel a conflict she was in between her duty and affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
in what agonies she wrote unto you, when the first had got the victory
over the last, you might perhaps imitate me, and perhaps pity what you
detest. Thereupon he told me at large how <hi>Mithridates</hi> during my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
had made so solicitous an address to her, that many thought his
desire of a permission to employ such Vessels of War of <hi>Miletus,</hi> as would
serve him for affection or pay, was rather the pretence, than the cause
of his Voyage: How after he had found that the infinite Beauty he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
was guarded by a proportionate Virtue, he had chang'd his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and endeavour'd to appropriate what he had endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy;
which he might legitimately do, the Princess <hi>Calamis</hi> being dead
six months before, having some fifteen years past presented him with the
Prince <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> the Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> the Princess <hi>Roxana,</hi> and the
Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and the Princess <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> How as soon as so unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an overture was made to <hi>Philopomanes,</hi> he had embraced it with a
greediness, which shewed both his wonder and his joy; and had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly
press'd his daughter to embrace so high a Fortune, that this day
vanquish't by his intercessions, or rather persecutions, she has promis'd to
morrow to give her self to the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, who seems to be much
more satisfied at it, than any other concerned in it; and that she had
esteemed it fitter for her own Letter to inform me of it, than that any
thing else should; over which she reigned such showers of tears, that had
I seen them, I must have concluded, that could not be her design which
was so much her torment.</p>
               <p>I leave you to judg (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) whether this accession
to my former miseries had left Fortune any thing more than life to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
upon me. But lest this Page should be sent to observe my actions, as
well as to acquaint me with his Mistris's, I resolved to bear my loss in his
sight, with a constancy which should (when she knew it) invite her to
believe I was unworthy of such an usage; and that though she had given
he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> self the Victory, yet I would deny her the triumph of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore with as much composedness as those various agitations I
was under, would permit me, I forced my self to tell him, Go and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Lady in my Name, she should not have assured me, That as
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:96335:286"/>she would never give her self away without <hi>Philopomanes</hi> consent, so
she would be never given away by him, without her own; or having
given me that engagement, she should not have sent me this Letter, for
they are inconsistent; tell her also the same duty which has hitherto
made me obey all her Commands, I know will make me to obey this
last. I dismist him with these words, and endeavoured to find in my
reason, and resentment, the power of performing what I then
spake.</p>
               <p>But alas, some expressions in that Paper which had brought her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of declining my passion, too much contributed to the impossibility
of performing it, and continued me in disputes too painful to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>The next morning, though my indisposition were not a little increast
by the precedent days Agitation; yet I commanded one of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to bring me an account of that ceremony, which was made so
much to my cost: Towards the evening he returned, and told me that
<hi>Monyma</hi> had been led to the Temple of <hi>Hymen,</hi> with all the solemnity
which so short a preparation could admit of, where <hi>Mithridates</hi> waited
for her, in raptures as visible as great.</p>
               <p>But as the Priest was going to perform his Office, <hi>Diocles</hi> with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Sword ran furiously at the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, telling him, that none
could possess <hi>Monyma,</hi> whilst he had a Life and Sword to hinder it.</p>
               <p>This short declaration of his gave some <hi>Pontick</hi> Lords, who invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd
their King, time to draw their Swords; and though they could
not hinder him from receiving a slight wound in the Arm, which he
got putting by <hi>Diocles</hi>'s thrust, yet they hinder'd him from receiving
any more, and took away his life who had given him that; Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
a great many of the youth of <hi>Miletus,</hi> forced into the Temple:
against whom the Magistrates commanded all the assistants to make
opposition, and sent hastily for some of their <hi>Militia</hi> to suppress and
punish this disorder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pontick</hi> Nobility also, who had attended their King with some
of his ordinary Guards, put themselves into too resolute a posture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him and his Queen; That the Friends of <hi>Diocles</hi> understanding of
his Death, seeing the one, and hearing of the other, and only coming
to contribute to their Friends interest, in case he had successfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his design, began by little and little to retire; so that before
any help came, there was no need of it; but lest <hi>Mithridates</hi> might
again be expo'sd to the revenge of <hi>Diocles</hi> friends, as he had been but
too much to his, those Companies which came to his relief, were by
the Magistrates appointed to be his Guard whilst he continned in their
City.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Philopomanes,</hi> with all the chief men of <hi>Miletus,</hi> and
<hi>Monyma</hi> her self, earnestly conjur'd him to suspend his Nuptials till his
hurt was well, yet he was deaf unto them, protesting, he was much
more concern'd in the cure of that wound the fair <hi>Monyma</hi> had given
him, than in that <hi>Diocles</hi> had, and that delay would be more dangerous
to the first, than the last.</p>
               <p>This being often reiterated, as his opinion, and at length as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
the Priest performed his Office, and <hi>Monyma</hi> gave the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
King her hand and faith; who led her from thence to the Temple
of <hi>Diana,</hi> much adored at <hi>Miletus,</hi> their City standing near Mount
<hi>Latmus,</hi> the residence of her <hi>Endymion,</hi> where the remaining cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:96335:286"/>
being perfected, she was conveyed back under a Triumphal
Arch, supported by some of his Nobility, and followed by the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of all the people.</p>
               <p>I did nothing (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) but sigh during this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which being finished, I askt the maker of it, Whether he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
any thing in the new Queens countenance which relisht of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
rather than inclination, in all that performance. To which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reply'd,
That either her heart and face were in perfect mis-intelligence,
or never any of her Sex went with more joy to a Nuptial, than she did to
this. This he told me, as he confest to me afterwards, both as it was the
truth, and as believing my condition would rather have been impaired,
than advantag'd by a contrary assurance; since I was not to expect my
cure from her kindness, but my resentment. I commanded him again to
endeavour to bring me an account of the conclusion of the day, as he had
of the beginning; which not long after he did, by telling me, He had
seen <hi>Monyma</hi> in <hi>Mithridates</hi> arms. All that night I took as little rest, as
the <hi>Pontick</hi> King did; for I could not but consider, That in the same
time I was deploring my loss, another was enjoying it. Ah how sensibly
I felt my resentments were inferior to my love, since I found my trouble
in that which otherwise had presented me my cure.</p>
               <p>Whilst I lay thus strugling with my miseries, I learnt, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ive days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Nuptials, <hi>Mithridates</hi> having obtained licence from the Senate
of <hi>Miletus</hi> to engage what Ships of War he could in their Cities or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
(at the same time granting the like favour to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> to preserve that equality they had till then
so wisely for themselves observed, believing the advantage they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the <hi>Pontick</hi> King in first making his Levies, would be repay'd by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them voluntarily a priviledg they had never solicited for) he took
a solemn leave of them; and taking his Queen with him, was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by them to the utmost limits of their Countrey, where after many
professions and embraces, he had taken his final leave, hasting into
<hi>Pontus,</hi> to prepare for that War he was determin'd to make with <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
and his Confederates.</p>
               <p>The next day after this departure, the fair <hi>Irene</hi> sent to visit me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
she would have made one her self to have comforted me in my
loss, had the Laws of Civility permitted it; and had she not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I had been so highly injur'd by one of her Sex, that it might too justly
raise in me an aversion to all of it. I return'd this obligingness with all
the respect and acknowledgment I was capable of, assuring her I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be an enemy to a sex which had a person of so much merit of it, as she
was, who had given me more inclinations for it, than <hi>Monyma</hi> could do
the contrary. It was above six moons (generous Hearers, that I lay lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
in my misfortunes, and disputing for the victory over them; which
at length having obtained, I resolv'd to search all the inland-seas for <hi>Tela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who (I had some hope) might only have been taken by Pirates; at
least I esteem'd it my duty, as much as 'twas my inclination, to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unattempted which might satisfie me I had perform'd that debt I
owed him; hoping further, that the varieties of this voyage might settle
the cure I had with so many difficulties acted; in prosecution of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
I caused a large Galley to be bought; and having Man'd her to the
utmost both for the Sword and the Ore (the immense quantity of Jewels
left me by <hi>Telamon,</hi> inabling me to defray the most prodigal expences;
which made me conjecture his quality was more eminent by much, than
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:96335:287"/>
he had made the World and me believe) I prepar'd to leave for ever
<hi>Miletus,</hi> the place in which I had enjoy'd and suffer'd so many satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and misfortunes: But this resolve was a few days suspended from
execution, by a confinement which I was extreamly pleas'd with, The
Nuptial of the fair <hi>Irene,</hi> who was to be married to a <hi>Carian</hi> Lord, that
in all mens opinions, and, which was more, in her own, perfectly deserv'd
her: I omitted no gallantry in this occasion, which might evince my
joy for it, and that high friendship I so justly pay'd her. I was also a
little concern'd to let her see, that as I could endure all the crosses of
love, where mine was not unfruitfully received; so I could divest my
self of my passion, when I found it was unworthily plac't.</p>
               <p>Having spent some days in this employment, and left the fair <hi>Irene</hi> in
that condition she desir'd and merited; I took of her and her Lord a
final leave; and setting to Sea, I follow'd the course which Fortune only
had appointed for me, believing she could not be as inconstant as she is
represented, if she made me as unhappy in one Element, as she had made
me on the other.</p>
               <p>I will not tell you how many Coasts and Maritime-towns I visited, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after <hi>Telamon;</hi> nor the particulars of a signal Naval-fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Betuitus,</hi> between the <hi>Hellespont</hi> and the <hi>Thracian
Bosphorus,</hi> in which I joyn'd with the former, having too much cause to
be an Enemy to <hi>Mithridates;</hi> nor those Civilities the King of
<hi>Bithynia</hi> confer'd upon me, nor those high Employments he offer'd me
to tye me to his service. Those, though otherwise considerable in
themselves, I designedly omit, that your attentions may be entertained
with Adventures less unworthy of them. One day as I was sailing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Promontory of <hi>Assum,</hi> and the Island of <hi>Lethos,</hi> I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three Galleys which were engaged in a furious fight; and though I
made up to them with as much haste as my sails and oars could afford
me; yet before I joyn'd them, the dispute was ended by the Victory the
two had obtained over the one.</p>
               <p>The succesful were so intent upon the joy of their being so, or upon
the dividing the spoil, that though I was come near enough to perceive
them transporting in their Boats from one Vessel to another, many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
richly cloth'd; yet they never put themselves into a posture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or so much as seem'd to be concern'd at my approach; so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any acts of hostility, I came near enough to see a Lady fall upon her
knees, and with elevated hands to beg my assistance, which she seem'd to
implore with so good grace, and so much to need it, that I resolv'd to
afford her whatever lay in my power.</p>
               <p>But to make my quarrel just, or to render any needless, I desir'd the
Commander of those Gallies to restore those fair Captives to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or to acquaint me whether it was justly they had lost it.</p>
               <p>But instead of a civil reply, I was rudely commanded to be gone, lest
I should be involv'd in that captivity I so impertinently enquired into.</p>
               <p>This harsh Answer took from me all hopes of acting my design, but
by force; and therefore to loss no time, and to take them in that disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which their advantage in number seem'd to render necessary, I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
grappl'd with that Galley which the prisoners had been conveyed
into, and leaping upon the deck, I soon made them find, that an answer
not so rude had been more safe, than that force which made them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to give it.</p>
               <p>But whilst I was disputing the Victory in one of the Enemies Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:96335:287"/>
my own was boarded by the other; where though they found some
considerable resistance for a time, yet in the end they were reduced to
need and call for mine; which the less disadvantageously to afford them,
I left my Lieutenant to justifie that progress we had made, and with
some Soldiers with me I return'd into my own Galley, which I found
had almost lost that Name; yet our unexpected relief so animated our
friends, and therefore so terrified our enemies, that from assaulting they
began to retreat, and after a little time to leap confusedly into their own
Galley. We knew how necessary it was to husband this confusion, so that
following them, we soon made our selves Masters of their Vessel, killing
all that resisted, and extending mercy to those that flung down their arms
and implor'd it. This small success gave me hopes of a greater, which
the sooner and hopefullier to solicite, I left some of my men to guard
the prisoners; and with the rest I flew to my Lieutenant, who was in a
condition to need my assistance, before I could afford it him: For a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
cover'd with a rich Armour, and having a Helmet shaded with
a great plume of Carnation Feathers, had during my absence animated
his own party, and acted such prodigious things, that he had almost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
us to a condition of only hoping to dye handsomely. This Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
after much dispute, I singled out, and began a combat with him,
which made me know the honour of the success would at least equal the
danger of acquiring it. Thrice we were forced to take breath, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us to deprive each other of that little which was left us; and the
fourth time he lifted up the sight of his Helmet, and discover'd a face so
full of deformities, that it took up my amazement, till his words put a
period to it, which to the best of my remembrance were to this effect:</p>
               <p>Valiant man! thou hast shewed so much courage in a cause wherein
thou hast had so little invitation to manifest it, that it gives me a high
desire to make thee my friend, at least to have thee no longer my enemy;
which to perswade thee to, I shall freely give thee all my this days ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions, except one Beauty, for whom I have so unextinguishable a
passion, that it has forced me against the respect and duty I owe, and
shall but in this occasion, eternally pay her, To endeavour by force that
which by my Prayers and Services I too long and too unsuccessfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</p>
               <p>I cannot think it strange, I repli'd, that believing I fought for <hi>Pillage,</hi>
thou should make me so low an offer. But I would have thee know,
Since thy rudeness and the assistance which some prisoners thou hast, have
implor'd of me, has only made me draw my Sword, nothing less than an
acknowledgment of thy offence, and a restoring those Captives to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can invite me to sheath it. One then, or both must dye, the other fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
answer'd, which is a fate I can with less trouble embrace, than
those conditions thou proposest to avoid it.</p>
               <p>These words being finish'd, he pull'd down the sight of his Helmet,
and renewed the Combat with a rage, which I could not attribute to
a less motive, than that which animated his; twice with two reverses
he made me stagger, and made me owe my life to the faithfulness of my
Armour; but at length I gave him so large a wound in his left side, that
despairing of Victory, as of Life, he hastily abandon'd the Combat, and
ran to the Stern-Cabin, to which place I flew after, and just as he enter'd
it, I past my Sword up to the hilts through his body, which he being less
concern'd in than in not imploring a pardon from the Beauty he serv'd,
he fell on his knees by her, and presenting her a handful of his blood, he
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:96335:288"/>
begg'd her, that that Oblation with the loss of his life, might expiate a
Crime, which he was much more troubled to have committed, than to
have it thus punish'd: Then breathing a deep groan, and kissing her feet,
he expir'd in that performance.</p>
               <p>Though you may believe all this did not a little surprize her to whom
he spoke, and at whose feet he dy'd; yet I can assure you, her beauties
did infinitely more surprize me.</p>
               <p>Ah Gods! With what Majesty and Empire did they disclose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves!
and how, at first sight, she divested me of a high anger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
me with a higher admiration, which having oblig'd me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
her a while in silence, I at last broke it, to tell her: I implore
your pardon, Madam, if to obey your commands, and to serve you, I
have been guilty of a rudeness which has rendred me unworthy of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but had I known your Enemy and mine had fled unto you as his
Sanctuary, he should have found you an inviolate one, since to have
been in that way suspended from my revenge, had been a higher duty
than to have acted it.</p>
               <p>That admirable beauty to whom these words were addrest, by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
looking upon all those Women which waited on her, seem'd to
evidence her surprize and astonishment at them, and then told me; What
you have acted and hazarded for me, should have prepar'd you sooner
to have receiv'd my retributions, than to have made me any excuses;
But those I owe you are such, that what contracts the debt, renders me
uncapable to satisfie it.</p>
               <p>Madam, I reply'd, You will (I hope) permit me to believe, your not
owning my fault too infinite, is but only to acquaint me your mercy is,
which has in that one performance so over-rewarded the duty of the
service I have pay'd you, that I must beg of you to honour me with
more of your commands, to expiate my having so rudely obey'd
these. What you undertook, and what you have performed, She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
are both so generous, that it leaves me no apprehension that you
will imploy your Victory to any other end than to restore us to that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
whose loss invited you to sollicite it; and therefore you have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
me nothing more to desire of you, but to convoy us to our intended
Harbour, that we may not repeat as great a misfort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne as that which your
courage has freed us from.</p>
               <p>That, Madam, (I reply'd) which now shall be my obedience, should
have been my desire, if I had not esteem'd the honour you have already
done me, too great to importune you for any more: but before I obey
you, allow me to free the place and Galley you are in, from the blood
and disorder in it, and to restore your Friends and Servants to that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
they had so underservedly lost. Then dragging out the dead body
that was in the Cabbin, and causing the blood to be wash'd away, I went
to see what face things wore, since my abandoning the Combate; but I
must freely acknowledg, I went away in such disorders and emotions,
that I found I had endanger'd my own liberty, by a sight of that beauty,
to whom I had restor'd hers.</p>
               <p>Do not wonder, I beseech you, that I could so soon be apt to receive
the impressions of a passion, in which I had so recently been unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
since those Charms which now began to subdue me, were such,
that I had as little the power, as the will to resist them: Never had the
gods been so prodigal of their gifts to one person, as to her; Her sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and shape were such, that it was as impossible to have found in
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:96335:288"/>
either a defect, as to have wish'd to either an addition.</p>
               <p>Her complexion was so fresh, so lively, and so admirably mix'd, that
it might entirely have taken up my wonder, had not her fair eyes chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
at least an equal part as their just proportion: in brief, all things
were so peculiar in her, that I could not say, this individual grace or
feature was exact according to the received rules of Beauty, since hers
were of a quality that impos'd new ones, which had nothing of unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in them, but the impossibility of having them imitated. Neither
could her exterior graces transcend that rational faith I had assum'd of
the Beauties of her soul, which had manifested an absolute equality in
the highest extreams; for her grief at her captivity had not dejected
her, nor her joy at her restauration exalted her; but she continu'd in
as perfect a calm, as if her mind, secure in it self, nor fear'd the frowns of
Fortune, nor car'd for her smiles. Whilst I was entertaining my thoughts
on the Stern-deck with this part of my relation, the reliques of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
were kill'd and taken, the Galley according to my orders was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd
of the dead, and all the innocent prisoners were brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into mine; where they had waited longer, had not my Lieutenant
interrupted my ravings, and invited me to dispose of them: which
when I went to do, I found that Lady amongst them, who had in so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a posture, before the fight began, invited my assitance. I desired
her to acquaint me, who that Beauty was she waited on, or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd:
To which she told me, her Name was <hi>Mithridatia;</hi> that she was
daughter to a <hi>Pontick</hi> Gentleman who was highly lov'd by his King, and
who was Lord of <hi>Lestos;</hi> which that morning she had left, to go to her
Father, who had concluded a marriage for her with a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
This News did not a little surprize me; but lest she might observe
so much, I beg'd her pardon if my curiosity were so uncivil as to desire
to know who that was which had taken them prisoners, and seem'd to
have so violent a passion for the fair <hi>Mithridatia.</hi> She reply'd, His name
was <hi>Nepturnus,</hi> that he was Admiral of the <hi>Cilican</hi> Pyrates; That some
six Moons past being forc'd into <hi>Miletus,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Lestos,</hi> by
a furious storm, he had seen <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> and had assum'd a violent, but
secret passion for her; that having been near her Father (who was then
by <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Command contracting with him for a <hi>Cilician</hi> Fleet)
when he sent Orders for her going to <hi>Pontus,</hi> he resolv'd (as this day he
acknowledg'd to her) to intercept her at Sea, and to carry her into his
own Countrey, where he declar'd he intended to make himself King,
and having a Crown to present her, he hop'd she would not in an Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
way refuse it. He made her many Apologies for his being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to such a proceeding, which yet operated so little upon her, that
she was determined to have owed that obligation to death, which now
she is indebted for to you.</p>
               <p>This Lady having thus finish'd her information, I gave her many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
for it, and accompani'd with her, and follow'd by those late
prisoners, I went to <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> and told her, Forttune, or the Mercy
of <hi>Nepturnus,</hi> had spar'd so many of her friends, which I desired her to
accept of from my hands; to dispose of such of her Enemies as had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
the fury of the Sword, and to name that place to which she would
have us steer our course. The first she receiv'd with satisfaction; the
second she beg'd me to act in as I thought fit; and for the last, she nam'd
<hi>Nicomedia</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> the then residence of <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and consequently of her Father, who she assur'd me would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:96335:289"/>
my obligation in a way much more proportionate to it self, than
she had the power to do.</p>
               <p>The name of the <hi>Pontick</hi> Kings Court did so strangely surprize me,
that when she mention'd it, I could not but repeat it; but recollecting
my self again, with a deep sigh I said, I would obey her, though the place
she had nam'd had in it horrors for me, which nothing but her commands
could perswade me to engage my self in.</p>
               <p>She seem'd at this declaration to be as much surpriz'd, as I had been at
what constrain'd me to make it; which made her conjure me to inform
her, what high cause of aversion I had for that place; and since I had,
that I would but land her on any shore which obeyed <hi>Mithridates</hi> his
Power. Madam, I reply'd, the knowledg of what you desire, will give
me so deep a sadness, and afford you so little satisfaction, that if it may
not displease you, I should implore your revoking that command; which
yet if you do not, I shall obey it; but I must beg your pardon if I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not your last orders; for since they concern my particular, I should
be too unworthy your Care should I accept of it. Then pausing a little,
and recollecting my self, I thus continued: No, Madam, upon more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration, I am now so far from being troubled at my going
to the <hi>Pontick</hi> Court, and at my detestation of it, and perhaps of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
person, that I passionately wish, if it were possible, that the
cause thereof were capable of accession, that in that performance you
might be convinc'd I have no consideration higher than to serve the fair
<hi>Mithridatia.</hi> I found her a little troubled at what I had spoken; but
finding I was unalterable in my resolution of waiting on her thither, she
at length assented to my doing so; and we steer'd our course towards
<hi>Nicomedia;</hi> to which place we had arriv'd in two days, had that obliging
gale which then follow'd us, continued so long: But it was soon forc'd
to give place to a raging North-East wind, against which we strugled
two days and one night; but then it became so uncontroulable and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that the Pilot forsook the Helm, and we soon after our hopes: this
was about an hour before day During all the extremity of the storm, I had
declin'd giving the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> any full intimation of her danger,
that if the gods had deliver'd us out of it, she might have been exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in some measure from the apprehensions of it; but now that the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
concealment of our condition might have proved a greater crime than
civility, I went trembling to the Stern-Cabbin; and having desired and
obtained the permission of coming in, having first acquainted her of the
danger with a dejected countenance, I told her; The gods are my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
Madam, that the loss of my Life would be my satisfaction, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the eminent hazard yours is in, might cease; but we are now invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in a ruin, where neither the actings of Courage, nor the sacrificing
my self for your safety, can any way purchase the ambition'd end. My
grief at these words rudely disabled me from speaking more, which
gave the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> an invitation thus to answer me: That death,
generous <hi>Callimachus,</hi> which you are so sensible of, merits not your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which might, upon a general account, be more justly employ'd for
your own loss, than for mine; the World will lose by me but a person
who has hitherro given neither much hope, nor any evincement of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
considerable; but by you it will be deprived of so much, both
by expectation and evidence, that your private loss may truly be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a publick one: but when ever the gods do call us, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
our selves as willingly to death, as we would enjoy the felicities of
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:96335:289"/>
life, if they do assign us those for our portion; else we follow not their
will, but ours; and serve not them, but our selves.</p>
               <p>These words, so obliging to me, and religious in themselves, made me
resign all my fears to admiration; from which I was soon recall'd by a
hideous cry in the Galley, by which I too soon, and too clearly knew
the Vessel was founder'd, had struck, or sprung some greedy Leak. The
horror of the noise and danger, made me forget all respect; so that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Mithridatia</hi> in my arms from off a bed on which she lay in her
clothes, I carried her on the deck; whither I was no sooner come, but
the conquer'd Galley open'd in the middle, and left us to the mercy of
an Enemy, which she found had none.</p>
               <p>I was unalterably determin'd to carry what I held, on shore, or dye
in the attempting my highest inclination and duty.</p>
               <p>Thrice by the fury of the Sea, the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> was struck out of
my arms, and thrice I recover'd her again; but at last my strength fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me: and though I yeilded to few in the world in the art of swimming,
yet in such mountains of water, so much obscurity, and being confin'd to
save another I was much more concern'd for, than I was for my self, my
spirits were so diminish'd, that I look'd for no more, than to find my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
in that Enemy, from whom I receive my death; happy only in this,
That I should not out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> live a loss that I much more apprehended than
death; and that mine should be serving, nay expiring in the arms of a
person of as high a vertue as beauty. But the gods, who often delight
to cast us into dangers, the more to endear that mercy which relieves us
out of them; and to make us think upon a better place, by seeing the
uncertainties of this; sent a plank of the broken Galley to me, just in
that moment of time, upon which with very much difficulty I got, and
had by that help a little leisure to recover my breath and strength; but
finding both were too great a load for it, I begg'd the fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi>
having first acquainted her therewith, not to quit her hold, whilst I
would swim by it, and endeavour to shove it to land, which then by the
dawn of the morning I discover'd not a furlong from us. But that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
person conjur'd me, not out of a vain hope of saving two lives,
to forsake almost a certainty of saving one.</p>
               <p>Ah Madam, I repli'd, I beseech you do not hope to invite me to
save my life by an action which will render me unworthy of it; nor
think me capable of a performance, which if you believ I am, you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me that esteem, which next to your safety, I value above all things else;
no, Madam, I am unmovably resolv'd to bring you out of this danger, or to
share in that Fate I want power to alter. Thereupon sliding from the
Plank, I began to thrust it toward the shore, where at length, through
many hazards, we arrived; the sea and the wind which had brought us
to that extremity now contributing to the freeing of us from it. Never
did there appear any thing so like <hi>Venus</hi>'s ascension out of the sea, as the
fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s did; &amp; had not her rude usage by that Element destroy'd
that Faith, she could not but have been taken for the goddess of it. But
alas, as soon as she had recover'd the shore, what through the difficulties
she had strugled with, what through the bruises she had received from
the shelves near the land, she fell into a swound, and was so carried by
me to a house near the place where her fainting had seized on her: As
I was performing this duty, casting my sight towards the sea to observe
whether any reliques of our small Fleet had been spared by the furious
waves, I discover'd a little Skiff with but one in it, which driven by
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:96335:290"/>
the wind, was recovering that place I then was on: I had not the leisure
to see the event of this discovery, or to afford that necessitous person in
it my assistance; for the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s condition took up all my
thoughts and care, who I soon after brought to that house I intended;
where promising those in it, high rewards for their service and assistance,
both they and I began to pay her, and afford her all we could: but her
senses were no sooner return'd, than she was invaded by a violent fever,
which yet could not render her condition more dangerous, than therefore
it did mine. At the first appearance of this fatal disease, I posted away
several Expresses for the most expert Physicians at <hi>Larissa,</hi> the nearest
City to us (for we had been shipwrack'd in that Gulph, which takes its
name from the Mountain <hi>Pelius,</hi> which is not many furlongs from the
bottom of it). But as I was taking order that all the helps which Art
could yeild the fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> might be prepared for her, there came
one all over wet into the house we were in, who to my joy and wonder
I found was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> servant, which <hi>Telamon</hi> had taken
whilst he resided in <hi>Greece;</hi> and who had so faithfully and cheerfully
serv'd me during my residence at <hi>Miletus,</hi> that I had entrusted him with
my most secret concernments. I lern'd from him, that 'twas he I had
seen in the Skiff, which with his naked Sword in his hand, he had secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for me, when he had observ'd the Galley foundring; but that the
care he had of me had been fruitless, since the same wave which had
broke the vessel, carried him out of it in the Skiff, which having no
man in it but himself, was driven even by the storm to the shore. He
farther presented me the small Cabinet, in which I had my preciousest
Jewels, which he carried with him to supply our want on the land, if the
gods ever brought us in safety thither. I was a little pleas'd at the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
of <hi>Demetrius</hi> (who (continu'd <hi>Callimachus</hi>) had abandon'd the
World with me, and is one of the Society of this place) and at the care
he evidenc'd, in saving so plentiful a preservative against want, which
otherwise I might have apprehended in a strange Countrey, having my
self only sav'd some Diamonds of good value, which I constantly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about me. But alas, these faint satisfactions were rudely cast out
by the too eminent danger the Physicians at their arrival told me their
fair Patient was in. Five days and nights her Fever encreas'd; during
all which time, at seasonable hours, I never stirr'd from her feet, paying
her all my respects and services; but the sixth night her malady gave
the Physicians so little hope of her life, that they advised her to prepare
her self for the loss of it.</p>
               <p>This advertisement was no sooner receiv'd, than she sent for me into
her Chamber (for that night by her express Commands I was removed
into my own, my watchings and my distempers having flung me into an
indisposition, which they had assur'd her would prove hazardous, if not
timely prevented); as soon as I came in, she commanded all else out of
it; which being obey'd, she told me with much grace and calmness; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus,</hi>
that life which you have so often and so miraculously preserv'd
at Sea, the gods are now determined to lend me no longer; and I obey
their summons with a joy which assures me of that happy place whither
I am now going.</p>
               <p>If I resent any trouble at this change, I assure you it proceeds from
some regret I have of owing you so much; yet hereby of being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
uncapable of any thing, but acknowledging it, and of being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to conceal my real condition from you, which is occasion'd
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:96335:290"/>
by a hasty vow I made, and caus'd all my Women to take, when you
were disputing, as we then apprehended, only whose prisoners we should
be; I conjure you to satisfie your self, nothing but such a tye could have
occasion'd my silence. Ah Madam (I repli'd, interrupting her) what I see
and find of you, renders my knowledg of your Extraction unnecessary,
and your goodness needed not have apologiz'd for your continuing me
in that ignorance, since your Empire over me is so absolute, that the
knowledg of what is your will, is the highest reason for me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with it.</p>
               <p>But oh gods! Madam, is it possible that so much Beauty and Virtue as
you possess, should be showed us, to make it as much our misery, as now
'tis our wonder! For the knowledg of it cannot more act to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the latter, than this hasty deprivation of it will to the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the former.</p>
               <p>That little Beauty and Virtue, she answer'd, which I have, is but lent
me by those who have the power and the right to recall it; and who
have been so merciful, as to give me, till I received your obligations, no
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inements to that life they resolv'd to take so early from me; and
who I believe have given me those, but the better to illustrate and set
out my obedience; which could not have appear'd so clear, had it not
had some difficulties to have contested with.</p>
               <p>These words she spoke in so low accents, that I fear'd they were her
last; and that fear I found was not groundless, when immediately stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth her hand towards me, her eyes soon lost their conquering light;
and the small remainder of that Vermilion which was left in her cheeks,
fled hastily away, and resign'd the entire Empire to that colour which by
the Laws of Nature and Beauty was but to have enjoy'd a share; and
by a few sighs seem'd to celebrate the separation of a soul and body
which had once been so excellently match'd.</p>

               <p>THE loud and confus'd noise I made at this fatal loss, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
drew such as waited in the next room, into <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datia</hi>'s;
where all their Art and care proving unsuccessful,
they forced me into my own chamber, for nothing else
could have made me abandon a person, who though dead,
I valu'd more than all things which were alive. I cannot tell you the
horrors I was in; which though infinite, yet they could not transcend
my joys, when <hi>Demetrius</hi> came to my bed-side and told me, the fair
<hi>Mithridatia,</hi> which had layn six hours without motion, was, when the
Physicians had given her over, come again to life, and was fallen into a
sweat, which they assur'd me was the Crisis of the disease. I could not
credit this by the report of my ears, unless my eyes confirm'd it, which
they soon did, and thereby gave me more felicity in that one service,
than in all they had ever done me before. In brief, the Physicians last
thought was the truest, and in three days their fair Patient was in so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
a way of recovery, that my fears had quite resign'd their places
to my hopes. But she was no sooner out of danger, than I fell into no
small one, by a fever, at least as violent as hers had been, partly through
over-watching, partly through the disorders of the ship-wreck, partly
through the grief which invaded me at the suppos'd death of the fair <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatia:</hi>
But those gods which had preserved her, extended the like
mercy to me; but yet I fell into three relapses, which were much more
dangerous than my first sickness; the last of those was so long and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,
that it render'd my recovery almost a miracle. This desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was in, being told fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> she forced both her
modesty and her weakness to give me a visit, which she might perform
without exposing her self to the open air, my chamber being next to
hers. As soon as I saw her come in, I told her; I know not, Madam,
whether I have cause to rejoice, or be troubled at the honour I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
for if I consider my self, I have infinite reason for the first, but
if I consider you, I have as much reason for the last: but I hope you
come to oblige me with some of your commands, which will certainly
present me my cure; for I cannot believe the gods can esteem the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my sins so necessary, as my obedience to you.</p>
               <p>This, she reply'd, which you now have spoken to acquaint me with
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:96335:291"/>
that belief, might well hinder it any longer from being yours; The gods
cannot be what we must believe them, if we believe them to be gods, and
not to be offended at your esteeming civility a greater debt from you
to me, than is the acting of justice from them upon you; do not, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> by such discourses, give me more cause to fear
your loss, than your sickness can; and be confident, your declining to
evidence your acknowledgments this way, will more pleasantly satisfie
me of them, than any thing you can say in it. Madam, I answer'd,
there is nothing could so entirely convince me of my being in a fault,
as your declaring that I am; and nothing I hope can so much convince
you, I will no more be guilty of wit, as your having commanded it me:
But, Madam, will' you permit me to believe the gods will restore me my
health, now they and I find you are concern'd in it? I do not only, she
reply'd, permit you to believe I am concern'd in it, but desire you to
make it a part of your faith, as I assure you it shall be of my prayers, That
what you have spoken in your sickness, may not provoke them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it.</p>
               <p>And to retrench you from the occasion, as well as to hinder those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
which I apprehend your civilities to me, and their necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me to such answers, may cast you into, I will retire into my own
chamber; which immediately she did, but with looks which told me my
reprehensions were upon a score, which made them an Obligation.</p>
               <p>That night I took so much rest, that the next day I was capable of
entertaining my self in the just causes I had to admire the virtues and
beauties of <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> which was my most constant imployment all the
time I kept my chamber; and all the time I had the high priviledg to
wait on her, in hers, I had new and fresh occasions to continue it.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell you what resolute opposition I made before I yielded;
which when I had, I was in a far higher perplexity that I had made so
much resistance, than formerly I had been, that I was able to make no
more.</p>
               <p>My precedent usage from one of the fairest of her Sex, which thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
I had considered as an invitation to hate all of it, I now look'd
upon as an effect of my Fate, which had denied me the less felicity, but
to make me pursue the greater; and I could no longer quarrel at that
inconstancy which had already more oblig'd than it could injure me,
since'twas a Nobler happiness to sollicite <hi>Mithridatias</hi>'s esteem, than to
possess <hi>Monyma</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>These, and a crowd of such like suggestions, made me know I was
a Lover, and not the repeating of any symptoms had appear'd in me in
my first passion, which were as short of such as I then resented, as those
were of my condition before I had resented any.</p>
               <p>Never perhaps did any beauties captivate at once with more Majesty
and more sweetness, than the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s did, which inspir'd me
with a flame so far transcending my first, that had I known whilst serv'd
<hi>Monyma,</hi> that I could have lov'd as much as I did, and had lov'd her no
more than I then did, and that she had known the like, I must have both
condemn'd my self, and have excused her: my former fire appear'd but a
heat compar'd to this, and rather seem'd to have prepar'd my heart for
this conquest, than to have acted one over it.</p>
               <p>I was not ignorant how difficult a design I engaged in; How unapt so
severe a virtue as hers, would be to admit of an address; How improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it was to invite so infinite a beauty, to believe any services could
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:96335:292"/>
give any man a title to it; How unhappy I was in not knowing from
whom I deriv'd my extraction, and in not having a Place or Friend
to whom I might retire, and enjoy my happiness, should her mercy
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er it on me: and lastly, what just cause I had to believe (by what
she had told me) that her blood proportion'd the greatness of her
beauty and merit, and might render the first of those three as high an
obstacle, as the two last. This latter consideration made me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times resolve to acquaint her with my passion, before so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an obstruction was openly known unto me; But then those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
soon vanish'd, when I throughly consider'd such a proceeding
might appear to her, as a making use of her being in my power,
which was a meanness could hardly have been more punish'd, than by
performing it.</p>
               <p>I was also loth by so precipitate a proceeding (if she told me what
she did to hinder my manifesting to her, what she might have discover'd
or fear'd in me) to have given her cause to believe, that any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her quality could suppress the payment of a duty, which two
higher considerations could not; besides, I esteemed it as uncivil, as
unwise, to inform her of my adoration, till a succession of services had
given me some title to it; and then also I concluded it more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to her beauties and the passion I paid them, to let her discover it,
than I; and indeed, I was much more apprehensive she would do so to
some, than not at all: I beg your pardons (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>), if
I have too particularly retail'd this part of my Story, which I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to repair, by contracting some other.</p>
               <p>At length the gods restor'd us both to our precedent Healths, which
made me employ some men all along the Coast, to discover if our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had been as favourable to any of our company, as to us: as also to
hire a Galley of good force to continue that journey, which the late storm
had so fatally interrupted. They perform'd the last part of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
but as to the first, they could not hear of any that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd
alive the fury of the Seas, but a couple of ordinary men who had
re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ship'd themselves again for <hi>Asia;</hi> and that divers dead bodies of Men
and Women, and Ribs of several Vessels wrack'd, had been cast upon the
shore of <hi>Thessaly.</hi> With this sad intelligence, by which we had just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to apprehend our Friends and Servants were lost, we prepar'd our
selves for <hi>Nicomeda,</hi> to which place the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> was very scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
to go, because I had manifested some sensible aversion to the
<hi>Pontick</hi> Court.</p>
               <p>Her civility had been so great, that ever since I had discovered an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to disclose the cause thereof, she had not desir'd to know it;
but the fresh wounds she had given me, had so entirely cur'd those I had
received from <hi>Monyma</hi>'s inconstancy, which was the only occasion I had
to detest the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, and Court, that I thought the breaking of
my silence was a duty I ow'd the civility of hers, and was indeed so far
from being longer necessary, that I esteemed it would be disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to me, since she might attribute my then speaking to those two
causes which invited me to it.</p>
               <p>The day therefore before we went to Sea, having spoken to her some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which seem'd to relish fo that which she had prohibited (though
really 'twas not meant so by me); to expiate that offence, I offer'd to
tell her what it was, which had occasion'd my hating <hi>Mithridates</hi>
Court; at this overture she assumed so unusual a satisfaction, that I
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:96335:292"/>
found the knowledg of it was no indifferent thing unto her, This made
me hasten to give her that account, which I did in the same manner I
have presented it to you.</p>
               <p>After I had finish'd my Story, she continued in silence for some time;
but then she broke hers, to tell me: I am perswaded <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you
will not think it so strange, being born a subject to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> if I do
take his part; as being so, if I should do otherwise; 'tis therefore I must
tell you, though your loss was great, yet the <hi>Pontick</hi> Kings injustice to
you was not; for by your own relation, I find he knew nothing if your
addresses, nor of her engagements to you; And therefore if he injur'd
any, 'twas <hi>Diocles,</hi> who openly, and by his Parents assent solicited her
affection.</p>
               <p>Nither indeed was the criminal so much to you, as to <hi>Philopomanes,</hi>
for she sinn'd more against him in loving you against his commands, than
she did afterward against you in marrying <hi>Mithridates</hi> in obedience to
them; The Paternal right preceding the right of Love; the first having
existence from our birth, the latter only from the time we are capable of
those impressions, which cannot also be legitimately received, till the
former obligation be justly cancell'd.</p>
               <p>Madam, I reply'd, though you have said much more for her, than ever
she has said for her self; yet I beg your pardon, if I assure you the event
of things, has more apologiz'd for her, than any thing I have heard said
by her; for though some Priests have given the right to the Paternal
power, before that of Love, yet the gods those very Priests do adore,
have given it by their actings to that Noble Passion, which seems to be
the god of the gods, those being necessitated to submit to that.</p>
               <p>No, Madam, the charms of a Crown were greater with <hi>Monyma,</hi> than
those of Love and Constancy; She could disobey her Father in <hi>Diocles</hi>'s
case, but she would not in <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s: had her actings, Madam, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from that filial duty you artribute so high a power unto, it would
have manifested it self in the first, as well as in the last; the obedience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in observing what <hi>Philopomanes</hi> enjoy'd, and not relating to the
disproportion between the persons for whom the injunctions were made;
so that in one of her performances, she err'd: for either she should not
have promis'd me her affection, when he had commanded her to confer
it on <hi>Diocles,</hi> or she should have continu'd it to me, after he had enjoyn'd
her to bestow it on <hi>Mithridates.</hi> I think, replyed the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi>
smiling, that you cannot justly believe, that having committed one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
'tis better to commit another, than to repair that; which, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, is the true state of your case.</p>
               <p>However, by her Letter I find she cannot think obeying her Father is
more her duty, than she fears it will prove her punishment; which
makes me for my Kings sake, as unwilling you should visit his Court, as
you were formerly to do it for your own; since your presence may afford
<hi>Monyma</hi> a disturbance which may invite <hi>Mithridates</hi> to sympathize in it.</p>
               <p>No, Madam, I reply'd, the wrong has cured the wrong, which if it
had not, I have since met with what secures me from ever thinking on
her again. These words fell from me unawares; but I had no sooner
spoken them, than I blush'd, and perceived <hi>Mithridatia</hi> did so too: so
that had not <hi>Demetrius</hi> accidentally come in to acquaint me that the
Captain of our Galley was come to speak with me, I had been engaged
in a difficulty I should not have so easily freed my self from, as I entered
into it. But joyfully laying hold of that opportunity, I went out of her
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:96335:293"/>
Chamber, into my own, where having told the Captain we would set to
Sea next morning, I dismist him to prepare himself accordingly. The
house, in which we were, belonged to a Gentleman of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> who in his
youth had so prodigally consum'd his estate, that in his age he was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to that retirement: His Wife was dead, and had left him two
Daughters, the eldest of which (whose name was <hi>Nerea</hi>) all the while
of <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s sickness, and during her recovery, manifested so high a
concern for her, and had with such care and diligence served her, that she
enjoin'd me to move her Father, to permit her to go with her into <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
which I did, and after many importunities obtained his consent; in
requital whereof, and for the use of his house, and civilities during
our continuation in it, I presented, and forced him to take such a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Jewels as freed him from fear of want, and of being unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for <hi>Nerea</hi>'s Sister.</p>
               <p>The next day we went aboard our Galley, and in three days, without
meeting any adventure worth your knowledg, unless the being assaulted
by a Ship of War, which we took, we safely arrived in the Port of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi>
the residence of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> because <hi>Murena</hi> then threatned the
invasion of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> of which that City was the chiefest: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
standing on the Sea-side, we landed there, and passing through one
of the Gardens to go to the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Apartment, we observed all
those we saw were in deep mourning; the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> desired me to
ask the cause thereof; which I did of a Gentleman that was passing by,
who told me 'twas for the death of the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> the favourite-Daughter
to the King; I acquainted her with it, at which she was in no
small disorder; but hers was not comparable to mine, when immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, there came a throng of Gentlemen into the walk in which we
were, amongst whom was one, to whom all the rest paid so high a respect,
that I concluded it was one of the Kings Sons, and so it was: which so
soon as <hi>Mithridatia</hi> was satisfied of, she lifted up her vail, and gave the
Prince and all that waited on him the liberty of seeing her face, at which
they all were amazed, and in a disorderly silence, seemed to evidence their
suprize.</p>
               <p>At first I thought it was an effect of her beauty, which I knew was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of as signal a production; but I was soon taken out of that belief, by
the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s crying out; Oh gods! is it not <hi>Statira</hi> that I see?
yes Brother (replyed <hi>Mithridatia</hi>) 'tis <hi>Statira</hi> that you see, who has been
preserved by such strange means, that when you are acquainted with
them, 'twill certainly make your gratitude as great to this Gentleman
(looking upon me) as your wonder is at my return.</p>
               <p>These words were scarce spoken, when <hi>Atafernes</hi> flew into his Sisters
arms, and by a thousand imbraces celebrated his joy: But those being
finished, he came to me, and in many obliging terms assured me, I had
served a person, who could not have a higher sense for my having done so,
than himself and all the rest of his Family would eternally have; to
these and many such assurances, I made him acknowledgments as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to his quality and civilities, as I was capable; and because
<hi>Mithridates</hi> was that morning at his devotion with his Queen, and the
Princess <hi>Roxana</hi> (Sister to <hi>Statira); Atafernes,</hi> leading us into a less
practis'd walk, conjur'd her to tell him by what miracle I had avoided that
furious Storm, for as for her deliverance from <hi>Nepturnus,</hi> he had learnt
it from a couple of her servants who had escap'd out of one of the
Galleys upon the Coast of <hi>Greece,</hi> who a few days before were safely
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:96335:293"/>
arrived at <hi>Nicomedia</hi> with the fatal news of her loss, which had put the
King and all the Court into that mourning they would now cast off with
a joy equal to that grief with which they had put it on.</p>
               <p>The Princess to obey that Brother for whom she had the highest affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
gave him an account of his desires, and I believe in very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
terms for me, since he came to me afresh with many embraces and
vows of perpetual friendship. This I say, because though I was present,
yet the grief which invaded me, by finding to all my other difficulties,
that additional one of <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s quality, deni'd me the power of
listning to what she had related.</p>
               <p>But our retired entertainment was soon broken; for some of the
Courtiers, knowing what infinite satisfaction the unexpected news of
the Princess's Arrival would be to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> went to him, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
his devotions, acquainted him therewith, who suddenly after
came to the place where we all were, and even in tears manifested his
joy.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> and his fair Sister, having given some time to
those tender evincements of his affection, inform'd him that it was to me
he owed, first her Liberty, then her Life, and at last her safe Return. I
cannot tell you those various and passionate expressions the <hi>Pontick</hi> King
gave me for what I had done; nor those many protestations of what
he would do for me, if ever he could find an occasion wherein his
power should proportion his desire of gratitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> then leading the Princess in one hand, and me in another,
walked back towards the Palace, at the Gate whereof the Queen and
the Princess <hi>Roxana</hi> met him; the first of which knowing the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
her Husband had for <hi>Statira,</hi> and being satisfied by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
voice of the Court, that never any person could have a better title
to it, in transports of satisfaction embraced and kissed her, and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
demanded where that Gentleman was, to whom they all owed their
present felicity.</p>
               <p>This is he, Madam, (reply'd <hi>Mithridates,</hi> taking me by the hand, leading
me to her): But as soon as she saw who I was, she stept two or three paces
back, and looking upon me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixtly a while, she hastily beg'd the King's
pardon, if a sudden indisposition forced her to retire; and forthwith
did so: it was happy for her and me, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> and the rest of
the company were so throughly engaged in looking upon, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Statira,</hi> that she only observ'd the disorders of <hi>Monyma,</hi> which I
was not displeas'd to find she did, that she might believe in the future
I could not but be prepossest with a higher passion, by my having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
that which I once had for the Queen, when even she had not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
divested her self of that friendship she had once honoured me with,
which her emotions at this meeting gave a pregnant evincement of.</p>
               <p>The two Princesses having by many manifestations of friendship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the greatness of theirs, they beg'd the Kings permission to
follow <hi>Monyma,</hi> which they did, but found her in a condition which
caused at once their pity and wonder. She was the more willing that
<hi>Mithridatia</hi> and <hi>Roxana</hi> might see her in that posture, that it might apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize
the more effectually both to them and the King for her abrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
and make all three believe what she was not a little concern'd
they should; for she did not so much as suspect I had disclos'd any thing
of my addresses to her, which the <hi>Pontick</hi> King was entirely ignorant of;
for they had been actually private, and seemingly suppress'd, from the
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:96335:294"/>
time <hi>Diocles</hi> had obtain'd <hi>Philopomanes</hi> favour; and from the time <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
had solicited hers, none was so unadvised as to have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with my Story: besides, during his residence in <hi>Miletus,</hi> I had
never stir'd out of my Chamber. Whilst the two Princesses were paying
their Care to the Queen, in which <hi>Statira</hi> was most successful (as best
knowing her disease); the King was concernedly enquiring of me who
I was, and whether my affairs would permit me to reside with him, from
whom he protested to me, when I expected all in his power, I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
more than he intended. After I had with much humility acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the obligingness of such expression, I told him, My ignorance
who I was, and the duty I ow'd a person who had given me my educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and perhaps was my Father, whom I had lost at Sea, had invited me
to search all the West coasts of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the East of <hi>Greece,</hi> to find him
out; which having unsuccessfully perform'd, I was now only hopeful
the Land would restore him to me; and therefore I should with satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
embrace the offer he was pleased to make me, for some time: which
offer you may easily conceive (considering how inviolate a confinement
I now had in his Court, and how impossible it was for me to have any
plausible pretence for a longer continuance in it) was a thing I was more
satisfied at, than he could be at my acceptance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> much pleas'd with my reply, told me, That he had but
one desire more to make me, which was, That I would accept of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus</hi>'s
forfeiture, which was a very large pension he had setled on him
during his life, upon his faithful engagement of bringing him a Fleet of
<hi>Cilicians</hi> able to dispute the Empire of the Sea.</p>
               <p>But this I absolutely declin'd, assuring him, That the greatest obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he could do me, was to command me things wherein I might serve
him, not my self.</p>
               <p>This refusal at once troubled him, and made him admire; but at length
I so well satisfied him in what I had done, that he prest me no more: for
I protested to him, the offer should tye me to his service more than if I
had accepted it; and that I had a private reason for my disobedience,
which if I could acquaint him with, would invite him to excuse me for it.</p>
               <p>This I did, because I hoped 'twas the civillest way of letting the fair
<hi>Mithridatia</hi> know I aim'd at higher rewards than any of such a nature;
that I had nobler con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inements than profit to keep me in her Father's
Court; and that I was not of an inconsiderable condition, when I refus'd
such high offers.</p>
               <p>The day after my arrival at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> sent to me
to wait on her in one of the Palace-Gardens; where she told me, Two
things had invited her to do it; the one, To desire me to excuse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
of her quality; the other, To give me her acknowledgments
for my having promis'd the King to make his Court my residence; since
thereby she hoped to let me see by the considence she would repose in
me, that nothing but her vows had occasion'd that incivility; and yet
the Name her Governess had told me was hers, was really so, since she
was called <hi>Mithridatia</hi> as well as <hi>Statira,</hi> and her Sister was known by
the Name of <hi>Roxana</hi> as well as <hi>Nissa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madam (I reply'd) this acknowledgment is as far below you, as the
excuse is above me; you had reason to make a vow of concealing your
name and quality, whilst you knew not but in my success you might
only have chang'd one of your Enemies for another; and having made
it, you had no reason to violate it. Neither, Madam, was there any
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:96335:294"/>
necessity of disclosing who you were, your Virtue and your Beauty were
too high for any extraction but that from whence you derive yours.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, will you permit me the confidence of desiring to know
whether all that your Governess said was as true; for she informed me,
you were sent for from <hi>Lesbos</hi> to be married to a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Gentleman.</p>
               <p>That also (said <hi>Statira</hi>) is true: That <hi>Cyprian</hi> Gentleman is the King
of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who having seen my Picture, took such a fancy to me (for
I can call it no better, since it had no solider a foundation) that by a
solemn Embassy he desired <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s permission of making his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to me; which he has assented unto, his difference with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
rendring so powerful an Alliance necessary to his affairs, especially
that Island being abundantly provided with Shipping, of which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was wholly disfurnish'd by his peace with <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas therefore I was sent for from <hi>Lesbos,</hi> where these three years I
have resided in an impregnable Castle, because <hi>Mithridates</hi> was told by
the Oracle at <hi>Delphos,</hi> That I should run a great hazard of marrying
his open and mortallest Enemy.</p>
               <p>You cannot (generous Princes) but believe that this information ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
powerfully upon me; yet not so much as to render me uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(after some introductory discourses) humbly of asking her, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she could think a Passion, which had for foundation that only
which a thousand Casualties might impair, and which time must, was
worthy of her; and whether she could prepare her self to receive a
person for her Husband which she had never seen, and pretended to her
only upon an invitation so disproportionate to her.</p>
               <p>If the gods (she reply'd) had made me as much at my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose,
as they have at <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s, I might have liv'd perhaps free
from all Addresses, at least not have received any where Beauty was
the only motive of them: But since I am at another's Command, I can
prepare my self for obedience, and afterwards esteem him to whom
thereby I am subjected; and this I can act with less dissatisfaction, than
I can decline it; because the duty of the performance will lessen, if
not take away the trouble of it; and the omission would invade me
with a grief above the cure of any thing it could present me:
And this, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I believe I told you in another's case as well
as mine.</p>
               <p>It is true, Madam, you did so; and certainly since, though you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
'twas your belief, you could not thereby make it mine; I must
conclude the reasons are very clear and pregnant, which force me to
the crime of my embracing your judgment. And indeed, Madam, if
you throughly consider it, by your Rule possibly you may find you make
a Father a Tyrant as well as a Father; or if he become not one, his Child
owes it to his Mercy, not his Justice.</p>
               <p>I think the utmost of the Paternal Right, is to hinder any which own
it, from marrying against that consent; a negative obedience is the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
it can unoppressively extend it self; Shall there be no distinction
between what power a man has over his Beast, and what he has over his
Child? And shall Reason be esteem'd unfitter to rule, than Nature?
which, Madam, according to what you argue (yet I hope do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
may follow. For if the Paternal Right is only founded upon
that Title, he that does possess it, may have much less reason than the
person over whom he does exercise it; and then the certain'st rule shall
be laid aside for one that is not so: besides, Madam, your Principle
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:96335:295"/>
always follow'd may make obedience due to an Idiot; there being as
much difference between the most re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in'd reason, and that which is but
a degree above folly, as there is between that and Idiotism it self: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Madam, observing your Law, are we freed from obeying a Parents
passion, as well as obeying him; for if his aversion to his Child, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to her Lover, his ambition, his interest, or any other passion, be
more predominant in him than Nature or Reason, even those very passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must be obeyed as the Father; so that if the childs reason be not
Judg, when the Fathers just power, not his imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ections, act him; you
must give his weaknesses as high a right to rule, as you say the gods have
given him.</p>
               <p>Such, reply'd the Princess, is the discrepant constitution of Man, that
even the gods cannot prescribe a Law, which in all things shall be equal:
and whoever will not observe a Rule, because it has inconveniences in
it, will at length find he must walk by none at all.</p>
               <p>If a child were to be Judg, whether the Parent or himself had the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
reason, or when his Father was acted by the principles of a just pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
power, or by his passion, 'tis as, if not more like, he might err,
as his Parent; and what was not consonant to his desires, he might say,
proceeded from his Fathers having a less degree of reason than himself,
or was occasion'd by his Passion; so that if the inconveniences of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the disobeying power to the child, and the undisputed power to the
Parent, be equally great in themselves; and that the not having any
Rule establish'd between both, is more prejudicial; certainly the giving
of the precedency to the Father is but just, since it is most likely that a
person who has many years experience more than another, should have
a greater quantity of it; and doubtless there is some difference during
ones life, due to the Author of it.</p>
               <p>But, she continu'd, I will desire no more than what you have already
confess'd, to invite you to acknowledg the truth of what I have spoken:
for that negative obedience of not marrying a person, which a Parent
has prohibited, and which you say is a duty owed by a Son to a Father,
is as much as that I have argued for; since the misery of Marrying a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
one does not love, cannot be greater than the misery of being deni'd
marrying one which one does love.</p>
               <p>Ah Madam, I hastily reply'd, because I saw the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards us; A Lover is not perfectly miserable so long as he has
hope, and that he may enjoy whilst another does not possess his Mistress:
there is too, some satisfaction, that if he be unhappy, his Rival is so too;
besides the difference is great between a Passive and an Active mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
               <p>Tis true, said the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> in some cases, but in this 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to separate them; for he that is involved in the former, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
be the like in the latter.</p>
               <p>By this time we were so near the Prince, that I could make no reply,
which I was not a little troubled at; het last words having given me a
rise to have made one, which had been apt enough for what I drove at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atafernes,</hi> as soon as he came near us, told me, he came to make me
an invitation to a Tilting, which the King had appointed to celebrate
<hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s return with, and <hi>Monyma</hi>'s recovery; That his Brother
the Prince <hi>Pharnaces</hi> was Challenger, and he Defendant; that <hi>Archilaus</hi>
(who had commanded so many vast Armies under <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but now
was suspected by him for that ignoble conclusion he had necessitated him
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:96335:295"/>
to make with <hi>Scylla) Neptolemus, Dorilaus,</hi> and several others, were
join'd with him: that <hi>Gordius</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> were of his own party, and
if I would make one of that Number, he should not doubt of success:
and that <hi>Statira</hi> was to give a Bracelet of Diamonds to whomsoever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it.</p>
               <p>I look'd upon the Princess, so soon as <hi>Atafernes</hi> had done speaking, as
desiring to receive my Orders from her, that she might see where their
obedience came in the Balance, it out-weigh'd even the respect I owed
to <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Successor, which <hi>Pharnaces</hi> some few days before was
declared to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridatia</hi> soon perceiv'd my meaning, and as suddenly (lest what
was a civility to her, might otherwise appear the contrary to her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
desired me to add my assistance to a side, which she wish'd might
be the conquering, and which then she would be assur'd would be so.</p>
               <p>I gave her my humble retributions for acquainting me which that was,
that I might thereby be ascertained of success in my party, whatever I
met with in my particular; only I begg'd that I might be exempted
from running against the Prince <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> for he was Brother to two
persons I had so high a respect for, that it could not but extend it self
to every one which related to them.</p>
               <p>This they thanked me for, and then <hi>Statira</hi> retir'd to give us time
to prepare for the ensuing solemnity, which since it was <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>'s
sight, and for a favour from her, I resolved to appear in it in
all the magnificence I could, and therefore gave order to <hi>Demetrius</hi>
to cover my Arms with the fairest Jewels were lest me by <hi>Arsamnors</hi>
care, and preserved by his; and that the rest of my equipage might be
proportionate.</p>
               <p>But as soon as <hi>Pharnaces</hi> was inform'd by <hi>Atafernes</hi> of my desire of
knowing the Arms he would wear, lest my ignorance might make me act
a crime, which knowingly I would never be guilty of; he absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
making use of my respect, saying, it might be the Victory would
come in competition between him and me, and that then he would not
have my civility suspend him from it; nor decline to decide that, which
he was confident his courage would advantageously forgive him;
that therefore he was resolved none of his party should be known to the
other.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Atafernes</hi> inform'd me of, lest otherwise hearing the denyal of my
offer, and not the cause of it, I might have been unwilling to assist at
the Tilting; or else since the words were spoken so publickly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not but come to my knowledg, he esteemed it more friendly
to give me that information, than that any other should.</p>
               <p>But as soon as I received it, I determined to do my utmost to make him
think my civility sprung not from that consideration to which he ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
               <p>The day being come, and all the preparitory solemnities performed;
The King, the Queen, the two Princesses, with the young <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
their Sister (who then gave admirable promises of beauty, which she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
fully perform'd) with a throng of other persons of eminent
quality, ascended those proud Scaffolds which were provided for them;
and then the Trumpets invited both parties to give the beholders the
sport they were come to see.</p>
               <p>All the young Nobility began the Justs, and by various misfortunes
had cause to with they had been upon the Scaffolds, rather than in the
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:96335:296"/>
lists: at length <hi>Dorilaus</hi> had unhors'd so many of ours, that with some
insolence he cry'd out, if we had no better Disputers of the Victory,
'twould be best to yield it.</p>
               <p>These words inflam'd <hi>Atafernes,</hi> who presented himself for his next
Enemy, with so much agility, grace and strength together, that all the
assistants by a loud shout seem'd to tell one another the advantageous
thoughts they had of him, which he abundantly made good: for the
first encounter they made, both their Launces shiver into the Air; the
second was but an exact repetition of the first; but the third, having
taken the strongest Launces they could get, and being inraged that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them had worsted the other, they ran with such fury, that when
they met, the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> carried <hi>Dorilaus</hi> clear off his Horse with
his saddle between his legs; but then his own Horse stunn'd with the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the shock, was forced to touch the ground with his Cropper, and
being incessantly spur'd to make him rise, and perform his course, strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey his Rider, unfortunately he fell over upon him; and though
he did him no great hurt; yet, by that mischance he was disabled, as
much from continuing the sport, as by his valour he had disinabled <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus:</hi>
which so soon as <hi>Atafernes</hi> perceived, he beckned me to come
near him, and told me in my Ear, he left the hopes of his parties success
to my management; and then was carryed off, arm'd as he was, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilaus</hi>
the like.</p>
               <p>The next which ran, were <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> and <hi>Craterus;</hi> but the third course
(for the two first were equal) the first got the best of it.</p>
               <p>Then there remained of all our party, but <hi>Gordius,</hi> who was Lieutenant.
General to <hi>Archilaus,</hi> and his creature; he desired me to permit him to
break a Launce then, lest my skill might deny him that favour. This
civility I could not refuse, though I was impatient enough to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
<hi>Atafernes</hi>'s fall, and to have been acting for a reward, which was
to be received from the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s hands.</p>
               <p>But I was not long suspended from my desires, for <hi>Gordius</hi> was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
dismounted by <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and left me only to make good our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
title to success, which I was as concern'd for, as hopeful of; the fair
<hi>Mithridatia</hi> having not only exprest her inclinations for our Victory, but
seem'd to have some confidence of it from me; elevated with these
thoughts, as well as with the honour of having our Sides entire hopes
left to my Arm, and somewhat troubled with those unhappinesses which
had brought it to that pass, I began my course against <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> in
which I was so successful, that being but a little shook in my Saddle, I
carried him clear off his Horse, and made him measure his length in the
dust. This action was solemnized with the acclamations of the people,
whereunto to put a period, <hi>Archilaus</hi> soon appeared at my opposite end
of the Career, [I tell you now their Names (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>)
in the order they fought, though I knew not any of them till after the
Combate] who furious at his Brothers disaster, came to revenge it; but
at the second course he was forced to bear him company, and resign his
place to <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> who was esteemed one of the best Tilters in <hi>Asia,</hi> and
therefore was not troubled at his parties want of success, since he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
'twould but the better set off his.</p>
               <p>We were by the Laws of that day, to have but three courses, the first
of which was perform'd so equally and furiously by both, that the people
by a general clapping of their hands did applaud it; but having cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Truncheons
of our broken Launces, we took stronger ones,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:96335:296"/>
and with them so rudely met one another, that both our Horses were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to recoil four or five steps; and 'twas with many spurrings, that we
made them perform their course.</p>
               <p>This too was celebrated by the people in as great a measure; nay, it
even invited the fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> the Princess <hi>Roxana,</hi> the Queen and the
King to rise from their seats, as some demonstration how much it had
pleased them.</p>
               <p>But the third Course decided the Victory on my side: For I carried
<hi>Pharnaces</hi> clear off his Horse; but yet it cost me the loss of both my
Stirrops, and so rough a shaking in my Saddle, that I had near fallen out
of it. When I had perfected my course, I turn'd about, and saw the
Prince yet lie on the ground with his Helmet off, for by the rudeness of
his fall, the Laces of it were broken; As soon as I perceiv'd who it was,
I ran to him, and lighting from my Horse, with the sight of my Helmet
up, I told him, Sir, I humbly beg your pardon for the crime my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
has made me commit; had you been pleased to have accepted of
that motion, my respect and duty made you, you had exempted your
self from this trouble, and me from a greater, by having occasion'd it:
but I hope, Sir, you will remember 'tis a meer effect of my obedience to
your commands which has made me so highly offend, and therefore you
will be therein convinc'd, since I observe them against yourself, I shall
not decline them against any other.</p>
               <p>I had much rather (said <hi>Pharnaces</hi>) owe the loss of success to your
better Fortune, than have deni'd trying it in that way you proposed;
No <hi>Callimachus,</hi> civilities in Arms are never seasonable till after Victory;
so that I cannot be more pleased with yours now, than I was offended at
them before.</p>
               <p>That Sir, I reply'd, which you are pleas'd to term my better Fortune,
and which I should have called it against any other of your party, I shall
term my unhappiness against you, as I shall what I humbly motion'd by
the Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> since I observe how contrary to my expectation 'tis
resented: And to manifest the truth of what I said, I shall humbly beg
you to make my Apology to the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> for not imploring a prize
from her hands, which to receive from the Title I must own if I have it,
would as much trouble me, as to go without it.</p>
               <p>No, said <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> I enjoin you to go and receive what is your due,
since to deny it upon such a score, were to violate the Laws of this days
recreation.</p>
               <p>Thereupon he commanded some Gentlemen to carry him to his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
whither I would have waited on him, but he would in no ways
consent unto it.</p>
               <p>As soon as he was carried out of the Lists, to the extremity whereof
I attended him: I went to the Scaffold on which the fair <hi>Statira</hi> was,
and told her, Madam, That success which all here as well as my self may
be convinced I owe entirely to Fortune, since I obtained it against the
Prince <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> is so much my grief, and so little my due, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
will bear me witness I was asham'd of, and troubled at it, and would
not have implored the prize from such fair and just hands as yours are,
had not his commands of doing it given me that confidence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
on me a Title, I only depend upon. <hi>Mithridates</hi> satisfied with
what I had done before the Justs, and more so with what I then did,
came to me, and in embraces told me, That both my courage and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
gave me so high a right to the prize, that he knew his Daughter upon
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:96335:297"/>
either of those scores, much less upon both would not deny it me.</p>
               <p>This favourable sentence on my behalf, made the Princess present me
the Bracelet, which I kneel'd down to receive, and in the same posture
told her; I have (Madam) by the great <hi>Mithridates</hi> decree, and by
the Prince <hi>Pharnaces</hi> goodness, so many Titles to this gift, that I cannot
tell from which particular one I derive it: and to attribute a part to every
one, were to injure all in not sufficiently obliging any: Will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(Madam) permit me to owe it entirely to your favour, that will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from disobliging many other pretences, and oblige me more than
all of them.</p>
               <p>This I presumed the less timorously to speak, because I observed the
King, and divers others, were then receiving an account of the two
Prince's healths, from a Gentleman they had employ'd to enquire after
them.</p>
               <p>But she blushing at what I had said, told me, My success had given me
a better Right than her favour.</p>
               <p>I had much ado to avoid telling her; But not so desired a one.</p>
               <p>Presently after, this great Assembly broke up, and <hi>Mithridates, Mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
and the two Princesses went to visit <hi>Pharnaces;</hi> but finding him more
troubled than hurt, soon after they visited <hi>Atafernes,</hi> from whence all
but <hi>Statira</hi> (who stayed with her Brother, as I did to wait on them both)
went to take the Air to refresh themselves, after the heat of that days
ceremony.</p>
               <p>As soon as they were gone out of the Chamber, I told the Prince; Sir,
I am come to give you an account of those commands you honour'd me
with when you left the Lists; and to present you with what only, by the
power they gave me, I have acquired: If the Princess <hi>Mithridatia</hi> had
been pleased to have given it me upon the account of her favour, which
I once presum'd to implore, I would much rather have parted with my
life than with it: but since she declined giving me that Title to the prize,
and gave it to my success; I could not, Sir, but bring it unto you, from
whom I must always acknowledg I entirely derived it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atafernes,</hi> refusing my proffer, and embracing me, reply'd, <hi>Statira</hi>
could not have been more obliging, in giving you that Bracelet as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of her favour, than she was just, in conferring it upon the score
of your Victory, to which I have so little contributed, that my refusal
of the prize, is infinitely short of what I owe you for obtaining
it; and having no other way to evince my gratitude for your having
done so, I do earnestly conjure my Sister to give you the prize upon
the account upon which you once desired it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atafernes</hi> having done speaking, we both look't intently upon the
Princess, whose face was immediately cover'd with Blushes: which
when her Brother observ'd, he told her; You have often assur'd me,
<hi>Mithridatia,</hi> that you gave me a higher share of your affection, than you
gave any one else; I beg you manifest it in granting me this desire; 'tis
not injurio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to that strict virtue you profess to the World; and 'twill
be consonant to that strict friendhsip you profess to me, which I shall set
the greater value upon, when I experiment the effects of it do not only
extend to me, but to a person I am equally concern'd for; and when
it enables me to pay a debt, which otherwise I should be uncapable
to discharge.</p>
               <p>Sir, I answer'd, had you owed me my debt, you had abundantly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
it, in thus desiring to do so. Then addressing my self to <hi>Statira,</hi>
                  <pb n="667" facs="tcp:96335:297"/>
I told her; Madam, had I imagin'd the duty I have perform'd to the
generous <hi>Atafernes,</hi> and acquainting him with the grounds on which I
did it, would have occasioned those desires in him, and those troubles
those desires have rais'd in you, I should rather have appear'd rude to you
both by my silence, than have been found injurious to you in so break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; and therefore, Madam, I humbly beg you in the Princess <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datia</hi>'s
behalf, that you will not let he descend so much below her self,
as to act what her Brother asks of her, and I once implor'd, when it
was only to avoid receiving the prize from a title which now I observe
to own, will be less injurious, than to decline; and consequently your
denial will be as favourable as your grant, nay more, having, Madam, a
higher concernment for what I find pleases you, than I can for what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
my self.</p>
               <p>This I did speak with an accent and look which palpably manifested,
my respect only made me do so; which invited <hi>Atafernes</hi> to fix his eyes
upon <hi>Statira,</hi> who easily read in his countenance, how much her delay,
if not denyal, was sensible unto him; and that was so prevalent, that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her brother, she told him (in no small disorders) I thought
you were so fully satisfied of my affection, that you would not put it to
fresh experiments; but since you will, you shall see I can disobey you in
nothing: then looking upon me, she said; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> that which I
gave you, as due to your success, I now give you in obedience to <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>
desires, as a mark of my favour.</p>
               <p>Madam, (I reply'd) since the gods have plac'd every way so infinite
a disproportion between you and me, that I cannot ever so much as
hope to receive on my own account, what you are pleas'd to give me
on your generous Brother's: I cannot but acknowledg their goodness in
raising me up so powerful an Intercessor; and yours in permitting him
to be so.</p>
               <p>I spoke so much, being a little heightned in that act of friendship I had
then received from <hi>Atafernes;</hi> and I durst speak no more, by repining
at having receiv'd no more, I should induce her to repent her having
done so much.</p>
               <p>All the rest of that evening we spent in <hi>Atafarnes</hi>'s Chamber; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
having waited on the Princess to hers, I retir'd to my own [for,
though a Ball was that night designed; yet, because the two Princes were
unable to assist at it, 'twas deferr'd till a fitter opportunity] and past the
greatest part of the Night in reflecting upon the passages of the preceding
day.</p>
               <p>The strange difficulty <hi>Statira</hi> had made of letting me receive the prize
as a mark of her favour, when upon the Scaffold I had lighted upon no
ill expedient to have clouded it with, and when thereby both she and I
had adjudged the honour of that day to her Favourite-Brother, and also
had exempted me from carrying it away from her eldest Brother; And
her declaring, when she made me that obliging assurance in <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s
chamber, that it way to obey him; could not more perplex me, than I
was pleased with what I inferr'd from that proceeding; for I flatter'd my
self with an opinion, that thereby she had discovered my passion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
I was not ignorant she had done so; both which occasion'd that
coldness, which was at once my satisfaction and my trouble.</p>
               <p>But if in this one carriage of hers, I had occasion to make that my
Faith, by many a one in the future I had not so much as a shadow
left me to suspect I was mistaken; for whereas formerly she often elected
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:96335:298"/>
me to wait on her, above any other, she was afterwards careful to avoid
it; and from being friendly she only continued civil; but yet she was
civil in a way, which assured me she was not offended at any thing, but
that for which, though I could have wish'd she would not have been, yet
I could not but expect she would.</p>
               <p>I was not ignorant in how improbable a design I had engag'd my self;
that being but a private person, destitute of friends, and ignorant even
of what I was, to lift up my sight towards a Princess, the greatest in the
World by her quality, and more formidable to me from her severe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and her absolute resignation to her Fathers will; which he had but too
positively acquainted me with, as he had her, that if she would observe his,
she must give her self to the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who was but forming a Fleet
fit to assist her Father with, and an Equipage fit to make his Court in.</p>
               <p>But all this, and much more, was not so prevalent to disswade me from
a resolution of adoring the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> as her virtues and beauties were
to confine me to do it; and having already gone through one of the
most difficult performances, that of letting her know my passion in so
little criminal a way, I despaired not of attaining the other, that of
perswading her to permit it; for I was so obliging to my own hopes, as
not to despair in an Age, when the Sword gave the Law; but by mine
to present her with those Titles, which my birth had denied me, or my
ill Fortune had conceal'd from me: And therefore in those high prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives
which were made for a War the ensuing spring against <hi>Nicomedes,
Ariobarzanes,</hi> and <hi>Murena,</hi> I was not unactive: But there hapned an
accident which was much more speedy and favourable to me, than I
could have imagined; for at a solemn Feast made by <hi>Gordius</hi> to which
<hi>Archil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us, Neoptolemus, Craterus</hi> (with whom I had contracted a strict
friendship, and who was indeed a person of much honour) <hi>Dorilaus,</hi> my
self, and many others were invited; <hi>Archilaus</hi> fell into discourses of a
deep discontent, which is a disease that commonly proceeds from the
highest power too long intrusted in one subjects hands; who finding the
King uncapable to remunerate future services by having given all he can
give to preceding ones, do not consider, That duty, if never rewarded,
obliges him to all he can do; and if rewarded, to the utmost; duty and
gratitude binds him equally to the like.</p>
               <p>I admir'd none there attempted to show him his errour; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
their respect to him, made him lay aside all his to his Prince; I
could not but do that my self, which (though less concern'd than many
which were present) I had condemned them for omitting.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Archilaus</hi> more provoked by my minding him of his duty, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
cast it off, that what at first I had considered as an Act of heat and
passion, I now looked upon as a providence of the gods, who would
make him disclose some Treason, which if he had continued silent, he
might have acted. Therefore the more to make him discover himself, I
told him; I see <hi>Archilaus,</hi> that your being General over so many gallant
men as are here, makes them continue in a silence, their looks visibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests;
and therefore, since I am not engaged to it by that obligation, I
declare unto you, if to morrow morning you do not acknowledg before
them, that your passion only has made you utter these criminal expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I shall expect reparation for them with your Sword; which if you
decline, prepare your self to answer what you have said, before <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
to whom I am too strictly bound, to hear him injur'd, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to right him in one of those ways I have proposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="669" facs="tcp:96335:298"/>Young man (<hi>Archilaus</hi> furiously repli'd) the services I have done the
King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> are so many and signal, that they will be credited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee; and therefore not to give thee satisfaction, but to punish thy
insolence, I will give thee that meeting to morrow morning which thou
desirest; where be as certain I will punish thy pride, as now thou mayest
be that I resent it.</p>
               <p>This answer so incens'd me, that I could not abstain from answering
him: Those duties which thou gloriest in, have not acquired so much
for thy King, as thou gavest away from him unto <hi>Sylla;</hi> but I will now
speak no more, since thou hast assured me to morrow of so certain a
means to repair thy disrespect to thy Prince, and thy rudeness to
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archilaus,</hi> losing all his patience at what I had spoken, laid his hand
upon his Sword, as I immediately did the like on mine: But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
interpos'd to part us; which made me tell him, I shall expect thee
to morrow morning early in the Meadow near the Sacred Grove, single,
or with any person of Honour that may witness we fought fairly: but
know, if thou failest, or that this be divulged, I am acquit from that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which otherwise I promise thee till then to keep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archilaus</hi> only by a nod of his head seem'd to tell me, he assented to
what I had proposed, which made me immediately retire to my appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to prepare for our intended Duel, which I was confident of; for
my Enemy was a man of known Courage, and our dispute and assignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was only before persons who lov'd him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> had much rather have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
him to my Sword, than to my Accusation.</p>
               <p>In brief, according to assignment we met; <hi>Archilaus</hi> bringing with
him <hi>Craterus</hi> as a mutual witness, who (he knew) was one I reposed
no small confidence in; for my Enemy understood the Punctilio's of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and was curious in their practise; so that if he had been as honest
as gallant, we had never measur'd our Swords.</p>
               <p>The first Pass, our Clothes were only wounded; but the next, he hurt
me through my left Arm, as I did him through his right; and following
my thrust, clos'd with him, flung him down, and disarm'd him. <hi>Craterus</hi>
immediately stept in, to hinder me from making any fatal use of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which I had no design to do: for immediately permitting him
to rise, and restoring him his Sword, I told him; <hi>Archilaus,</hi> be satisfied,
I am in the right by my success against you; and be as satisfied, that if
you employ that Sword and Life I give you, for your King, he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
know what you have spoke against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archilaus</hi> with a deep sigh only repli'd; You are generous, and I am
unfortunate; and then with <hi>Craterus</hi> went away: but lest my wound in
my arm might give some suspition of what we had been doing, I resolv'd
to keep my Chamber for a few days, as being indisposed in health; and
being confident the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> would visit me, I caus'd the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
which drest my wound (whose privacy I strictly enjoin'd) to
let me blood in the same arm I was hurt, that unsuspectedly I might carry
it in a scarf: and to take away all cause of jealousie, I caus'd the blood
he took from me, to be left in my Chamber till <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>afernes</hi> did come, which
he suddenly after did; for 'twas my custom every morning to wait on
him; which omission, then, lest he should think strange, I sent to
apologize for, being rendered uncapable by an indisposition which
had necessitated me to breathe a vein, and would for a few dayes
confine me to my Chamber. This information he had no sooner
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:96335:299"/>
received, than he came thither, and by many tendernesses convinced me,
I had a higher interest in his affection and friendship, than I either
thought or deserved.</p>
               <p>All that day he continu'd with me; and the next, return'd early to
repeat that honour.</p>
               <p>I had then also the satisfaction of having the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> send
one of her Gentlemen to enquire after my health, which I would always
have been deprived of, to have it so obligingly sought after.</p>
               <p>The same day towards the Evening, <hi>Mithridates</hi> favour'd me with a
visit; and during his stay with me, <hi>Craterus</hi> came hastily into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to acquaint his King, that <hi>Archilaus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> were fled in
disguises; that <hi>Archilaus</hi> had secured <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea,</hi>
the chiefest Towns of the <hi>Bosphorians</hi> and <hi>Colques,</hi> of which two
Provinces they were Governours, and thereby possest themselves of all
his Fleet, who were rendezvous'd in those two Havens; and that they
had given out words which made it more than probable that they would
join with <hi>Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes,</hi> and <hi>Murena.</hi> The truth of which
intelligence was not to be suspected, since 'twas impossible they could
justifie their first crime, but by acting this second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> was sensibly surpriz'd at this advertisement, and forthwith
gave orders for all his chief Officers to meet, to advise of the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
against so threatning a danger; whilst the Council was assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
some of the Guards which had got notice of the two Brothers es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
seized upon and broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> before the King a person whom they found
in the dusk of the evening stealing over the Works; for no sooner was
this News divulged, than all the Ports of <hi>Nicomcdia</hi> were shut, and the
Guards doubled, lest to the publick Revolt, some private attempt might
have been made against his Person. This man was soon known to be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilaus</hi>
Secretary, who confessing nothing, was forthwith condemned
to the Rack, which he had not resolution to endure, or scarcely to look
on; so that he told <hi>Craterus,</hi> if he were brought to the King, and might
only suffer death, without tortute, he would discover all. The first being
performed and the last promised by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> he told him, Sir, since
the agreement made by my Lord with <hi>Sylla,</hi> he found himself so little
valued by you, that after a long dispute between his resentment and
his Loyalty, the first obtained the superiority; whereupon immediately
he made his secret applications to <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Murena,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
if he delivered you, Sir, alive or dead into their hands, they
would make him King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> which he should hold in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee from the
people of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he promised within one Month to perform; which he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
done, if by his too little precaution at a Feast <hi>Gordius</hi> lately made,
he had not spoken words of so high a discontent against you, that they
necessitated <hi>Callimachns</hi> to that duel with him, which he was confident
would not be so privately kept, but that it would come to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;
and therefore not being ready to act his designs against your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he thought it more advisable to revolt to your Enemies, and present
them with your Fleet, and those two Provinces he and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
than run an apparent hazard of being discover'd, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
even in that.</p>
               <p>I was commanded by him to continue here, and endeavour to gain <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
for him; but I had not so much as the opportunity to speak with him:
&amp; having advertisement that the Ports were shutting, I apprehended 'twas
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:96335:299"/>
the more probably to seize on me; I resolved to fly, but I was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and therefore must submit to your Justice, and my Fate.</p>
               <p>This Discourse was no sooner finish'd, than <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Atafernes</hi>
looked upon me, in a way which (me thought) seem'd to reproach my
silence to the one, and my affection to the other. But <hi>Craterus</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
told the King all that had passed, and then thus continued; I am,
Sir, the most guilty, but I know nothing could have bribed me to so cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
a silence, but my Generals electing me to be a mutual second to
both, which perhaps he knew, and therefore impos'd on me that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
besides, Sir, I was more than hopeful, his having given <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus</hi>
that way of satisfaction, for what I thought proceeded from a
distemper of company only, might have ascertain'd him from his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and consequently have confin'd him to employ that Life in your
service, which was given him by the gods, and by his Enemy, for
that end.</p>
               <p>As soon as <hi>Craterus</hi> had finish'd; <hi>Mithridates</hi> came to me, and in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
and many words as obliging, acquainted me how sensible he was
of the service I had done his State and Person, in so timely discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Treachery, which otherwise had ruin'd both.</p>
               <p>He also cast forth some words how happy he was in having a Friend,
who, though a Stranger, had manifested more concernment for him, than
all his Subjects had done.</p>
               <p>I was (continued <hi>Callimaclus</hi>) a little in disorder to find my acting,
gave some ground for this reproach to <hi>Craterus,</hi> and those other brave
Men which had been present at our quarrel; and more, that by such a
deciding it, I had brought the safety of <hi>Statiras</hi>'s Father, her generous
Brothers, and perhaps her own to so hazardous an issue as a Duel was,
for which I made many excuses to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> extenuating too the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
offence of <hi>Craterus</hi> and the rest's not doing what I did, by their
being under <hi>Archilaus</hi> command, and by their belief that they were
words of passion rather than design; to repair all which, and to evidence
I spar'd not my Enemy upon any criminal account, I humbly begg'd the
King to employ us all against him, that by our actions we might obtain
and merit his belief to our professions, and that I in particular might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to destroy a person, I now found I had but too prodigally spar'd.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> again embraced me for this desire, which he told me should
be granted; professing openly he was confident that the same Sword
which had worsted <hi>Archilaus</hi> in a Duel, would do the like in a Battel.
Soon after, he went out of my Chamber to hold that Council he had
summon'd, and forthwith order'd the Secretary to be put to death.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Atasernes,</hi> who had assisted at the Council, came again to
me that Night, and in raptures of joy acquainted me; That <hi>Mithridates</hi>
having resolved on two Wars, the one against his Rebels, and the other
against <hi>Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Murena;</hi> had then nominated two
Generals, which were <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and himself; This to command against
<hi>Archilaus,</hi> that against <hi>Nicomedes:</hi> That the King had made me his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General, and <hi>Gordius</hi> his brothers; that <hi>Craterus</hi> was to go with
him, as <hi>Dorilaus</hi> was to go with <hi>Pharnaces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confess this Advertisement was not unpleasing to me, for it gave me
a relation to that generous Prince, which fix'd me near his person, and
put me in a possibility of acquiring Glory, which was the only way I
had to court the fair <hi>Statira</hi> in: but I was a little troubled <hi>Craterus</hi>
should have a command under mine: yet <hi>Atafernes</hi> soon made it cease
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:96335:300"/>
by protesting he resented none thereat, but was rather pleas'd, being in
effect as well as in profession, highly my Friend.</p>
               <p>Ten days after, having Rendezvous'd on the Banks of the River <hi>Calpas</hi>
thirty thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse of those with whom <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
designed to make War against <hi>Murena,</hi> he order'd them to
move towards <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and his Associates, who had furnish'd <hi>Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus</hi>
with some considerable additional Forces to join with his Brother,
lest in that Peninsule he was in, he might be worsted; and indeed it was
high time, for <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> had already brought his Army over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Horminius,</hi> and after having cross'd the River <hi>Hypias</hi> was hastily
marching to gain the Passes of the River <hi>Sangarus,</hi> after which he had
nothing but Bodies of Men to hinder their so much desired conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Atafernes</hi> had perform'd the parting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> duty to his Father and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(to the first of which I pay'd many humble acknowledgments for
the honour he had done me, and the trust he had reposed in me, which
he answer'd too flatteringly to be repeated) he took me with him to the
Queen's Appartment, where there then was the Princess <hi>Roxana,</hi> from
whom as <hi>Atafernes</hi> was taking leave, <hi>Monyma,</hi> covering her Face with
her Vail, told me; I know not, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> if what I was necessitated
to do, has left you any belief, that I am still concern'd for you, or has
left me any of that Empire over you, which you were once pleased to
give me; but lest you should so much wrong me as to have a contrary
thought, or lest I might so much wrong you as to believe you would
impose that penalty on a necessitated Fault, which can only be due to
a willing one, I conjure you in the War you are now undertaking, be
not so covetous of honour, as wholly for it to neglect your safety, which
is considerable, and perhaps but too much so, to me.</p>
               <p>I was so strangely surpriz'd at these words, especially at the last of
them, that doubtless I had been much troubled for an answer, if <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>
having taken leave of <hi>Roxana,</hi> had not then come towards us,
which gave me only time to reply; Madam, I have still pay'd so exact
an obedience to all your commands, that I hope you cannot have cause
to suspect I will decline that practise.</p>
               <p>This was the civilest, shortest, and resentful'st answer I could give her,
which were the three ingredients I desired it should be composed of:
soon after having kiss'd the Princess <hi>Roxana</hi>'s hands, we went to the
Appartment of <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> which her Brother did visit in the last place,
as being that for which he had the highest concern, and resolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the most time upon.</p>
               <p>Never was there any separation so moving as that of these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Persons, and never did I see the fair <hi>Statira</hi> give so clear an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that the equality of her mind was conquerable, as in this occasion,
which yet was a Noble Condescension, since even that weakness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
but the better to manifest the strength of her friendship; yet it
hath made me many time since conclude she had some Prophetick fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of the fatal miseries this War would produce.</p>
               <p>Three times in strict embraces they endeavour'd to part before they
had the power to do it: which as soon as they had obtained, I went to
receive her Commands; which when she perceived, passing her hands
before her face to cover the trouble <hi>Atafernes</hi> had rais'd in her, she told
me with an Accent and Grace particular to her self:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I owe you my Liberty and my Life, which are high ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations;
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:96335:300"/>
and I can assure you are not, nor ever shall be forgotten;
but yet those I was not near so much concern'd in, as I am in <hi>Atafernes,</hi>
whose safety I expresly recommend to your care. I know the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of youth, and the first solicitings of Victory, are motives will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
him into dangers, from which only your courage will be able to
free him; but I wish I could be as confident that your advice would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him from running into such perils, as I am, that your Sword, when
they are run into, will disengage him out of them: I conjure you, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
his Heat by your Counsel, and by representing to him the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
my life must be replenish'd with, if his should be lost; against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
whereof, I am not a little fortifi'd by the gods, having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for him such a friend as <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who when he acts all that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and frien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ship can produce, does but make good the opinion I have
already of him.</p>
               <p>Madam, I reply'd, The duty and care I owe the Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> as
he is himself, is uncapable of accession any other ways than by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he has to the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and by those commands she has now
been pleas'd to honour me with: I cannot doubt that a person who is so
justly and highly in your care, can be denied that of the gods; but yet
I can no more hope the means to that end should be by my advice, than
doubt it can be by any other, than by representing to him how certainly
his death will occasion and accelerate yours: that is a sin, which to
avoid. I believe he would not only be content to decline the Courting of
Glory, but even be an Enemy to it: No Madam, the gods are too just to
make you give your friendship to one, who can prefer any thing before
it, or who would not despise all honour for that only of observing your
Commands, which are of so unlimited a power, that what they enjoin,
they will enable me to perform, or render the not surviving my disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
a just penalty for having been guilty of it.</p>
               <p>I cannot, said <hi>Statira</hi> be invited to believe, that an addition to a loss,
can any way repair it; and therefore if the gods should call away <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes,</hi>
I expect <hi>Callimachus</hi> should rather live to give me consolations,
than by his death give me an higher need of them.</p>
               <p>These words she hastily spoke, because the Prince was come towards
us, who had been taking leave of his Sisters Women; which I think he
did, to allow me the more freely an opportunity of doing the like to
her, whose obligingness in her last expressions, I endeavoured to acquaint
her by some of mine, were as sensibly as humbly received.</p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Atafernes</hi> took his last <hi>Farewell,</hi> which was in so many tears,
that I could not more pity <hi>Statira,</hi> than I did envy him.</p>
               <p>The next morning early all the Streets of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> eccho'd with the
Trumpets, and were fill'd with the Guards which attended the two
Princes to their Armies.</p>
               <p>Ours that Night we overtook, for it had been led but three easie days
marches by <hi>Craterus,</hi> who brought <hi>Atafernes</hi> notice that Night to his
Tent, that <hi>Archilans</hi> the preceding day had made a General Muster on
the Banks of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>illis,</hi> that his Numbers were much superiour to ours, and
that he was therefore resolved to seek a Field for the decision of the War,
unto which bold resolution he was as much invited from the advantage
of his numbers, as by his intelligence that <hi>Pharnaces</hi> was advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Neoptolemus</hi> with a vast Army (for <hi>Mithridates</hi> had manifested the
disproportion of his affection between those two Princes, by the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the Number of their Forces, which was near double) whom
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:96335:301"/>
he therefore was solicitous to join with, and would not decline an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
in pursuance of that Design.</p>
               <p>All which <hi>Craterus</hi> assur'd his General he had even then received from
a faithful Spy.</p>
               <p>This Advertisement made us resolve to prepare for the Battel, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
whereof would be as advantageous for our Enemies as if we had
lost it; but in regard their Number so much exceeded ours, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
advisable to endeavour to divert a part of their Army, whilst
we were fighting with the rest: and therefore I caus'd an Officer of ours
to go as a Spy into their Camp (which by reason of their great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in Forces, and their immediate resolution of fighting, was not at all
fortified) and there to act that part so grosly, that he could not but be
seized upon for one; which when he was, and condemned (which would
infallibly follow) then to let <hi>Archilaus</hi> know if he would save his Life,
and give him an equal employment in his Army to that he lost in <hi>Atafer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s;
he would discover to him a secret, which probably might destroy
his Enemies; which should be, that we had sent a third part of our Army
to meet an additional supply (equal to that Number) which <hi>Mithridates</hi>
had sent after us, hearing of the Enemies unexpected Forces; which if
<hi>Archilaus</hi> would send to meet, he might with as much ease defeat, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done that to them, he might the next day do the like to the
rest.</p>
               <p>The attempt indeed was hazardous for the Undertaker; but the
Laws of War render it just to employ Men upon things which were
much more so, for the general advantage: His hire too was great; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it impossible but, if he were believ'd, he might get off, either
by their trusting him, or by our success before they were able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and punish his Delusion. But to leave as little to Fortune as such an
Affair would admit, I sent a Spy with him to bring me word if that same
Night any part of <hi>Archilaus</hi>'s Army moved out of their Camp, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
on notice thereof we might do the like to fall on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.</p>
               <p>In brief, This Officer so well acted his part, that fifteen thousand
Horse and Foot, were sent (and he for their guide) about fall of the
Night, to intercept our imagin'd Recruits, and three hours after (which
was the time spent in bringing that Advertisement) we moved with all our
Army (which was purposely kept in readiness) towards the Enemy, and
by break of day came to their Camp, which after some little resistance we
broke into, for they were so confident of their false intelligence, that
they did not so much as fancy we would attempt them till our believed
supply, and that part of our Army which went to secure them, was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with us.</p>
               <p>The execution was very bloody, for all but the usual Guards were
taken asleep and in disorder; But yet <hi>Archilaus</hi> escaped in a Boat down
the River of <hi>Psillis,</hi> at the mouth whereof his Fleet lay, with which he
immediately set Sail for <hi>Heraclea,</hi> lest <hi>Neoptolemus</hi>'s ignorance of this
misfortune, might occasion his being involv'd in a parallel one.</p>
               <p>But to improve this success to the full, I forthwith caused our Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to refresh themselves, to put on the cloaths of them they had kill'd,
to furl up their own Colours, and march with those we had so lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
towards the residue of that vanquish'd Army, leaving such behind
in <hi>Archilaus</hi>'s Camp as were wounded or tired, as also a competent Guard
for <hi>Craterus</hi>'s person, whose wounds disinabled him to stir out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="675" facs="tcp:96335:301"/>A little before the fall of the Sun we came in the sight of them, as they
were sadly returning from their hoped Victory (having put to death
him that had deceived them) which was the time we desired to do it in,
that seeing our Soldiers Clothes and Colours, they might the less suspect
us: this also hapned as we had expected; so that some of the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
riding fearlesly up to us, we seized upon them; the Body moving
carelesly, seeing their Officers join'd with us, were immediately surpriz'd;
which so soon as they found they were, and heard <hi>Archilans</hi> was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and mercy offer'd to those which flung down their Arms, and would
willingly take up that Allegiance they had so slightly cast off, they all
embraced that mercy, which was both their duty and safety: amongst
those many Prisoners which were there taken, there was a <hi>Bosphorian</hi>
Lord called <hi>Lingarus,</hi> which had commanded these Forces, who had the
repute of a man of honour and courage.</p>
               <p>Him I spoke with privately as we returned to <hi>Atafernes;</hi> and desired
to know the ground of his and so many other brave mens revolt; and
whether <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and those other Cities <hi>Archelaus</hi> had seduced, would
not on so signal a disowning of their Quarrel by the gods, and an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of pardon, return to their former quiet and subjection.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Lingarus</hi> answer'd, I am confident that neither this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Defeat, nor all the assurances of forgiveness, will any way prevail to
perswade the <hi>Bosphorians</hi> to return under <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s power, whilst
he designs them that Governour, which <hi>Archilans</hi> assur'd me he would
give us, which did more for <hi>Archilaus</hi> than any other way he could have
done for himself; but if instead of <hi>Pharnaces</hi> we may have <hi>Atafernes,</hi> I
dare engage that considerable Province shall sheath their Swords, or
cheerfully employ them against any Enemy, when led by so generous a
Prince, whose eldest Brother has given such undoubted and early marks
of cruelty, that we thought it much less hazardous to oppose than submit
to him, and wanting, by <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi>'s change, a Friend
which might acquaint <hi>Mithridates</hi> with our sense in such a way as we desired,
as also being prest by them to prevent by Arms what we could not
by Petition; and that the crime of a Revolt, before <hi>Pharnaces</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on us, would appear less to the King, than to do it for that Reason,
with their faithful promises of never making a peace till we should be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from that fear which made us make a War, invited us to what we
have done, and has brought us to what we suffer.</p>
               <p>I was not a little pleas'd to understand so desired a truth, and that by
making an internal peace we might be better enabled to carry on a War
against <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Murena,</hi> which promis'd more Glory than this we
now hoped so advantageously to finish.</p>
               <p>'Twas therefore that I fortifi'd <hi>Lingarus</hi> in his design of quietness, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Atafernes</hi> for Governour, which I faithfully promis'd in few days to
solicite <hi>Mithridates</hi> for.</p>
               <p>The next day we returned to our Camp, where our General (who had
stai'd there by reason of an incommodious hurt) gave me so many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
for what I had contrived and acted, that I was more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
at them, than at the Victory.</p>
               <p>As soon as I had visited <hi>Craterus,</hi> whose wounds were more painful
than dangerous, I return'd to <hi>Atafernes</hi> Tent, to whom I imparted what
<hi>Lingarus</hi> had acquainted me with, and what I had promised him, which
I begg'd his permission and license to accomplish, whilst his Army was
taking that refreshment their two harrasing marches required: I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:96335:302"/>
represented to him the Command of so considerable a Province
(which being so well affected to him before they knew his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and consequently would be so entirely when they did) might
render him considerable to his Father and Brother, as well for his power
as desert; and if the Province of <hi>Bosphorus</hi> were forthwith quieted, he
might by joyning Armies, share in his glory, having acquired with much
celerity, all that the War he was assign'd unto could produce, which
might let the World see, the disproportion <hi>Mithridates</hi> placed between
them, was purely an effect of his inclinations, by his acting against evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
able to convert any thing else.</p>
               <p>I had scarce done speaking, when <hi>Atafernes</hi> embraced me, and repli'd;
The gods do now abundantly repair giving me such a Brother, in giving
of me such a Friend; yes, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I say, such a Brother; for till now
I never disclosed, but to <hi>Statira,</hi> a wickedness of his, such as the very
thought of it makes me tremble; for he no sooner saw <hi>Mithridates</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
me with some marks of his affection (not content with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
he had therein) but he instantly calumniated me unto him, and
finding the unfruitfulness of so unjust a proceeding, he hired one of my
Domesticks to kill me, which the faithful Servant acquainted me with,
and then fled into another Kingdom, knowing how unsafe this was after
such a discovery to me, and such a disobedience to him; this not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
he hired one to poison me at a Feast he invited me to; but the
Servant which was to do it, being accidently call'd aside, another came
to fill some Wine for <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> and took it out of the Fatal Bottle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for me; but the other on his return found the mistake, and ran to
his Prince to acquaint him with it, who before he came had drank the
Wine; but having timely notice, he rose hastily from the Table pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sudden indisposition, and before the poison had too much seized on
his vitals, he forced himself to cast it up.</p>
               <p>This the design'd Actor hereof a few days since, as he lay on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
repenting his sin, sent very privately for me, and acquainted me
with, begging my pardon, and advertising me of my danger in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Neither has this cruel Brother desisted, though he has had so clear
evidences how much the gods detest his being so, but has highly solicited
the Marriage of <hi>Mithridatia</hi> to the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that by her remove,
my chiefest support might receive one, for she so perfectly affects me, and
is so highly valued by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> that whilst she is near him, he can
hardly that way act his designs.</p>
               <p>Sir, (I replyed) the crimes of your Brother render the motion I have
made so necessary, that if you decline it, and that <hi>Pharnaces</hi> reach his
ends, you are not only guilty of your own sufferings, but also of his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
having so fair a way to prevent both.</p>
               <p>Go then, said <hi>Atafernes,</hi> and make me your Debtor for my safety as
well as success.</p>
               <p>That very hour I posted away towards <hi>Nicomedia</hi> where <hi>Mithridates</hi>
resided, for whom I had a Letter from the Prince, which refer'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of our late Victory to my making, with this flattering Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
[Since the Actor would be the best describer of it.]</p>
               <p>I also presented <hi>Mithridates</hi> with all those Colours we had taken
from <hi>Archilaus.</hi> His joy was exceeding great, so were his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to me, in the heat whereof I so happily prest him, that he gave
me a Commission from my General to be Governour of the <hi>Bosphorians,</hi>
and to pardon all of them which he thought fit, wherein he enjoined
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:96335:302"/>
the using of all expedition, in regard he had then received certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> with a considerable Army of itself, was join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Murena</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> and that they daily expected <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi>
with some considerable accessional Forces, which if united might
over-power <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> with whom he earnestly desired <hi>Atafernes</hi> might
join, as soon as ever he had put the affairs of the <hi>Bosphorians</hi> in any tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable posture.</p>
               <p>But whilst <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Orders, and the Prince's Commission was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, <hi>Mithridates</hi> told me, 'twas but just the Queen should participate
of the good News I brought; so that he fortwith led me to her Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to give her an account thereof: during which I observed what but
confirmed the opinion I had assum'd, by those words she spake when
I last waited on her, which made me not a little rejoice that <hi>Mithridates</hi>
was present, lest otherwise she might have begun a Discourse I would not
willingly have been engaged in.</p>
               <p>The King soon after dismiss'd me to make my other visits, since I allow'd
my self so little time for their performance.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to pay my duty to the Princess <hi>Roxana,</hi> who, after
she had satisfied her self with questions concerning the Battel, and highly
rejoiced at her Brother's success in it; asked me, whether I had been with
her Sister? to which I told her,'twas the next visit I intended; I will
then, said <hi>Roxana,</hi> accompany you thither; for you carry with you what
will give her so much satisfaction, that it will be some to me to see it.</p>
               <p>I could not refuse this honour, though I was sensibly troubled at it;
yet when I came to the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s Appartment, I found <hi>Monyma</hi>
there, whereby I perceived that privacy I was deny'd by <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I had otherwise been depriv'd of by the Queen's, which also did
confirm me in a belief that she had discover'd the passion under which I
suffered, and in which I delighted.</p>
               <p>This made my visit short, and the Discourses in it unfit for my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
only when I took leave of the fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> she told me soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I had done so much for her Brother's glory in the Battel, and for
his safety after, that the sence of those Obligations should always continue
with her.</p>
               <p>Immediately after, having received my dispatch from <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
I returned towards our Camp, all the way entertaining my thoughts
with what had been said and done since my leaving it, though thereby
I found or apprehended new Obstacles in my passion (from <hi>Monyma</hi>'s
resentment and power with the King) equal to those I was prepar'd to
contest with from <hi>Statira</hi>'s disposition and quality, and from the lowness
of my own.</p>
               <p>As soon as I came to <hi>Atafernes,</hi> and had presented him with the effects
of my journey and solicitations, for which he gave me higher marks of
his favour and friendship than ever: He forthwith sent for <hi>Lingarus,</hi>
to whom he communicated his Commission, and upon his faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of acting, as he had promised me, he had his Pardon and Liberty;
which he so well employ'd, that three days after, the strong City of
<hi>Chalcedon</hi> sent <hi>Atafernes</hi> her Keys and Submissions; and all the rest, by
her Example, did suddenly expel or seize on <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Garisons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their former obedience, which gave <hi>Lingarus</hi> as high an interest
in <hi>Atafernes,</hi> as he then manifested he had in his Countrey.</p>
               <p>This accelerated success was very opportune; For the prince had no
sooner thus setled his Province, than the first days march he made out
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:96335:303"/>
of it to join with <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> he received advertisement from <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
that it was impossible to do so: For <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Murena</hi> by a
subtilty of War finding the <hi>Pontick</hi> Army kept and camped near the
Bridg <hi>Omiris</hi> upon the River <hi>Sangarus,</hi> over which none could go to
<hi>Nicomedia</hi> but by marching about to the source thereof, which would
cost six days time; they caus'd some of their own Soldiers to run away
to <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> and to inform him, that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> being not yet come,
and understanding <hi>Atafernes</hi> had defeated <hi>Archilaus,</hi> (which really they
had not then heard), they were so terrified thereat, that they would
have for the present dissolved their Army, had not their shame been su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to their fear, but that they were then beginning strongly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
themselves, till their expected supplies arived; so that if they were
immediately attempted, the resistance would be small, and the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Victory great; For though they had the River <hi>Hyppias</hi> before
them, yet there were Foords enough unguarded some hundred furlongs
above the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, which they would undertake to guide the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Army over.</p>
               <p>This Advertisement confidently delivered by certain <hi>Bithynians,</hi> who
acknowledged themselves weary of following their unfortunate King,
and desired no other reward for so emiment a service, but that they might
return quietly to their homes, and receive their Sepulture in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
which gave them their Birth.</p>
               <p>This invited <hi>Pharnaces</hi> to commuicate it to <hi>Gordius, Dorilaus,</hi> and the
rest of his principal Officers, who finding the design full of hope &amp; honour,
as also one motive of the Enemies fear (<hi>Archilaus</hi> defeat) true, which
News was the precedent day come to <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> and perhaps envious at
<hi>Atafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es</hi> glory, &amp; fearful by a conjunction of forces,(which that Prince's
<hi>Victory</hi> enabled him to make) He might further eclipse his; They resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the design; and, making their Intelligencers their guides, they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the succeeding Night with all the Army (but a Guard they left to
justifie some works they had cast up at the end of the Bridg <hi>Omiris</hi>) to
those Foords which were a days march above <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Camp, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
receiv'd advertisement thereof, leaving some few men to continue
their fires therein till <hi>Pharnaces</hi>'s appearance, and then in Boats to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Fleet which Rid at the mouth of <hi>Hippius,</hi> he forthwith marched
over that River, broke down the Bridg, and thence sending four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse with Foot behind them, to <hi>Omiris,</hi> those partly by deceit, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by force, took the Fort which commanded it, and put all that defended
it to the Sword: then marching his own Army over it, he broke that down
also, as well to hinder <hi>Pharnaces</hi>'s following him, as to let his Soldiers
know they were to expect no safety but in their courages.</p>
               <p>The success of this excellent <hi>Stratagem</hi> could not give <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and
<hi>Murena</hi> more joy, than the arrival of <hi>Archilaus</hi> by Sea that night invaded
them with sorrow; for till then they had not heard of his Defeat, a stiff
East-wind having deni'd him a conjunction with his Associates, though
the distance was not above a Nights Sail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Murena</hi> having given some hours that Night to sorrow,
began then to console themselves in that Fleet <hi>Archilaus</hi> had brought
them, which made them absolute Masters at Sea, and in the hope they had
of being speedily the like on the Land, by their having so well separated
the two Brothers, and by being so near <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the unfortified resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> which they design'd the next Evening to see, and
the next after to possess.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MIthridates</hi> Fear was not inferior to the Joy this confidence
had given his Enemies, whose hasty advance made him
often determine to desert the place of his usual residence,
and seek his safety in <hi>Atafernes</hi> Army, which he consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a more hopeful Sanctuary than that large and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
City. But at length his Honour having conquered his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
he resolved to continue where he was, and not to encrease <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
advantages by two such signal accessions, as those of his own flight,
and of the loss of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which last would be an infallible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the first. This intention once assum'd, he sent several Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to my General to acquaint him with it, and to command him to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
out of his Army such a considerable strength to secure the City, as
might rationally do so, till he came up with the residue, or till <hi>Pharnaces</hi>
could come to his assistance. <hi>Atafernes</hi> having received these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
resolved in person to take four thousand Horse, and mounting
as many select foot behind them, to cast himself into <hi>Nicomedia,</hi>
as knowing those services in which the King's safety is ascertain'd, and
which he is a spectator of, are of deepest impression, and happiest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
The command of the Army he intrusted me with, though I
passionately beg'd to wait upon him, both as 'twas my inclination and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to him, and the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s last commands; for which disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
having undertook to excuse me, upon the necessity of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
safety; and having pressingly invited <hi>Lingarus</hi> and the rest of the
<hi>Bosphorian</hi> Nobility, to encrease his numbers, and to contribute to a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
which probably was to decide a War, the Enemy having put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a posture which rendered that belief a rational one, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, taking <hi>Craterus</hi> with him, whose wounds made the Town more
fit for his condition than the field. Soon after I followed his steps, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
yet nothing unessay'd to encrease the Army to such numbers, as
without Jemerity we might conquer <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and not be obliged to
the assistance of <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> and thereby end both Wars, before he had
begun one. Neither was I altogether indebted to my hopes for so flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an imagination, but to my reason also; for <hi>Lingarus</hi> had so intently
and actively imploy'd himself, that when I was come within a days march
of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> he overtook me with the flower of the Nobility of <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi>
                  <pb n="680" facs="tcp:96335:304"/>
who perhaps thereby endeavoured to let <hi>Mithridates</hi> see, they
were too considerable not to be continued his friends, or to be made his
enemies. But alas, my satisfaction then could not transcend my sorrow
soon after, when by an Express from the King, I understood that the
same morning on which the Letter was writ, the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> being
furiously assaulted by the Enemy (who knowing their condition, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no recovery if they were not conquerors of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and of one
Army before the other had joined with it) and having with wonderful
resolution beat them off, had so far and so briskly followed this dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
success with all his horse, that before he saw his mistake, he was not
in a capacity of remedying it, the whole Army having interposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and his retreat, which finding 'twas impossible to make, he
and his were resolved so to signalize their defeat, that his foes might
have as much cause to mourn, as to rejoice at it. This design he had
fully acted; and at length he and all that followed him, overpressed
with multitudes, were every one kill'd or taken; and whether he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had fallen into the first or last of these misfortunes, was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
so that the Forces in <hi>Nicomedia</hi> being deprived of him, seem'd
to be deprived of what had animated them; defending now the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
renewed and universal assault, with such coldness, that 'twas deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehended their ressistance would not be long enough to render my
relief worthy that name. Oh Gods! you alone can tell my trouble at
this sad advertisement, having of two persons I most valued, lost one,
and being but in too high a probability of losing the other. But I had
not time given me to deplore my unhappiness, nor hardly enough to
prevent the encrease of it: Therefore immediately marching away all
the Horse I had, and appointing <hi>Megabizes,</hi> a gallant and experienc'd
Officer, to follow me expeditiously with the Foot, I bent my course
with all imaginable celerity toward <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> resolv'd to put a period
to the danger of those in it, or to my life.</p>
               <p>By the dawn of the day I was come near enough to hear the shouts
and cryes of the Assailants and Defendants, and soon after to see all <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
Army (except those employ'd in the storm) under their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
By this I knew the place was not lost, and that the Enemy had no
small hopes that it would soon be won.</p>
               <p>Thrust on by this apprehension, and elevated by that joy, I flew to
charge a Body of near Ten thousand Horse, which lay ready to receive
that relief they believed <hi>Mithridates</hi> needed, and I would bring him.</p>
               <p>I strictly order'd all my Soldiers not to follow any success the gods
and their courages should give them, farther than might contribute to
our entring of the City, which was then only our design.</p>
               <p>The Fight was furious and bloody, the hopes of both parties depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the event of it; but at last I singled out the General of their
Horse, and in sight of both parties kill'd him; at which our Enemies
gave ground, and soon after so precipitately lost all, that we entred <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia,</hi>
not having lessened our Numbers above four hundred, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lessened five times as many of our Adversaries: But, as if Fate had
designed that both the Streets and the Fields should be equally moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with human blood, as I entered the West-gate, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> in person
entred the East, having left the generous <hi>Craterus</hi> for dead in the mouth
of the breach, and fill'd up the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t with the dead bodies which had
so resolutely defended it, thereby having rendered those which had been
the obstacle of their entrance, now the means of having it more easie.
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:96335:304"/>
Had you seen the faces of the <hi>Nicomedians,</hi> you might have read their
condition; for they equally participated of joy and fear, their friends
being triumphant at one end of the Town, and their Enemies at the
other. But the last News coming earlier to <hi>Mithridates</hi> than the first,
he thought it no longer courage, but frenzy, to expect relief in a place
which he now esteemed uncapable of any.</p>
               <p>He therefore hastily abandoned the Palace with the Queen, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Statira,</hi> the Princess <hi>Roxana,</hi> and the young Princess <hi>Cleopatra;</hi>
and flying with them towards a little Fort which stood at the extremity
of the Street I was entred, and commanded the Sea (to which Element
he now only hoped to owe his deliverance), he met me at the head
of my Forces, covered with dust and blood, as most in the first Ranks
were.</p>
               <p>The posture we were in, joyn'd with the intelligence of the Enemies
having entred the City, made him no longer doubt but that his Fate
was come; and in that belief he was going to act it with his own hands:
but perceiving his mistake by the flight of those few Guards he had left,
and by the cryes of the Princesses, lifting up my Helmet, and turning
the point of my Sword to the ground, I rode up to the King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
him not so much to wrong the gods and his own Soldiers, as by
abandoning <hi>Nicomedia</hi> to evidence he doubted the goodness of the one,
or the courages of the other, their having so freshly defeated a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of the Enemies Forces and their now having so opportunely
sent him a more considerable part of his own, were such good earnests
of future mercies, if not themselves present ones, that to doubt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
afterwards, were but to provoke them to deny it.</p>
               <p>Never words had a more fruitful effect than these, not only upon <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
but even upon the fair <hi>Statira</hi> too, who lifting up her fair eyes
eclips'd with weepings, fix'd them so obligingly on me, that my felicity
was thereby higher in my own apprehension, than their late danger had
been in hers.</p>
               <p>Here (generous Princes, continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
my crime; for I could not but bless the gods which had cast her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such misfortunes, since they had destin'd me to free her from them.</p>
               <p>As soon as I was alighted, the King flew into my arms, and in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
great as his joy, he began to give me acknowledgments of the same
nature: but he was cut off in the midst of them; for by this, <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
had so far enter'd the City, that her Inhabitants and Garison by their
hasty flight, and confused cryes, seem'd to acquaint him all was lost. I
had only time to conjure him to return to his Palace (which he was not
many paces from) and to beg him to rest assur'd of a Victory which our
Swords had in some measure begun, and were now going to perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates,</hi> whilst he was acting my desire, gave me so many assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his confidence in my Courage, that it brought no small accession
to it.</p>
               <p>But when (out of respect) I was helping the Queen to walk, he so
expresly prohibited so dangerous a civility, and she to take away the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of my continuing it, went so hastily from me, that thereby
I got an occasion of telling the fair <hi>Statira</hi> (whose incessant weepings
seem'd to reproach my having not paid her commands of never abandoning
her Brother, that obedience I owed and have faithfully promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them), Madam, had I followed my highest inclination, and my
greatest duty, for so I shall always call that observance your orders
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:96335:305"/>
exact from me) I had now freed that generous Prince from his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or not liv'd to see you so deeply deplore it.</p>
               <p>But his injunctions on me of following him with the Army, which by
reason of <hi>Craterus</hi> wounds he would not trust with any other, and his
reiterated Vows of apologizing for me to you, has made me guilty of a
Crime, which by what I see and feel, cannot be greater than my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But Madam, I am now going by some eminent action to dry up your
tears, and wash away my guilt, or else to convince you by my death,
that I did not altogether merit that cruel Command of your Brothers,
which at once was to separate me from waiting on him, and from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you.</p>
               <p>These words brought fresh tears into the fair Princess's eyes, and seem'd
so to contract her breast with sorrow, that she was only able to tell me;
The poor <hi>Atafernes</hi> has told me all which you have now spoken, and I
think I have not been accustom'd to give your words so little credit, as
to provoke you in so fatal a way as you mention, to invite me to believe
them: no, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> though the gods have so signally punished the
Royal House of <hi>Pontus,</hi> as to deprive it of that unhappy Prince (the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of whose death has hitherto hinder'd grief from acting mine)
yet I believe their Mercy will place limits to their Justice, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
it at the same time of so considerable a Friend, for whose particular
preservation I shall as concernedly pray, as for the publick success.</p>
               <p>A hideous cry occasion'd by some of <hi>Nicomedes</hi> Soldiers, who thirsty
after blood or pillage, had much advanc'd themselves before the rest of
their Companions, render'd me uncapable of hearing what she farther
said, or of speaking any more unto her; so that having hastily again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
my Horse, I moved eagerly towards that Enemy, the shedding
of whose blood could not be but a just and necessary expiation for their
having caus'd <hi>Mithridatia</hi> to shed so many tears.</p>
               <p>I will not here enumerate the various accidents of that bloody Day:
it may perhaps suffice to tell you, That <hi>Mithridates</hi> having seen the
Streets of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> run with the blood of his enemies and his subjects;
he at last saw after a little Battel, in a great <hi>Piazza,</hi> that by the last
the first were expell'd the City, in which they left so considerable a part
of their Army, that had they been alive, they had been enow to have
kept it against the rest.</p>
               <p>I was not solicitous to follow the execution too far, lest I might have
repeated the generous <hi>Atafernes</hi> misfortune, and thereby have left <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>
without a Defender, when she had honoured me with that Noble
Title. Besides, I was not without apprehensions, that <hi>Nicomedes</hi> might
believe it a more hopeful design to cut off our Foot under <hi>Megabizes,</hi>
than now to take <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and might with such celerity attempt it,
that if any time were lost, that part of the Army might be so too. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore first diligently search'd for, and at last found the poor <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
Body, which yet seem'd to have some life in it, and of which I took
all imaginable care, I hastily caus'd that wide breach by which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had entred, and had been expell'd, to be made up; and whilst that
was doing, I went to the King, gave him an account of what we had
done, begg'd his permission forthwith to attempt those who interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
between <hi>Megabizes</hi> and me; and being join'd, to camp in those
great Fields which Neighbour'd the West-port, that our men having a
Night's refreshment, they might be the earlier refresh'd for a Battel,
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:96335:305"/>
which I was confident <hi>Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes,</hi> and <hi>Murena</hi> would so
pressingly offer, that I must either accept it, or draw into the City in which
our Horse would be famished, before <hi>Pharnaces</hi> could come to our Relief,
and by which our Army would be as much dejected, as the Enemies
heightned; who also might when <hi>Pharnaces</hi> came near, silently rise in the
Night, and fight him before we could get notice of their remove; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
if they had success, all would too probably be lost: whereas if he
permitted me to decide the quarrel in the Field, if we did not present
him with Victory, yet at least we should so much diminish our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Numbers, that our Friends should find an easie way into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> and all his Council believed this too hazardous a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but I so confidently perswaded them the contrary was so, that at the
last they condescended to what I proposed.</p>
               <p>I was beginning to take my leave, and to return to my Men, when the
King perceived some blood drop from my Arm, at which he seem'd as
much concerned, as if it had been from his own; and forthwith sending
for a Chirurgeon to dress me, and for a Scarf to support it, the Queen
not having one about her, and fearing 'twould take up too much time to
send for one, she desired the fair <hi>Statira</hi> to spare me hers (for by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
accident she had one which she had prepar'd for the unhappy <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ernes</hi>):
This that obliging Princess did, and I received it from the hands
of <hi>Monyma,</hi> who by an excess of civility would needs put it on her self,
though I endeavoured by many entreaties to free her from so low a
trouble; But whilst she was ordering of it, I seem'd by my looks to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
<hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s goodness, more than the Queen's, and that the
first had more oblig'd me in granting the Request, than the last had, in
having made it; and if I was capable of any dissatisfaction in so much
happiness, 'twas only in deriving my Obligation from any but my
Princess.</p>
               <p>But finding my hurt had more befriended me already than it could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
me, unless by longer expectance of one to dress it (which it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerableness
needed not) I went away, having first paid my humble
acknowledgments to the Princess, and the Queen, and so fully assur'd
<hi>Mithridates</hi> of success, that he seemed to be then as desirous of the Event
of my Enterprize, as formerly he had been apprehensive of it.</p>
               <p>My Soldiers having (during this) taken a little refreshment, which
the over-joy'd Inhabitants willingly presented them, were all in Arms at
my return. I told them, we were again by another Victory to join with
those, which we had obtained a Victory, to separate our selves from.</p>
               <p>This was so requisite a performance, that it appear'd such to the
meanest capacities there, which made the motion be received with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
shouts; at the conclusion whereof, we chearfully left <hi>Nicomedia</hi>
by the same Gate by which we had entred it.</p>
               <p>We were not above two furlongs on our March, when we discovered
many Divisions of Horse drawn up to intercept us, and all the Residue of
<hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Army (who easily foresaw our intention) moving to join
with those; we were therefore hastily advancing to charge, which we did
with such fury, that all their resistance contributed but the more to their
loss, and our glory.</p>
               <p>We had no sooner disintangled our selves from this bloody Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
than we prosecuted our intended design, and with such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that <hi>Nicomedes</hi> not being able to overtake me with his Foot,
thought it was the more safe advi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to give his men refreshment, whilst I
*
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:96335:306"/>was harrasing of mine, that they might be the fitter next day to attempt
the City if I did not return, or to give me Battel, if I did,</p>
               <p>'T was therefore that uninterruptedly I joyn'd with <hi>Megabizes,</hi> whom
I met about thirty furlongs from the place we had so lately fought in, and
with whom I found such brave accessional Forces, which <hi>Lingarus's</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
had drawn under out Ensigns, that I return'd with a firm resolution,
no longer than the next Day to decline a general engagement: and an
hour before the Sun was set, I camped in some great inclosed Fields con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to the Walls of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where I order'd my Soldiers to take
as much rest as their vicinity to so many ill Neighbours would admit:
And having assembled a Council, and resolved in what form we should
give the intended Battel, leaving <hi>Megabizes</hi> the command of the Camp,
I went into the City, taking <hi>Lingarus</hi> with me, whom I presented to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
with those Elogies I esteemed due to his merits. The Kings
actions shewed he believed my words, and that gallant Man received so
many kindnesses from his Prince, that it brought no small increase to the
zeal he had already assumed for his Service.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Mithridates</hi> was entertaining himself with him, and giving him
many Professions that his present services had totally wiped away his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
fault, one of those many Officers I had employ'd amongst the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
to learn some intelligence of <hi>Atafernes,</hi> sent to speak with me in
an anti-chamber; to whom I went hastily, and from whom I received
information, that by a Prisoner of quality he was assured that generous
Prince had been taken alive, but much wounded, and yet not so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously, as to make the Chirurgeons despair of his recovery. Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with this happy News, I fled unto the King, and acquainted him
with it, who sending forthwith to the first Informer of this joyful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement,
and having received from him a full convincement of the
certainty thereof; he told me, Go, <hi>Callimachus</hi> and stop the poor <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira's</hi>
tears with this obliging assurance. This almost as obliging a
Command I hastned to obey, and having obtained the Princess's permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of waiting on her, I entred her Chamber, but did find her so drown'd
in sorrow, that for a while it made me forget my own grief, and that I
was come with what would mitigate hers: but when I had found the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil
cruelty of such a sympathizing; I told her, I was once, Madam,
coming to implore the priviledg of mingling my tears with yours for our
common Loss, and of lamenting, till I could revenge it: But now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I am come to tell you, That the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> hath not lost his
life, but his liberty; which misfortune I hope by this time to morrow so
to free him from, that you will have no trouble but in beholding of his,
when he shall know those tears his Captivity has made you shed; and if
he prefers not your satisfaction above his own, he cannot but believe his
wounds and loss of Liberty a cheap price for discovering so high a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as thereby he experiments the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> honours him with;
for my part, though I value him at the rate his virtues merit, yet if I can
by restoring him to his Freedom give her as great a contentmeat, as the
loss of it did give her a trouble, I shall hardly so much repine at his
Fate, as I shall glory in my own.</p>
               <p>The Princess either did not, or would not hear my last words, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
them, told me; O gods! <hi>Callimachus,</hi> is it then possible
that <hi>Atafernes</hi> is alive? or do you think my sorrow was so near sending
me to bear him Company, that to deny that only remaining happiness,
you this way endeavour to suspend me from it now, and to morrow hope
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:96335:306"/>by repeated Victories I shall not find room enough to entertain a killing
grief in so general a cause of Joy? Madam, (I reply'd) the Truth I have
told you is as great, as therefore my satisfaction is; and your generous Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wants, I hope, but that Freedom which ere long he will enjoy;
since Fortune which has honoured my Sword with some success when
'twas for your service, will not deny it the like when 'tis for your satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>You have (said the Princess) done so much already for us, that I
know not any thing which we may not expect from your Courage and
Civility; and the next happiness to seeing my Brother at Liberty, is to
receive an assurance of it from you; but yet <hi>Callimachus,</hi> have a care
you give me as good an account of your self, as your promise; for your
preservation will be as requisite for my satisfaction, as for the publick
safety.</p>
               <p>Madam, (I answered, transported with what she had spoken) till
these glorious words, I never was acquainted with any thing which
might flatter me into a belief that my preservation could be useful to the
publick, or as much as to my self; the gods having kept me a stranger to
my own extraction, and yet at the same time having given me a heart to
aspire to what the sublimest only can legitimately pretend unto; yes,
Madam, I have such transcendent aims, that I thought I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
nothing which was not inferiour to them, till the gods destin'd me
to your service, which goodness I must at the same instant acknowledg,
and deplore; since for to make me useful to you, they have eclips'd the
condition you were born unto, and have thought fit rather to diminish
your greatness, that thereby I might become in some poor measure useful
to you, than continue it, whereby I should have been deny'd that
honour; and since I find by so unhoped-for, yet obliging experiment,
that such a manifestation is not indifferent unto them, nay, rather than
not evidence it, they have shaken the greatest Empire of the World,
and troubled a Princess fit to be inthron'd in it; I shall no more doubt
they will finish what they have begun, than I should rejoyce that my
Opinion might have the honour to be yours; or if it be not, that you
will pardon its being mine.</p>
               <p>All the while I was speaking, I was much more concern'd in <hi>Statira</hi>'s
looks in what I spoke; for I could not but believe that a heart entirely
hers, could be elegible to her; and therefore I was much more intent to
know her sense of what was there, than to cloathe that discovery in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
fit for its self, or that admirable Person to whom it was made:
Neither durst I, observing that more reserved look she put on when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
my discourse, conclude it in words of the same quality; but I so
alter'd it, that the end might relish of the beginning, or of my great
hopes of relieving her generous Brother: In which sense she seemed to
receive what I had said, and therefore told me; Though the gods have
directly conceal'd from you what your extraction is, yet obliquely they
seem to inform you of it; for by giving you such high aims, you may
thereby know your descent is not disproportionate: yet permit me to
tell you, that your designs of acquiring as great an Empire as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
for <hi>Mithridates,</hi> is not to me so eminent a proof that your birth is
high, as your so generously undertaking his quarrel against his Rebels;
the relief of the oppressed being a clearer act of greatness, than winning
of Kingdoms; this being most frequently the recompence of force, that
being alway the illustration of vertue. But alas (she continued) would
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:96335:307"/>to the gods I could believe the Warrs my Father is plunged into, could
be irrationally attributed to what you alledg: No, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> his
own faults, and the crimes of his subjects are too visible, and great, to
allow me any rise to ascribe our present confusions to any other cause;
and if I have any hopes that they are sent only for our correction, not
our ruine, 'tis that the gods have sent us in our afflictions such a Friend,
who doubtless would not have been permitted to have imploy'd his
sword and conduct in a quarrel designed to be unsuccessful: Nor would
those powers have so strangely preserved <hi>Ataphernes,</hi> but that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
of this unfortunate Family are destin'd to owe their safety unto
you, that the gods might not wholly destroy a House, in which possibly
some unguilty persons are, and yet preserve it in such a way as might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
silence any imaginations of their having acted towards that mercy:
And it may be also to make those of it in love with virtue, above power,
when they shall experiment, that the desert of an unknown person could
more preserve them, than innumerable Armies too too empty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>I had not (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) leisure enough to admire the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
vertue, and resembling obligedness of the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to pay by my acknowledgments any part of that vast debt, what
she had said, had so justly engaged me unto; by reason the Princess <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
and immediately after, the Queen came to congratulate with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatia</hi>
the happy news of <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s being alive.</p>
               <p>Whilst the two Sisters were entertaining one another, <hi>Monyma</hi> after
some usual Discourses presenting me her hand, made me follow her to the
farthest end of the Chamber we were in; where having a while continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
silent, she at length told me; I observe, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> your carriage
towards me has so much of indifferency in it, that it might justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
me to imitate you; which (doubtless) long agon I had done,
were it not to convince you, that in all things which entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon actings, I have an esteem for you uncapable of suppression, or
as much as of dimunition.</p>
               <p>Madam, (I reply'd, strangely surprised at what she had spoke) I hope
my carriage to you has relish'd of all sorts of respect due to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and merit; if it has not, I humbly beg to be told my fault, that
I may not only repair it, but also punish a crime so contrary to my duty
and inclination.</p>
               <p>Your fault, (the Queen reply'd, casting down her eyes, and blushing)
is better mended than told: but since you pretend to be ignorant, I shall
find out an opportunity not only to acquaint you with it, but also with
what, I am confident, causes it. These words were scarce out of her
mouth, when she went away, and 'twas happy for me she did; for had she
staid, she could not but have guessed by my disorders, what had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
them: her last expression gave me so much fear, that I found my self
too unfit to continue longer in the Princesses Chamber, out of which
I pretended to go, as a duty to the company there, having assured them,
if the next day the Enemy declin'd not the Battel, which I thought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
their condition nor courage would make them guilty of, I would
leave no means unattempted to restore the Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> to his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>After the civilities that promise did invite the Queen and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
to bestow upon me, I went to visit <hi>Craterus,</hi> whom I found
more afflicted by his being unable to assist me in the intended
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:96335:307"/>Battel, than at those wounds which denied him that power, and me
his help: from thence I went to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who the nearer we grew
to the execution of our design, had the more aversness to it; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again dissipated those cold apprehensions by words altogether Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and promising, I retir'd towards the Camp, accompanied by all those
Officers which then were in <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> resolving not to see that
place again, till I were covered with Laurels, and till by eminent repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
services I might let the fair <hi>Statira</hi> see, I wanted not merit, but a
sufficient quality to aspire unto the title of her servant. After, having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the requisite orders for the succeding days business, I dismiss'd all men
out of my Tent, but <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whom I order'd to imbellish my
Armour with the richest stones I had; for designing to act remarkable
things, I was resolv'd to wear Arms which were so: And knowing that
so signal an engagement could not but invite the Princess to be a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of it, which from the Battlements of the Palace she might easily be,
I thought my intended gallantry would be excusable; and I elected
rather to be known to all my enemies, than not to be so to my
Conqueror. All the night almost I entertained my self with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciousness
of my Fortune; By how rare an accident I had first seen <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma,</hi>
and by a rarer lost her; how that to cure the reliques of that passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I had elected a course of life which had cost me a greater; how Fortune
seem'd to delight to engage me in love, by having enabled me to pay
my two Mistresses higher services the first moment I saw them, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
could expect to perform in the whole course of their lives: And
then, that she was really more concern'd in making me unfortunate in it,
having the first time perswaded me to pay my affection to a person
from whose humour I could expect no success; and the last, from whose
quality I was to attend the like unhappiness: how from nothing I was
rais'd high enough to love, and not high enough to hope the reward
of it: That if I prov'd successful in War, I should be no longer useful;
and if unsuccessful, I could be no longer considerable; as also, that if the
War were protracted, the greatest glory of it would be lessened, even that
of expedition; That the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was daily expected, whose
Title and Power, joyn'd with the Authority of the Father, and the
exact obedience of the Daughter (whose principles I had but too reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
been acquainted with, to allow me the least hope she would decline
the practise of them) would soon involve me in infelicities as vast as
those joys which were to cause them. These and many other suggestions
of as unpleasing a nature, my memory (conspiring with my fortune)
represented to me in their liveliest colours, and would not so much as
by sleep allow me an interval of rest, so that they were my constrant
and importunate Companions, till the day, and the military musick
made them retire, and resign their places to the thoughts of acquiring
Victory, the possession or loss whereof some few hours would decide.
The glory I possess'd in being the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s Servant, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I hoped that day to win in being her Brother Deliverer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
that melancholly the nights entertainment had infected me with,
that when I began to draw out my Army, my looks so participated of
my hopes, that my desire of success could not therefore exceed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
my Soldiers had of it: And that which did yet more contribute
to my hopes, was to see the Tarrase of the highest Tower in <hi>Nicomedia</hi>
covered with Royal Pavilions, whereby I was satisfied <hi>Statira</hi> would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
us with her sight, whose influence could promise nothing less than
Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="688" facs="tcp:96335:308"/>But whilst the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> Army was drawing up in that form I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and the Enemies were covering the opposite side of the Plain
with their Divisions, an Officer from the head of one of those which was
most advanced, came towards me, and turning the point of his Javelin to
the earth in sign of friendship, told me with a loud voice, That one of his
Generals desired to speak with <hi>Callimachus</hi> between both Armies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
his Faith during the parley, and till his return, nothing of violence
should be offer'd, and that he intreated the like assurance.</p>
               <p>A compliance herein having a possibility of good, and a certainty of
no hurt, I was advis'd ro accept thereof by all the Officers which were
near me, whose opinions I more willingly followed, because of the passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
desire I had to learn the condition of the Prince <hi>Atafernes.</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told the Enemies Officer, I would forthwith meet his General, for
whose safety during the conference, and return to his own Army after it,
I engaged him my Faith. To which he (being told who I was) reply'd
it was sufficient; and so return'd to the head of the Enemy's Army, from
whence I saw a Gentleman advance singly into the middle of the plain,
where immediately I met him, and where after, having lifted up the sights
of our Helmets, and performed all the civilities which are usual in
such cases; He told me; If you now think it strange that I have desired a
parley, when we are going to fight a Battel, possibly you may do so no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when I have told you I am <hi>Nicomedes</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> that same
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> who owed principally to your Sword and Conduct, a Naval
Victory he obtained over <hi>Mithridates</hi> in the Mouth of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea;
and that it is but even now I learnt you are that brave <hi>Callimachus,</hi> from
whose courage I derived so signal an advantage; I must plainly confess
after this information, I could not but desire to express my trouble, both
that you are engaged against me, and for him, who, to say no more, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
not such a Friend: But I come not now to Court you from him, I
could not be worthy of your Friendship if I now made you such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
neither could you be worthy of mine, if you now granted it: all
that I ask, is, after this Battel, if the gods make us outlive it, that you
would take leave of him, and joyn your self to a quarrel, which possibly
deserves your embracing it; and to a Prince, who during his life will
give you as large a share in his Fortunes, as he has already in his esteem.</p>
               <p>This I hope will not be thought an immodest desire, since, as you once
assur'd me, you are not <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Subject, and had too much cause to
be his Enemy; and that you must fight to maintain an Usurper in
the Throne, and to keep the Legitimate Prince out of it, who has not
only a right thereunto by a lawful succession, but also even by the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
King's Treaty of peace with <hi>Sylla,</hi> and his reiterated engagements
to <hi>Murena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the gods too, favour my Arms in this Field, I hope I shall not need
employ them to win another; and though I should lose this day (which
I have no cause to doubt, but your being my Enemy) I have yet so
many powerful Friends in <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> nay the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in my quarrel, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> to be quiet King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> must
be the like of the whole World. As soon as <hi>Nicomedes</hi> had done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I reply'd: The honour I once had to do you a small service, is so
nobly remembred, and paid, in what you formerly did, and now are
generously pleas'd to offer, as well as in that high care you have of my
reputation even when I am in Arms against you, that I hope you will
conclude my confinements to <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s service are not to be broken,
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:96335:308"/>since they continue firm after such powerful Assaults: Yes (great Prince)
I take the gods for witness, that your generosity will make me look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
success with grief, and wish I had never worn a Sword, since it must
be so unhappily employ'd.</p>
               <p>I can too with the like truth protest, if the now difference between
the <hi>Pontick,</hi> King and you were ended, that I would as freely hazard my
life to restore you to your Kingdom, as now I will to preserve <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
from losing his: And though possibly his innocence towards you
might not be perfect, yet I beg you, generous <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> to consider how
unfit it would be for me to hear it accused; and let that consideration
prevail with you to send me away, with the sorrow of being compell'd
to draw my Sword against a King, from whom I have received many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
and never any dissatisfaction; I say, Compell'd, and that too
by causes so undisputable, that I must act what I do, though I were as
fully convinc'd of the Justice of your quarrel, as you your self are.</p>
               <p>After this Declaration, be pleased rather to pity than condemn my
not accepting of your favour; and be confident I would not have said
so much, but to one I perfectly honour, and to whom I am a servant in
heart, though my hand may act against that truth.</p>
               <p>This I spoke, being truly affected with the injustice I did to the King
of <hi>Bithynia</hi> in opposing his undoubted right, and being as perfectly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
with his civilities.</p>
               <p>His answer too was so moving, and full of Obligation, that thereby I the
more clearly discovered the height of my passion for the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi>
which made me deaf to friendship and justice, and resign the power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
even to a hopeless Love; but yet to a Love so glorious, and so
charming, that not to have given it the precedency of all other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
would have been a greater Crime than to have done it.</p>
               <p>What need I tell you more (generous Princes) than, that this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ended with the high satisfaction and trouble of us both, the one to
see we had such invitation to be friends, and the other that there was such
an impossibility of becoming so.</p>
               <p>But before I took leave of the unhappy <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> I begg'd him to
tell me what was become of <hi>Atafernes;</hi> to which he reply'd, If he were
living, he was in the power of <hi>Murena</hi>'s Soldiers, for he had been taken
by the <hi>Roman Legionaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doubt rais'd in me so many fears and troubles, that they were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who therefore assured me, since he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I was concerned for him, he would thenceforth be the like.</p>
               <p>I pay'd him as many acknowledgments for that promise, as for all
his other respects, which he increased by telling me; Lest you may
believe the denyal of your friendship to me, has supprest mine to
you; Permit me to tell you, Your disorders at <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s danger,
may be prejudicial to you; for I see your Army is ready to begin
the Battel, having <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Murena</hi> to supply my absence,
and that yours probably having none to supply yours, may sustain a
prejudice, which this way I would not have it endure, were it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Mithridates</hi> himself, much less being 'tis by the brave <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus,</hi>
whose refusal of my offers I cannot be offended at, since, by
what he has told me, I must believe it springs from a cause to which not
only a desired friendship has been inferiour, but even a formed one, and
which I have experimented has been so prevalent with me, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be offended at its now being so against me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="690" facs="tcp:96335:309"/>These words made me at once joy'd, and confounded; this that he
should know the truth of the thing (though not of the person) and that,
that it had produced so obliging an effect.</p>
               <p>In brief, we parted, and I believe as full of thoughts at what had past,
as at what was to come, he galloping to the head of his Troops, as I did
to the head of mine, where I gave all the chief Officers a Relation of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>'s
desires to me, which only had occasioned and continued our
conference, of which also I sent an account to the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, that he
might have no cause to suspect my fidelity, which was tyed unto him by
an Obligation, though secret, yet incorruptible.</p>
               <p>This being done, I forthwith sent every Commander to his respective
place: and having in a short speech incited the Soldiers to manifest their
courages for, and before their King, I commanded the signal of Battel to
be given, and then the military Musick began to invite us to that glory
which so Noble a Field was to present the Conquerour: never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
was there a Battel in which so many Kings and of Royal blood
were Actors, or Beholders; and never perhaps were Armies so brave
and glittering as these.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and the King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> appear'd in an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
and with Forces worthy their Titles and their hopes; and <hi>Murena</hi>
manifested that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were sometimes as exorbitant as the
<hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aticks,</hi> which their pride or wisdom so much condemn'd.</p>
               <p>On the other side, <hi>Mithridates</hi> Troops which consisted (for the most
part) of the young Nobility and Gentry of his Dominions, which their
honour, as much as his danger, had incited under his Ensigns, were so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and rich in their Furnitures, as were also all those Courtiers which
shame or glory had drawn out of <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> that they look'd rather like
going to triumph after a Victory, than to win one: Who even that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had beheld the various multitudes of Colours, the Wind and those
which carried them did wanton with; The glistering of Arms, and
Swords, the vast Numbers of brave Horse, all seeming as impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
as their very Riders; the variety of Nations and Habits, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Martial Countenances; the exact regularity every individual Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
had within its self, and the perfect proportion all of them had with
each other: whoever too had heard the neighing of the Horse, the shouts
of the Soldiers, and the Military Instruments, could not but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
how deformed soever the face of War uses to appear, yet that day
it had Charms enough to have captivated even that Sex whose Nature is
compos'd of pity.</p>
               <p>I must acknowledg how greedy soever I was of a Victory, which I
hoped might in some measure repair the unhappiness or ignorance of my
Birth, yet I was so delighted with that Noble entertainment and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that it was with some reluctancy I put a period to it.</p>
               <p>The Enemies Forces consisted (as I may say) of three Armies, and
were commanded by <hi>Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes,</hi> and <hi>Murena,</hi> out of all
which <hi>Archilaus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> had a great body of Horse and Foot
given them to lead, who acted so many high things that day, that had it
been for their Countrey (as it was against it) their precedent guilt might
have been thereby entirely defas'd.</p>
               <p>In imitation of the Enemies Order, I had divided my Army into three
equal parts, having first chosen out a select Number, as a general reserve to
answer all Emergencies: and because I was exceedingly over-power'd in
Foot, I placed behind every Battalion of my Foot, a Reserve of Horse to
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:96335:309"/>countenance and second them, which proved of no small use.</p>
               <p>Secretly, behind the outwardmost divisions of our wings of Horse, I
placed some of our best Archers, who when we were going to charge,
discovered themselves, and thereby not only amazed, but so gall'd our
Enemies with their Arrows, that the wounded Horses by their disorders
made sufficient breaches for us to enter at: This too did not a little help
us; but that which did most, was this which I am now going to tell you
(for I never saw it practis'd before; and it was then of so great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that you will perhaps pardon my particularizing of it, and
possibly one day have occasion to make use of it; which if you have,
I wish it may be as successful to the followers, as to the beginner of it).</p>
               <p>I found when our Armies faced one another, that the Enemy did much
over-wing us, and that possibly therefore he had neglected to secure his
left Flank with a deep stream which ran some three furlongs from it; so
that he had so much of Champion-ground on that wing, and had much
more on the other.</p>
               <p>In our embatteling therefore I let him see how much he outwinged us
on both sides; but when he moved to the Charge, I gave strict order to
all my Army to shog still toward the right hand; so that by the time we
came to mingle, we outwinged their Left Flank, as much as their Right
Wing outwinged our Left, and thereby in a great measure shared the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences with them, which by their numbers they might have entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cast upon us, if they had taken the advantage of the place in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the stream on their left Flank.</p>
               <p>I shall not trouble you in giving a minutes description of this days acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
'tis enough you know, though the <hi>Mithridatians</hi> did behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like men of Honour, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> led by <hi>Nicomedes</hi> (for <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi>
had been dangerously wounded, and was carried off in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fight, and all <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Forces had been broken and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd) so signally manifested their Courages, and kept their Discipline,
that I was twice reduced to our general Reserve, and to a Body of Foot
which had been kept entire only by the help and countenance of some
Horse which had been their Reserve.</p>
               <p>That which had reduced us to this extremity, was not only the fall of
<hi>Megabizes</hi> (who though he lost his Life, yet he got a Reputation which
was much more worth) but also the dangerous wounds which <hi>Lingarus</hi>
received, who thereby was carried out of the Field sensless and speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
yet accompanied with so many elogies, that none which was a friend
to Honour, would have declin'd the bloody rate at which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
his. Great gods! what did I not think! and what did I not say,
when I saw my self reduced to so sad an extremity, to be worsted in <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>'s
quarrel, nay even in her sight, and thereby expose her to lose her
own Liberty, whose Beauties were capable to deprive all men of theirs!
To presume to lift up my eyes to such a person, and be defeated at the
head of such an Army; To have had success enough to give me such
exalted hopes, and then from the height of them to precipitate me, were
considerations too too sufficient to make me cast my self into the arms of
death, to put a period unto them.</p>
               <p>I may truly say (generous Princes) that this despair made me act
strange things, even worthy the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s sight, and perhaps her
commendation, which yet I even blusht at, to find that any motive
could inspire my Arm, more than the Noblest Passion for the Noblest
Object.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="692" facs="tcp:96335:310"/>I kill'd in this fury <hi>Neoptolem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in the Center of his, and by the help of <hi>Lingarus</hi>'s Son,
who had rallied a body of the young <hi>Bosphorian</hi> Nobility, I stop'd the
current of <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s success, and thereby gave my own Forces time and
opportunity to Rally, which they did, and with which we soon made our
Friends see we were Conquerors, and our Enemies feel it.</p>
               <p>Never was there in such a number so horrid an Execution, scarcely <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
and <hi>Murena</hi> loaden with wounds, could recover a little Boat,
which with much hazard carried them to <hi>Archilaus</hi>'s Fleet, where he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
soon after did arrive, cursing Fortune which had given them such
hopes, only to make their loss the more unsupportable.</p>
               <p>But amidst the blood and confusion of our Victory, I caus'd the Name
of <hi>Atafernes</hi> to be ecchoed in all places, and by all Persons under my
Command, promising high Rewards to any which could bring me News
of him: but finding those ways unsuccessful, I sent several parties of Horse
towards the Sea, presupposing when the Enemy had seen the probability
of their Defeat, they might have sent him towards their Fleet, as the only
place to secure so considerable a Prisoner in.</p>
               <p>And that nothing might be left unessay'd, and something acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my own mind, galloped I my self away at the head of some
Horse, to seek that generous Prince, for whose Freedom I had higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
than for Victory.</p>
               <p>I was already come within sight of the Sea without discovering
what I sought, and was even turning back when I perceived com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of a small Wood, a body of Horse, who bended their course
towards a Galley which rode near the Shore, but yet they marched
so leisurely, that I concluded in so general a Flight they carryed off
some considerable Person, whose then condition would not admit of a
speedier motion.</p>
               <p>I therefore resolved to attempt them, and having sent some Horse to
engage them, and to retard their March, I came up at last with those I had
with me, and after some Resistance, broke and defeated the Enemy: But,
O gods! what was my joy when I found in a Litter the Prince <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>
alive! but so weak and changed with his wounds, that 'twas some
time before I knew him, and 'twas with much difficulty that he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me.</p>
               <p>This addition to the winning of the Battel, made me need but one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
more. With <hi>Atafernes</hi> I joyfully took up our way to the Camp,
whither as we were going, he so signally owned the services I pay'd him
and his Family, and in such pressing words assur'd me, they had nothing
in their power above my Merit, that thereby he flatter'd a Despair, which
his fair Sister could only suppress.</p>
               <p>He told me too, that he owed his life to me, before I had this last time
redeem'd it; for <hi>Murena</hi> enraged at his wounds, and thinking the day
would be lost, since those necessitated him to retire, had commanded his
Soldiers (to whom I was a Prisoner, and who then guarded me) that if
they could not recover the Fleet before they were overtook, they should
put him to Death; which (being once pursued) they were about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
when by accident <hi>Nicomedes</hi> in his flight passing by, not only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
but discharged those <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Murena,</hi> placed a Troop of <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and <hi>Cappadocians</hi> about me, with order if they were overtook, or
worsted, they should leave me untouch'd; and having acquainted me
therewith; he added, 'Twas for <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s sake, who had desired his
care of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="693" facs="tcp:96335:310"/>This generosity I was inform'd of with much satisfaction, and with no
less trouble, to find my Fate had destin'd me to be an Enemy to a Prince,
who by many confinements merited my Service.</p>
               <p>We were no sooner arrived at the Camp, than the shouts of Victory
were drown'd in those <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s life and Liberty occasioned in the
Soldiers, whose joys yet had not a higher production, than a cause.
'Twas then I waited upon <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> where having pay'd him all the
civilities due to his Title, and given him all those consolations due to his
condition, I sent him to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> accompanied with the chief Officers
of the Army.</p>
               <p>But to let you see the instability of the most promising earthly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as I was inviron'd with some thousands of Conquerors, and in the
embraces of a generous Prince, there came a young man of an excellent
Meen, and in a Garb which shewed him to be of some quality, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to speak with me, promising a piece of intelligence worthy my
knowledg.</p>
               <p>I must confess I trembled at it, fearing it might be some discovery
where <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was concealed, and therefore I would have put him
off; but he so pressingly importun'd my attention, that in the end I
gave it him; but instead of what he promised, he plung'd a Dagger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my breast up to the Handle, and would have doubled his stroke, but
that I had strength enough left to force it out of his hand, and return
his bloody present, at which he fell, and had only Life enough left to
say, That he was <hi>Neoptolemus</hi>'s Son; and that since I had destroy'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Family, having no other way to act his Revenge, he had chosen
that, which he hoped his high wrongs and necessitated condition would
apologize for.</p>
               <p>His immediate Death saved him from those torments the rage and grief
of the Soldiers had design'd him; but such abundance of blood gushed
out of my wound, that I soon after fell, and 'twas with much Art and
pain, that my wound was bound up.</p>
               <p>The generous <hi>Atafernes</hi> took me into his Littor; and the Palace in <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media</hi>
being the nearest place we could retire unto, we advanced thither.</p>
               <p>Never was there Triumph so sad as this, and never was there Laurel
and Cypress so exactly mingled; the whole Army march'd by the Littor
carrying the Trophies of their success, and washing them with their
tears; so that when the King, the Queen, and the Princesses, came to
meet us at the Court-gate, to honour and share in the joy of our success,
they found so many evincements of grief in all the Armies looks, that
they knew not what to fear, and yet did fear every thing; the sadded
Soldiers which marched in the first Ranks, gave so imperfect an account of
what they were demanded, as did also all those which followed, that their
eyes were their first and truest Intelligencers; and though at the same
time they saw <hi>Atafernes</hi> alive, and free, yet seeing me with so little life
by him, and all disfigured with blood, it seem'd to chase away all their
causes of satisfaction; and I found by as sad, as high a proof, that my life
was not inconsiderable to so many eminent Persons; and above all, to
that fair Princess to whose Service I had devoted it: The shrieks she
made when she saw me in so dangerous a case, drew me from that Dying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slumber
I had been in, and as soon as my eyes were open, they met with
hers, which suddenly after wept such a deluge of tears, that had I not
ascribed them all to her Noble Brother's condition, I had neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd
my own, nor her grief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="694" facs="tcp:96335:311"/>I would have forc'd my self to rise, but I found I could not; which
she perceiving, forbad me any more attempts of that nature; by which
I had scarce strength enough humbly to acknowledg her care.</p>
               <p>This made them the more hasten up to the Prince's Chamber, where
he would have me lye, causing another Bed to be set up. We were no
sooner in a condition to receive a visit, than the two Princesses, and the
King gave us one (a sudden indisposition of the Queen's then confining
her from stirring out) who after he had spent some time with me in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincements
of his satisfaction for what I had done, and sorrow for what
I was reduced to, and in kindnesses to his Son; he went immediately
after to the Queen's apartment, out of which he seldome did use to stir,
when any distemper tyed her unto it: The two Princesses stayed with
<hi>Atafernes,</hi> who perhaps to oblige me (for I believe he then suspected my
Passion) desired his Favourite-Sister to entertain me, whilest he did the
Princess <hi>Roxana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That admirable person did me therefore the honour to come near my
Bed, and told me; I see, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> how deceitful and uncertain all
humane things are; for had I know that this day you should have
brought us home Victory, and <hi>Atafernes,</hi> I could not have believed
there had been unhappiness enough left to have clouded our satisfaction;
but your wounds and danger make it impossible at once to express grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and joy.</p>
               <p>Madam, (I replyed) there can hardly be a higher evincement how
unestimable most Worldly things deserve to be, than to see that so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a persons condition should cloud and disturb yours; but, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
how sad soever it appears, I have yet sufficient cause to bless the
gods, which have given me life enough to deliver you from your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
your Brother from his imprisonment, and to see you once more,
to give you such an account of the honour of your Commands: And
possibly now there would remain no addition to these happinesses,
but that I left the World, lest the future actions of my life might
be inferiour to these, and consequently more unfit for you to receive,
or me to pay.</p>
               <p>The Actions you have perform'd (the Princess replyed) in a few
days, are so signal and eminent, that upon the glory of that stock you
may spend a longer life than your condition or courage will (I fear)
lend you; and though in the future you should never more oblige us,
what you have done already has left such deep impressions in me, that I
must lose my memory to lose the sense I have of them; your favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the like quality with Life, which needs not still be renewed; it's
first principle being so powerful, that it still carries it self on in the strength
and vigour thereof.</p>
               <p>Madam, I answered, by so telling me of what I have done, you tell
me what I should have done, had my power of serving you proportioned
my desire of it; and though you could flatter me into a belief, that you
are so good as to credit what you say; yet that Rule I have set up to my
self in serving you, does so far transcend all you have spoke, that whilest
I do any thing short of what may be done, and whilst I ever intermit
acting at that Rate, I am such a reproach unto my self, that my dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction
surpasses whatever you can imagine of it. At the end of these
words, <hi>Mithridates</hi> came hastily into the Chamber, with what did more
wound me than the young <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> Sword; 'twas with News that
the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> with a vast Fleet appeared before the Harbour, and
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:96335:311"/>had sent some of his Nobility to advertise him thereof, and to beg his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to land, that he might offer his Forces to him, and his service to
the Princess <hi>Statira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh Gods! continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> how great a torment this was you
only know, and I only did feel; 'twas such, that before I could be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
over my own motions, I sighed so loud, that the Princess not only
took notice of it, but had the goodness to enquire what had caus'd it:
I was a thousand times going to tell her the truth, and then in a Sea of
blood to have expiated the confidence of that discovery, as well as to
have avoided that indignation it could not but have raised in her; but
then the Majesty which shined in her eyes, which could not inspire me
with higher admiration, than it did with reverenc and respect, stifled those
thoughts even in their Birth, and rendred them guilty only in design, not
in act.</p>
               <p>But I was then as much troubled what to say, as I had been what not
to say; and finding no better expedient than to attribute it to the pain of
my wound, I made use of that, whereat she assumed so high a grief,
that I perswaded my self she could not then entertain any other
guest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> observing the visible sadness in the Princess's eyes and
looks, came towards her, and ask'd her, What could in such general cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of joy make her express so little of it? To which she replyed, Whilest
the recovery of her Brother's wounds was so uncertain, and mine so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerons,
the dictates of Nature and Gratitude would sufficiently apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize
for her sorrow.</p>
               <p>The King answered, there is so little fear for the one, and so much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the other, that I must not only desire but expect, that you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
your self of whatever may render you unlike that <hi>Statira,</hi> whose sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
has conquered the King of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princess made no reply, but by bowing her self seemed to say, she
had too long practis'd obedience, than to decline it.</p>
               <p>The King at least (I believe) placed that interpretation upon what
she had done, for he suddenly after went to the Port to receive his
designed Son-in-law, who made so magnifick a descent from his Fleet,
that all concluded he could not be less than a King, and a Lover.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the fair <hi>Statira</hi> continued alone in <hi>Atafernes</hi>
Chamber, her Sister after <hi>Mithridates</hi> was gone, returning to <hi>Monyma,</hi>
who otherwise had been left unaccompanied.</p>
               <p>That generous Prince who perfectly lov'd her, beginning then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that to be <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s (for so the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King was called) he must
de deprived of her, told her; Would to the Gods, <hi>Statira,</hi> you did
not consider duty above friendship, for then I might be certain to enjoy
your Company whilest I enjoy'd my life; but now a Fathers power will
give that happiness to a Stranger, which otherwise I should have pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd;
and that affection I have for you, must endure an absence which
cannot more bless him, than trouble me.</p>
               <p>These words he spoke so loud, that I not only heard them, but also that
she thus answer'd him; If it were lawful to break those Tyes the gods
have confined us unto, the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> should have been exempted
from giving both himself and me this trouble; but since the violating a
Divine Rule cannot bring a satisfaction so great, as the sin is, I shall
strive to evidence as little discontent in obeying <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as I am
certain I should have done if he had commanded me not to receive any
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:96335:312"/>addresses, which are to banish me from <hi>Atafernes,</hi> in whose affection and
company I find so high a contentment, that I am capable of begging no
higher than to be continued in it: Since, reply'd the Prince, you are
devoted to that obedience, ah that <hi>Callimachus</hi> were King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
I could then find some consolation in my loss, and without reluctancy
part with my best happiness, to him I esteemed best worthy of it:
Blush not <hi>Statira,</hi> at what I have spoke; for since I am unable any way
to evince my friendship in Actions, deny me not the priviledg of doing
it in wishes.</p>
               <p>This (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) was so strange and unexpected an
expression, and consequently had so universal an operation on me, that
my wound gush'd out a bleeding, and thereby so entirely conquer'd those
few spirits I had left, that casting open my arms, and fetching a deep groan,
I fell into a swound.</p>
               <p>The Princess was not so confounded at what her Brother had spoke,
but that she had heard my last manifestation of life; so that turning
her eyes towards me, she saw my condition, and therefore shriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, she went hastily into the Anti-chamber, and called in all
the servants which waited there, by whose help I was soon brought
to my self again, and the Chirurgeons which some ran for, having
bound up my wound, desired all persons to leave the room, lest I
might repeat the like sad accident: <hi>Statira,</hi> who possibly was glad
of such a pretence, civilly to decline her Brothers company, whilst
he was addicted to discourses of that nature, having first desired
me to take a special care of my self, which the more powerfully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
me to, she told me she should receive it as an obligation, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
withdrew, and left me to contend with difficulties too strong for
me, though I had not been reduced to a weakness, which for the many
causes I had to despair, I rather wish'd were greater, than less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atafernes,</hi> not to oppose the prescriptions the Chirurgeons had made,
continuing silent, thereby gave me the uninterrupted leave of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
my own thoughts, which were so confused, that for a while I
could not reduce them to any method: but as soon as I had in some degree
composed them, I began to consider, that Fortune continued her usual
practise, and by mingling felicities and torments, gave me still at once
cause to adore and hate her: The glories which the beginning of that
day had thrown upon me, and the miseries which the conclusion of it had
involved me in, appear'd so admirable, that though I enjoyed those, and
felt these, yet I could hardly believe either: but when I began to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that all my Victories made but an easier way for my Rival to possess
<hi>Statira;</hi> that the nearer I had acted to deserve her, made my deprivation
of her the more sensible; and when that by a miracle her generous
Brother had let fall expressions whereby without a crime I might in
some measure have disclos'd what her thoughts were towards me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she had pass'd any engagement to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> or have found so much
cause of despair, as I might no longer have flattered my self into a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
more unsupportable than the highest effect of it; then to fall into
a fainting which had hinder'd it; I could no longer contain my self, but
by loud exclaimings, condemn'd that Fate which I wanted power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
or alter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atafernes</hi> finding thereby that his silence was so far from contributing
to my good, that he apprehended it had done the contrary, soon broke
it, and after some introductory discoursers, having first commanded all
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:96335:312"/>those which in the outward Chamber might have been within hearing,
to keep at a greater distance; told me, That friendship, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> which
we have contracted, merits we should have nothing in reserve to each
other; and if it does not confine you to tell me all the secrets you know,
yet at least it does to acquaint me with the truth of those I shall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
In a word, either my observations have strangely deluded me; or
you have something in your breast, which though I may be concern'd in,
yet I am kept a Stranger unto; and though possibly I might hitherto have
had but cause to suspect it, yet what these few hours has produced,
makes me confident of it; so that if any thing can perswade me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
your so long silence, it will be your persevering in it no longer.</p>
               <p>You cannot but imagine (generous Princes) that what <hi>Atafernes</hi> then
spoke, made me repeat as high Emotions as any that day I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
with; for I found my self necessitated either to deny the truth,
and thereby become guilty to my Friend; or reveal it, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
guilty to my Princess: but at length, finding to adore her could not
be a greater duty, than to conceal any thing from her Noble Brother, and
be a crime; especially, he then extorting a confession from me by the
powerfullest Rack, the conjuration of a Friend, blushing and trembling
all-over, and fetching a deep sigh, I spoke to him to this effect: If,
generous Prince, I have concealed any thing from you, it is that only
which I thought unfit I my self should know; and I was too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to continue the blessing of your esteem, to acquaint you with
what might too justly invite you to deprive me of it: but since what I
am to say is a pure effect of my obedience to your command, I do with
less trouble lay my Secret before you, knowing you are too vertuous to
require a discovery, and then abhor me for making it.</p>
               <p>Here I paus'd a little, being startled at what I was about to say; but
finding I had said so much, that not to speak more might be as ill resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if I spoke all, I thus continued; I must confess, great Prince, I
must confess the beauties of your admirable Sister gave me the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of lifting up my eyes towards her, or rather denyed me the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of doing otherwise; and ever since I first beheld her, I have lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
away in flames which only her eyes are able to kindle, and which
death only is able to quench; 'tis therefore that long since I had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
that cure, had I not thought I was obliged as much to be just to
her, in punishing my sin, as I had been to her beauties, in committing it;
and therefore not to put a period to my torments was too much a duty,
to let the ease of ending it perswade me to so criminal an Act: this, great
Prince, hath hitherto kept me from laying violent hands upon my self,
and perhaps I might not lye if I assur'd you, I have had as high a dispute,
not to embrace that remedy, as I have had to avoid that presumption
which will render it necessary.</p>
               <p>This is that concealment I have so long labour'd under: and if now
I have discover'd it, permit me to say it springs from a friendship as great
as my passion; and nothing inferior unto that, could have made me
discover this.</p>
               <p>Now you know my miserable condition, be not, I beseech you, so cruel
as to deny me your pity, if you do your pardon.</p>
               <p>After I had done speaking, <hi>Atafernes</hi> was some time before he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
me: but at last he thus spoke; If I have been so long silent, 'tis
not that I am surpriz'd with what you have now said; for I consider it
rather as a confirmation of what I formerly thought, than a disclosure of
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:96335:313"/>what I was ignorant of, but yet I see so infinite a distance between what
you aim at, and what possibly I wish you may possess, that I do not
only believe your unhappiness is great, but also I highly sympathize with
you in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Statira</hi>'s disposition, <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s authority and engagement, <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s
passion and presence, joyned with the ignorance of your extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are difficulties so insuperable, that to assure you of all my assistance,
is to promise you at once whatever I am capable of, and yet nothing:
But yet not to leave any thing unessay'd, and to let you see I am your
Friend in impossibilities, as well as in things of hope, I will not only let
her know your passion, but employ all my interest in her, to make her
approve and accept it.</p>
               <p>I will tell her, That the Sword which has captivated Kings, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her with Kingdoms: that vertue is preferable to power; and that
being more a friend to her Happiness, than her Titles, I will conjure her
to elect <hi>Callimachus</hi> without a Crown, sooner than <hi>Ascanius</hi> with one.</p>
               <p>This, dear <hi>Callimachus,</hi> is all I can do, and this therefore is the least I
will do; wherein if the success answers not my endeavours, be confident
I shall resent as vast a trouble thereat, as you your self can, and where my
power cannot serve you, my friendship shall suffer with you.</p>
               <p>Generous Prince (I reply'd, bowing my self as low as my wounds
would admit) you have already manifested so much obligingness and
condescention to me, that I find my scores of gratitude are as unpayable
to the brother, as those of adoration are to the Sister: you have done so
much in the best extream, that nothing but my acceptance thereof could
make me do the like in the worst. But, Sir, I have not told you my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to invite your assistance, but to illustrate my obedience; and if I
expect your favour in any thing, 'tis in your pardon, not your solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which latter yet I cannot more want, than I desire the former. No,
Sir, though my Star's have destin'd me to a passion for the Princess with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope, yet it is not without satisfaction; and what I should not pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
undergo as their imposition, I shall as her due.</p>
               <p>Possibly (said <hi>Atafernes,</hi> interrupting me) You cannot think this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
fitter for you, than I do, that acting the contrary is so for me; and
therefore as I do not quarrel with you for making such desires, so I
shall expect you will not be offended with me, if I grant them not: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
owes her unto you, and she owes her self unto you; and though
you have not a Kingdom to give her, yet this day you have given her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one, and preserved him another, whereby you have made his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
such, that he need not find that a want in you.</p>
               <p>Doubtless he would have given you <hi>Statira</hi> this Morning to have been
certain of what you have placed him in this Evening; therefore why
should you despair he would buy success at a higher Rate than he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it? for my Fathers promises to the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> they were made
but to engage him to undertake that which you have performed without
him, and thereby not only removed the invitation to that performance,
but secured <hi>Mithridates</hi> against the <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s resentment at it, should he
have any: besides, our new Lover may be perswaded to lay aside that
Title by <hi>Statira</hi>'s appearing averse unto it, which if the King once give
her a Rise to do, let it be my care to improve it to that height your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
will need, and my friendship will therefore undeniably endeavour:
it is not a new thing for a Lover to fail of his Mistress's affection, nor for
a Father in that case to decline making his Daughter miserable, to prevent
a strangers becoming so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="699" facs="tcp:96335:313"/>He will more secure his Empire, and probably enlarge it in tying you
by his alliance to his service, than by giving his Daughter to any Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Prince; the doing the like is an action so common, that it seldom
produces an effect which is extraordinary; but the bestowing of <hi>Statira</hi>
upon <hi>Callimachus,</hi> will not appear more rare to the World, than 'twill
prove advantageous to him; for what returns may not be expected, when
the largest cause of gratitude is placed upon a person the most replenish'd
with it; and to whom the gods have given so much vertue and courage,
that thereby his power of being thankful, will equal his will!</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Statira,</hi> I strangely mistake, if she will not prefer him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
a Crown, before him that only wears one; and when I shall acquaint
her with your passion for her, and my friendship for you, possibly if the
one does not move, the other may; and the just ascendent she hath over
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> may prevail with him to free her from <hi>Ascanius;</hi> and your
repeated services may in time force him to believe no Reward under her
deserves that Name; so that when it comes in competition, whether he
must do nothing, or so much, he will rather elect This, than that.</p>
               <p>Ah Sir, I reply'd, Do not, I beseech you, so much as mention acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fair <hi>Statira</hi> with my flame: I am scarce able to undergo my own
knowledg of it, and therefore shall never be able to support hers: your
pardoning my Crime is so much above my desert; and your offering
to attempt to reward it, is so much above my hope, that I cannot be that
greateful person you were pleased to speak me, if I did not hinder your
undertaking a design which must lose you, your Father and your Sister,
and that too upon my account: No, generous Prince, let not my
passion make any other unhappy, nor give me so low an opinion of my
offence, as to find by such an experiment, as great a misery as it self can
befall me by it.</p>
               <p>My afflictions will either be supportable, and then they will not need
your care; or unsupportable, and then my death will render me uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it.</p>
               <p>Do not, I beg you, believe I do this out of a modesty which none could
want that had so many pregnant causes to raise it; but out of conviction
that I am tied in duty, when she knows I have done her the highest injury
out of my power, to do her also the highest Right is in my power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her; to dare to have said I love her, is That; and to dare to kill my
self afterwards, is this; so that if you would not have me punish my self,
now I have accused my self, let that be a secret to you, which shall be one
besides to all the World.</p>
               <p>Many such implorings, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I was forced to make,
and many such reasons to present to his consideration, before I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
that promise from him which I had so passionately desired; which
soon after I had obtained, a Gentleman came to tell us the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King
was entred the Palace, and was gone to wait upon the Queen and the
Princesses; and not long after <hi>Mithridates</hi> accompanied with <hi>Ascanius,</hi>
came to visit <hi>Atafernes.</hi> Gods! What agitations was I exercised under,
when I not only saw my Rival come into the Chamber, but found him a
person of an admirable good Meen, and of a fashion not inferiour: I must
acknowledg I was so mean, as then to hope I might discover in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
what might have secur'd those fears his outside had raised in me;
but it was but just I should be defeated of so low and unworthy a
hope, and so I was; for I found in what he spoke to the Prince, he was
as much beholding to Nature, and Education, for the gifts of his
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:96335:314"/>mind, as he had been to either, for those of his Body.</p>
               <p>After his civilities were performed to <hi>Ataphernes,</hi> the King told
him; This room, Sir, contains a person worthy your knowledg, and
by whose courage and success you have enjoy'd so peaceable an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
here.</p>
               <p>The merits of <hi>Callimachus</hi> (said <hi>Ascanius</hi>) are so well known to me
though his person be not, that though the motives be very high which
make me desire his friendship, yet they cannot exceed the passion I have
to acquire, or merit it. After these words, he saluted me with so much
obligingness, and with so good grace, that in spight of all the causes I
had to abhor him, I could not abstain from giving him a Reply, that
relish'd of that civility which had acted over my resentments such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
               <p>After many discourses of an usual quality, <hi>Mithridates</hi> took a Rise to
inform him by retail, of all those transactions which had hapned so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
within and near <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and did it with such elogies in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that <hi>Ascanius</hi> cryed out; Happy <hi>Callimachus!</hi> that not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the highest things, but acted them for and before the persons most
worthy of them: would to the gods I had by all my blood purchas'd
that glory, which has cost you but a part of yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who found by this ardent ejaculation, that the subject
of his discourse had rather rais'd <hi>Ascanius</hi> envy, than satisfaction, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
disintangled himself out of what he had so far engaged in, and then
conducted him to his apartment, where all things relish'd of the highest
Luxury <hi>Asia</hi> was never guilty of, or the profusest Actor of it, ever
practis'd.</p>
               <p>He was not long gone, when the Queen (then recovered of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition)
with the two Princesses came to visit <hi>Atafernes,</hi> who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
enquiring how he made his first addresses, received an assurance
from both those which were least concerned in it, that never man had in
such an occasion, acquitted himself with so much gallantry: His humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>Statira</hi> was at once full of deep respect, and of Majesty; as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he would shew, to be a King, and her Slave, were not inconsistent,
but rather that this Title did help to heighten that; his looks had in
them at once so much passion mingled with reverence, that either seem'd
to be as uncapable of addition, as change; and his discourse and
entertianment had peculiar charms: so that in effect there were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any of the senses which found not in him, sufficient to captivate
them.</p>
               <p>These, and many other expressions as wounding to me, fell from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma</hi>
and <hi>Roxana,</hi> which the obliging <hi>Atafernes</hi> easily guest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made the more haste to put a period to them; which when he had
done, the Queen leaving her two Companions with their Brother, came
to me, and observing they were probably engaged in a discourse with
him, which might not suddenly interrupt hers with me, she began it in
these words: If at your return with so much glory, I did not come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
it with you, I may truly say, you are the cause thereof: for
when I saw the bloody rate of your purchase, a sudden horrour so invaded
me, that till now I could not free my self from so many of its effects, as to
be able to visit you, and to let you know why I did not so, sooner.</p>
               <p>Madam, I reply'd, that little blood I have spent in your service, is
too prodigally pay'd, by what you now are pleased to act, and speak;
and had I known my wounds had so sensibly touched you, they
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:96335:314"/>would have been more painful to me upon that account than their
own.</p>
               <p>I should (she answer'd blushing) have believed those words, had
they been spoken to me at <hi>Miletus,</hi> or were I a person not far from
hence, who though I must confess merits them better, yet perhaps would
not receive them with that satisfaction I should, if I thought them not
words of Civility, rather than Truth.</p>
               <p>Madam, I replyed, (being somewhat moved to be still struck by her
in so sensible a place, and, if possibly, to make her think she was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook)
permit me to say, that had you never given me cause any more to
doubt your words, than I have given you to doubt mine; you had been
free from the trouble of such discourses, and I from the unhappiness of
your believing I deserved them.</p>
               <p>Alas <hi>Callimachus</hi> (said she, interrupting me) why do you delight so
much to torment me, as not only to mind me of my unhappiness but to
acquaint me you think I was the Author of it: No, I attest the gods, I
would now, even with joy descend from the Throne, to be that to you,
which I am to <hi>Mithridates;</hi> and rather be his who deserves the greatest
Empire of the World, than his who possesses it: but (she continued,
letting some few tears steal from her eyes) since the gods have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
designed it, I beg but this, That you will esteem it a punishment
sufficient for me to have lost you, and do not augment it so much as to let
me see another has got you; this is all the unfortunate <hi>Monyma</hi> desires;
and if there be any unreasonableness therein, ascribe it to a passion
which makes me act more illegitimate things for you, than I ask of
you.</p>
               <p>She went away at the end of these words without staying for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
and telling the company a relapse of her indisposition was going
to assault her, she hastily retir'd to her apartment; and not long after
the hour of rest being come, <hi>Atafernes</hi> enjoyning me to try if I could
take any, and endeavouring the like himself, thereby gave me a licence
to reflect upon some things past, which so powerfully entertained my
thoughts, that I could not for some time so much suppress them, as
by sleep to enjoy that refreshment my mind and my body but too much
wanted.</p>
               <p>These last words of the Queen, I soon concluded, sprang from a passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which would not be easily quenched, and which had a being would
so much interrupt any progress in that I pay'd the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> that it
self would have been a sufficient impediment, had I conquer'd the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of many greater.</p>
               <p>I was too proud at my insensibility, when I saw a Queen weeping before
me, and one so full of youth, and beauty, that she could not be a greater
wonder for her Charms, than I was in resisting them.</p>
               <p>I must confess I was a little grieved, that so signal an evincement of
my constancy should not be known to her who was the cause of it; but
then when I consider'd that the misfortune could not be greater, than
consequently the merit of it was, I concluded she deserved all I could
suffer, and therefore I had more cause to rejoyce I had done so much, than
to be troubled that she knew no more.</p>
               <p>Whilest I entertain'd these parts of my fate, it was only with sorrow:
but when I thought upon those parts which related to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> how he
was come to rob me of my hopes, which was all I had left, or indeed
ever had, and how a few days would invest him in that felicity I was to
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:96335:315"/>lose, Rage and Resentment so entirely govern'd all my faculties, that if I
did not follow the extreamest dictates of them, 'twas only because I
thought them too low and disproportionate to their cause.</p>
               <p>At last, not having strength enough to persevere in such entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
sleep by degrees began to conquer me, and held me a Prisoner for
some few hours, which yet it could not have so long done, but by letting
Dreams continue what my waking had begun; whereby, and by the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the precedent day, the next Morning I found my wound was so
inflamed, and my Body so feaverish, that the Chirurgeons doubted of my
Life, and informed <hi>Atafernes</hi> so much; who easily imagining the cause,
having freed the Room of all which waited in it, told me so many flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
things, and then so reiterately vowed if I mended not, he would
tell <hi>Statira</hi> what caused my languishments, that partly through hope,
but much more for fear of that, I began patiently to receive those Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
which the Physicians &amp; the Chirurgeons prescrib'd, whereby in few
days I was past all danger of Death, as I wish'd I had been of Life. I
knew not with what design I liv'd; and yet I could not oppose my doing
so, carried on by an internal motion, whose cause I was as ignorant of, as
unable to resist its effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> every day she visited her Brother, had so much humility
as to enquire of me of my own health, and as my answers were of its
impairing or mending, so her looks put on melancholy or satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atafernes</hi> was so generous as constantly to enquire of the Princess what
progress <hi>Ascanius</hi> had made in the acquisition of her esteem, yet could
never learn any thing from her, but that her duty to <hi>Mithridates</hi> had left
her nothing but obedience.</p>
               <p>This strange perseverance and submissiveness that generous Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me with, and thereby prepared me to receive a stroak, which
soon after wounded me; but alas! not enough to relieve my pain, but
increase and continue it.</p>
               <p>'Twas with the fatal News, that at the expiration of fourteen days <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
had publickly declared the Nuptials between <hi>Statira</hi> and <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
should be celebrated; who thereupon sent half of his Fleet into the
<hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, to conquer what that Element had saved of <hi>Nicomedes, Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
and <hi>Murena</hi>'s ruins: The revolt of <hi>Archilaus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus</hi>
having depriv'd the <hi>Pontick</hi> King of most of his Naval-forces, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
Son-in-law's being so strong, that he rather thought that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the largest, than the least; reserving also the residue to carry back
his Queen with more pomp into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which happy Countrey had been
once destin'd to the Queen of Love, and now to a Beauty which more
justly merited that Title.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Pharnaces</hi> returned with his Army, more troubled
that his Father had by <hi>Atafernes</hi> received his deliverance, than if he had
entirely failed of it: and if he had any thoughts which refresh'd him, they
were only those which did rise from the speedy probability of <hi>Statira</hi>'s
removal, and consequently of his Brother's being thereby deprived of
his powerfullest Friend; and therefore he so incessantly prest the speedy
celebration of the Nuptials, that thereby he gained as high an interest in
<hi>Ascanius,</hi> as a performance so acceptable to an impatient Lover could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
procure.</p>
               <p>At last the Eve of the long'd-for day arrived, and now nothing was
seen but preparatives for celebrating of it, which was to produce the
highest extreams in the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King and me. The Armies had received
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:96335:315"/>orders to express their Military joys in all those ways which could give
the highest evidence of them; the Streets were already beautified with
triumphal Arches; The Courtiers did all strive who should out-shine
each other; The Priests had prepared herds of Sacrifices; And in a
word, all things had put on their chearfullest looks, but <hi>Statira, Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes,</hi>
and I; the first continuing that same equal temper which had been
so long her practice, that I fear'd it was turn'd her Nature; the second
sympathizing in his Friends sorrows, wore them so visibly, that they were
at once both my comfort and my trouble; the third you may too too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
imagine had such infinite causes of grief, that their effects were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate.</p>
               <p>Had it been the hour of my Death which was come so near me as the
hour of losing <hi>Statira,</hi> I should have consider'd it with much less
trouble.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I resolv'd to go and tell her I ador'd her with a passion
which could much rather make me elect the Grave, than to see her <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi>'s;
and though I was able to live and not possess her, yet I was
unable to live and see another do it, and then act that truth as well as
speak it; sometimes I resolved to let the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King know how abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impossible it was for him to enjoy <hi>Statira,</hi> and I my life, and
therefore that he must deprive me of This to possess That, and thereby
either avoid being sensible of my loss, or hinder him from acting it: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
too I thought of going to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> of laying my Services be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; and of acquainting him <hi>Ascanius</hi> had never acted, but what all
men living would, adored the highest Beauty, and desired to enjoy her;
that my Sword had put him past the needing such a Friend, or at least the
buying him at such a Rate; that if he would make her the blessing of my
Services, I would engage to carry his Ensigns where the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles
yet could never flye, and seat her in a Throne as little unworthy of her,
as the Earth could produce; that as soon as <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s Beauty was as
well known to the World as to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> all the Kings of it would do
more for hope of that Reward than <hi>Ascanius</hi> could do for possessing it:
sometimes too I was determin'd to present my self to those Forces to
whom I had so often shewed the way to Victory, and by disclosing my
despair, have provoked their Swords to have cured it.</p>
               <p>These and many as extravagant thoughts were the productions of my
distemper, which when a little consideration had let me see they were, I
cast them off as such.</p>
               <p>But though my Reason shew'd me what I was not to do, yet it could
not what I was to do; so that when the Night came, the last Night of all
my hopes, I was as unresolv'd what to do, as I was certain, doing nothing,
what I was to suffer.</p>
               <p>I had some little glimpse of comfort, to feel I was not able to go to
the Temple, and be a looker on, lest thereby I might have been snatch'd
from my self, and forced into a Revenge, which I had so long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to reason (at least perswade) my self out of; but this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a hindering of me from doing ill, and not any thing of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in my doing well, I had as little time to reflect upon it, as I have
spent in telling it.</p>
               <p>The generous <hi>Atafernes</hi> did scarce abandon me one moment, knowing
my condition needed all the consolation, though it was above all service
of a Friend. The Night was not an hour old, when <hi>Ascanius</hi> leading in
<hi>Statira,</hi> came into <hi>Atasernes</hi> Chamber, which bare sight had near over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:96335:316"/>thrown all the sober thoughts of the preceding day, but they stay'd not
long, <hi>Mithridates</hi> carrying them away to see some fires of joy the <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
had made to grace the Eve of the intended Marriage: some two
hours after, <hi>Atafernes</hi> and I, having disengag'd our selves from our many
Visitors, went to try if we could walk in a Gallery contiguous to his
Bed-chamber; where we had not long been, when <hi>Statira</hi> and <hi>Roxana</hi>
came into it to visit their Brother, having miss'd him in his Chamber.</p>
               <p>That obliging Prince so dexterously managed the business, that heg ot
his elder Sister to him at one end of the Gallery, and lest me with my
Princess at the other.</p>
               <p>I thought this was an opportunity not to be lost, and yet could
not imagine how it might be improved, but to begin a Descourse which
might give me the opportunity to say something, if by a Miracle I should
find a Rise for my so doing: I told her, You are now (Madam) going to
place <hi>Ascanius</hi> in a felicity so great, that if thereby you could place your
self in a resembling one, you would not leave your Servants any thing to
wish, or your self to desire.</p>
               <p>I know not (she replyed) whether my satisfaction will be great, I
am certain my obedience is: but acting what lyes on my part, I shall have
this comfort, that if the end answers not my expectation, I may condemn
my Fate, but not my self.</p>
               <p>Ah Madam! I answer'd, Permit me to believe you go upon a clearer
Principle than you mention; for else what comfort can it be to you, if <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi>
should not still be as much your Servant &amp; Adorer, as he is now to
know your misfortune is an effect of your vertue; and that your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which you so highly magnifie, should make you more miserable than
the declining of it could possibly have done? No, Madam, I cannot but
believe, if it were fit for me to beg a knowledg of the Truth, or that
you should condescend so low as to speak it, but that the Charms of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi>'s
Person and Conversation contribute as much to his happiness, as
your obedience to <hi>Mithridates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You make me blush (the Princess reply'd, passing her hand before her
Face); but yet if you are not seemingly but really concern'd in what you
say, I will satisfie your doubts.</p>
               <p>Concern'd Madam! I hastily answer'd; Yes Madam, I am concern'd,
and shall be whilst I live, in all things relating to you; and therefore, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
permit me to beg of you a certainty of that upon which I must
ground all my felicity or trouble, because by it I must judg of yours.</p>
               <p>Then, said <hi>Statira,</hi> I do assure you it, as a real Truth, that nothing
renders <hi>Ascanius</hi> more acceptable to me, than <hi>Mithridates</hi> Commands,
and possibly I should not lye if I said nothing else; but then I tell you
as great a truth when I say, That that it self is more powerful with me
than any thing which can flow from my own inclinations; for I know by
observing those I may err, but by observing that I cannot.</p>
               <p>For as to what you mention'd, that it would add unto my trouble to
consider that my Vertue occasion'd it; I answer, it would much more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
me to avoid an evil by an evil, than to endure an evil for having
done what was good: for the event is only in the power of the gods, but
the performance of Duty is in my own.</p>
               <p>Never, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> never did any words at once so much
cure and so much wound as these; and never was any confidence higher
rewarded and higer punished, than mine, which asking such a question,
received such an answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="705" facs="tcp:96335:316"/>But, not to appear too much surprised at what she had last said, I reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I have heard, Fortune delights to make some men perfectly happy,
and some as perfectly miserable; which last I have, and do experiment,
and the first you have now justified in <hi>Ascanius:</hi> for nothing could cloud
his felicity, but to know, your obedience only does invest him in it, and
that he is as unlikely to know, as not knowing it he is unlikely to think
any happiness is equal to his; or indeed if he knew it, it might still leave
him in that condition: for what you say would not be highly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
when what you do is so infinitely so: Nor, Madam, will I presume to
argue in the furture against your obedience, since I feel you are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
fix'd upon it, and so far engaged in it, that though I might
convince your Reason, I should not be able to change your Resolution;
Pardon me, Madam, if I have made use of an expression, which had been
too arrogant had I spoke it upon my own score; and may be pardonable
from so great a goodness as yours, it being spoken on your generous Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
who will not only by your Marriage be deprived of his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
supporter, even when <hi>Pharnaces</hi>'s anger will most need your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
such; but also tear you from him, whom he as certainly values
above all things, as you merit to be so; And if, Madam, after what I have
said, I may be permitted to mention any thing so low and inconsiderable
as my own contentment, excuse me if I say, After you are Queen of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
I shall never expect to see any: the sadness that Title will involve your
Noble Brother in, were there no other consideration, will strike me with
a grief I should much rather elect to dye by, than to live under.</p>
               <p>This, generous Princes, (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) was all I did say, and
indeed all I durst; and I had more reason to think I had spoke too much
than too little, when I heard her thus answer; Would to the gods, <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
I had miss'd this last discourse with you, for it hath left so deep
an impression in me, that I can hardly hope it will ever be defaced.</p>
               <p>I confess I tremble when I think upon <hi>Pharnaces</hi> humour, and how
naked <hi>Atafernes</hi> will be left when I am removed at a distance, unable
to do him those Services my interest in my Father gave me hitherto
power to pay him. I cannot too, without horror, reflect upon my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
separation from that poor Prince, in whose Society and friendship I
have enjoy'd a happiness I must despair of finding in all things else: I
must also confess, I resent no little trouble at my being to be banished
from <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who has placed on me so many indelible Obligations,
and in whom without flattery I have found such eminent and singular
worth, that I know nothing he could wish that I do not wish him: nay,
I attest the gods, had they made me the Distributor of their Rewards, I
would joyfully have placed him in whatever he ambitions, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reservation: This, generous <hi>Callimachus,</hi> is all my unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
makes me able to do for you, and therefore I hope will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of by you,</p>
               <p>Madam, I replyed, prostrating my self at her Feet (which I the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
did, because I saw <hi>Roxana</hi> and <hi>Atafernes</hi> had their Backs towards
us, and were looking out of a Window) what you are, and what you
say, makes me attest the self-same gods as my Witnesses, That had I by
Birth or Virtue possessed all the Empires of the World, I would have
lay'd all them and my self at your Feet; and have more gloried in doing
that, than in commanding them: But since the gods have concealed from
me my Birth, and given me only a Sword to raise my self with, whereby
I am unable to act any thing worth your acceptance, permit me at least
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:96335:317"/>to say, what my performances should have said for me; that never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was there any passion like to that I have for your Service, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any life could be so nobly employ'd, and ended as I should think
mine would be were it to be spent, and were I to dye therin; nor would
I ever desire a higher recompence for doing so, than I should receive in
doing so: Possibly, Madam, studying too much for what I should say, I
mind not well what I say, and therein may have offended; by which you
may in some measure judg what an unfortunate person I am, that even
for those expressions by which I would deserve your favour, I must abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
need it.</p>
               <p>But (Madam) will you pardon me, if I am forced to ask you if you
do not think there is as just a debt due to a Friend that is also a Brother,
as to a Father? and whether you have endeavoured all you can to pay
that, before you engage your self so positively to pay this. I know (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
I could scarce be guilty of this confidence, nor were it indeed
pardonable, but upon the score of the Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> whose content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you have so often recommended to my care, that I had rather trouble
you in obeying that command, than avoid doing it by so criminal a silence.</p>
               <p>The fair <hi>Statira</hi> having first commanded and made me to rise: told me,
Your care for my Brother which I have so often recommended to you, is
so much my desire, and has been so much my satisfaction, that I cannot
condemn any production of it, though this does both violate what you
even now promised, and encreases a grief which is of it self already but
too unsupportable; and therefore I will not scruple to assure you, that
in the sense of my being to be banished from <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>afernes,</hi> I have been
so importunate with <hi>Mithridates</hi> to free me from <hi>Ascanius</hi> addresses,
that you cannot think me so religious a worshipper of Obedience, as I
fear he does the contrary.</p>
               <p>Let this truth therefore which I have now spoke, and which I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
never to speak again, or ever thought to disclose, be sufficient to
absolve me in your judgment; and hence forwards do not condemn, but
pity an unfortunate person, who having tryed all just ways to avoid being
so, has at last elected to submit to a Fate, which she cannot decline, but
by what would render her too worthy of it.</p>
               <p>Here (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) that admirable Equality which this fair
Princess had so unintermissively practised, was overcome by some tears
which the end of her Discourse drew from her, which suddenly after
being asham'd of, and to let me fee hers had rather been surprised than
conquered, drying up her fair eyes, and putting on her usual looks
she told me: I know not, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> what influence you have ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
me, but you have made me do and say more than I thought even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>nes</hi> himself could.</p>
               <p>And since you have so far pierced into my secrets, allow me a little
to enquire after yours, and tell me what Discourse you could have with
the Queen, which could send her so hastily, and in such disorders from
you? for if I be not much deceived, her Eyes were full of Tears, and her
Face of sadness, when she retired.</p>
               <p>Ah, Madam, I replyed, After what you have told me, do not think I am
capable of doing any thing but of lamenting your condition, and of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
you my Sword and Life to redress it.</p>
               <p>The gods forbid (she hastily answer'd) you should have so criminal
a thought: No, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I tell you positively, if ever you should again
mention such a thing to me, much more endeavour it, you would cast me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:96335:317"/>
greater miseries than you would free me from, and convert that high
friendship I have for you, into a proportionate hate.</p>
               <p>Before the Princess had fully ended these words, <hi>Pharnaces</hi> came into
the Gallery, and thereby put a period to an entertainment which had
darkly given me some small satisfaction, and had clearly discovered, that
was all I was to expect.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Princesses and <hi>Pharnaces</hi> were gone, I gave <hi>Atafernes</hi>
a million of acknowledgments for that opportunity I had derived from
his favour, and an account how I had employ'd it.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you with a relation of those generous offers he made
me of acting himself what <hi>Statira</hi>'s commands had bound me from; nor
of those reasons and prayers I made use of to divert him from it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I tell you how I entertained my self that fatal night, during
which I slept as little as I do now; being too sensibly afflicted with the
considerations, that it should be the last of my hopes; and that my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
was denied the common consolation of having it build the felicity
of my Mistris, who in one performance was to make her self and me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
Nor indeed can I tell you all those confused thoughts my Love
and Despair dictated to me, which left me not till the day appeared,
and that the hurry and noise of the preparatives for the Nuptials, made
me to begin to feel I was to provide to endure an unhappiness I was not
able to prevent.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Callimachus</hi> observing the heat of the Sun began to be too offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and by this time being come to the River <hi>Cyris</hi> (which not many
furlongs off, continuing still navigable, falls into the <hi>Euphrates</hi>) the banks
whereof were shaded with divers Trees which might afford an obliging
shelter against that Enemy they endeavour'd to avoid, desired <hi>Artabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> to take the benefit of that natural defence, whilst his
Servants would prepare an Entertainment as good as the place would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
               <p>Our two Heroes had been so pleas'd with his Relation, that (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less)
had they not had more care of him, than of themselves, they would
have declin'd accepting of such a proffer, especially in such a part of his
History; but the Laws of Respect being more prevalent than those of their
curiosity, they left the high-way, and took a path which led them to a
tust of Trees which had many neighbours of the like bigness and
growth; but when they came thither, they saw an Horse tied unto an
Oak, at the foot whereof the Master of him lay: His Armour was all
black, without any thing in it which might give the least rise to judg the
cause of his sadness; and his face was turned to the ground, whereby
they were disenabled from the hopes of discovering who he was by a
fight thereof.</p>
               <p>The noise which they made when they came near him, did not alter
the posture he was in; whereby they concluded a deep sleep, or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
sorrow had seized upon him; and therefore they withdrew
to another shady place not far from thence: but before they had well
seated themselves in it, they discovered a Boat ascended the River by
force of Oars, which soon after came to the Shore on the same side they
were of, out of which there landed a young Gentleman of an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Meen; and soon after there descended out of the same Boat by his
help, two Ladies, which though vail'd, had yet in their stature and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
so admirable a grace, and so like unto <hi>Parthenissa</hi>'s and <hi>Altizera</hi>'s,
that had not <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> esteem'd it as great a crime to
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:96335:318"/>
have thought any therein could have resembled their Princesses, as an
impossibility that these could be them, they must have judged against
their eyes, or have concluded the first of them had seen a miracle, and
the last what he would as much have priz'd.</p>
               <p>These two excelent persons being landed, there came out of the Boat
after them only three Women, and as many Men, who all together took
the way to neighbour-Village, to go to which they were unavoidably
to pass not far from the Thicket where <hi>Callimachus</hi> and his generous
Friends were; who observing it, took as conceal'd places, and as near
the way as they could. Soon after the Strangers coming thither, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they needed the shade they were in, that lovely young man which
led them, advised their continuance there, whilst he sent one of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
before to prepare an accommodation for them in the Village, or
to carry them to the Vestal Nuns at the Temple.</p>
               <p>This motion being assented unto by all, and a servant employ'd about
it; he that made it, having first sent away all the rest at a good distance,
embracing and kissing the two Beauties which were with him, told them;
This recompence of my services which I now take, you will both confess
is not above their merit: for now I have brought you within a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
of the place to which I undertook to conduct you, where I hope
the gods will soon give you cause to believe they will henceforth reward
that Constancy they have so long permitted men to persecute; and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
the mercy of preserving us in so long a journey, is but an earnest of
a greater.</p>
               <p>I confess (one of the two repli'd) this last smile of Fortune is more
than we have been acquainted with this long while, and might therefore
invite us to believe she has a mind to be reconciled: but I have found
her so treacherous, that whilst she can be my Enemy, I must fear she will.
You know too we are not yet safe; neither do I know, till I hear of my
generous Friend, whether my condition will require being so: possibly
what he may have heard already, has occasion'd him to do that which
may invite me to believe, what I have been freed from, may be that which
I may wish had not been, and which I may have cause to elect again.</p>
               <p>Ah, Madam, the other repli'd, how preferable is your condition to
mine! you but fear that loss which I have already suffer'd. 'Tis true
(said she that had first spoken), but then you are to consider, though the
generous Prince you have lost, possessed your affection, yet there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Prince living, who deserves it, and who you have confess'd had a
juster title to it than he which by death has now lost it. You are (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)
a felicity great enough for two, and therefore the gods have destin'd
you to reward those two which have best merited it.</p>
               <p>Oh gods! Madam, the other repli'd, Be pleased not to wound me afresh
with such remembrances, mine being a grief, which if it be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
will be better so, by time, than by discourse.</p>
               <p>I know not, said the young Gentleman, what others may do hereafter,
but for the present I pretend so great an interest in you both, and you dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give me such evincements of it, that if either of your former Lovers
should chance to see it, they would conclude me more happy than they
could expect to be; and think I had took too large a possession, to be cast
out of it, or possibly that 'twere vvorth their pain to do it: But since
your discourses rob you of your quiet, and that sleep may restore you to
it, I vvould move you till the return of your Servant, to endeavour to
take all this place vvill afford you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="709" facs="tcp:96335:318"/>
This motion being relished by both, he took off a loose garment he
had on, and spreading it upon the ground, the two Ladies and he laid
themselves upon it, and having all of them embraced each other, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in that posture to find a repose which the distemper of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but much more those of their minds did render so necessary.</p>
               <p>All the while these lovely Strangers were thus discoursing, and thus
doing, <hi>Artabbanes</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> were in transports higher than till then
they had ever been acquainted with: for though many things in those two
Ladies resembled <hi>Parthenissa</hi> and <hi>Altezeera,</hi> yet their voices did it in
such perfection, that our Heroes were often going openly to have resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their doubts, and had certainly done so, if their immodest kisses and
embraces had not assured them of thelr mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artabbanes</hi> could much sooner believe his Princess was revived, than
that she should be unchast; and <hi>Artavasdes,</hi> as perfect a Lover as he was,
could easilier believe that another might be like <hi>Altezeera,</hi> than that she
could do things so unlike her self: so that whatever hopes or thoughts
their ears and sight had given them, were destroyed by the actions of
those two fair Strangers.</p>
               <p>A thousand times they ran over all the words they had spoke; and
though they found therein something which might have come from their
two Princesses, had the one been living, and the other in that place; yet
other parts of it had so little connection with those, that the repetitions
they made, served rather to encrease their wonder, than resolve their
doubts; sometimes also they believed it a delusion of the Devil's, who
conspiring with Fortune, endeavoured in this last essay to conquer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancies
which till then they could never but assault: They were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
too about to try if they could see their Faces plainly, which during
their discourse they had but imperfect glimpses of. But those resolutions
soon vanished: for to think those could be <hi>Parthenissa</hi> and <hi>Altezeera</hi>
which had done such strange things, would have appeared as admirable
in our Heroes, as that very Immodesty would have done in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Callimachus,</hi> who perceived their disorders, and who being the
least interessed, was the fittest to counsel them, advised they would leave
<hi>Symander</hi> in that concealment from whence they had made their discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that they themselves would retire to a shade at a farther distance,
where they might take some refreshment, and the better consider and
advise what was to be done when <hi>Symander</hi> should bring notice of
their being awake.</p>
               <p>This proposal was no sooner made, than accepted of; and our two
Heroes, with <hi>Callimachus,</hi> went to a place within sight of the first, where
having received a refreshment more proportionate to the Prince of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
Priest, than the place, they conjur'd him to prosecute his Story,
though what they had seen and heard, gave them impatiencies, which
nothing but their desires of knowing so generous a Friend's Fortunes,
could have dispensed with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callimochus</hi> at length vanquished with their perswasions, and believing
the Strangers might employ as much time in sleep, as he should in telling
the remainder of his Adventures, in these terms did begin where he had
left off.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had last the Honour to Wait on Your Royal
Highness, You ordered me to write another Part
of</hi> Parthenissa, <hi>and You gave me leave at the
same time to Dedicate it to You.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only Your Commands, Madam, could have
made me Undertake that Work; And only
Your Permission could have given me this confidence.</p>
               <p>But since Your Royal Highness appointed me to Obey, it was
proportionate to Your Goodness to Protect me in my Obedience;
which this Dedication will. For all my faults in this Book
cannot be so great as His, who shall Condemn what has been Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for You, and is by Your own Allowance humbly addrest to You.</p>
               <p>Nothing less than Your Name could be my Sanctuary; and
nothing more than Your Name can make it inviolable.</p>
               <p>If ever Your Royal Highness can give away so much of Your
time as must be Imploy'd in reading this Tome, You will find in it
the Fairest, the Greatest, and the most Vertuous Princess of Asia,
so much divided between what She ows to her Quality, and her
Obedience, and what She ows to Her Inclinations, and Her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
as possibly Your Royal Highness may oblige Her at once,
both with Your Pity and Your Kindness.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, She has Commanded me to assure You, That if
You will Honour Her with the Last, She will neither desire, nor
need the First. Your Concernments for Her Misfortunes will put
a Period to them; since She cannot lament any Cause, which will
Produce for Her so Advantageous an Effect.</p>
               <p>I did once design to have Ended Her story in this Book; But
the Vicissitudes of Her Fate were so many, and so various, that
I could not confine it within so narrow a compass. Nor was I
Over-much solicitous to do it; For since I limit my self in the
main Events to the Truth of the History, I was Apprehensive,
Madam, that the ill Result of Her Destiny might have given You
as much trouble, as the ill Stile in which I should have related
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:96335:321"/>But, Madam, rather than to Apologize, for having Written no
more, I should humbly beg Your Pardon for having Written so
much.</p>
               <p>And since nothing can be a nobler Motive to forgive an Offence
(especially where the Person offended is equally merciful and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous)
than Ingenuously to acknowledg it; I will confess, That
being to draw the most Excellent Princess of that Age, I took for
my Model the most Accomplisht of ours. And to make the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture
of the fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> I attempted, Madam, to make
it resemble Yours.</p>
               <p>But I find the Coppy so unlike the Admirable Original, that
I could not go more beyond my duty in the Design, than I am
come short of my intention in the Event.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, though whoever had been possest with my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
must have fallen into my disappointment; for 'tis one of
Your Noblest Advantages, to be above description; Yet I am so
far from being grieved at my fault, as I rejoyce that I could not
avoid committing it: Since I had exceedingly rather want, than
have the Power to describe You.</p>
               <p>As much as Your Royal Highness Transcends the <hi>Pontick</hi>
Princess in all the Gifts of Nature, and Excellencies of the
Mind, May You by so much surpass Her in all the Services of
Fortune, and the Felicities of Power; And may you be inclin'd
to extend one evidence of the Latter, by pardoning the confidence

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Broke off (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) the Relation of my Life,
in a part of it so full of Horrors for me, that nothing
could Equal it; and in a Condition so far above the
hope of Remedy, that nothing could be more; for
that Fatal Day was come, which was to place the
Princess <hi>Statira</hi> in an Estate far more inaccessible to
me, than she had been, either by the height of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or the Lowness of mine: As vast disproportions
as those, having been often Equall'd by Love; and had I been so bless'd as
to have obtained hers, the other Obstacle had been Conquer'd as an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that Victory. But now her Vows were so entirely to confine her
to the Happy <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s Affection; That to have Sollicited hers, would
have been an Action as void of Hope, as Virtue. Already the Sacrifices
were brought to the Temple; The <hi>Augures</hi> were there to judg of the
Prophetical part of the Victims; The People by the way began to sing the
usual Songs, in Honour of <hi>Hymen;</hi> The Triumphal Arches were Imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
with their Noblest Ornaments; The Priest which was to Joyn their
hands, stood ready at the Altar; and the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King himself, with
looks as full of Felicity as his Condition was, came at last, leading <hi>Statira</hi>
into <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Chamber, to Solicite his Presence and Company at the
Nuptial Solemnities. This Sight, Generous Princes, This sight had so
Universal an Influence on me, that had not <hi>Ascanius</hi> been absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon his Request, he might have easily seen my Disorders. and as
easily have imagined their Cause. I had not the Confidence or Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to speak one word to the Princess; But mine Eyes were so unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably
fixed upon hers, and were so sad, and languishing, that they proved
no uneloquent Orators; for I perceived the Brightness of hers begin to
be obscured with a Cloud, which would have dissolved into Tears, had
not the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King turned towards her, to implore the joyning of her
Desires to his Prayers, whereby she had been surprised in a disorder,
which though she had much trouble to Conquer, yet (I believe) it did
not equal that which had occasioned it; from which flattering Belief, I
had still new cause to condemn my Fortune, which never gave me pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hopes, but to torment me; for my condition was such, that I more
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:96335:322"/>
needed what would send me to the Grave, than what might disswade
me from it; had I been Master of my own Reason, I should have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<hi>Statira</hi>'s grief, to her being so near a performance, which would
separate her from a Brother, whose loss might have but too abundantly
justified the highest effect thereof; and not have ascribed that Noble
sorrow to some Esteem she had for the unhappy <hi>Callimachus,</hi> whose
Condition and Services were too low to hope for such a Felicity.
The Generous <hi>Atafernes</hi> was not conquered by <hi>Statira,</hi> or <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s
Solicitations; Excusing himself upon the Account of his want of
health, which going into the Air, might so much encrease, that it might
prove an Interruption in those Ceremonies: Though the real Cause was,
That he would not assist at a Solemnity, which was to Cost him (as he
afterwards told me) the deprivation of his Sister, and possibly the loss
of his Friend. The King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>(not a little troubled at this Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
which he disguised by saying, He was as much afflicted for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
which denyed him the honour of his Company, as at the want
of it) soon after took his Leave; <hi>Mithridates</hi> sending him word, That
all things were ready if he were. This happy Summons he Joyfully
obeyed, and blush'd that he had needed it; and leading out the Princess,
went to possess a happiness as much above Merit, as Description. But
whilst I reflected thereon, all my passions broke their Chains, and did so
violently Agitate me, that my Reason could not more Torment me, than
they (at that time) did; and though <hi>Atafernes</hi> Endeavoured by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings,
and his sympathizing with me, to perswade me to moderate a grief,
which I could not Cure, yet all his Attempts were in vain; I could not
consider what <hi>Statira</hi> was gone to do, without giving my self as much
up to despair, as she was to give her self up to <hi>Ascanius:</hi> The very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of whose Name, seemed to add more Fire to my rage;in
the dictates whereof (I thought such Extravagant things, (that if my
memory could serve me to repeat them, yet) I should be ashamed to do
it. What Condition (Generous Hearers) could be more Irrecoverable,
than mine seemed to be? Which I have the more particularly told you,
to raise your hopes, or hinder your despair, for your own; for just in the
moment I had cause to believe <hi>Statira</hi> might be giving her hand and faith
to the <hi>Cyrian</hi> King, <hi>Demetrius</hi> came running<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hastily into the Chamber,
and (losing that respect he owed to the Prince) he told me, I have
brought you (Sir) an Intelligence, which (doubtless) will exceedingly
surprize you, if at least it hath the like Operation on you, which it had,
and has, on all that Great Assembly in the Temple: At the Gate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
a Gentleman, who had rid Post, in haste acquainted <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
That his, and the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> Fleet had fought with <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s, in
the Prospect of the City of <hi>Carri,</hi> where after a bloody dispute, <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
had remained the Conqueror, and that so Intirely, as hardly any one had
escaped, but a few <hi>Quinquereme</hi> Galleys: That <hi>Arsides, Ascanius</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Admiral, had been kill'd in the first Heat of the Battel, which
had not a little contributed to the Enemies Success; Who immediately
after, the wind blowing from the North, had hoised up all his Sails, and as
swiftly (as those and his Oars could carry him) made for the <hi>Bosphorus;</hi>
and, as the Governor of <hi>Scutari</hi> did conjecture, would endeavour to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
the Residue of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet, in the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> Who (if
they got not Intelligence of their Friends defeat) might be Conquered
by their Security, or (if they did) by their Fear, if vigorously Asssaulted on
the first Impression of it. This Gentleman (whom the King knew to be a
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:96335:322"/>
Person of Honesty and of Courage, and therefore through apprehension
had not augmented the Loss or the Danger) had scarce done speaking,
but several Posts came one upon the Heels of another with Advertisements
from the several Governors on the Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, that a Prodigious Fleet had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
pass'd the Straits of <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and was with all Celerity doubling
the Point of <hi>Acritas,</hi> which makes the North-west Head-land of the Bay
of <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> These Reiterated Assurances, gave the Two Kings on time
for Consideration, there being scarce time enough left to prepare for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Ascanius</hi>'s misfortunes could not appear greater to him, than his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
did to all the Assembly; The loss of a Fleet, and a Brother much
more Considerable, did seem sufficiently to Apologize for his Trouble,
which yet he told the Princess had a higher cause than either or both of
those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which was, That by so Signal an Infelicity he should be cast into a
greater, That of being a while suspended from Joys, which, if in degrees
compared to his Losses, made them appear little; That his Brother &amp; Navy
could not have been Noblier lost, than in her Service, to whom all he had
was both his dedication and his debt; That since <hi>Arsides</hi> was dead, there
was no other but himself, with whom he durst intrust the Remainder of a
Fleet, which were to have the Glory, not only to fight for her, but before
her; That he had often exclaim'd against the Excellency of his Fortune,
which had destin'd him the Highest Happiness, and had still denied him
the opportunity of Acting what might make him the less unworthy of it;
That therefore the gods had now removed that Occasion of Complaint,
and thought it were at a high price, yet it was not at one he would decline
to purchase it at: That he was confident this day should, in the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be as a Signal for his advantage, as the beginning of it had been to his
prejudice: and, That since a few Hours would decide the difference, he
Humbly begg'd, that all the preparations for the Nuptials might continue
as they were, that at his Return with Victory, he might receive a Crown
from her of Mirtles which he would infinitely value above one of Lawrel,
and which would be a Cure above any misfortunes he had or could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> was present all this while, and either to satisfie <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s
Request, or else to let the people see the confidence he had of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
He commanded all the Assistants to continue as they were, till that
King's Return, and to joyn their Sacrifices and Prayers to his Arms. He
then commanded <hi>Pharnaces</hi> to permit <hi>Ascanius</hi> to draw out of his Army
what Soldiers he should need to man his Fleet with; and the like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
he sent to <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Forces: But the <hi>Cyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ian</hi> King declin'd that
High favour; possibly, left whilst he brought <hi>Mithridates</hi> assistance, he
should seem to need his. <hi>Ascanius</hi> had no sooner took leave of the
Princess and her Father, but he was followed by <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
declared, He was resolved to share in his Danger, and Triumph;
That it was unjust another only should dispute his Quarrel, and he
himself be but a Looker on: And that he would let <hi>Mithridates</hi> see,
he wanted not Inclination, or Courage, but Fortune to have served
him, as eminently as his Brother. With these and many such Reason
(continued <hi>Demetrius</hi>) he conquer'd <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s resolution, and went
with him on Board his Fleet: which they doubtless had been surpriz'd, if
the Solemnity of this Day, which they were prepar'd to Celebrate,
had not put them into a readiness; and scarce were they ordered to
prepare for the Battel, when the Enemy, who was to present Them it,
appear'd. In this condition (said <hi>Demetrius</hi>) I left things when I came
from the Temple: and, if I be not much mistaken, there is a Tower at
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:96335:323"/>
the end of the adjoyning Gallery, from whence you may see this Naval
Fight. O gods! (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) What retributions did I not
pay you for this admirable Interruption and Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssing, which in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
I considered as the fore-runner of a greater! Nay, the Generous
<hi>Atafernes</hi> was himself overjoyed thereat; and in his Servant's concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
seemed to have forgot those he had for his Father, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
I begg'd his leave a Thousand times to contribute my help to
those Force which fought for <hi>Mithridates;</hi> That I might imitate my
Prince, by letting him see, I had a stronger Inclination for what was
his, and his Father's interest, than my own. But though he still reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
denyed me, yet I was not silenc'd till he told me, 'twould be fit
I considered, That not only <hi>Ascanius</hi> and <hi>Pharnaces</hi> might esteem it
as an offence, that uninvitedly I came to participate in their Glory; but
that also, having declined to assist at the Nuptials for want of strength,
if I could assist at the Fight, it might give some occasion to suspect by
the one, what caused the other. These Reasons (I confess) conquer'd
me, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> then returning with assurance, that from the Tower
he had mentioned, we could see all the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the Scene of
the intended Fight; The Prince and I went thither, having first sent
Orders to his Army to Imbattel themselves along the Shore, and to five
thousand Men to have a watchful Eye towards the City, lest upon any
ill Success of the Fleet, it might be ready to receive her former King.
As soon as we came to the uppermost Room of the Tower, which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so commanding a Prospect, we discovered the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet had
weighed Anchor, and was with their utmost Industry striving to get
the Wind of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> which he rendred an Impossibility to do; for
he had no sooner doubled the point of <hi>Acritas,</hi> but he kept the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
shore of the Bay so close on his left-hand, that he doubted not by
that Advantage to get as certain a Victory, as he thought to have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a surprise; which failing of, and seeing his Enemies in so good
and ready a form, relying on the benefit he had of the Wind, on his
Courage, and on his former Success, he resolutely advanced, to become
as absolute Master of one Element, as <hi>Mithridates</hi> had made himself of
the other: The <hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet inraged by the loss of their Companions,
animated by the presence of their King, and by the glorious Assembly
on the shore, loudly published, such unusual Incitements were of more
advantage to them, than the Wind was now, or the recent Victory had
been to their Enemies. In a moment, we saw that noble Order, which
both Fleets had so well observed, turned into confusion, and <hi>Cyprian</hi>
and <hi>Nicomedian</hi> Flags and Streamers, so promiscuously mingled, that
the Discomposure was then as Great, as a little before the Regularity
had been: sometimes Galleys of equal strength had also an equal Fate,
and by opening each other with their Brazen Beaks, sank both to the
bottom together, with those fatal Engines which sent them thither:
Sometimes we saw Men so eager after their Dawning success, that they
minded not how by an unexpected Leak, they became a prey to an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
more merciless than themselves, and needed that help from others,
which even then they had denied to others: Sometimes the Heavens were
darkned with a Cloud of Arrows, and then again nothing but seeming
Lightnings employ'd our Sight, occasion'd by the Sun's reflections on the
Helmets and Swords of the contending Soldiers: but though these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
afforded us variety of Objects to entertain us, yet one above the
rest, did it so intirely, that nothing else could divert us from it: and
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:96335:323"/>
this was, The two Galleys which carried the Admiral's Flags, met, and
grappled, and so long fought for the Victory, that we thought there
would have been hardly any left in either to have solemnized it: But in
the conclusion, we saw one run up the Main-mast of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and having taken down from thence the mark of her being so, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the rest of the Fleet began to retire, and in a short while so visibly
and hastily fled towards those Forces which were their Friends and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
on the Shore, that we could no longer doubt of <hi>Ascanius</hi> and
<hi>Pharnaces's</hi> Defeat; but in it, I was so equally divided between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations
of Interest, and those of Honour, that the one not intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overcoming the other, I remained neither sensible of Joy or Grief:
But <hi>Ataphernes,</hi> who, by his condition, was left to a more free way of
resolving, than my unfortunate one left me; cried out, <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
I know not what disorder this Loss may bring amongst our Soldiers;
Nor what intelligence <hi>Nicomedes</hi> may have in this City (over which,
but by the Fate of War, he is lawful King); therefore, if your
strength will permit you, see to the safety of it, if <hi>Mithridates</hi> has not
given particular Orders therein already; and I will hasten down to the
Strand to save what we can of our Vanquish'd friends, and to oppose any
Descent the Enemy may make in this confusion of our Affairs. Though I
had not Health enough to see <hi>Ascanius</hi> possess <hi>Statira,</hi> yet I had enough
to defend her against <hi>Nicomedes;</hi> and with Joy accepting that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ataphernes</hi> forthwith commanded a couple of Chariots to be
brought us, for we were not in a condition, without much pain, either
on Foot, or on Horse-back, to act those Duties we held necessary,
and had therefore undertaken: The Prince's Chariot being first come,
and he having the longer way to go, instantly made use of it; and
mine soon after coming, I forthwith went in it, from the Palace, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the great place of Arms in the Center of the City; but by the
way, I was met by the then Chief Magistrate of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>'s
natural Subject, who told me, he had even then presented
his apprehensions to the Prince of some Conspiracy by the <hi>Nicomedians,</hi>
who were more active and stirring, than he had observed them ever to
have been in Alarms; and that <hi>Ataphernes</hi> had commanded him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this Intelligence to me: I thanked him for his care, desired a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of it, and that he would forthwith draw all the Citizens into
Arms, of whose Fidelity he was groundedly confident, and have a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
eye over the rest. I forthwith dispatch'd some of my Servants to
<hi>Ataphernes</hi>'s Camp, with repeated Orders to have their Men in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with parties of Horse constantly moving between <hi>Nicomedia</hi>
and the Army, that if any thing were stirring, they might with the
needed Celerity repair to the City and defence of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Gate that was next the Camp, to be thereby certain of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
if there were need: When these Orders were given, finding the
King had left none particularly to answer a Revolt within the Walls,
I did the more hastily put the <hi>Pontick</hi> Militia of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in Arms;
and no sooner were they in a posture to Fight, but the occasion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd;
for most of the ancient Inhabitants of the place, hearing of their
King's success, took up Arms to encrease it; and thinking to surprise
us, began the Ingagement with that Fury, which usually possesses
such as promise themselves Success, or, wanting it, are certain of Death;
I was not over-forward to oppose them, not knowing the Courages
of those I headed, and being (with much difficulty) able to make
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:96335:324"/>
use of a Horse which then was brought me: But principally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I knew the Conspirators party was at the heighth, and mine
would be increasing; for some time, I was therefore contented not
to lose Ground, as my Enemies were, that I won none: When a
hasty Intelligence was brought me, that a rich <hi>Nicomedian</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> to a Gallery in his House, which stood much
more commodiously to see the Fleets, than any part of the Temple; and
that she was no sooner there, but her Gentlemen were assaulted, who
yet defended themselves with some resolution, but (if not instantly
relieved) their Courages would yield to their Enemies number: This
fatal advice made me cast off all those cold prudential considerations,
under which I had thitherto Acted; and telling the danger the Princess
was in, to those Forcess I headed, they seem'd, by an universal Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
to evidence their sense of it, and to promise with the hazard of
their Lives to free her from it; I was loath to lose the first heat of this
Duty; and, having by a successful charge broke through those which
had stopt up my way to my relieving the Princess, I flew from those as
fast as they had done from me, minding now no enemies but those which
were such upon the most unpardonable score; as soon as I had discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them under their Ensigns, before the Gate of that treacherous <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median</hi>'s
House, I saluted them with a furious Cry; and finding by
the Order they were in, they had finish'd their attempt, I had not
so much patience as to look behind me, to see whether I was well
followed, which I too late found I was not; for many of my Party think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it safer and more beneficial to pursue a routed Enemy, than to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
one that seem'd to Brave them, followed the Execution of those,
and left me with a few to conquer these. It was a miracle I was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
my own weakness, and the weakness of my Party concurring, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to condemn me to a Defeat; against the belief whereof, nothing did
fortifie me, but the remembrance for whom, and (possibly) in whose
presence, I fought: These two Reflections gave me that strength, which
my late Wounds seemed to have denied me; evidencing thereby, that
Love has a higher power than Nature; the weakness of this, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
by the strength of that. But whil'st I was thus forcing a passage
through a thousand Swords, I received from a young <hi>Nicomedian,</hi> so
large and deep a Wound through my left Arm, into my left Side, that
almost despairing of Victory, I even bless'd that Hand which had given
me so great an assurance of not out-living the loss of it; yet still I
fought, esteeming that as great a duty whil'st I did live, as it was
to live no longer, when I could not by my Sword act the Deliverance
of the fair <hi>Statira;</hi> but I was snatch'd from these Melancholy thoughts,
by the welcome Cry of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who aloud told me, Sir, your relief is
at hand; he told me what was true: For, immediately I heard the
Trumpets of some of <hi>Ataphernes</hi>'s Troops, who having by my Orders
secured that Gate of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> next their Camp; just as the Revolters
were marching hastily to possess it, had, by it, a free admittance into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
whose Revolt having been assured of, and of my danger, they came
hastily to punish the one, and relieve the other. <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s assurance
was heard by the Enemy, as well as by me, and was so throughly believed
by them, that what brought me Advertisement of a relief, did also
Act it; for, fearing lest all the Prince's victorious Army was falling on
them, most fled away towards the Harbour, and there in Boats
sought to save themselves under his Protection, for whose Service only
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:96335:324"/>
they needed it; others fled in at the Gate of the House in which <hi>Statira</hi>
was, having forthwith Barricado'd it, began from the Court-wall
to play upon my Relief with their Darts and Arrows. I forthwith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all those Troops which came to my succour, to leave their
Horses, and some to attempt the breaking open of the Gate, others to
get Ladders in the adjacent Houses to scale the Walls; and in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Buildings I placed some Foot (who by this time were come up) to
beat the Enemy from their Defences; it seemed those that took this
House for their Sanctuary, were of the resolutest; for though my Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
omitted not their Duties, yet they proved fruitless: My old
Wounds, and my new, render'd me unable to lead my Men up those Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
from whence so many had been tumbled down, that even the most
heated amongst them, were somewhat cooled. The much Blood I had
lost, made my strength decay so visibly, that several of the Officers came
to conjure me, to retire to some place out of danger of the Enemies shot,
to dress my Wounds, lest my longer neglect might render those mortal,
which possibly of themselves were not such: But I was deaf to all such
perswasions, and leaning upon my Sword, I did by my words solicite their
Courages, to whom I was not able to bring any Accession by my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
or Assistance: Never was any disability so sensible as mine was
then to me, to stand useless in my Princess's Service; and when to act
it, no other impediment remain'd, but forcing of an ordinary Wall,
wounded me more than all the Arms of the false <hi>Nicomedians</hi> had done:
But I was soon struck with a deeper stroak than any yet I had received,
'twas with a redoubled Cry of some of the Princess's Women, that they
were forcing her away into a Barge, to carry her to <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Fleet.
This Advertisement, generous Princes, this Advertisement acted a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
on me; I lost not only the remembrance of all my Wounds, but
even of the pain and weakness they had given me; and running to the
next Scaling-Ladder, I climb'd it up, killed two of those which resisted
my gaining the Top of it, and having won the Battlements of the Wall,
I was soon so well followed by the rest of my Friends, that the Enemy
by a precipitated Flight, left us no other trouble, but to follow them:
which, whilst the Soldiers were doing, I flew to the place where the
Princess's Women continued their Cryes, by which I was guided to a
small Key, where the Barge they had mention'd was; there I saw a
Crowd of Soldiers forcing into it the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> and those Women
which had attended her, for all the Men had been lost in her Defence:
This Sight gave my decaying Strength a new Inspiration, in the Dictates
whereof, by a furious Cry, I warned the Ravishers of their inevitable
Death, if they proceeded in their Crime: But this was so far from
hindering what I feared, that it did but hasten it; for knowing they
had done too much to be pardoned by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and too little to
be receiv'd by <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> unless they presented him with some benefit to
his Service, as well as endeavour in it: Leaving all the Women on the
shore, two of the <hi>Nicomedians</hi> by plain force ran with <hi>Statira</hi> into it,
and the chief of them commanded all the Rowers immediately to Lanch
from the shore. This fatal Order was no sooner given, than obey'd;
so that nothing coming timely enough to hinder the execution of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
all my remaining Forces, I leap'd into the Barge, and passing
my Sword through him who commanded in it, and who had laid his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
hands upon the Princess, I fell Dead at her feet; seeming in that
place to have received the reward of my Endeavours; and in that
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:96335:325"/>
condition, the punishment of their unsuccessfulness. The Death of the
<hi>Nicomedian</hi> Commander raised a fury in all his Soldiers, which my fall,
and the Barges being got off from the Key, gave them but too much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
safely to discharge; and therefore running to my Body with
their Swords drawn, from the Head of the Barge towards the Stern where
I lay, and at which end I had got in (that part being brought near the
Shore, for the Princess's more convenient going into it) they had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by many new Wounds acted that, which seemingly had been acted to
their hands, had not she (forgetting her own misfortune, and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their Arms) interposed her self between me and them: and, by the
majesty of a Look only peculiar to her self, and able to infuse a deep
veneration in the most salvage hearts, put thereby a full stop to their
fury, even in the highest Dictates of it. She was her self as much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to find this unexpected reverence, as those were, in whom she had
rais'd it: And therefore, not to lose the desired effects of it, she told
them; <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Will you, to the horrid Sin of forcing away your
King's Daughter, add that Inhumanity, of imbruing your hands in the
blood of a Dead man? The truth of that reproach, and the belief they
gave to that assurance, made them by degrees retire to the Head of the
Barge again; which they had no sooner done, but the Princess, and <hi>Nerea,</hi>
(the only person of all her Attendants which had the Honour to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
in her misfortunes; for, (as she told us afterwards) finding they
were resolv'd to force away the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> she had flung her self into
the Barge at first, not to be separated from her). These two, I say, by an
excess of goodness, and the Princess, of condescension, tearing of the
Linnen they wore, did with it endeavour to stop the many springs of
Blood which ran out of my Body; and by a Deluge of weeping, <hi>Statira</hi>
her self celebrated her apprehensions of my having lost my Life; a Life
too nobly lost, since 'was in her Service; and too nobly lamented, since
'twas so, even by her Tears, But her Charity and Grief were soon forced
to resign their rooms to her fears; for the <hi>Nicomedian</hi> I had run through
when I leap'd into the Barge, had a Brother with him, who more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to save his wounded Brother than to revenge him, whilst others were
running to this, he employ'd himself in that; but in vain: For the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which the awe of the Princess had made retire, were no sooner
gone back to their dying Captain, but he expired in his Brother's Arms;
who now seeing 'twas no more time to serve him, ran to revenge him;
and finding my Sword (which by accident lay near him) covered with
his Brother's blood, He cryed out to his Soldiers, Companions, follow
me, and you shall see this Sword that has acted yours, and my loss, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it. This was no sooner said, than with a furious look, he ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place where I lay. The words he spake, were so loud, that they
reached the Princess's ears; who, fearing lest those who had been so soon
converted, might as soon be guilty of a relapse, had not so intirely mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, as not at all to mind them. And therefore, when my intended
Murtherer was come near me, with Looks as bloody as his intention, the
Princess, by an excess of generosity, interposed her self a second time
between me and my Death, commanding <hi>Nerea</hi> to give me that care,
which the cruelty of these men forced her from contributing unto; and
with a Look, able to have struck a Veneration and Awe into any but
him on whom 'twas mis-spent; she told him, Monster, Art thou alone
of all thy Companions capable to act a violence to me, and a barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to a dead Gentleman? That Crime which they were ashamed to
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:96335:325"/>
have designed, art not thou ashamed to perform? Madam, (he replied,
interrupting the Princess) 'Tis I only of all my Companions, who have
lost a Brother, and yet a Person dearer to me upon the account of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
than of Blood; who even now Dying in my Arms, recommended
in his last Breath his revenge to my Sword, which by all that is Sacred,
nothing shall hinder me from. Cruel man! (she answer'd) What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
wouldst thou desire that is not acted already for thee? His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
renders him uncapable to suffer more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thee to do more: Malice
it self ceases in Death; and thou wilt not (I hope) be worse than the
worst of Ills. If he were Dead (the <hi>Nicomedian</hi> hastily answer'd) you
would not both have taken such care in dressing his Wounds: neither
whilst you fruitlesly endeavour to keep me from encreasing their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
would you employ your Woman to dress those he already has: No,
Madam, be he what you say he is, and what I think he is not, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Blood, which covers this Sword, must be wash'd away with his
guilty Blood, who has thus stain'd it. Barbarian, (the fair <hi>Statira</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed)
Canst thou draw from the duty of a performance I owe a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
which Died in my defence, an Argument to provoke thy rage, and
increase thy guilt? Because our charity is mistaken in doing good, lest
thy malice from thence should be mistaken in not doing ill, thou wilt
run to a Sin which past-Ages have not parallel'd, neither future ones
will? What greater evidence canst thou have, that <hi>Callimachus</hi> is Dead,
than that thou hast his Sword? That Prince also to whom thou art now
carrying us, is too generous to receive under his protection, a Person so
loaded with Crimes; and the wickedness thou art now intent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
will out-weigh the Service thou dost him in making me his Prisoner;
and force him, lest he share in thy guilt, to deny thee the reward of it.
I never use (the <hi>Nicomedian</hi> furiously replied) to sell my Services; and
those I have now paid, being done for my King, are both my Duty and
my Reward; and having lost my Brother, do I thirst after any other
recompence, than the satisfaction of revenging him? which lest your
tears, and prayers, might hinder my Prince from denying me the right to
do, when I come unto him, I will perform it before: I conjure you
therefore, Madam, as you value your own safety, do not any longer put
your self in a posture of hazarding it, lest any of those blows my just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
aim at him, should fall where I mean them not, and make me
as actually guilty, as you would perswade me I am already intentionally.
Thou wouldst (said <hi>Statira</hi>) not only commit a Sin, but to do it, wouldst
perswade me to act another; since thus to revenge thy Brother's Death,
cannot be worse in thee, than the permitting of it would be in me: Thy
Brother's Blood is shed in a treacherous Action, for so I must call what
thou now doest, though it be for thy natural Prince, whom thou shouldst
have followed in his misery; or, not having the courage or honesty to
do that, thou shouldst not have had the wickedness to do this. Thou
didst live under my Father's protection as a Subject, and now forcest
away his Daughter as a Traitor into the hands of his Enemies: Canst
thou, I say, who in all the actions of thy Life, hast not done what thou
shouldst do, and done that which thou shouldst not do, think it a Duty to
revenge a Brother, who Dy'd in the Crimes thou art guilty of? And
shall not I esteem it a higher Duty of preserve from more than Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Body of a generous Prince, who now lyes weltring in a deluge
of Blood, only for my defence? or, If by a Miracle, he should above my
belief, have any remnant of Life remaining, shall I not expose mine to
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:96335:326"/>
defend his, which had not needed my defence, had he not been reduced
to what it is, by defending me from thee, and that Brother, whose just
loss excites thy rage? Do not think to fright me from a duty I would
not fear to pay, with the certain loss of that which thou dost thus threaten
me with: Canst thou think thy resentments are fit to be acted? And
canst thou have the vanity to think thou canst terrfie me out of mine?
Shall the imaginary Debts of wickedness be more punctually paid by
thee, than the real ones of Virtue by me? Ah! 'Tis thy Ignorance of
good which makes thee so bad, or makes thee hope to make me the like!
No, no, If thou wilt go to thy cruelty, thou shalt go to it through me;
I should be more troubled to decline thy fury, than to endure the fiercest
effects of it: Therefore lose no time, for all thy solicitations to me, are
as vain as mine have been to thee, or rather for thee. I will lose no
more time then, since you command me it, (reply'd the angry <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>)
I have lost too much already, and the Ghost of my Brother seems
to reproach me for that remissness, which my respect to you has made me
guilty of to him; Permit me therefore (he continued, advancing nearer
the Princess to lead you from a sight which might but heighten your
displeasure. Touch me not (said the fair <hi>Statira</hi>); thy seeming care of
me, is a real cruelty to me: Those impious hands which are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued
in <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s blood, must not give me any assistance; or, if
thou hast a respect for me, shew it in obeying my Commands, or in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my desires of desisting from a Crime the gods will punish, if Men
would not. Remember the condition thou art now in, flying from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>'s
justice, which may make thee rationally fear thou may'st
one day feel the highest effects of it. Desist from this wickedness, and I
will engage to procure thee my Father's pardon; not only a forgiveness
for thy self, but for all thy Companions; and the remittal of all your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures.
Consider what it is to be eternally banish'd from your native
Country, from your Friends, and from all that is dear unto you, and to
become Vagabonds, eternally confin'd to an Element, as merciless as thy
self; for <hi>Nicomedes</hi> has no place but his Navy, on which to set his Foot:
I do not conjure thee, not to bring me to thy King. Keep me as Hostage
there, till what I have promised be performed; I ask not for my self, I
ask for him, who in serving me, is render'd for ever unable to serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
Thou needest but not to be wicked, to be happy: abstaining from
one intended Crime, shall procure thy patdon for every one thou hast
acted: No man except thy self but would lose all he has, rather than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that Sin, which to buy thee from, I offer thee all that thou hast lost:
But, if all my commands, my desires, and my offers move thee not, as I
fear they will not; (for he that is Deaf to Virtue, probably will be so
to all things else) carry thy Rage to the highest; add to the Barbarity
of giving new Wounds to a generous Person that is Dead, and to the
forcing away thy King's Daughter, that of shedding her blood also; for
thy Sword can no way be so sensible to me, as to see it employ'd against
him. Can you, Madam, possibly believe (replyed the <hi>Nicomedian</hi>) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having unmovedly heard all your Commands, and with disdain
(pardon me if I must say so) all your offers, that only an Inhuman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to shed Blood, and not a virtuous Revenge, inspires my now resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
And since I am acted by such a Principle, in the name of all the
gods, Madam, do no longer fruitlesly endeavour to hinder its effects;
were <hi>Callimachus</hi> as much Alive, as you would perswade me he is Dead;
and from my own being Alive, would thence have assured me he is Dead;
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:96335:326"/>
were he, I say, in the condition you wish him, possibly his Courage
would not have so long protected him, as my respect to you has done;
He, that at the Head of a victorious Army, could not force a weak
House, till my Companions fear did more for him, than his own Valour;
is not an Enemy so much to be fear'd, as you would have me fear him;
nor a Friend so much to be esteemed, as I perceive he has the honour
to be esteemed by you. Whilst the Princess (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>)
was by more than a Human goodness employing her words for one so
highly unworthy of them, <hi>Nerea</hi> had not only stopt the bleeding of that
great Wound I had in my Side, but also by casting water upon my Face,
and by several other things practised to one in a Swoon, brought me out
of that, which too much Motion, and too little Blood had cast me into;
and I was no sooner come to my self, than confusedly remembring the
danger the fair <hi>Statira</hi> had been in, and not being able to imagine what
the result of it had been (fetching a deep groan) Oh gods! said I,
What is become of the Princess? Those few words I spoke just as the
<hi>Nicomedian</hi> had ended what I last related, and were no sooner heard by
him, than (crying out aloud) Madam, Does your Dead man speak? He
at the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> time struck a furious blow at me, and said, Take that as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sent thee from the Manes of my Brother. The violence of the stroak
was broken by the interposition of the Princess; who, finding now my
Enemy had lost all respect to her, and was carried away by a Deaf fury
to my immediate destruction, began now to conclude, I should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be what she but fear'd I had been. <hi>Nerea,</hi> the better to afford
me her help, had set me up against the Stern of the Barge (the place in
which my strength had so fatally left me) which was so narrow, that
whilst the Princess stood before me, none could come on either side to
me, so that all the blows made at me were over her shoulder; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more offensive to me, being hinder'd at that price, than had they all
taken an unobstructed effect. The <hi>Nicomedian</hi>'s words and actions,
made me soon imagine what was doing, and therefore looking about for
my Sword, more to punish his insolence to <hi>Statira,</hi> than to defend, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my self; I endeavour'd to get up, but my Treacherous weakness
cast me down again, and left me to the rage of an insulting Enemy; to
which I had then been sacrificed, had not the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> by a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cruelty to her self, finding all other ways unsuccessful, cast her self
upon me, and by covering me with her Body, render'd it an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the <hi>Nicomedian</hi> (but by her Death) to act mine. <hi>Nerea</hi> also
seizing with all her strength upon his Legs, did so intangle him, that
he was not able to move one step to force <hi>Statira</hi> from the posture she
was in; This made him call to some of his Soldiers to tear that impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from him, and that safety from me; who, by striving to get up, had
open'd my Wound again, and had thereby repeated my former fainting;
and therefore was not sensible, either of my danger, or of the felicity by
which yet I was preserved from it; The way of it being infinitely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of satisfaction, than the end. The <hi>Nicomedian</hi>'s Soldiers ran to obey
their Captain's command; and having with much difficulty forced <hi>Nerea</hi>
from from his Knees, and with infinitely more rudeness forced the Princess
off me; lifting his Eyes up to Heaven, and his Sword into the Air, He
cryed out, Brother, dear Brother, accept of this Sacrifice, the least that I
owe thee, and the greatest I can pay thee. <hi>Statira</hi> by a loud shriek endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to stop his lifted-up Arm from falling on me, or by it, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to honour and lament my Death; when on a sudden, instead of seeing
*
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:96335:327"/>
the <hi>Nicomedians</hi>'s Sword fall upon my Head, she saw it fall out of his
Hand, and him soon after Dead at her Feet. Possibly, generous Princes,
(continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) never any Man was so near Death, and so
strangely escaped it; I have not, to make the deliverance seem the
greater, made the danger seem such; for even in that very instant, which
was between the lifting up the Sword to kill me, and the letting it fall
for that effect, an Arrow shot him through the Heart. <hi>Statira</hi> has often
told me, she thought it came from Heaven, as a Return to her prayers
and tears: But lest the truth might look like a Fiction, permit me to tell
you what will free it from that unhappiness. The Barge we then were in,
was that Magnificent one which <hi>Mithridates</hi> himself commonly made
use of, when for his Divertisement he would take the Air in the Bay; and
because it was imbellished with much Gilt, and admirable Painting, it
was kept in a House built on purpose for it upon Pillars some little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the shore, lest the curiosity of the common people might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
it in either; and therefore those to whose care it was committed,
had a small Skiff, capable only to hold the Rowers of the Barge, which
were twenty, in which as they had occasion they went to it, and returned
from it. This Skiff, when the Barge was thrust from the shore by the
<hi>Nicomedians,</hi> at my Arrival had only six Rowers, ready to receive such
as in their intended flight to <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Fleet, could not have room
enough in the Barge; the Water-men, left in the Skiff, seeing the Barge
hasten away, from whence only they could expect their relief, were so
amazed and terrified thereat, that before they could resolve of any thing,
they were discovered by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and by his Orders secured: He
having seen my danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in having cast my self single amongst above
twenty Armed men, besides as many Rowers, and ready at the time I
did so, to sink under my Wounds, calling to him some of the nearest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, ran with them to the Skiff, and just as he was going to leap into
it, he fell down by the side of it; for, in the Fight he had received some
Wounds, which his zeal in my Service had not made him consider. The
decay of his strength was so great, that it hardly gave him power to say
hastily to <hi>Rebadates;</hi> I recommend, valiant <hi>Rebadates, Statira</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus</hi>'s
relief unto you, which it seems the gods have esteemed me
unworthy to contribute unto; Fly then, and lose no time, lest you lose
them. Some Soldiers forthwith took up <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and carried him to
the next Help; In the mean time, <hi>Rebadates</hi> and ten more of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
leap'd into the Skiff, and having not only promised the fearful
Rowers their pardon, but exceeding great rewards, if they carried him
time enough to relieve their Princess, and me; Those timorous Men
tugg'd at their Oars so vigorously, that <hi>Rebadates</hi> soon perceiv'd he went
faster than those he pursued, and therein he was not mistaken; for those
in the Barge, both Rowers and Soldiers, being out of all danger from
the shore, had been at first so intirely taken up with their common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of revenging their dead Captain; and after they had been diverted
from that by the Princess, were so intent in observing what past between
her and his Brother, that thereby they made such slow way, as a small
Boat with few Rowers, might easily overtake them. <hi>Rebadates</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a far off the Barge full of Men, (for all in it standing up, made it
appear so to him) he did esteem it advisable, by a slight, to supply the
smallness of his number: He therefore order'd the Rowers to continue
their diligence, and on their Lives, by no word or signal, to give any
notice to their late Companions, whowere in the Barge; but rather, if
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:96335:327"/>
any question'd them, before they came near, they should answer, they
thought themselves happy they had only brought away themselves: He
then appointed all his Friends to keep themselves undiscovered, by lying
flat in the bottom of the Skiff with their Arms ready, that as soon as ever
they came to the stern of the Barge, they might with all their Arrows
salute the Enemy, and second that Salutation by leaping in with their
drawn Swords. These directions were not more exactly observed, than
the whole design happily succeeded; for, of all that were in the Barge,
some were wholly taken up in the employment I already mentioned;
and others, who looking towards the Skiff, saw none in it but the known
Rowers belonging to it, troubl'd not themselves in asking any questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they might at leisure be resolved off. This gave our Relief the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
they wished: And <hi>Rebadates</hi> lying himself at the Head of the
Skiff, when he came near the stern of the Barge, seeing a bloody Sword
high in the Air, was at once confounded and pleas'd at it; this, in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
it gave him, I still was alive, since I alone was in the Barge to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them; and that from an apprehension, 'twas so colour'd at my
cost: Therefore, starting up with all his Companions, just in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the <hi>Nicomedian</hi> was going to Kill me, by a happy Arrow he killed
him; and springing into the Barge with his Friends, he made such an
execution amongst his Enemies, that those of them who had escaped the
first furies of it, fled from the stern to the Head of the Barge, and
there, but by defending themselves, gave their Assaulters an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they needed not. Whilst <hi>Rebadates</hi> was thus employing his
Valour for my safety, one of his Companions was employing his Art for
the like end: 'Twas an Officer, who had received so often, and so many
Wounds, that by a dear experience he had no small Skill in the Cure of
any which were Curable; and, because the duty of his Profession often
called him unto danger, and his Courage oftner, he never went without
things necessary about him, for his own or his Friend's use: and seeing
me lye in that sad posture I was in, and that the fair <hi>Statira</hi> and <hi>Nerea</hi>'s
help (which they were honouring me with again) was too small for
a danger which seem'd so great; observing also, that his Companions
had not so much need of his assistance as I: He came to afford me his
in so seasonable a time, that he told the Princess, though he could not
warrant the event, yet he did assure her, Had his Service been never
so little delay'd, it could not but have proved fatal to me: But whilst
this obliging person was preserving me, his Friends were destroying my
Enemies, in which they prov'd so successful, that by that time I opened
my Eyes, I could see none of them in a posture of resistance; though
the last of them which had been so in a despair, and expos'd himself to
ten Swords, that he might pass his own through <hi>Rebadates,</hi> which he
did, but paid for that Wound, by the loss of his Life; yet <hi>Rebadates</hi> by
that he had received, fell, and needed the assistance of that Friend; as
soon as I had received from him all which then he could afford me. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others of those Gentlemen, by whose courage the Princess had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that deliverance, I was thought unworthy by the gods to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her, were so dangerously hurt, besides two which were Kill'd; that
had the Water-men in the Barge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had half so much courage as they had
fear, they might have done that with their Oars, which their Masters
fail'd of doing with their Swords: But these Men, conscious of their own
guilt, and well seeing which way the dispute was like to be decided,
and having no promise, or hope of pardon, whilst <hi>Rebadates</hi> and his
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:96335:328"/>
Friends were Fighting, and the Princess, <hi>Nerea,</hi> and <hi>Tomsones</hi> (for so was
that Gentleman called, who had dress'd my Wounds) were intently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
their care on me; the Water-men of the Barge had got into the
Skiff, and fled towards some boats they saw afar off; the Rowers also
of the Skiff fled with them, suspecting their past-Crimes would have a
more punctual payment, than their late Services a Reward, especially
those being voluntary, these constrained; so that by the time we were
deliver'd from our Enemies, we found our selves unable to return to our
Friends; at least did it so slowly, that before we had time sufficiently
to admire the Miracle of our deliverance, we saw we needed another to
secure it: For all the Rowers being fled, and not above two with <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones</hi>
being free from Wounds, and thereby, as well as by their unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
in using of an Oar, unable to Row, we moved so slowly towards
the shore, that our Water-men had time enough to overtake those Boats
and Persons they fled unto; who they found were <hi>Nicomedians</hi> flying
from their City to their King: These being fully inform'd how great a
prize was in the Barge, and how little resistance would be made in the
defence of it, and knowing well all the Boats and Barges in <hi>Nicomedia</hi>
were carried from the shore by their defeated Companions; they made
towards our Barge, hoping by presenting <hi>Nicomedes</hi> with so great a gift,
they might deface the blemish of their first unsuccessfulness. Their Barges
being so well fitted, and ours so ill, they had no great difficulty to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
us; and though <hi>Tomsones</hi> was a person of great Valour, yet having
but three sound Men in the Barge, and seeing about two hundred in
three others, and many more coming, thought it better to use his Tongue
than his Sword; and therefore began, as soon as they were within Call,
to capitulate with them: Telling them, though possibly their Numbers
might at length oppress him and his Companions, yet he assur'd them, ere
they did so, he would lessen them considerably; and therefore he offer'd
them, If they were Inhabitants of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> their pardons and full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity,
would they carry the Princess and me back to <hi>Mithridates:</hi>
If they were Soldiers of the Fleet of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and that they could
esteem a Lady, and a dying Gentleman fit Presents for them to make, and
him to receive, He would, upon their faithful Engagements of carrying
us with all Honour and Civility directly to their Prince, without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
yield himself upon the faith of that Ingagement. Whilst he
was thus talking with the several Companies which had surrounded him,
one of the <hi>Nicomedians</hi> which commanded in one of the Barges, came
gently behind <hi>Tomsones</hi>'s Barge, and then furiously leaped into it, as soon
as he had joyned it; but <hi>Tomsones</hi> soon made him find, that Treachery
should be more fatal to him that had designed it, than to him who was to
have suffer'd by it; for at first Thrust, he pass'd his Sword through him up
to the Hilt, and having thereby laid him Dead at his Feet; by a second
Thrust, having happily done the like to another; and his few Companions
by a brisk seconding him, &amp; mingling themselves amongst those which had
Boarded them, made them immediately with more Celerity abandon our
Barge, than they had entred into it; and the rest seeing how ill this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
surprize had succeeded, were so far from revenging, that they
openly condemned it, and began to listen to what had been offered;
esteeming it now a more hopeful thing to take us by Capitulation, than
by Force: Nay, some of the Soberest amongst them, sensible of the Ills
they were to suffer, by a wandring Sea-life, and probably an eternal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
from their Countrey and Estates, and therefore much moved
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:96335:328"/>
with the assurance of the contrary, of which they seem'd no way to
doubt, by reason of that great Influence the Princess had over her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(who, the more hopefully to conquer their doubts, had her self
confirm'd that offer made them by <hi>Tomsones</hi>) began to incline to the
first Proposal rather than the last, and had actually accepted of it, had
not amongst that number, (as almost amongst all others) the Indiscreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the Worst, been the most; who, being also of a condition which
rendre'd War their hopefullest Trade, and who expected more from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
by such a Present, than to recover of their own by returning;
and believing this manifested condescension of some of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
would, when known to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> render the Numbers which
were to share his Liberality, the less, and their Services which opposed it,
the greater, so loudly exclaimed against this, and so readily promis'd to
observe the other, that the less Number at length yielded to the bigger;
and We to both; <hi>Tomsones</hi> having first made them solemnly Vow, that
none should enter our Barge but Water-men to Row it, till we were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the victorious Fleet. This he did to secure himself, as much as his
condition did admit, that no incivility should be offer'd the Princess, nor
to me by a multitude, he apprehended, by what they had done, might not
be too averse to it; as also, that thereby he kept himself in no worse a
posture for defence, than he was in before the Agreement, should they by
any Treachery violate or break it. As soon as we had received our
Rowers on Board, inviron'd with all the other Barges, we moved direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Nicomedian</hi> Fleet, which lay at Anchor about thirty Furlongs
from us. All the time we were going thither, the Princess sat by me,
waiting for some stronger marks of Life, than hitherto I had given; and
conjuring <hi>Tomsones,</hi> by the most pressing words she could speak, to give
me all his Care and Skill; and, if after their separation and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Rebadates,</hi> or any of those generous Officers, to whom, as to him
she owed that little Life I had, wanted any thing which might contribute
to their Recovery, that he would acquaint her with it; for she promised
her self from <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Civility, all things of that nature which she
could ask. <hi>Tomsones</hi> assur'd the Princess of a perfect observance of all
her Commands: But begg'd, if I should Dye of my Wounds, that she
would not ascribe it to his neglect of them, for they were so deep and
dangerous, and I so weak, that at their first Dressing, he was not able to
form any certain judgment of them; but had more reason to fear the
worst, and to believe the best. These words, as he that spoke them
did afterwards assure me, drew some Tears from the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s Eyes,
and cast her into a Melancholy greater than she had discover'd for her
own Captivity. We had not now ten Furlongs to the Fleet, when I
began to open my Eyes again, and to recover so much Memory, as to
call to mind how I was brought to that sad Condition: and that the
danger <hi>Mithridatia</hi> had been in, was the cause of it. But not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing more, and the incertainty which that I knew left me in,
forced me to fetch a deep Groan, and to say, Oh gods! What is become
of the Princess? She her self being near enough to hear this Question,
had the goodness to answer it, by saying, I am here, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and have
not any greater trouble than what your danger gives me: Ah! Madam,
(I reply'd, turning my faint Sight towards that place from whence her
Voice came) Mine is not worthy your thoughts, much less your trouble;
but for the sake of the gods, tell me where you are, and what condition
you are in. The Princess justly believing the truth thereof would but
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:96335:329"/>
heighten my danger; told me, As to my condition, I have acquainted
you with it already; and as to the place, we are on the Water, and in
that Barge where the gods have so signally favour'd your safety, that I
cannot think, they will soon permit the loss of a Life, which by a Miracle
they even now have saved. Alas! Madam, (I reply'd) I find you are
not pleas'd to return direct answers to my humble desires; and therefore,
by your so telling me, you are not a Prisoner, you do but too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me you are one. Oh gods! (I continued) What has the unhappy
<hi>Callimachus</hi> done, that you have thought fit to call him out for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess's
deliverance, and then deny'd him the Honour of it, and yet permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to out-live it? Ah! Take again the Life you have lent me, it can
now only serve to torment me: No Honours nor Glories to come, can bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
this Infamy; to live to see the fair <hi>Statira</hi> a Captive, and made such
by my unhappy defence of her, is a Load too great for Life to support.
The deep Wounds these considerations gave me, not long after made me
relapse into a more dangerous Swoonding than any I had before; and
though <hi>Statira,</hi> in Expressions far above me, and Condescensions far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her, endeavour'd (whilst I was capable to hear and observe them)
to remove the cause of my despair; yet I thought it built upon too much
Reason, to permit it to be Vanquish'd; nay, that admirable goodness
which she shewed me, was so far from acting her desires, that it made me
but the more resolutely approve of mine own, which was to Die. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
having left me nothing more Elegible: since, if I recover'd, 'twould
be but to see that fair Princess in the Bonds of Imprisonment, whilst she
continued with <hi>Nicomedes;</hi> and in those of Marriage, as soon as she was
freed from the others, either of which was a misery that render'd Death
a less, than to behold one of them, Whilst I yet lay in a seeming Death,
we were come so near the victorious Fleet, that one of the Barges which
had conducted us, advanced faster than the rest, to acquaint the King how
they had fail'd of their first design, and what good marks they brought
him, that they had attempted it. This was the cause, that by that time
we were come to the side of the Admiral's Galley, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was ready
to descend into our Barge, which he did, and with many Civilities and
Respects, strove to render <hi>Statira</hi>'s loss of Liberty, as little uneasie as he
could. After she had convinced him, she was not unsensible of what he
said, and did; She told him, There is, Sir, in this Barge a Gentlemen, who
though he has been your Enemy, yet I will believe you will not deny
him your care. Madam, (said <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) I have already been told that
<hi>Callimachus</hi> is here, and dangerously Wounded; and though he has been
my Enemy in so high a degree, that by his Sword I have been kept out of
my Kingdom, and this Day out of the chiefest City of it; yet your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and the Duty I owe to Gallantry, though in an Enemy, shall make
my care of him be as great, as if his Wounds had been received for, and
not against me. <hi>Statira,</hi> as <hi>Tomsones</hi> afterwards assur'd me, gave <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
more Acknowledgments for what he had promis'd her for me, than
for what he had paid her, for her self; which had made the <hi>Bithynian</hi>
King tell her, I cannot, Madam, blame <hi>Callimachus</hi> for tying himself so
absolutely to your Service, since by the Honour of your Concernments for
him, he has that Duty so advantageously rewarded; and possibly, his
present condition is not so much to be lamented upon any account, as that
by it he is render'd uncapable to know these fresh Obligations you lay
upon him, and to pay you his Acknowledgments for them. <hi>Callimachus</hi>
(reply'd the fair <hi>Statira</hi> blushing) has too much hazarded himself for me,
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:96335:329"/>
not to make my care of him a Debt due unto him; and since he has been
Prodigal in obliging, I ought to be just in paying. But I believe, were he
to speak only the truth, he would esteem his now Condition more deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
by its rendring him uncapable to resent your generosity to him,
and to pay you his retributions for it, than on any other score; and since by favouring me he is reduced to that misfortune, be pleas'd to accept
of my Acknowledgments for him, till the gods render him able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with his own for himself. <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> who found by that little
disorder <hi>Statira</hi> had been in, that what he had intended only in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
was otherwise received, took a particular care, no more to err
on that side: But having in Magnificent terms, applauded the justness
and greatness of the Princess's care of me, he presented her his Hand to
lead her up into his Galley, and then told her; I know not, Madam, if
you have any other Commands to Honour me with, for any else in this
Barge; but if you have, I beg to receive them ere we go out of it. Sir,
(reply'd <hi>Statira</hi>) Here are some Gentlemen, who had not now been Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
or Wounded, if their civility to me had not involved them in
that misfortune: But I know they are in the power of a Prince, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
any Intercession of mine for their good usage, a needless thing. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
by bowing himself, acknowledged that advantageous opinion the
Princess had contracted for him; who, to evince it was a true one, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
some of his Officers to take as much care of <hi>Rebadates,</hi> and those
others that were hurt, as they would of their best Friends; and to give
all the rest any freedom they desired, but that of returning to <hi>Nicomedia;</hi>
and because he had understood <hi>Tomsones</hi> had dress'd me, &amp; was very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and skilful in curing of Wounds, he appointed him to be still near me,
and to lye in a Pallet in the next Cabbin to me. These Orders being given,
the Princess, helped by <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> ascended into his Admiral, and as
soon as she was come into the noblest Room of it, He acquainted her, That
her Brother, and the Prince, who was to have a happier and nearer relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to her, were in the same Vessel with her; and because he easily believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they would have longing impatiencies to wait on her, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
the sooner to afford them that Honour. <hi>Statira</hi> had scarce time
enough to reflect upon the prodigious changes of that Day, but she was
interrupted, first by the Arrival of <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> who carried his Arm in a
Scarf, having received a Wound which had necessitated him thereto; and
he having condoled their common misfortune, and magnified the high
Gallantry of the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he solemnly protested, transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his present misfortune; for while he had been generously disputing in
the Head of his Galley, there had enter'd a throng of Soldiers, which
had Boarded her on her Quarter, and had made him a Prisoner. <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
himself immediately after came in, but with Looks so dejected, that
<hi>Nerea</hi> told me afterwards, she more pitied his so ill Entertaining his
Misfortune, than his having fallen into it; and that <hi>Statira</hi> her self,
through all her reservedness, seem'd to think much more of it than she
would speak. The <hi>Cyprian</hi> Prince, having with all imaginable Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
paid his Respects to <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> folding his Arms th' one within
the other, and breathing some Sighs, told her; I thought, Madam, to
have been called one moment from the Temple, considering the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
occasion that carried me thither, had been infelicity enough to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all my Sins, but those of daring to lift up my desires to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Statira.</hi> But it seems the gods have placed a higher punishment
upon that noble and unavoidable offence; for they have not only defeated
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:96335:330"/>
my Fleet, which had the great honour to fight for you, but even before
your Eyes; and have made my Enemies surprise me into the infamy of
out-living it. But alas! I sadly find, they have reserved for me other
miseries, which make these hardly deserve that Name: for these chiefly,
if not wholly, relate to my self; and so much duty and veneration I owe
your Beauties, that these infelicities I could suffer as a just punishment of
my happy presumption, and as an easie purchase of that blessing your
extream mercy and condescension had rais'd me unto. But when I find,
that to all these Sorrows, I was reserved alive but to see my Princess in
captivity; and that that calamity is an undeniable effect of my unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfulness
in her Service (for, had I been victorious, where could the
treacherous <hi>Nicomedians</hi> have carried, and where could <hi>Nicomedes</hi> have
detained her?) That, Madam, wounds me above the Cure of Art, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Time, and makes me esteem my Enemies saving my Life, the
highest torment could befall it. Sir, (replied the Princess) I am sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of your misfortunes, and of the grief with which you bear them;
but cannot upon any terms ascribe them to that cause to which you do:
Though sometimes we do not know what those Sins are for which we
are punished; yet we still know, and should always confess, The gods
are just even in their punishments; and oftentimes repining at what is
done, we provoke them to do more. To do more (<hi>Ascanius</hi> hastily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
interrupting her)! Ah Madam, what can the gods do more than
they have done? And what can they make me suffer more than now I
do? When one endures a Torment which Death compared unto is an
ease, What can befall him worse, than by Life to be denied it? Oh gods!
(he continued) What has the wretched <hi>Ascanius</hi> done, that you have
made him feel, in the compass of a few hours, changes and miseries above
whatever any other did in the whole course of his life? What Triumphs
and Glories was I destin'd unto in the Morning? And what black &amp; deep
Calamities am I plunged into in the Evening? Pardon me, Madam, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beg you, that I do in your sight give vent unto a sorrow which your
sight does animate and heighten; and let your mercy so far indulge to
my condition, as to excuse me, if in an extraordinary grief I give evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it which are not common. <hi>Statira</hi> was going to reply, when
she was interrupted by <hi>Nicomedes</hi> his coming in to acquaint her, that he
paid so much obedience to her Commands, that he was not contented
only to order them to be observed, but he even then came from seeing
them obey'd: That <hi>Rebadates</hi>'s Wounds were not unpromising, but
that mine were not yet altogether so hopeful, yet that by Cordials I
was brought from my fainting: But that when he came from me, I had
neither opened my eyes, nor spoken. <hi>Statira</hi> for those new Obligations
gave <hi>Nicomedes</hi> new Acknowledgments. But <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Ascanius</hi>
not having heard of my being in the Galley, or wounded; and the first
of them expressing a desire to know how that misfortune was befallen
me; she gave them a relation of it in such advantageous terms for me,
that in it my Wounds and Sufferings were but too prodigally recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
At the end of the Princess's Narrative, one of <hi>Nicomedes</hi> his
chiefest Officers came to advertise him, That the Gentleman he had sent
to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> was return'd with an Answer from him, which made him
withdraw to receive it: And not long after, <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Ascanius</hi>
began to retire, to leave <hi>Statira</hi> to that quiet which both her Mind
and her Body but too much needed. But before they had finished their
parting-Ceremonies, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> returned again, and told <hi>Ascanius;</hi> Sir,
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:96335:330"/>
You are at liberty, at least you are no longer my Prisoner; for as soon
as you were made such, I sent to <hi>Mithridates</hi> to offer you in exchange
for the King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which he has accepted of: <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>
will be immediately here; and I have engaged my Faith to the <hi>Pontick</hi>
King, to send you to him. <hi>Ascanius</hi> (as <hi>Nerea</hi> afterwards told me, from
whom I had an account of those things, at which I was not present my
self) seemed at this advertisement to have a look mingled with joy and
astonishment; but immediately after, recollecting himself, he told <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi>
I am too much obliged both to the great <hi>Mithridates</hi> and you;
To you, Sir, for offering so advantageous an Exchange; and to him, for
accepting it. But you have now Prisoner, a Princess, who ought, the
first off all to cast off that unhappy condition; and if you can esteem
any, nay all those in her Father's power, an equal Ransom for her, and
accept of them, you will thereby act a greater Victory over us, than
your Sword has this Day given you. Do not, generous <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
esteem me so unworthy of liberty, as to accept of it, while my Princess
has lost hers; or to allow for my exchange, of a part of that, which
I hope will purchase hers. I confess (repli'd the <hi>Bithynian</hi> King) I
propounded you for <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> ere I knew of the Princess's
misfortune; but had I known of it earlier, I should have made
<hi>Mithridates</hi> no other proposal: for I know too well to value the
fair <hi>Statira,</hi> to think any exchange in the <hi>Pontick</hi> King's power, can
be proportionate for her: Nay, should I restore her to him for a quiet
re-possession of the Throne which he keeps me out of, I should yet
give him much above what I received from him. Will you (replied
<hi>Ascanius</hi>) accept of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> for me, and then me for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess?
that will in effect present you with two Kings for part of her
Ransom, and I shall eternally acknowledg I yet owe you more than
I have paid you, or more than ever I can pay. This I propound,
has a mixture of both those Virtues, in the manifestation of which, I
know you are concerned; The serving of your great Friend, and
your obliging the admirable <hi>Statira;</hi> which you will abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
by taking so little for what deserves so much. And your obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to me, will not be inferior, since to lose my liberty to restore
the Princess to hers, will in some degree repair my having lost her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
by first having lost my own. That which you have offer'd (said
<hi>Nicom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi>) will doubtless be better accepted of by the Princess, than
it can be by me: She is, in her self, and in my opinion, above all Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms;
and when I shall pay her the Duty I owe her, it shall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mixture, lest that should be esteemed a Bargain, which has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of so low a nature in it. This Noble Dispute (continued <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus</hi>)
lasted so long, that ere it was concluded, News was brought
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> that the King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> was so near the Fleet,
that he could hardly have time enough to meet him, if he any
longer defer'd going about it. This made the <hi>Bithynian</hi> King tell the
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> I wish, Sir, you were come to a resolution, for I have passed
my engagement to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as soon as I receive <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> to
return you to him. My resolution is already taken (repli'd <hi>Ascanius</hi>),
and a captivity at the feet of my Princess, is exceedingly preferable
to a Liberty which must force me from thence. Here <hi>Pharnaces</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himself, desired <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to go and receive <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi>
whilst he and his Sister would endeavour to perswade the King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus.</hi>
The <hi>Bithynian</hi> King, strangely perplex'd at the <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:96335:331"/>
went in great trouble to receive his Friend, whom he was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to send back, having avowedly in his power a sufficient exchange
for him, or else must deliver up the Princess <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> for whose
Exchange he had entertain'd such high hopes. On the other side, as soon
as he was gone, the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Pontus,</hi> had no
small trouble to vanquish the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King's resolution; neither could
they ever conquer it, till <hi>Mithridatia</hi> her self, having told him how
fix'd she found <hi>Nicomedes</hi> against her exchange; and that by his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
she would entertain hopes, in a few Moons he would get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such a Fleet, as might give her that freedom by his Arms, which
his great Overtures had failed of; and therefore, by all the power she
had over him, she enjoined him not to decline an Offer which also
might be resented by <hi>Mithridates.</hi> In short, <hi>Ascanius</hi> obey'd <hi>Statira</hi>'s
Commands, and <hi>Pharnaces</hi> Desires, which, when told to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
it gave him a satisfaction as great as his trouble lately had been; and
therefore he hasten'd away <hi>Ascanius,</hi> lest he should relapse, and lest
his stay in the Fleet, after <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>'s Arrival there, should make
<hi>Mithridates</hi> believe his generosity, and trust, had not had a fitting
Return The King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> before he went, kneeling at <hi>Statira</hi>'s
Feet, made her many earnest and high protestations of his Passion,
and solemn Vows of speedily freeing her from her restraint, or of
losing his Life, in the Duty of that attempt; conjuring her, by
all those things she honoured with her highest esteem, never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
that the misery of his being free from all Captivity (but hers)
when she was not, was a pure effect of his Obedience, which he hop'd
she would believe could not but be paid her in all things else, since
'twas not declin'd in this. <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> with her usual reservedness,
and civility, gave him a Return, and soon after <hi>Ascanius</hi> imbracing
<hi>Pharnaces,</hi> with whom he had contracted a strict Friendship, he took
his leave, having first visited <hi>Ariobarzanes, Nicomedes,</hi> and design'd
to do me also the like honour; but my condition render'd me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of it, being not then come out of my fainting. Whilst <hi>Ascanius</hi>
was returning to <hi>Mithridates, Tomsones</hi>'s Care and Art had been so
successful, that, by them, I was brought again to Life: <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> as soon
as he heard it, came to visit me; but being informed my weakness was
such, that to be spoken unto, or to speak, might be highly prejudicial to
me; he forthwith retir'd again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giving repeated Orders for my being us'd
as if I were his Son: Civility in him doing as much before he knew who
I was, as Nature it self could have done, had he known it. But being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd,
that my Recovery would be much hinder'd, if not endanger'd by
the motion of the Galley, and the straitness of room in it; and having
also observed <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> even while they were at Anchor in a good
Road, felt a disturbance, which yet she would not complain of; gave
Orders to weigh and steer their course for the Island of <hi>Scyros,</hi> which
was the only place the Kings of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> had left; in
which was a Castle, where they kept all their Magazines for their Fleets,
and where they usually detained their most important Prisoners: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Island was so considerable to them, as that the Loss of it would
be the loss of all; they had fortified that Castle in it so well, as it was
esteemed impregnable; two sides of it standing on a precipice over the
Sea, and the other two being cut off from the Land, by a deep Graft,
forced through a main Rock, with three Fortifications, one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
another, consisting of Walls, and Towers, of a prodigious
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:96335:331"/>
heighth and thickness, which clearly forbad all hopes of taking that
place, but by Treachery, Surprize, or Famine. <hi>Nicomedes</hi> the rather
hasten'd thither, because <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had yet one Wound, whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
needed rest and time. As soon as the whole Fleet was moving,
which by their late Fight needed the Recruits of their Stores; the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynian</hi>
King waited on <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> and told her, That to render her
misfortune the less uneasie, and more hopeful to observe her Commands
for me, he was going to Land her in a place where my Wounds might
be better looked after, and where she her self might resent less inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
than in that Element she now was on. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> also at that
time waited on her, to acknowledg the noble Treatment he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from her Father whilst he had been his Prisoner, and to assure her
of all the Respects he was able to pay her. <hi>Statira</hi> was not unsensible
of these Civilities, and by her Expressions convinced them of it: But
whilst she was in the midst of them, she was interrupted by the hasty
coming in of <hi>Tomsones,</hi> who told her; Madam, I hope you will pardon
this confidence, since 'tis in Obedience to your Commands; for having
done for <hi>Callimachus</hi> all that my Art has taught me, and having had Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
almost above my Hopes, he was no sooner come to Strength enough
to speak, but he asked a particular account of all that had passed since
his first fainting; and though I endeavoured all I could to disswade
him from a Relation, which I knew would have some fatal Operation
on him, yet his resolution was not to be conquer'd; and fearing, lest by
an obstinate silence he might imagine what was too bad, to be yet
worse, I gave him a particular relation of all, except of the Danger you
had exposed your self unto, in saving him; which was no sooner signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
than he cryed out, with much more Strength than I thought he had
been Master of; Great gods! Did you then reserve the unfortunate <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus</hi>
to the highest Honour, that of defending the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi>
only thereby to involve him in a proportionate misery, that of letting
her by his fault become a Captive! Yes, yes (he continued) You may
be severe to her, you may be cruel to me; but you shall not any longer
make me such unto my self: You may Cloathe me with Infamy, but you
cannot force me to wear it; that ought only to be the Livery of guilt: But
since you have made it the Livery of misfortune, thus I cast it off. At
these words, he began to tear off what bound up his Wounds: and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our holding him by force, was as dangerous to him by his strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as if he had left him at liberty to act his Despair; and that the
horrour of having been unsuccessful in your Service, only created it; I
ran, Madam, to inform you of it, that by your Presence, and your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
you may suppress it; for 'tis uncapable of any other Cure. These
words were scarce out of <hi>Tomsones</hi>'s mouth, when another of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
came running to confirm their truth; and to add, that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
in spight of all their opposition, opened one of my Wounds, and
that if I did the like to the greatest, such a Flux of Blood would run
from thence, that with it my Life would go away. <hi>Statira</hi> transported
with fear, and fill'd with an excess of goodness, having begg'd the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of the two Kings for leaving them, went precipitately to my Cabin,
which was not so far from hers, but that she could hear the Cries of those
that tended me; and as soon as she came thither, she found me in that
condition she had been informed I was in; and therefore, holding one
of my hands, she told me; Is it thus, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> that you evince your
Acknowledgments to the gods for their late preserving your Life! A
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:96335:332"/>
Life, they shewed themselves so much concerned in, that rather than
lose it, they chose to save it by a Miracle! The sight of the Princess,
with the words she spoke, and the action she did, put a period immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to all those effects of my sorrow and despair, and made me in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
full of Humility, reply; Can you still, Madam, can you still have
any care for a Person, who wanting success in the Honour of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
could out-live that misery? Or, do you esteem that Sin merits the
punishment of surviving it, as the highest can be inflicted on it? You
have committed no Sin, (said <hi>Mithridatia</hi>) but in endeavouring to act
that, which therefore has forced me to come and hinder it; not as a
punishment of what you could not do, but as a Duty for what you have
done: I have seen your Virtue shine in all Conditions, but Captivity;
and in that it chiefly evidences it self: the gods therefore have chose
sooner to deny your Courage its ordinary effects, than to deny your
Merit so extraordinary a Rise to manifest its greatness. Ah! Madam,
(I reply'd) interrupting her, Can you then so much as add unto my
Affliction, as to think it can proceed from my own being a Prisoner,
when even you your self are one, and made one by my fault? He,
Madam, that wanted not Fortitude to sustain the unhappiness of being
Ignorant what or from whence he is; of having in an object, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
extraction, Ambition fit for, if not transcending the highest;
and that could without Dying, see a misery to which Death is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preferable; He, I say, that could endure, and not sink under these
Burthens, cannot be suspected to fall under any others, abstractedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to himself: No, Madam, they are your Sufferings, occasion'd by
my Crime, that weigh me down unto Death; which I hope you will not
deny me to embrace, since I have no way but that left me to evince
to the World, my misery is not my fault; for none can justly believe he
that elected Dying, because he did not serve you as he ought, did neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to serve you as he ought for fear of Dying. Since (reply'd the
fair <hi>Statira</hi>) 'tis my condition only which inspires you with such Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
resolutions, I hall not much doubt to suppress them, when I mind
you, that to endeavour to remedy it, is more suitable to <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
than to despair of it. Can you think my Imprisonment a deep Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
And can you deprive me of that Arm, and Sword, by which I
chiefly hope under the gods to be delivered from it? If you act any
thing against your self after this assurance, I shall believe a despair from
your own Condition, rather than a sense of mine, invited you to it.
Alas! Madam, (I answer'd) What can be hoped for, from a Sword
and Arm, which could do nothing in your Service? It is now uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of any thing, but that only, to which therefore I would employ it.
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> said <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> You are too unjust to your self, and
thereby would become the like unto me; because when Wounded, and
Single, you could not for me destroy a multitude, you will therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
your self; you would thereby do more against me than Fortune
has done; for she has but robb'd me of freedom, but you would rob me
of the best, if not the only means of recovering it; She has flung me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the misery, but 'tis you will fling away the Cure of it. <hi>Tomsones</hi>
here whisper'd the Princess in the Ear, That these Discourses, if long
continued, would prove destructive to that end for which they were
made; She therefore putting on that Majestick Look, with which she not
only used to enjoyn Obedience, but by which she always obtained it,
told me; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> Believe me, I have use of your Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:96335:332"/>
I conjure you, and if that be not enough, I enjoyn you, nay, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you to act nothing against it; but observe all that <hi>Tomsones</hi> shall
prescribe you for the preserving of it; and if you have any value for
me, shew it by your Obedience in this. Ah! Madam, (I reply'd, with
a deep Groan) since you command me, you must be obey'd; but, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
when you find me plung'd in these miseries to which these Orders
do reserve me, you will then as much Lament the having enjoyn'd them,
as I do that you have done it now. If ever (said <hi>Statira</hi>) I should
be so unhappy as to see what you say, I shall be so Ingenuous as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
it, and so Just, as to free you then from this Injunction: But
(she continued) I have in my Care of your Life, I fear, too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd
it: I will therefore leave you to that Rest which your Health
cannot more need, than I do wish it you. She retired, having said so:
And <hi>Tomsones</hi> found me ever after perfectly obedient to the Princess's
Commands, in an exact observance of all his prescriptions. The Wind
favouring us, it was not long ere we arrived at the Island of <hi>Scyros;</hi> and
soon after, the Princess was conducted to the Castle of it by <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
with as much honour and respect as if the place had belonged to the
<hi>Pontick</hi> King. <hi>Statira</hi>'s Appartment was Magnificent, both for the
Largeness and the Furniture of it, and had an unlimited Prospect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea; next to hers was the Prince <hi>Pharnaces</hi>'s, and a little
beyond his I was Lodged: But though it were at some distance from
the Princess, yet by the obliging Neighbourhood of a long Gallery, I
could go to her Anti-Chamber, without passing through the other
Room. In this place my Wounds, as obedient to <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
as I or my Chirurgeons, began daily to mend, and so fast, that
I found I should be sooner ready to serve her, than restored to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of doing it. Every day, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> gave me
the honour of a Visit; and the Princess manifested her concernment in
my Recovery by often sending <hi>Nerea</hi> to enquire after it. I thought it
not strange that the King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> continued in the Island, whilst
the Defects of his Fleets were repairing; nor, that the King of <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi>
did it longer, because his Wounds were not so fully consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that the motion of the Sea might be both troublesome and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to him: But I admir'd that <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> when his Galleys were
fitted, did not employ them to improve by a new Success, the fresh one
his Conduct and Courage had given him, which was not more contrary
to his Interest, than his Practice. But alas! I had too many sad Thoughts
relating to my own Condition, to admit me to employ often any of them
upon anothers; and I could not fancy for what end <hi>Statira</hi> was so
concerned in my Life, resolving to give her self to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> which
would make it my Torment; neither could I imagine why the gods
had so strangely preserv'd me from Death; and as strangely, twice in
one Day separated <hi>Mithridatia</hi> from the King of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and by such
admirable ways had brought me to wait on her in her misfortunes; as
well as in a high Degree, to have been the unhappy cause of them. These
Generals, you may easily believe were not unfruitful in affording me
Particulars, which never left me unentertained; and never entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me with any thing that was clear, but that my Condition was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any Remedy, but that only which <hi>Statira</hi>'s positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
had forbidden me. Oh gods! (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) Had
I then known I was <hi>Nicomedes</hi> his Son, how many Miseries might I
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:96335:333"/>
have avoided? How many Battels by Sea and Land had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fought?
And some Lives had been spared, for which I joyfully
would have laid down my own: and for the loss of which, I shall
mourn whilst I have any Life. <hi>Callimachus,</hi> at these words, could not
resent a higher Grief, than invaded <hi>Artabanus</hi> and <hi>Artavasdes</hi> by their
sympathizing with him: which he saw so evidently, that it brought
at once an Accession to his Sorrow, and made him the sooner hasten
to conceal the effects of it by thus prosecuting his Relation. One
Evening, the Princess having sent the fair <hi>Nerea</hi> to visit me, (who
was much my Friend) I endeavour'd, as I had unsuccessfully several
times before, to win her to such a sense of, and concernment for my
Condition, as thereby to learn something less obscurely what <hi>Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
Inclinations were towards me, than her own excessive Reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
would allow me to discover from her self; and finding <hi>Nerea</hi> was
less unwilling then to listen to words of that nature, than she had been
before; after some Introductory Discourses, I spoke to her to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
That great Goodness which you have on all occasions mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to me; and that great Necessity I shall have to hope in it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
will give you the trouble of my disclosing to you some Thoughts
and Secrets, which I am so far from imparting to any other, that I dare
hardly impart them to my self: Yes, fair <hi>Nerea,</hi> I have the highest and the
most improbable Design of any man living; and having told you so much,
I need not tell you any more to acquaint you with it. A Design, which
cannot promise more felicities, if it succeeded, than there are impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities
to prohibit so much as the hopes of its Success; a Design I
so much despair of effecting, and am so criminal in undertaking, that
I would now have Died of these Wounds, as much upon the account
of the last of these Causes, as the first, had I not received an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Command to the contrary from the Princess, whom to disobey
would hardly have been a greater Sin, than to obey will be a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to me. But, Oh gods! <hi>Nerea,</hi> if you have any pity for this
unhappy <hi>Callimachus,</hi> Tell him, tell him, I beseech you, for what
end it is he is enjoyned to Live; since he sees nothing in Life, which
makes not Death as desirable to him, as it ought to be dreaded by
the too happy <hi>Ascanius.</hi> Since (reply'd <hi>Nerea</hi>) You are pleas'd to
make me your Confident, I shall endeavour to deserve that Trust by
all ways, but those, which in my opinion may render me unworthy
of it; and therefore I will not scruple to acquaint you, That my
own Observations of you, told me that long since which now you
tell me; and from the first hour I had reason to believe what now
I do, I had as much reason to deplore the Design you engaged in:
Such a confluence of Obstacles being visible, and many more invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that the Result was not more apparent to me, than I doubt it
will be unsupportable to you. 'Tis not that your Services have not
been highly Eminent, and many; nor that they have been paid to
a Person insensible of them: But—Here <hi>Nerea</hi> stopp'd; and
therefore I did by fresh and vehement Implorings, beg her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
and at last vanquish'd by my Prayers or Importunities, she
thus proceeded: But, the power of the Father, and his Engagement
also; the punctual obedience of the Daughter, and the Ignorance of
your Extraction, outweigh all your Actions, and turn the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale so
heavily, that the possibility is not great, it will ever be rais'd again:
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:96335:333"/>
You see (said <hi>Nenera</hi>) I flatter you not; for having profess'd a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to you, and Sincerity being the noblest part of Friendship, I
had rather practise it, though it might afflict you, than the contrary,
though it might please you. That (I reply'd, fetching a Sigh) which
you now have told me, has been hitherto my highest Apprehension;
and by your telling it me, it becomes as high a Certainty; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
since it is so, How can <hi>Statir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> enjoyn me to Live? If she says, I
have been too presumptuous in daring to lift up my Eyes to her; I
am so far from denying it, that I would have Dyed, that I would
have Killed my self to have revenged her, and to have punished my
self: And possibly a voluntary Death embrac'd by an Offender,
should be a sufficient expiation for an unavoidable Offence. 'Tis in
this only, obliging <hi>Nerea,</hi> that I will now beg your Assistance; and
since so many invincible Impediments deny me the expectation of
obtaining her Esteem, I will not despair, but by your Intercession to
obtain her Mercy; and that is, her Permission to Dye. Possibly
(said <hi>Nerea</hi>) you could hardly ask any thing of her, which she would
not sooner grant you; I say, any thing whatever; and even all those
Obstructions I so lately particularized, might be sooner vanquish'd,
than this one Request yielded unto. No, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> she has a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for you, and such a one, that had her Inclinations the Liberty
of a free Acting, possibly you would not have too much cause to
complain; Think not therefore to employ my Services in so fatal
and ungrateful a Request; for she that to save your Life, so recently
expos'd her own to an eminent Danger, will not by a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
give that away, which she has shewed is not indifferent to her.
I was strangely surprised at these words, and therefore raising my
self up hastily, I begg'd her to explain what they meant. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told me what <hi>Tomsones</hi> had concealed from me, and thereby
fill'd me with so much Trouble, Satisfaction and Amazement, that
for a while I remain'd as Moveless and Speechless, as after I came
to my self, I found I had too much cause to wish I had eternally
continued. As soon as I could speak, I cryed out, Great gods! Was
I not miserable enough in the disability of not preserving <hi>Statira</hi>'s
Liberty, and in surviving that Crime and Misfortune, but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I must also have been the occasion of hazarding even her Life?
Ah! Farewel those Griefs which hitherto tormented me: <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>'s
Authority, <hi>Statira</hi>'s Obedience, <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s Felicity, and my
own concealed Extraction; These deserve no longer that Name, nor
can any longer act their usual Effects, compar'd to what now I have
resented. Those only related to me, but this to my Princess; for
whom my Concerns are higher than any I can have for my self, as
much as she is above me, or my Designs above my Birth or Merit.
<hi>Nerea,</hi> who hoped what she had acquainted me with, would have
had a contrary Effect, to that she now too late found it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in me, left no Reasons unspoken to suppress that Despair she
had so unexpectedly cast me into; and though she did long insist
upon the too great Right and Empire, which <hi>Statira</hi> had over that
Life she had saved, for me to destroy it without, nay, against her
Permission; and how by that Action of hers I might be convinced,
my Preservation was not inconsiderable to her; since even, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
an unfortunate Life, as I term'd it, she eminently indanger'd
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:96335:334"/>
her own: Yet it was a long time ere she could reduce me to any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Thoughts; neither had she ever brought me to that desired Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
but upon reiterated promises of her Assistance, and of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
my Concernments with her best Care and Affection; which by
that high and great esteem <hi>Mithridatia</hi> had for her, gave me some
hopes; but such faint ones, that though I could not but entertain
them, yet I could not tell why I did so. <hi>Nerea</hi> having staid much
longer than she had used, or than she had designed, no sooner found
me fit to be trusted with my self, but she left me to my self: The
only Company I could justly desire, and the worst I could keep.</p>

               <p>I Fear (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) thus retailing my Story, I shall
make the Relation of it as unsupportable to you, as the Events
in it are to me; I will therefore acquaint you, that after a
few days, I recovered Strength enough to walk the length of
that Gallery, which was between my Lodging and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess's
Apartment; and welcoming that dawning Health I then injoy'd,
only as 'twas an effect of my Obedience to her Commands; and in
hope, that I might by it be inabled to serve her: I sent to beg her
Permission to wait on her, which she was pleased to send me; and
I, soon after, to make use of. By accident there was none but <hi>Nerea</hi>
with her, when I came into her Chamber; and therefore, with the
less constraint, I had the opportunity of Kneeling before her, and
of telling her, I am come, Madam, to lay that Life at your Feet,
which is yours upon so many Accounts, that I durst not end it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your leave, much less against your Commands; though by its
great unhappiness in having fail'd serving you, and its infinitely
greater, in thereby having engaged your Goodness to indanger yours,
it merited a thousand Deaths; and if I can support its being unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
'tis only because thereby I suffer a more signal Punishment,
than by the most tormenting Death could be inflicted on me. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>
having made me Rise by her repeated Commands, was then
pleas'd to answer me: Since by your belief that I have a Right to
your Life, I have thereby obtained a power to preserve it; I will not
deny a Title, which though no just one, yet is very advantageous
and obliging to me; and though as yet I see no visible means for
my deliverance, yet I will not despair of it, the gods having given
me so powerful an earnest of it, as your recovery of Health: which
when you injoy'd, I have been freed from a more hopeless and more
unpleasing Condition than now I am in. Madam, (I reply'd) That
eminent Virtue and Innocence, which has shined so bright in the
whole course of your Life, may well invite you to believe, though
the means of your speedy Releasment is not now visible, yet it is
certain: But alas! Madam, my Crimes make me despair of the honour
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:96335:335"/>
of contributing to it; for he that could not rescue you at first from
being a Prisoner, and could afterwards survive that Infamy, cannot,
I fear, be reserved for a happiness even too great for a Person of the
most unblemished Fortune: But yet, Madam, this I do promise you,
if ever I am bless'd with the opportunity once more to draw my
Sword for your deliverance, if I be not so happy as to Act it, I will
avoid being so miserable as to out-live it; and by a second Attempt,
repair You, or punish on my Self, the misery of my unsuccessfulness.
But, Madam, since yet we hear nothing from <hi>Ascanius,</hi> nor that the
generous <hi>Ataphernes</hi> has yet a probability of getting together a Fleet
able to force his passage with an Army hither; Why may there be
no endeavours used by Treaty, to win <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to pay you the
Duty of restoring you to Freedom, since with so much cheerfulness
he pays you every one else? And though the way by which you lost
it, being by Arms, seems to require by the like way your Restauration,
and that by no other means but those, I have so much as an expectation
to serve you; yet so much I prefer your Satisfaction before all things
else, that I cannot but pray for any way which may lead to such an
End. I confess, (said the Princess) that <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s usage is so full of
Generosity, that since there wants nothing to compleat the Evidencing
of his, but restoring to Liberty a Person, whose loss of it is neither
considerable to him, or his Enemies; neither would her Recovery of
it be otherwise. I have admired at my Detension, especially <hi>Ataphernes</hi>
having so far prevail'd with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as to offer him so high a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for me, with the choice of having it, either in Treasure, or the
Value thereof, by restoring some Towns and Countries in <hi>Bythinia</hi> to
his immediate Possession: But it seems nothing will satisfie <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
in Exchange for me, but the intire Resignation of all <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and
<hi>Cappadocia;</hi> so that by asking so much, I begin to fear he has no mind
to part with me; nor can I ever get out of his hands, but by force;
and therefore could I any way contrive your Inlargement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should
hope, that a Fleet led by <hi>Ataphernes</hi> and <hi>Callimachus,</hi> would soon win
what an unfortunate Fleet had the unhappiness to lose: And in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
I have not been Idle, though I have been Unsuccessful; for though
<hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omedes</hi> over-values me, yet he knows justly how to value you; and
therefore, though but a little before your coming now to visit me, I
was impowered by <hi>Ataphernes</hi> to propose to him as much for your
Releasment, as <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> offer'd for his, when he was my Father's
Prisoner, yet I received a positive Denial, with an assurance, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could put an end to your Imprisonment, but the end of the War
between him and my Father; and that his Friends in <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> by
presenting you unto him, had given him that, which he more valued
than his Victory over the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and my Brother, and his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made them both his Prisoners. Madam, (I reply'd) prostrating
my self again at her Feet, (from whence she immediately made me rise)
I am not able sufficiently to admire your Goodness, or deplore my own
Infelicity, that, where I owe both my Life and Liberty, I must, instead
of paying them to you, receive them from you; and though those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
offers you were pleas'd to make <hi>Nicomedes</hi> for a worthless Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
be above all things, but your Goodness, and my Wonder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
at it; yet I cannot but esteem my self more obliged to him in
the refusal, than I could have been in the acceptance of them: For I
know not, if I were at liberty, whether my usual unhappiness might
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:96335:335"/>
not involve me in that greatest, of being unable to serve you; but by
being in restraint, I have the honour to suffer with you; and therefore,
I had rather have a certainty of this, than run a hazard of that: But, I
confess, Madam, I have not been without Thoughts, Why so active a
Prince as <hi>Nicomedes</hi> hitherto hath been, has continued so long uselesly
here, after his Navy was repair'd, and after his late Victory had offered
him so large a cause for hope, if in the heat of that Success, he had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
improved it: It may possibly give me occasion to believe,
there is something in this place which he prefers to his Revenge, his
Glory, and the Recovery of his Throne: I admire also, at his setting
a Value upon what is above all; for nothing can fully pay the setting
you at liberty, but the satisfaction of having done that Duty, without
any other Consideration, but the honour of the performance. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
has Acted a double Ill; to detain you a Prisoner at all, or, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to detain you, to offer your Redemption at any Rate. And, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if I may presume to tell my humble Apprehensions, I must say,
I know not which has done worse; <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> since he will Sell you,
asking no more; or <hi>Mithridates,</hi> since <hi>Nicomedes</hi> will Exchange you,
proposing so little: The Kingdoms of <hi>Bythinia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> ought
not to be put in Balance with one moment of your Trouble, much less
with your Liberty: The common Consequences of Battels, are the
winning of Kingdoms, which is a happiness not to be named in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
with the Guilt of letting the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> continue a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Ah! Madam, Why have the gods made those only which have
the Power to serve you, so unwilling to do it? And him that has so
highly the Will, so little the Power to do it? Were <hi>Bythinia</hi> and <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia</hi>
mine, and were the giving up those two Crowns the Price of
your Ransom, I would pay it with an unexpressible Contentment, and
resent more Happiness in being so divested of Monarchy, than any could
injoy by possessing that of the whole World. That which I had spoke
of my Apprehensions, concerning <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s continuance in the Island,
and what I had spoke in the latter part of my Answer, had covered
<hi>Mithridatia</hi> with Blushes; and therefore the sooner to take me off
from an intent considering of them, She reply'd, with a little smile; I
perceive, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> though I am unlikely to recover my Liberty,
being <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Prisoner, I should have been much more unlike, had
I been Yours; for, by condemning my Father in refusing so much, you
thereby shew, you would have demanded more: But let us not mispend
our time in discoursing of things which are past, and on things that will
not be; but rather imploy it, to mind what may be, that is, your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;
and as a consequence of that, I shall hope for mine: 'Tis
not improbable, but some of those Officers, to whose Care you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
may have their Fidelity to <hi>Nicomedes</hi> conquer'd by that Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
<hi>Mithridates</hi> was offer'd him for you; and that I will assure them
of, if they will act your Releasment any way. Madam, (I answer'd)
Possibly in what I said, you might have found more cause to believe
I detested <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Crime, than that I would have increased it, had
it been in my Power. Could such a vast Misery have again befallen
you, as to be a Prisoner; And could such a vaster Guilt have befallen
me, as to have made you mine; You could not, I hope, imagine, I
would practise more wickedly that Sin I condemn in another; nor that
I would part with Kingdoms to purchase you from a misfortune, which,
had I the Power to exempt you from, I would continue you in: Let
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:96335:336"/>
it, Madam, I most humbly conjure you, suffice, That I am so criminal,
and miserable in my Condition, and Actions, and make me not more so
in your Thoughts, where I would appear to You, what I am to my
Self in my own, that is, a Person, who, during the whole course of
his Life, would serve you as perfectly in all things as you can imagine;
and would sacrifice it a thousand times, rather than one moment ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a contrary Thought. I believ'd, (said <hi>Statira</hi>) That the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which I spoke, would easily have convinced you, that my Words,
and my Intentions, were different; but since you entertain them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than I meant them, I will seriously assure you, I have no ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Esteem for you; nor will I believe, 'tis in the power of Fortune
ever to force you to an Action which may invite me to alter it: But
since you do renew your Promises of obliging me in all things, Do it,
I beseech you, in this particular I so lately mention'd to you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of you. Madam, (I reply'd) I pay you my humblest Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
for the Justice you do me, in believing what you now said
you believed of me; and for your extream Goodness, in giving that
belief so prodigal a Reward, as the high honour of your Esteem. But,
doubtless Madam, I should too certainly deserve to be eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of it, if, having a hope, that <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Officers could be won,
I did not indeavour to win them for your Liberty, for the recovery
whereof I would for ever with Joy lose even the very hopes of my
own. Banish, I beseech you (reply'd the Princess) all expectations
of that nature, unless you can hope to win <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to himself; for of late, he has Dismissed all his Officers that Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and performs that Trust himself with a greater Assiduity than
all of them till then did; and therefore, to design my Freedom any
way but by force, is so far from being fit to be attempted, that 'tis
not rationally to be hop'd: But if my Enlargement be considerable to
you, evince it, by a speedy endeavouring your own, and omit no ways
to obtain it; that in your Liberty, I may have grounds to believe I
shall speedily after recover mine. I was about to reply, when <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>
came into the Chamber to visit his Sister: He was very much
surprised to find me there, and seem'd much more pleas'd to see me so
well recovered; soon after his Arrival, there came in also <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
and <hi>Ariobarzanes:</hi> The first of them, after having paid his respect to
the Princess, told me what noble Offers she had made him for my
Enlargement; and that the high Value he had for me, not any Hatred
to me, had made him decline them; which, if ever an Agreement was
made between the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and Him, should be manifested, by
giving me an unransomed Liberty. I gave him a Return suitable to
his Degree, and to his Civility, and soon after, went back to my own
Lodgings; having now in the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s, too many Witnesses to
permit me to continue those Discourses which they had so disobliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interrupted. Several Days things continued in the state they then
were in; and yet, to our Admiration, we heard nothing of <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s
intention to leave us, or of <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s preparations to help us; though
almost every Day, by our Conquerour's civility, an Express from <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi>
was admitted to the Princess, to bring him an account of her
Health, and to acquaint her with his yet unsuccessful Indeavours for
her Inlargement. That generous Prince had also the Goodness, by the
same opportunities, still to be inquisitive after my Recovery; and to
assure me of his utmost Assistance, towards the freeing me from my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment;
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:96335:336"/>
which because <hi>Mithridatia</hi> had so positively and repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded me to endeavour my self, I did busie my Thoughts about
it, and was not over-troubled, that the more I reflected on it,
the less likelihood I found of it. For had I escaped, I had fallen into two
of those misfortunes which I most apprehended; The being banished from
the happiness of waiting on her; and by <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s wanting a Fleet,
from the hopes of serving her; nay, I knew not whether sometimes I
were not almost so unworthy, as not to grieve at her Imprisonment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that my Rival should deliver her, and after marry her.</p>
               <p>One morning, when I was alone in my Chamber, <hi>Rebadates</hi> came into
it, being recover'd of his wounds, and having obtain'd of his Keeper
leave to do it. I was pleas'd to see so good a friend past that danger, which
his kindness to me had in part cast him into: But the business he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
did not a little perplex me; for he came to tell me, That having found
his Keeper was a Person to be wrought upon, he had therefore made him
such large Offers, if he would connive at his escape, that he had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them, and promis'd the succeeding night so to order all things, that
without interruption he should get away; that he had given him a rich
Jewel he wore about him, so concealed, that none of <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had discovered it, as an earnest of the rest, when he was free. But, said <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badates,</hi>
I have thought that he which could do this for me, might do it for
you; and therefore I am come to assure you, I had rather you should have
your freedom, than I mine; for an easie Ransom may deliver me; but I am
assured you are valued above any. Therefore I conjure you, Sir, deny not
this proffer of my Service, having by my now Condition no other way
but that, to pay you any. I embraced and thanked <hi>Rebadates</hi> for this
high evincement of his kindness, though I wished perfectly he had never
conferr'd it on me; and then told him, That if his Keeper could employ
his Industry for acting the enlargement of the Princess, it would be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
indeed, and should be paid with Treasures which should enrich him
and his Posterity. I did already (said <hi>Rebadates</hi>) propose that unto him,
but he cut me off with an assurance that it was impossible, since his King
himself guarded her. But when I proposed you unto him, he seem'd not
to be out of hopes thereof, and has within an hour promised to bring
me a good account of his Endeavours therein; and I have promised
him he should receive from <hi>Mithridates</hi> a proportionate Reward to the
greatness of that Service; for he assured me, if he could contrive your
Escape, he must accompany you in it; since that would be a Crime above
the hope of pardon, though it were attributed to Carelesness, and not
Design. I will not trouble you (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) with the Dispute I had
with <hi>Rebadates,</hi> to perswade him to embrace the opportunity of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;
nor in telling you the Trouble I was in when I could not
prevail with him: for he was unconquerable in his Civility to me. And
soon after he withdrew, to learn from his Keeper what success he had met
with, that he might acquaint me with it, whereby I might accordingly
provide my self for that appointed hour. To be short, after he had with
some impatience waited for his Keeper's Return, some hours beyond the
prefixed Time, his Chamber-door was hastily open'd, and instead
of his Keeper, a rude Stranger came to him, and told him, his whole
Design was discovered, and the Manager of it put to a painful Death
for his intended Treachery; and that, since he and I so unworthily
abused that Liberty the Kings had allowed us, we should suffer for
that Offence: I being now confined positively to my Chamber, with new
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:96335:337"/>
and more numerous Guards; and he being expresly sent to keep him
from the hopes of any new design. This which this Officer told
<hi>Rebadates,</hi> was too true: for the unhappy Keeper, sounding the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of one whose help he was to need in my escape, did it so uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly,
that he discover'd his own, which the other went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to the two Kings, who punished the Keeper with death, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us to our Chambers, with Guards too numerous and too faithful to be
deceived or corrupted. I did indeed with much more trouble endure the
being denied the Happiness of waiting on <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> than my loss of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or the narrow limits I was confined unto. But one evening when I
was in a deep sadness for <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s and my own Condition, <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
alone came into my Chamber, and having lock'd the door after him, he
told me; I am come, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> to act a thing which possibly you will
wonder at, and possibly you would more wonder at, if you were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the cause, for I come to restore you to your Liberty;
and that which lately <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s great Officers, and which is much
more, the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Commands, could not prevail with me to do,
I now perform of my Self, without any consideration, but that of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
so worthy a Person, and perhaps of saving him too. But I doubt
I have said too much, in those last words; at Midnight therefore, fit
your self to follow <hi>Ostanes,</hi> the Officer that now Guards you, who will
bring you a Disguise, by which he will safely conduct you to a Vessel in
a small Creek, which has Orders to carry you where ever you will go.
All that I ask of you, is, that you keep an inviolable Secrecy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the means of your Escape: Let it always be believed, an effect of your
having corrupted the Fidelity of <hi>Ostanes,</hi> who is one I intirely Trust,
and much Esteem; and whom I recommend to your Favour, till I may
again by some fortunate Accident, openly restore him to mine. I confess,
(continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) few Accidents in all my Life surprised me more
than this; and the longer I reflected on it, and every circumstance of it,
the more cause I had still to continue that Reflection: I told <hi>Nicomedes</hi>
so much; and after, by many Acknowledgments I had endeavour'd to
exalt the Gallantry of this Action, and the gratitude I had for it, I said
unto him; Generous Prince, though after what you have done, there
might seem nothing left for me to do, but to endeavour, by continued
Services, to pay you some part of my vast Debt; yet I must by an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Request add unto, and increase it: 'Tis, that you will pardon me, if,
as soon as my hands are free, I use them against you; or else, that you
will not restore me to a Liberty, which I must forthwith imploy against
the Giver of it: For whilst you keep the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> a Prisoner, I
must as certainly be your Enemy, as in all things else, I will be your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
When I told you, (the King of <hi>Bythinia</hi> reply'd) That I would set
you at Liberty, I told you too, I exacted nothing of you, but your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
neither after the Declaration you now make me, do I expect any
thing else, but a Grant of that which I desired of you before. This (said I)
is a Gallantry worthy of <hi>Nicomedes;</hi> and this is a higher Favour, than his
free Breaking of my Imprisonment; and therefore Loads me with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Trouble, than by it he has freed me from: A Trouble which shall never
cease, but with my Life, unless by some retributions, as eminent and signal
as the Sense I have of your Generosity, I be inabled to act my Gratitude
for it. That silence you injoyn me, I vow Religiously to observe, and by
my kindness to <hi>Ostanes,</hi> I shall indeavour to make him endure his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from you, as little inconveniently as may be, and in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:96335:337"/>
convince him, by the respect I shall pay the Subject, how highly I
esteem my self indebted to his Prince: Of whom also, I will not beg to
know why such a Secrecy is injoyned me; because I perceive, that
ought to be as much a Secret to me, as from whose obligingness I owe
my Deliverance, ought to be to every one else: Though, Sir, I must
assure you, 'tis no small Trouble to me, being so deeply in your Debt,
to be prohibited from publickly acknowledging it, till I shall be so happy
as to pay it: But, Sir, since this Action, when known to the Princess
<hi>Statira,</hi> will, I hope, procure you her Thanks for it, which will be no
ill Reward of it, though it will not at all diminish my Score; May I
not beg your Permission before I go, to tell her of my going, and from
whom I derive that Liberty, that in her Acknowledgments to you,
you may have cause never to repent what you have done to me, if my
own unhappy Condition should not allow me the satisfaction of doing
any thing by way of Retribution for my self. I am sorry, <hi>Callimachus, (Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
reply'd) That you should ask me any thing I should deny you:
But I hope, when you remember, that for above twenty Days, you have
been kept with such strictness, that you have not been permitted to see any
one, nor to be seen by any, should you just before your Escape, have that
Freedom allow'd you by me, for it cannot be by any other, it might raise a
suspition, by what means you obtain'd it; and by destroying that end, for
which I have desired so perfect a Secrecy from you, draw a greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
upon me, than I believe, could I acquaint you with it, you would
have me run into. But to omit nothing for your satisfaction, I will possibly
contrive some way before the hour of your departure, whereby you may
acquaint the Princess with it, and receive her Commands before you leave
her; though neither She her self, nor the Person imploy'd between you,
must upon any terms know I have the least hand in, or so much as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of your Escape. Perhaps (continued <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) one Day I may live
to tell you, Why I have thus dealt with you: But if such a thing should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happen, oblige me, in believing there was reason for it. As soon as he
had done speaking, he immediately withdrew, and with as little Noise as
he had made when he came in; leaving me, not so full of wonder at the
Action, and the Circumstances accompanying it, as of Trouble, that now
I must forsake either my Princess, or highly Disobey her. The unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this ill Choice, entertained me till an hour before Midnight,
when I was interrupted by my Doors being opened, and by seeing <hi>Nerea</hi>
come into my Chamber, who, in many Blushes, for so undue a Time to
give me a Visit, told me, She now did it, because <hi>Ostanes</hi> a little before
had whisper'd to her, there was a very great and real necessity of her
coming to me immediately, where, possibly she might hear of things not
unpleasing to her; but that she was to come then, or never: She told me,
that having inform'd the Princess thereof, she had forthwith injoyned her
to come to me, which Orders she had obey'd, being conducted to the Door
by <hi>Ostanes,</hi> who had open'd, and then was waiting at it for her Return.
After that I had paid her my Acknowledgments for the favour of her
Visit, which could not be so unseasonable, but that her Virtue would
preserve it from being thought so by any, that had the happiness to know
her; I gave her an Account, how that above my Expectation, and even
above my Desires also, a certain way was offer'd me, of escaping that
Night; the Overture whereof I could not decline listning to, because
it was <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s repeated Commands; but that I so much preferr'd
being a Prisoner when she was one, before Liberty, when she was deni'd
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:96335:338"/>
hers, that at the same time, I told her, probably I could Escape; I begg'd
her leave, not to do it, though by being of late deprived of the high
Duty and Happiness of waiting on her, I had been deprived of my only
comfort in my Imprisonment, which yet I supported without repining, as
a righteous Judgment, for having been Guilty of the Princess's. <hi>Nerea</hi>
told me, she would carry my Message, and durst tell me my Answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she had received it. To be brief, she went immediately to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datia</hi>'s
Chamber, told her what I had said, and brought me a positive
Command, to lay hold of that opportunity which was so happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
me, by which she now had more than hopes of soon being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to her Liberty also. <hi>Nerea</hi> told me at the same time, if I should
delay my Obedience to these Orders, it would trouble the Princess al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as much as her restraint. She did acquaint me too with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
I did think somewhat strange, which was, that as she was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me, passing by <hi>Pharnaces</hi>'s Chamber-door, she perceived <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
gently coming out of it, who no sooner saw her, but he hastily shut
the Door again, and seem'd by his Looks to be in no small disorder at
his having been seen by her at that hour in that place. I had not
much leisure then to reflect upon this assurance, being so incessantly
press'd by <hi>Nerea</hi> to that Obedience <hi>Statira</hi> had commanded me, and so
concernedly expected from me; which at last I resolved to pay her, and
begg'd <hi>Nerea</hi> to acquaint her therewith, who immediately retired to do
it. And not long after, <hi>Ostanes</hi> came into my Chamber with a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-coat
of one of <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Guards, which I put on, and being led by
him, I past all the Soldiers, and came to that Creek where the Vessel
staid for me; and all things being in readiness, the Wind too favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, I desired them to direct their course for <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> to which
City in two Days we arrived without meeting any Impediment: I
went first to the Appartment of the generous <hi>Atafernes,</hi> whom I found
in a deep Melancholy in his Closet; and because he protected to me
my Absence and Imprisonment did partly cause it, he forthwith cast
off so large a proportion of it, as did evidence the reality of that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;
and after many Embraces he honoured me with, and many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
after the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Health and Condition, he was pleas'd
to acquaint me, how many ways he had endeavour'd to to get a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Force able to Land his Army in the Island of <hi>Scyros,</hi> to restore his
Sister, his Brother, and me to our Liberty: But that the late Victory
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> obtained, had so terrified all Auxiliaries from serving against
him, that even in that Success, he not only ruin'd the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet,
but almost the hopes of ever getting another together to oppose him:
He further told me, That as soon as <hi>Ascanius</hi> was defeated, he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with <hi>Mithridates</hi> to post away <hi>Betuitus,</hi> then somewhat recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that tedious Indisposition he had so long Languish'd under, into
<hi>Cylicia</hi> to engage all the Naval strength of that Nation; in which <hi>Betui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
had been so diligent and successful, that whilst <hi>Ascanius</hi> was here Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting
the King and Court, acknowledging the high Favour of his inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
excusing his Loss to them, and making many positive Assurances of
repairing his Defeat, and restoring <hi>Statira</hi> and <hi>Pharnaces</hi> to their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<hi>Betuitus</hi> had so far engaged the chief <hi>Cylician</hi> Sea-men, that when
<hi>Ascanius</hi> was return'd to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he found in his own and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
unsuccessfulness, his Maritim Strength so exhausted, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to send to hire a foreign Help; but he could procute none, by
reason of their pre-ingagement to my Father's Admiral. But the <hi>Cyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
                  <pb n="749" facs="tcp:96335:338"/>
hired by <hi>

                     </gap>etuitus,</hi> are not near enough with that little Sea-strength
<hi>Mithridates</hi> has left, to form a Fleet strong enough of themselves to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>Nicomedes;</hi> so that, though by preventing <hi>Ascanius,</hi> we have not
done our selves much good, yet we have hinder'd him from wholly
ingrossing that Force, which is necessary to reduce the Island of <hi>Scyros.
Betuitus,</hi> who is a faithful Servant to our Family, and particularly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionated
to <hi>Statira</hi> and me, having receiv'd a private Advertisement
from me, how passionately I desir'd her Deliverance, without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to <hi>Ascanius</hi> for it, but only to himself; had no sooner assur'd the
<hi>Cylicians</hi> to <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Service, than he forthwith went to the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
and has prevail'd with many of them to come under my Fathers
Pay; and whilst these are sitting their Galleys, he is returning to <hi>Miletus,</hi>
where, if he can have the like Success, he assures me, not only to
have a Fleet able to oppose <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> but to have it ready before <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi>
has his: who, by a double disappointment in <hi>Cylicia</hi> and <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi>
has been compell'd to send into <hi>Egypt</hi> to hire Galleys there. And
now (continued <hi>Atafernes</hi>) We hourly expect to hear of <hi>Betuitus</hi>'s
Arrival at <hi>Miletus,</hi> and what Success his endeavours will meet with there.
I was not (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) a little pleas'd to find what I most desir'd,
in so hopeful a way towards a good Result; nor was the Prince less
pleas'd, when in Obedience to his Commands, I had acquainted him,
how by the means of <hi>Ostanes</hi> I had acted my Escape, even when I had
not only lost the hopes, but the desires of it; neither would he be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
till I had called in <hi>Ostanes</hi> to him, whom he Embraced with many
Thanks for what he had done, (for I never mentioned any thing to him
of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> because of my solemn Vow) and forced him to take such
rich Jewels, that even those had been of themselves too Prodigal a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for me. <hi>Atafernes</hi> soon after told me, how he intended, and had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>Mithridates</hi>'s leave to Imbarque his Army in <hi>Betuitus</hi>'s Fleet, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Strengthen it, but if it were bless'd with a Victory, immediately to
Land, and prosecute that End, for which chiefly, if not only, 'twould be
a Blessing to him. I was exceedingly joyed at this assurance, because the
Duty of my Office led me, where the Duty of my Passion call'd me; but
the Prince, who knew how much I should rejoyce his Father by waiting
on him, made me attend on him to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> though it were very Late;
We found the King in his Night-gown ready to go to Bed; But as soon
as he saw me, he ran and embraced me with this flattering Complement,
That he never had received more refreshment from Sleep, than he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in seeing me. I will not Enumerate all the Questions he asked me
concerning the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> the Prince <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> their Usage, What
had made <hi>Nicomedes</hi> of late so unusually Unactive; nor how inquisitive
he was of the means of my Escape; to all which I gave him the truest
Answers I could; and when I had mentioned to him the Obligation I had
to <hi>Ostanes,</hi> he sent for him into his Closet, loaded him with rich Gifts,
and setled a plentiful Pension on him during his Life. <hi>Mithridates</hi> by my
Return, had been so long interrupted from his intended Rest, that I
thought it a Duty to Retire, which, whilst I was ready to perform, an
Express came to him, and <hi>Atafernes,</hi> with the sad News of the Death of
<hi>Betuitus,</hi> the same Day of his Arrival at <hi>Miletus;</hi> His Age, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Diligence he had used in preparing a Fleet in so many Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for his King's Service, and the Deliverance of his Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
had cast him into a Fever which ended his Life, just as he was
come to that City, where he hop'd to encrease his Navy considerably, and
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:96335:339"/>
before which he had appointed all his Ships and Galleys, waged amongst
the <hi>Cylicians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> to Rendezvouz. This sad Intelligence
wounded sensibly the <hi>Pontick</hi> King for he had no Subject to whom he
could intrust his Fleet; and he fear'd, lest those Auxiliaries engaged by
<hi>Betuitus,</hi> might esteem themselves absolved by his Death; and the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letians</hi>
also, wanting the presence and solicitations of the <hi>Pontick</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
might decline that Assistance, in which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionallest
hopes. I was not unmoved at the loss of so worthy a Person,
and in such a juncture of time, (and possibly those two Reasons gave
the Prince opportunity to move his Father to employ my Service) ere
I could present him an Offer of it: He told <hi>Mithridates,</hi> That my
longest practice in War had been by Sea; that in several Actions I had
gain'd some repute in the minds of those which frequent that Element;
and that by my Education and long Residence in <hi>Miletus,</hi> my Interests
there were likelier to contribute to his Service, than any other he could
employ: He could have added, with at least as much probability, that
my concernments for the relief of the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> and succeeding my
Rival in that Duty, would add Wings to my haste, as well as Courage to
my hopes. In brief, <hi>Atafernes</hi> said so much, and <hi>Mithridates</hi> believed
so much, that immediately he declared me Successor to <hi>Betuitus,</hi> and
gave Directions forthwith to dispatch my Commission and finish my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Instructions. I was a thousand times ready to have prostrated
my self at the <hi>Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k</hi> King's feet, to evidence my Joy and Gratitude for
an Employment which I valued more than all his Empires; for by it I was
inabled to dispute <hi>Statira</hi> on that Element on which she had been forced
from me, and in a possibility to recover that Glory which my Rival then
had lost. Never did <hi>Atafernes</hi> so sensibly oblige any, as then he did me;
and never did Looks speak more acknowledgments than mine did to him.
The generous <hi>Craterus</hi> newly recover'd of his Wounds, hearing of my
Arrival, came to Visit me, and to give me new Assurances of an old
Friendship; I met him just as the Prince and I were coming out of the
King's Appartment, where in Embraces he celebrated my Return, and
the honour <hi>Mithridates</hi> had so freshly bestowed upon me, which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was dispersed about the Court: So, that the news of my Liberty
and Succession to <hi>Betuitus,</hi> went together. I had only the next Day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me by the King to visit and take leave of all my Friends; and
though the time was short, yet the Duty of my impatience made me
esteem it too long. My faithful <hi>Demetrius</hi> I found recover'd of his
Wounds, and ready to go my Journey. When <hi>Atafernes</hi> retired to his
Chamber, I waited on him thither, and in renew'd Repetitions of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
I endeavour'd to let him see I was not unsensible, though unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his Favours: The assurances I gave the Prince, that I would not
mis-imploy one moment in the relief of the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> made him
give <hi>Craterus</hi> Orders to have his Army in a readiness to Ship on twelve
hours notice, when ever I came upon the South-west Coast of <hi>Bithynia;</hi>
that if the gods favour'd my Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by Sea, the Land forces might be ready
to be transported into the Island of <hi>Scyros</hi> to perfect that Deliverance,
which chiefly occasion'd the War; in which <hi>Atafernes</hi> was resolved in
Person to appear.</p>
               <p>This Night when I retir'd, <hi>Demetrius</hi> told me, amongst many other
things, that he was exceedingly deceived, if <hi>Monyma</hi> had not some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Reliques of that Affection she had once conferr'd on me at <hi>Miletus.</hi>
I wonder'd to hear a Discourse of this Nature from him who never had
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:96335:339"/>
practised the like before; and knowing of how dangerous a consequence
the least vent of that belief might prove, both to her and me; I told
him so much in terms which might let him understand how highly I was
concerned in his Cautionsness therein; and then as'd him, What Rise
that Apprehension of his had? (for, possibly by my knowledg there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I might be better instructed how to carry my self towards her and
others; for, though those Beauties which had first conquer'd me at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi>
were still as Flourishing and Charming as ever, and had received
no small Accession by the noble Ornaments of a Crown; yet I confess,
her inconstancy to me, and the resistless and triumphant Graces both of
the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s outward and internal Beauties, had so intirely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
all my Affection and Admiration, that <hi>Monyma</hi>'s favour was so far
from being my desire, that it would have been my trouble).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> in Answer to my Question, told me; As soon, Sir, as the
Queen had heard of my Wounds and Danger, she sent her most experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Physicians and Chirurgeons to me, and commanded their constant
attendance on me, till I was inabled thereby to attend her; which, as
soon as ever I was, she sent for me to her, and without permitting me to
pay her my humble acknowledgments for that Recovery, which (under
the gods) I owed unto her favour, she began a Discourse of you; and
knowing I was not ignorant of that Affection she had for you at <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
she did the more freely speak unto me; there being then either by
design or accident, none of her Women in her Cabinet: Her first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether yet you had discover'd from whence you derived
your Extraction? How you had resented her necessitated Marriage of
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thridate?</hi>s (For, continued <hi>Demetrius,</hi> she spake in such an Accent
that word <hi>Necessitated,</hi> as I perceived well, she had a desire I should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it). And whether you had ever had a Passion for any before her,
or had ever resented any since?</p>
               <p>I easily found she was more intent in my Return to the last part of
this Question, than to all the rest; and though I gave her the best An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
I could, yet still me-thought she had something to say which she
had not said, or would not say. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>And though in her whole Discourses,
her Words had they been written, could not have strictly born a sense
which could have manifested any thing more than a common Affection,
and a concernment for you: yet in their Tone, in her Looks, and in her
Dwelling more upon some parts of her Demands, than on others; I
had abundant cause to believe her Inquiries after you, were the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of more than an ordinary Curiosity. And by several other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
at several other times, (for ever since I was able to endure the
Air, I was daily commanded to wait upon her) I perceived she still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her former Passion for you; and was not a little Jealous you had
dedicated yours to some other Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> having ended speaking, I did again with earnestness repeat
my former Orders to him; and though I needed Rest, yet before I would
take any, I did in my Thoughts propound a thousand ways how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
my self towards <hi>Monyma,</hi> from a continuance of whose Affection to
me, I more easily foresaw the Prejudices, than their Remedies: And after
all were examined, I found none attended with less inconveniencies,
than never to wait on her but in <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Company, or the Princess
<hi>Statira</hi>'s when she should return, for thereby I should not decline the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
attending her, and yet do it in Company, where she would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
from evidencing any Inclination for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="752" facs="tcp:96335:340"/>
The next Morning I attended <hi>Atafernes</hi> at his Rising, and begg'd him,
that in the Afternoon he would let me wait on him to the Queen, to kiss
her Hands, both as my first Visit, and my last. He promised me this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and then we went to the King's Appartment, who had sat up so
Late in preparing my Orders, that it was Noon ere he Rose; and then
finding himself unfit for Business, he told me, 'Twould be the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ere I could begin my Journey. That Afternoon <hi>Atafernes</hi> led me
to the Queen's Appartment, who received me with many obliging Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and with Looks, which nothing but <hi>Statira</hi>'s Idea could have
enabled me to resist; the whole Discourse consisted of such usual things,
that I shall not repeat any of them in particular: And after an Hour, the
Prince rising to take his leave, I desired the honour of the Queen's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and acquainted her, That being by the King's Orders to go to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi>
'twas not improbable but he might have some Services to command
me thither. <hi>Monyma</hi> instantly reply'd, You have not a little obliged
me, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> in letting me know you were to go to <hi>Miletus,</hi> for I
hear <hi>Irene</hi>'s Father being Dead, she inheriting all his Riches is return'd
thither with her Husband, where most of them were left her: I intend
to present her something, which may let her see she continues in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
and affection; and therefore I will desire you this Evening
to come hither and receive it, for I know your delivering it will give it
a double good reception. I was so confounded at this Command which
had defeated all I had built, and so vexed at my Self for having given a
Rise to it, that I had like to have discovered to the Queen and Prince
my Disorders; which the better to conceal, I told her, I would not fail
to come and receive the Honour of such an Employment; since to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her Commands, and oblige the fair <hi>Irene,</hi> were Duties in which I
found a high Contentment. <hi>Atafernes</hi> hereupon retir'd, and I durst not
beg him again to go in the Evening to <hi>Monyma</hi>'s, left that might have
discover'd, what I was so desirous to keep from his Knowledg.</p>
               <p>From the Queen's side we went to wait on the Princess <hi>Nisa,</hi> and the
Princess <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who then began to disclose Beauties, which but for
the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s, had not had any Superiour in the World. Both their
Entertainments consisted in things relating to the Danger their Sister had
been in; and inquiries, how she indur'd her Imprisonment, and what
hopes there was to free her from it.</p>
               <p>By that time these Duties were paid, and other Visits I owed to my
Friends, it was Evening; and therefore I sent <hi>Demetrius</hi> to discover
whether there were any Company with <hi>Monyma,</hi> resolving when there
was most, to wait upon her, that I might not be engaged in a particular
Discourse with her, which I so much fear'd, and she, I found desired: I
waited so long, that at last he returned with assurance, that both the
Princesses, <hi>Nisa,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> were with the Queen, attended by all the
greatest Persons of the Court. To embrace therefore this desired op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
I went directly towards the Queen's Appartment, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a long Gallery which was in my way, I found <hi>Mithridates</hi> in it,
who seeing me, called me to him, as he said, to make me a sharer in the
good News he had then receiv'd: which was a Packet sent by an Express
from <hi>Ascanius,</hi> to assure him, Though he had met with many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in forming a Fleet for the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Deliverance, and his
Service, yet now he had vanquish'd them all, and would in twenty Days
present him a Navy, which he was confident would cure the Wounds of
his former Misfortunes, and present his Princess and her Brother with
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:96335:340"/>
that Liberty, the loss whereof was more insuppotable to him, than it
could be to them. I was not (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) generous enough
to rejoyce at such an additional Strength to the Princess's Deliverance;
I had rather have had it left to my Fleet, than have had the Assistance of
my Rivals: But this Packet made the King detain me a long hour, in
resolving where the two Fleets should Rendezvous; and when, and
how they should prosecute the War. <hi>Miletus</hi> was judged the most
fit place for the Fleets assembling; that being in the way for the <hi>Cyprian</hi>
Fleet, and the appointed Rendezvous by <hi>Betuitus</hi> for all his <hi>Phoenician</hi> &amp;
<hi>Cilician</hi> Galleys, as well as the place from whence we expected so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a Force, which I thought would the sooner be much Augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their seeing how considerable a Navy we had got together. The
Fleet in the <hi>Hellespont</hi> had Orders sent forthwith (Wind and Weather
serving) to Rendezvous in the Great Bay before <hi>Miletus,</hi> there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
further Commands.</p>
               <p>The taking up these Resolves, and the dispatches for putting them in
Execution, took us up a full hour; so that by the time I came to <hi>Mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s
Chamber, I found the two Princesses and all the Company had
left it; which necessitated me wholly to disobey her Commands, and
break my own Ingagement; or else to do that, which next to an Incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and breach of Promise, I most apprehended.</p>
               <p>Whilst I was debating with my Self what to do, one of the Queen's
Women, who thought my stay near the Door, was only to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Queen was at leisure to receive my Visit; was so-over offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as to go in to <hi>Monyma,</hi> and to tell her I waited at the Door to
kiss her Hands. <hi>Monyma</hi> forthwith sent the same Woman to desire
me to come in, which cut off all Debates, and made me follow my
Guide, who led me into the Queen's Bed-chamber; who no sooner saw
me, but she rose and came to meet me: But so lovely, and so charming,
that had not the remembrance of her Inconstancy been as much my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative,
as my Flame to my Princess, I must then have Acted that Sin
myself, which was my only quarrel to her. An hundred Crystal Lamps
shined in the Chamber, and yet gave it a less Light, both in degrees
and quality, than the Queen's Eyes: Her Dress was at once so negligent
and advantageous, that I found a great Art consisted in seemingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
of any: Her Looks had an equal mixture of Sorrow and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingness;
and yet I never saw any Face cover'd with Joy, inhabited with
more Lustre and Empire. I must confess what I saw, made me often wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have exchanged the hopes of the Glory of Triumphing over
such an Enemy, to have avoided the Temptation of her Conquest; and
if ever I knew the power I had over my self, or rather the power the
fair <hi>Statira</hi> had over me, 'twas in that Night remaining (I will not say
Unmoved, but I may say) unvanquish'd.</p>
               <p>After my little Disorders were over, I told the Queen; Madam, I
should not have been guilty of twice troubling you in one Day, had not
the honour of your Commands occasion'd it; nor have paid you this last
Duty at so uncivil an hour, if the King had not unexpectedly kept me
so Late, and enjoyned me to begin my Journey so Early, that I must now
have obey'd you, or else have been uncapable to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monyma</hi> walking towards a part of her Chamber, where, though
some of her Women had continued in the place they were, yet they could
neither see nor hear us; and there seating her self under a great Cloath
of State: she told me; I did indeed, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> expect this favour
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:96335:341"/>
from you somewhat Earlier; and your staying thus long, might have
made me doubt you would not have come, had I not remembred, that
you so detested a forced breach of Promise in another, that you would
not have acted a Voluntary one your self. But you see <hi>Mithridates</hi>
has the power to hinder you from performing, at your own time, your
intentions to me, as well as to hinder me from observing mine to you:
I am so good Natur'd, (she continu'd, with a Smile mixt with a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Look, that what she said might be taken either way) that I freely
forgive your failer; and I will hope, that your Reason, your good
Nature, and my Example, will invite you to practice the like towards
me. This Answer (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) made me judg what the whole
entertainment of my Visit would consist of; and though it was but
what I expected, yet it was also what I fear'd; and therefore the less
to intangle my self in Discourse, I only chose to answer such parts of
hers, as might give her the least Rise to dwell upon those particulars
on which I apprehended she would most insist. I therefore only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd;
I will hope, Madam, by that power you have found <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
has, you will the sooner pardon an Incivility in me, which is
but an effect of that Cause. I shall never (reply'd the Queen) esteem
your Visits an Incivility, but an Obligation; yet, lest you should
think them otherwise, (for I find you have some Thoughts of me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
you, which you ought not to have) to silence those Scruples,
I do grant you whatever forgiveness you desire: Then listing up her
Eyes, and fixing them on me, she said, May I have that satisfaction, to
receive from you as full a forgiveness, as I have given you? This
is the second time I have asked it; and if your Answer be not as
positive as the Desire, whatever words your Civility or Wit may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
it in, I shall esteem it a flat Denial, and deplore it at that Rate.
Then casting down her Eyes, which began to swell with some Tears,
she added; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> before you make me any Return, remember
what I acted was in obedience to the highest Duty; was a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of necessity, not choice; and is a punishment as great as the fault.</p>
               <p>At the end of these words, Those Tears which a little before had
but appear'd in her fair Eyes, now began to give way to those which
were to follow; which did so in such abundance, that though she strove,
by wiping them away, to conceal them, or at least their excess, yet
both were so visible, that they melted the violence of all my Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And in an Accent, which might as much evidence Truth in
one of my Sex, as Weeping could in one of hers, kneeling at her Feet,
I told her, Whatever, Madam, my Griefs, whatever my Resentments
have been, I hope neither of them have been so rude, as to make you
doubt my Obedience to any of your Commands: If they have been so
undesignedly unfortunate, they have as much Wounded me in you, as
for you; and if an assurance of an intire observance of those Commands
you have mention'd to me, can repair that unhappiness, I shall find in
my Duty my contentment.</p>
               <p>At the end of these words, <hi>Monyma</hi> casting one of her Arms over
me, she reply'd; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> What you have promised, cannot be a
greater Justice than it is an Obligation; an Obligation of so noble a
Nature and Efficacy, that I ought to cast my self in the like posture,
to speak my Gratitude, as you have been in, whilst you perform'd that
which caused it.</p>
               <p>I was not (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) a little confounded and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:96335:341"/>
at what <hi>Monyma</hi> said and did: But though I were in the Arms of
one of the greatest Beauties of the World, and of the greatest Person in
it, th' Effects of whose kindness, in the then Dictates of it, I might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have carried to a higher degree; yet I had so intirely resigned up
my self to the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> that the highest satisfaction I took in the
Queen's favours, proceeded from a knowledg I attain'd thereby, that
nothing was capable to alter or diminish my Passion for my Princess,
since <hi>Monyma</hi>'s Charms and Kindness wanted that Power; Charms, I
say, which consisted of those almost resistless Ingredients, of Beauty,
Kindness, Opportunity, and Quality: And though I were not a little
concerned, that <hi>Mithridatia</hi> should have seen the small transports in
which I entertained my first Mistress's favours, that thereby she might
have read the intireness of my Flame for the last; yet I had so much
respect for the Queen, that I would not have purchas'd such a satisfaction,
at so dear a price to her.</p>
               <p>But after she had a while continued in that Fashion I have mentioned,
and I speechless, occasion'd by what she did, and what I thought; She
rais'd her self up at last, with a Face so cover'd with Blushes, that I have
since believed, what by surprise she had Acted, having caused that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million,
she so long continued what she had done, to give it time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:
She had no sooner recover'd a little out of those disorders she had
been in, then she told me; Rise, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> lest some unexpected Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the postures we have been in, might mis-interpret them. These
words waked me out of my Thoughts, and whatever else had entertain'd
me; and having paid an Obedience to her Commands, she told me; I
hope, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you believe, that great Joy does bring some Madness
with it; and therefore, that you will attribute to what you have promised
me, all those Productions that assurance has made me guilty of; and since
I am now (I hope) restored to your good Opinion, you will permit me,
as an effect of that vast Concern I have still had for you, which always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
its first Lustre in me, though clouded to your Sight, to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
after whatever relates unto you, and to offer you all the interests
I have in <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to establish any of yours, which you are to derive
from him: And because, when I left you at <hi>Miletus,</hi> (at which words,
said <hi>Callimachus,</hi> she Sighed) you were in no small perplexity, at your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of your Extraction; Tell me, I beseech you, whether yet you
have had any Light of it. Madam, (I reply'd) I am yet as great a Stranger
to my Birth, as I was then; but having lost the generous <hi>Telamon</hi> on the
Sea, as soon as I had in some degree conquer'd my Sorrows, I resolved on
that Element to make a diligent Inquiry after him; in which search I
continued, till the gods presented me the occasion to serve the Princess
<hi>Statira;</hi> and ever since that time, you have seen and known my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Those gods (the Queen reply'd) were not a little concerned in the
manifestation of my Innocence, and in restoring me to the happiness of
your Friendship, since, as the way to the end, they permitted so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Person as the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> to be reduced to a danger, which
only <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s Courage was able to free her from: But, (said <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma,</hi>
fixing her Eyes on me) confess to me, I conjure you, Were you
not in the same Action, Conquerour, and Conquered? I was not (said
<hi>Callimachus</hi>) a little confounded at so unexpected a Question; which
made the Queen thus to continue; Blush not, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> at what I
ask you, I know nothing greater than the impossibility of not
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:96335:342"/>
adoring <hi>Statira,</hi> but the Sin of being ashamed at it: You that did not
resist that little Beauty the gods had favour'd me with, How could you
resist those Graces, which disclose themselves with such triumphing
Lustre in that Princess? I tell you not this, to discover your Inclinations,
but by letting you know I am acquainted with them, I hope to invite
you to make me your Confident: For by the Laws of the Gods, of
Men, and of Virtue, being indispensably confined from even the Thoughts
of possessing you my self, it will be my happiness to contribute to the
making of yours. I know the height of her Birth, and your Ignorance
of Yours, are vast Impediments; but I know also your Person, and your
Actions, are above all other Men's, as much as her Quality is above
Yours: I know too, that her exact Obedience to the King, and the near
consummation of her Nuptials, are considerable hinderances; but I
know also, that Love is more considerable help: And all my exactest
Observations abuse me, if she had not gone with less trouble to the
Temple, had she been led thither by <hi>Callimachus,</hi> instead of <hi>Ascanius.</hi>
Who knows, but that the Glory of her third Deliverance is reserved
to you? And who knows, but that those gods, which so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
separated her from the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> for a time, may, in the
next Battel, separate him from her Eternally? 'Tis not impossible too,
but that <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to reward your Services, and to repair the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
fatal Obedience of his Daughter, may be induced to make
that Happiness for you, which the gods, by so many repeated and
admirable Events, have seem'd to declare they design you to: Possibly
also, some happy Accident may discover to you in the progress of this
War, it being Naval, and <hi>Tellamon</hi> being separated from you on the
Sea, from whence you derive your Extraction, and the Knowledg of
your Quality may give you as free an admittance to make your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to <hi>Statira,</hi> as your Services have given you an interest in her.
These (continued <hi>Monyma</hi>) are the Hopes I have for you; and if,
by the affection <hi>Mithridates</hi> honours me with, I may in any degree
contribute by my endeavours to change them unto Certainties, if you
esteem me worthy of your Trust, you shall find by my Actions, that I
have afresh desired your Friendship, but the more hopefully to place
on you the effects of mine; and by my future Deportment, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
to repair you for the Sins of my past Carriage: For though, <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
I confess I love you, and possibly more than I ought for my Quiet,
and perhaps for Yours too; yet, since such an Affection is a Guilt, I the
sooner take this way, to free my self from it; and 'tis no small satisfaction
to me, that what is the intended remedy of my Fault, should be the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of my Esteem and Concernment for you.</p>
               <p>Never, (said <hi>Callimachus</hi>) never was I reduced to a greater Trouble
in forming an Answer, than at that time: The first part of her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
had so flatter'd my Passion, and my Hopes, that I listned to it in
Extasies; but the latter part, reducing me to the necessity of owning my
Flame, or of disobliging the Queen, who so generously offer'd me her
Assistance, and seem'd in what she had spoke, to have taken off the Veil
from all Disguisements, and to express a Tenderness for me, which at least
requir'd Truth and Respect from me; that, between those extreams, I
remain'd in Troubles so unexpressible, and great, that the gods pitying
me, sent me an unexpected Relief; for just as I was going to speak, and yet
not fully resolv'd what I should say, one of the Ladies of the Queen's Bed-chamber
came hastily to her, and told her; Madam, the King has sent to tell
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:96335:342"/>
you, that, having all this Day wearied himself in Business, he intends to give
himself the contentment of passing this Night in your Company; and is
now coming through the Gallery hither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monyma</hi> casting her Eyes upon me, seem'd, by them, to say something,
which, I interpreted, was to express more trouble than satisfaction at the
King's message; and rising hastily up, gave me a Present for the fair <hi>Irene,</hi>
and commanded me to tell her, She sent her that, as an assurance, that
whomsoever she loved perfectly once, she would always love in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
And then hastily taking leave of me, she went to meet the King,
who was almost at her Chamber-door; where she entertained him a while,
that I might have the more leisure to retire; which I did with a Joy
equal to the Trouble I was then freed from.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you, with all the various Thoughts which imploy'd
me, upon what the Queen had done, spoken, and offer'd; but to repair
having so long insisted on this Visit, I will hasten generous Princes, to tell
you, That the Night, I took my last leave of <hi>Atafernes,</hi> and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
Persons of Quality and Parts, with <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s desires to the
<hi>Cylicians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> to hasten their Fleets to the Bay of <hi>Miletus;</hi> I
sent also by expresses of great Trust, Orders to <hi>Galatides,</hi> Admiral for
<hi>Mithridates</hi> of the <hi>Euxine</hi> and <hi>Hellespontick</hi> Squadrons, that, because his
Fleet was to pass by the Island of <hi>Scyros,</hi> where all <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>'s
Fleet lay, lest they should attempt to intercept him, to keep the
Western-Coast of <hi>Asia</hi> close on his left hand; to have Scouts so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
as to receive timely Allarms; to take up all the small Vessels of
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> and Fisher-boats a long the Coast, with as much privacy as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he could; and in the beginning of the Night, to give all those small
Vessels the Lights of his Fleet, with Order to keep as near that Coast as
they could; which might not only delude the Enemy, but endanger
them: For his Ships and Galleys being of the largest in the World, they
would boldly (possibly without Sounding) follow such; and that with
all his Fleet, during the Night, he should strike over to the Eastern-Coast
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and keep that on his right Hand, till he were gotten so far to
the Southward of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the length of the Bay of <hi>Miletus,</hi> for
which he should then hasten, as fast as his Oars and Sails could carry
him. These Orders, soon after my coming to <hi>Miletus,</hi> I found had not
been needless; for, by them, <hi>Galatides</hi> assur'd me, he not only escaped
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> but the Lights in the small Vessels so well abused him, that
not a few of his were Stranded, and others Cast away, in their Chase,
ere the rest of his Fleet perceived the Delusion. The <hi>Miletians,</hi> who were
a People wholly, of late Years dedicated to their Trade; though they
received <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Letters to them, with all the formalities of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and respect, yet could not be induced to let that King have any
help under their publique Flags; for <hi>Nicomedes</hi> seemed to give the Law
on the Sea, and their greatest Trade was on that Element, and his Ships
had been so Civil to them, as thitherto, not to have interrupted it. Yet
by the help of the fair <hi>Irene,</hi> and her Lord, together with that Interest I
had gained newly, and formerly, amongst some of the Chiefest of that City,
I procured leave to raise what Volunteers I could engage, and particular
Vessels I could hire, which was a Priviledg also, they gave at the same time,
though unsought after, unto <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi> but they made
not use of it, either as not wanting it, or not having timely notice of it.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Miletus</hi> I daily renew'd my Sollicitations to the <hi>Cylicians</hi> and <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians;</hi>
and whatever time I had to imploy from the Duties of my Charge,
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:96335:343"/>
I dedicated it to the fair <hi>Irene;</hi> in the happiness of whose Nuptials, I
saw enough to make me at once rejoyce at her Condition, and deplore
my Own. But when I deliver'd to her <hi>Monyma</hi>'s Present and Words;
she told me smiling, If the Queen's assurance be without Limitation, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
has a double Reason to ingage you to Command his Fleets and
Armies abroad. But I assur'd her, all that had been Passion on my side,
was turned to Respect; and all that had been seeming Affection on her
side, was turned into real Friendship. She told me, she was perfectly
glad thereof, both for <hi>Monyma</hi>'s sake, and mine.</p>
               <p>The last Evening that I waited on her, the joyful News was brought
me in her Company, that a great Fleet was discover'd in the South-east,
making for the Bay of <hi>Miletus:</hi> This Advertisement drew me hastily
from that excellent Person, and her Lord, and made me take a final leave
of the Magistrates of the City, having that Morning sent into the Bay all
those Men and Vessels I could engage there to joyn with <hi>Galatides,</hi> then
Riding there; and though I flatter'd my self with a Belief, that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.
Fleet was from <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> yet lest it should be <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
which might come that Course, either from having pursued
<hi>Galatides,</hi> or at the least to Alarm me, by taking that way by which
my expected Helps were to come, I hastned on Board, and put my Fleet
in the best post posture I could to receive them as Enemies or Friends.
But the uncertainty soon ceased, my Scouts bringing me word it was the
conjoyned Navies of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Egppt,</hi> led by <hi>Ascanius</hi> in Person; and
soon after, I perceived in the Flag of the Admiral, a <hi>Venus</hi> ascending out
of the Waves; but a <hi>Venus</hi> fairer than she which sprung out of the Sea:
For the lovely Image as perfectly resembled the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> as the
noblest Piece of Art could the noblest Piece the gods did ever Create.</p>
               <p>Ah! How I envied the high Honour <hi>Ascanius</hi> had assumed of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> under her Picture! and did a thousand times
repine, that by the Barbarous Maritim Laws I could not change my
Flags! And that the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> by observing those of his Countrey,
might bear such glorious ones! Had I not been confined to those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tyes, I could have hoped by imitating <hi>Ascanius,</hi> to have rais'd the
Valour of my Soldiers, by letting them see in the Copy what the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
was for which they Fought: My Flag displayed a Terrestrial Globe;
<hi>Mithridates</hi> thereby intimating his aspiring to the universal Monarchy;
so that I bore the World, and <hi>Ascanius</hi> bore mine: Yet 'twas no small
consolation to me, that though I carried not her Image in so conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Place, as my Rival did; yet I carried it where it was more Lively
drawn, and where I could not out-live the Loss of it.</p>
               <p>Whilst I was thus entertaining my Self, the <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Fleets cast Anchor, at which I knew not whether I was more pleas'd, or
troubled; This, that their Admiral did thereby confess he stood in need
of my help; That, because some precious time was lost, in acting for
<hi>Statira</hi>'s Deliverance. But the various Thoughts I was in, hinder'd me
not from paying to the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King the Duty I owed his Title.
Wherefore I went forthwith Aboard him, where I was entertained with
all imaginable Civility and Honour; and with no small expressions of
his Trouble, that the <hi>Cilician</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Helps were not yet Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
which, he said, He esteemed advisable to stay some Days for, that
they might lose no accessional Force in so Ambition'd a Victory. I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
him, that it was more desirable, with the Force we had, to proceed
in so Glorious a quarrel, than to permit the Imprisonment of the Princess
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:96335:343"/>
so long time, as must be spent in the expectancy of their Arrival; that the
Justice of the Quarrel, and the Person for whom 'twas undertaken, were
assurances of Success in the Result of it; and if we thought a good
Cause was favour'd by the gods, we could not but believe thereby, we
were supplied with more Strength than even the desired Addition could
produce: And therefore I offer'd, with the Naval-Force I had, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the lest Wing: that, to stay for those Fleets we expected, would
convince the Enemy, and our own Soldiers that we thought we needed
them; and if they can not, as 'twas as probable they would not come
at all, as that they should not come by the Day prefixed by <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
and promised by themselves, we must then either wholly decline the
Action, or attempt it with the evidences of our own doubt of Success;
nay, possibly by a continuance where we were, invite <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to seek us out, when also by our continuance where we
were, we acknowledged we apprehended their Encounter.</p>
               <p>These Reasons, and that Offer of mine, made the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King cast off
all Thoughts of delaying the Battel, or at least of presenting the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with it; Possibly their own Weight, possibly that none might appear
more forward than himself in that Action, in which he was to receive the
greatest and highest Rewards, made him resolve and declare, That the
next morning he would set Sail for the Island of <hi>Scyros:</hi> and there find
the end of his Hopes, or of his Life. And to evidence his Apprehensions
sprung from his fears, that my Wing needed assistance, not his, he offer'd
me some eighteen Galleys to Fortifie it: But having paid him my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
for that offer, I declined it, thereby to convince him,
his Fleet and mine, that I thought I needed no such Accession.</p>
               <p>After we had resolved on all things for the Decision of the Battel, in
which he chose the right Wing, and assigned me the left, He shew'd me
several rare Inventions of his own Subjects, and of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> both
which had then the opinion of the best and most experienced Sea-men
in the whole World, as well for Navigation, as Fight. One of which
I cannot omit particularizing, which was, that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in most of
their Galleys, had divers great Earthen Pots full of small holes: in which
Pots they had inclosed great Serpents, which by the Holes, received Air
and Sustenance enough to preserve them. These were to be flung into
such Galleys as they grappled with. The fall of the Earthen pots on the
Decks of the Enemies Vessels, would infallibly break them; And then
the hungry Serpents being at liberty, would wind themselves about the
Limbs of the next they could seize on: and thereby not only hinder
them from Fighting, but in a short while put an end to their Lives.</p>
               <p>This admirable and cruel Invention I commended, only because 'twas
to be employed against the Detainers of my Princess; though in it self,
I did not like it, esteeming it a Salvage cruelty, to employ venomous
Beasts to destroy the Lives of Valiant Men. Soon after I had seen some
other like Inventions, I retired to my own Fleet; and, according to
the resolution taken Aboard <hi>Ascanius,</hi> made all things ready to weigh
Anchor with the Morning's light: which accordingly we did, (I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first left Orders for the <hi>Cilician,</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Fleets to follow me)
And with Oars and Sails, we steer'd our course to the Island of <hi>Scyros;</hi>
where, to my unspeakable Joy the Day following, by that time the Sun
was two hours high, we discover'd the two King's Fleets, embattelling
within the easie prospect of the Castle: and as ready to accept of the
Fight, as we were to present it them. I soon perceived the <hi>Bithynian</hi>
                  <pb n="760" facs="tcp:96335:344"/>
Flags composed the right Wing, which I was to Fight against; and the
<hi>Cappadocian</hi> the left Wing, which <hi>Ascanius</hi> was to oppose.</p>
               <p>Elevated with the Glory of what I sought for, and before whom I
fought; and troubled at nothing more than at the glorious Flag which
the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> carried, I began the Battel, which I might truly say,
was replenished with more various accidents than ever any which was
fought before. And though the Princess had the trouble to see her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
was a long time in the Balance; yet at last, she had the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to see the <hi>Pontick</hi> and <hi>Bithynian</hi> Admiral engaged singly: and,
though <hi>Nicomedes</hi> did all that became a King and a General, yet being
himself sunk under the weight of his personal Wounds, I entred his
Galley, and took him my Prisoner; though when I did it, he was by
the loss of Blood, uncapable to see my Success, or deplore the want of
his own.</p>
               <p>As soon as ever that Admiral Galley was conquer'd, all the rest of
his Fleet confusedly fled to the Shore; in which Chase we sunk many,
and took more; and prosecuted our Victory as far as the Water would
give us leave.</p>
               <p>But the Success could not be more glorious on our left Wing, than it
was deplorable in the right; for on my Return to see whether our Friends
needed our assistance, I found the <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Egyytian</hi> Fleets, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
vanquisht, as the <hi>Mithridiatick</hi> had the <hi>Bithynian:</hi> nay, I saw a
<hi>Cappadocian</hi> Galley carrying That glorious Flag at her Stern, which a
little before had adorned the main-Top of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Admiral. The
fury I was in at that sight, carried my Galley with Wings to so desired a
recompence and revenge; and the Enemy as proud of their prize, as I
was inraged to see it theirs, disputed their Purchase with at least as much
resolution, as that with which they had acquired it. The Fight was
such, that even the winning of this Galley, cost me not less blood and
time, than <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s: But at length she yielded, and presented me
with an <hi>Effigies,</hi> than which, nothing to me could be more acceptable,
unless the glorious Original. To recover that noble Trophy, was an
Honour which needed not to set it off, the Foyl of my Rivals having
lost it.</p>
               <p>In brief, that large Scene in which the Battel had been fought, was
clear'd of all our Enemies, but five Galleys: for <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> satisfied
with his having done that to our right Wing, which I had done to his;
and having been disorder'd in that Success too much, to attempt the
changing of mine: or else apprehending a Forest of Vessels, which
then began to appear (and, which afterwards I found were my <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
and <hi>Cilician</hi> Fleets) retired to the Island of <hi>Scyros,</hi> and left those
five Galleys I had mentioned, engaged against one single <hi>Egyptian</hi> Galley.
Which, though it defended it self with much Resolution; yet I saw at
last those in it, did not more deserve than need my assistance, I therefore
hastned to afford it them. A young Gentlemen of that Nation, and of
the colour of those Inhabitants, in splendid Arms, so animated his, both
by words and by Example, that in his Valour only the hopes and life of
their Party consisted. The Enemy observing my Approach, offer'd him
all honourable Quarter; and though he was Courted by many Civilities
to accept it, yet he declined it in words which testified his Resolution
as much as his Defence had done. And by that time I had joyned his
Galley, I heard the end of the young <hi>Egyptian</hi>'s Reply, which he finisht
in these words; That it was an unavoidable Fate for every man once to
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:96335:344"/>
Die, but he did not think it was the like: for Gallant Men once to yield.
This generous Answer, in my judgment, made him and his the more
worthy of my assistance; which I presented him with such Success, that
he was soon in a condition to afford his Enemies those Civilities, which
he had so lately refused to receive from them.</p>
               <p>By that time I came into his Galley, to congratulate his Success, and
give his Valour those Elogies it merited, I found him weltring in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Blood, which he had drawn from others, and lost himself. The
taking off his Helmet to give him Air, discover'd a Face as remarkable
for the noble features of it, as any I ever saw; and which, though black,
and in the Arms of Death, retained Charms enough to make me admire
it. I gave all my Chirurgeons express and repeated Orders concerning
him; and though I strictly examined all his Soldiers who he was, yet
none of them would or could satisfie my Curiosity, protesting they had
never seen him before that Morning, in which by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
he was put to Command that Galley upon the Death of the late
Captain of it. But, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I doubt generous Princes,
my concernment for this eminent Stranger has too long carried me away
from the direct Sequel of my Relation; which therefore (having begg'd
your pardons for) I will re-assume by telling you, That several of the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> Commanders which had fled under my Flags, to avoid the <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docian</hi>
King's Navy, assur'd me, that their own Prince was fallen dead
on his Deck, ere <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had taken him: and that his last words
were, It more troubles me to lose my Flag, than my Life. His last consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
being so worthy of an Adorer of my Princess, made me Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his Fall with a grief as real as great; and the abhorred Name of a
prevailing Rival, hinder'd not my paying his Merits the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
due to his Title, and Unhappiness. I offer'd all those <hi>Cyprian</hi>
Commanders, to employ my whole Fleet to recover his Body; that those
which could not Conquer him whilst alive, might not possess him when
dead: But they all assur'd me he was past recovery, as well out of the
Enemies hands, as out of the hands of Death; for they had seen the
<hi>Cappadocian</hi> Admiral carry under the Castle in the Island of <hi>Scyros,</hi> the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> Admiral's Galley, in which their dead King and General's Body
was.</p>
               <p>This loss appearing past remedy, I went to enquire how the generous
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> was; and how my Physician, and Chirugeon's care of him
had succeeded: but alas, I still found him in that swoon in which I
had left him, and in so little hopes of Life, that hardly any misery had
befaln me in the whole course of my own, had been more intolerable or
sensible to me. But those about him, either as it was their belief, or
else to lessen that grief which his condition so visibly invaded me with,
assuor'd me he was Alive; and that none of those Wounds they had
sounded, appear'd mortal: so that his Escaping was not only possible,
but hopeful. And though these words were very welcome to me, yet
the gods were pleas'd to send me something else, which was much
more; for even whilst I was under my fears of his Death, by a deep
Sigh, and opening of his Eyes, he manifested he had Life. The emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
generosity of this Prince to all men, and the particular effects of
it to me, which also were in some measure the Causes of his then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
gave me as high a satisfaction, as my sorrow for him had been
before; both which, could not have been more sincere and eminent,
had I then known the Relation I had unto him. And because the
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:96335:345"/>
motion of the Sea, and the small accommodations in a Galley, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious,
if not dangerous to him; I forthwith sent a Trumpet on
Shore to <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> with this Letter.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Callimachus, to the King of Cappadocia.</head>
                     <p>I <hi>Was till even now in no small apprehensions that I should have done
that to you, which now upon the score of your Generosity I will hope
for from you; and by sending to you the Body of</hi> Nicomedes, <hi>have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from you the Body of</hi> Ascanius: <hi>But the gods having restor'd
your great Friend to Life, and my best Physicians and Chyrurgeons giving
me more than hopes of his Recovery, I was unwilling to keep so welcome
an assurance from you. I believe you will not esteem the Restauration
of the Princess</hi> Statira, <hi>and the Prince</hi> Pharnaces, <hi>too disproportionate
an exchange for him; I have therefore sent this Letter to propound it
to you: And because 'tis below the generous</hi> Ariobarzanes <hi>to detain the
body of a dead Enemy, or receive any exchange for it, I will with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
wait for those effects therein, that his Virtue will give me; which
cannot be greater, than my esteem of it, and confidence in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>I was necessitated, both to cloud my passion, and not to appear too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of <hi>Mithridates</hi> his trust, to add <hi>Pharnaces</hi> to the exchange of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes;</hi>
and only to mention the name of my Princess, without particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing
those inducements for her deliverance which her Innocence, her
Beauties, and other admirable persections might have excessively furnish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
me with. Whilst my Trumpet was going, and returning, I was visited by
the <hi>Cilician</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Admirals, who in such humble and moving
Expressions, evidenced their sorrow for coming some hours too late,
that I was more troubled to console them, than I had been at their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
which was occasion'd by an unhappy Difference had fallen out
between the Chiefs of both their Countreys, which had already drawn
some Blood: and they doubted would draw more ere it was extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Nay, they had not now come, but that a religious Person, who
for being such, was eminent to both their Nations, represented to them,
That whilst they strove about what was doubtful, they acted a Certain
evil, by employing those Forces against each other, which were mutually
engaged to serve <hi>Mithridates.</hi> This being spoken from so reverend a
Person, produced this effect, That they all unanimously engaged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Contract, and to serve the <hi>Pontick</hi> King in his first Naval
Ingagement. But then by solemn Oath, they tyed themselves the next
day to return, whatever their Success was, and to obey whatever their
Superiours should enjoyn; who they hoped by this short Peace, would
assume thoughts of a perpetual one: and by their Absence, might be
invited to extinguish that Flame, which their Presence did but kindle
and animate. That therefore they were come, not only to implore my
pardon for their having been absent; but to beg my permission to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
that they might therein satisfie their Oaths to their gods, and their
Duties to their Chiefs.</p>
               <p>After I had acquainted them with my trouble for their absence, and
for the cause of it, I began to endeavour to make them sensible, that
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:96335:345"/>
even by their Vows, they were confined to see one Engagement more;
for this that was past, they had rather heard of than seen: That our
Fleets which had engaged, were so shatter'd, that without their help we
could not continue the Siege of the Island, till it was reduced: which to
effect, we were to employ half of our number to transport at once the
Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Army; since to Land it in parts, were to expose it to
the Army there, who by that worst proceeding, might soon repair on
the Land, what they had lost on the Sea. I did not omit to add to these
Motives, all those others which I thought might engage them; But plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Oaths to the gods, and their Superiours, as soon as the first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
was over, and binding themselves to me by the most Sacred
Vows they could make, as soon as their domestick differences were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sword, or by Agreement, they would immediately return to
<hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Service if called, and face the Island for five days before
they returned, which was a competent time to transport the Prince's
Army into it. Not being able to prevail for more, I accepted so much;
and forthwith sent an Express to the King, to acquaint him with our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and at what at Rate we had bought it. I likewise employed another
Express to the generous <hi>Atafernes,</hi> with an account of all things; and
how that in two days I intended to bring into the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> so
many of his Father's Fleet, as would transport into the Island Forces
enough to Conquer it: and that I would leave the residue of the Fleet
with the <hi>Cilician</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Navies, to block it up in the mean time,
that none in it might get out of it, and no new Supplies might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into it. By that time I had informed these Resolutions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
these Expresses, the Barge I had sent with the Trumpet, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and he brought me this Letter.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Ariobarzanes King of Cappadocia, to Callimachus, Admiral
of the Pontick Fleet.</head>
                     <p>I <hi>Had now returned you the dead Body of the King of</hi> Cyprus, <hi>if two
Noblemen his Subjects, and my Prisoners, had not begg'd it of me; that
they might perform the</hi> Cyprian <hi>Funeral-solemnities due unto his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and after that, carry it to receive the like Obsequies in his own
Countrey; for which end I have given them their own Liberty, and their
own Galley, with my Pass to return to</hi> Cyprus, <hi>as soon as these intended
Ceremonies are finished here, and that his Corps is Embalmed. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
your great Civility, in sending me news of</hi> Nicomedes <hi>being
alive; which yet does therefore hinder me from being able to dispose of
so considerable a Prisoner as the Prince</hi> Pharnaces <hi>is: But for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>
Statira, <hi>as it was always against my will she was detained (Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being neither the Cause, nor the continuance of our War); so I shall
willingly exchange her, and all the Prisoners with her, for</hi> Nicomedes;
<hi>Who, I am confident in your judgment, and in her Fathers also, will be
a sufficient Ransom for the King of</hi> Bithynia, <hi>if he does not recover of
his Wounds: And if he do, you may with reason expect from his justice
without a bargain, what ever he esteems this Exchange will fall short of
the value of his Liberty.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="764" facs="tcp:96335:346"/>
The gods, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> only knew my transports at the
reading of this Letter; For had the King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> demanded for
the Princess, not only <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> but also <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and the whole
Fleet he commanded, he had in raptures of Joy delivered them up to
<hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi> and esteemed that Purchase too low a Price for the honour
of her Redemption. I therefore immediately accepted of his offer on
the Conditions he proposed; and having received his assurance of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Princess on his receiving <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> I forthwith sent that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
King to the Island in his own Galley, lest his removal might have
been at once painful and dangerous to him; and as some small Evidence,
how disadvantageous an Agreement I thought my Enemies had made for
themselves, I cast their Admiral-Galley into the bargain; And I did
with all my Fleets accompany the King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> towards his Port.
And having attended him, as far as with safety I might, and paid him all
the Sea-honours I was capable of, which yet-his Condition made him ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
he had received, I then cast Anchor, and in impatiencies above
description, waited for the arrival of the Princess; to whom I had order'd
the Fleets to pay Submissions and Honours, which they never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
presented to any Admiral.</p>
               <p>Whilst this ambition'd happiness was expected in Raptures due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, or rather short of it, I perused a Letter brought me by my Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
from those two <hi>Cyprian</hi> Noblemen, to whom <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had
given their King's Body; who therein did acquaint me, That the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Honours due by their Laws to their King's Embalming, would
consume at least thirty days: by which time they desired, if any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassions
called me elsewhere, I would appoint all the remainder of the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet to be where now they Anchor'd, to receive their King's
Body, and to attend it into <hi>Cyprus</hi> to the Tomb of his Predecessors.
My Trumpeter also told me, That he learned <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> having as
totally defeated our right Wing, as I had his left, had determined by
a new Combat to have forced from me my Success, or increased it; but
that the then appearing of the Fleets of the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi>
which they knew was not for their assistance, they having then all the
help they could expect; But chiefly the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> King's Wounds,
which he dissembled till their effects then reveal'd them, and a large
Leak his Admiral-Galley had received, made him retire with the glory
of that Victory he had obtained over the <hi>Cyprians.</hi> That he had seen
the Body of <hi>Ascanius</hi> wept over by all his Subjects, which were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
who in the greatest of their Griefs, had evidenced the greatness
of their Loves.</p>
               <p>Whilst my Trumpeter was entertaining me with these Relations, I
perceived a Magnificent Barge appear from the Shore. I concluded
the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> was in it; and having drawn up my Fleet in a Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to receive her, leaving them in that Figure, I advanced with my
own Admiral-Galley, to wait on her: And as soon as I saw she was
there, I descended into my Barge, and in unconceivable Raptures went
aboard hers: where casting my self at her Feet, I did more by Actions
than Words, endeavour to shew her my Transports at her Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and at my having been Instrumental in it. She had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to receive me with that Empire and Modesty, which still accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
her highest Favours to me; and having with acknowledgments
dismist the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> and <hi>Bithynian</hi> Nobility, which had till then
waited on her, as <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> notwithstanding the pain of his wounds,
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:96335:346"/>
had done to the Barge, she ascended my Galley, and in it went to the
Fleet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who received her with shouts and clashing of Arms, and all the
other Military Evincements and Complements of Joy. Nay, all the
Flag-ships struck their signs of being such, and only let them fly again
when she commanded; to show, that she only gave Laws where I was
Admiral. All Ceremonies of her return being ended, she retired unto
the Stern-Cabbin of the Galley, and none being present but <hi>Nerea,</hi> I
did again prostrate my self at her Feet, and told her: Madam, I now
find the Honour of fighting in your Quarrel, cannot be greater than is
the Certainty of Success in so glorious a Cause; and if I failed of that
happiness once, it proceeded from the mercy of the gods: which though
intolerable to me, when dispensed; yet by what hath happened since, I
have found abundant cause to admire. But could I have prevented my
highest misery, at so Criminal a Price, as by wishing of your suffering, I
should have esteemed that sin equal to this Success; for such is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Veneration I pay the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> that to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
her Captivity, I would joyfully (had it been left at my Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction),
have suffered what the gods destined, her Captivity should
prevent. The fair <hi>Statira</hi> by her blushes seemed to tell me she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what I meant; and she had too the condescension to give me this
Answer.</p>
               <p>If you have received any advantage by a Captivity you then so much
deplored, and would have so fatally revenged, on him who had been
so far from acting it, that he almost lost his life to prevent it, I shall
find that contentment in it upon your score, which I could not on my
own; for 'tis but reason, that he who frees me from Captivity, should
receive some consolation in my having undergone it: and that my suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
should pay some of that Debt, which my Actings could not.
And since by experience you have Learned, that even the bitterest
things which the Gods cast upon us, have by patient waiting on them,
a sweetness in the Result, I will nope, that thereby we shall be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with an entire Resignation, to submit to whatever portion they
snall think fit to allot us. 'Tis in the force of this Duty, that I find strength
to submit to the loss of the unhappy <hi>Ascanius;</hi> and though he perished
for my Relief, and though by designation of my Father, his nearness to
me might apologize for my Tears, nay, render them a Duty: yet so much
I mind that hand from whence I received that stroke, that in as little
Emotions, as the frailty of my Nature is capable of, I desire to submit
unto it. At these words, said <hi>Callimachus,</hi> her Eyes were obscured,
which made me say, Madam, In those admirable Expressions, you do not
more evidence your piety to the gods, than by those unvaluable Tears,
you manifest your kindness and Esteem for <hi>Ascanius;</hi> whose fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is Celebrated with nobler Obsequies, than all his Friends and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
can design for him. To be loved by the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> whilst he
was alive, and to be wept by her when he was dead, are Felicities
which render him a fitter object of Envy, than of Sorrow: And since,
Madam, you are so Charitable and Just to the Dead, Permit me to beg
you to be the like to him that yet is alive; which is, to believe, though
had I got as much by your Captivity, as the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> lost; yet even
therein I should have condemned your Fate, and my own too, for being
so mistaken, as to think I could raise any joy, by your sorrow. In that
particular, the power of Destiny is limited; for it can present nothing
of contentment to me, which is caused by your suffering. Could you,
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:96335:347"/>
Madam, believe the contrary, To lead you out of that injustice (pardon
the Zeal of that expression) I would elect Eternally to be miserable,
rather than be made happy by a cause, which might confirm you in that
misbelief; and might reproach me with having valued my self above
you. But, Madam, I continued, whilst I ought to imploy all my time
in expressions of my Trouble that you were made a Captive, and of my
Joy that you are no longer one; will you pardon me, if I employ some
of it, in imploring a concession from you, which only can be granted by
you; and which I fear you may with Justice deny me. 'Tis, that by
your Order I may enjoy a part of this dayes Victory, which by the Law
of Arms is mine already; yet only by your decree, can Authentickly be
made such. The Princess again was cover'd with Blushes, fearing my
Confidence had been greater than my Success; and that my implorings
would have been more suted to my desires, than my merit: therefore to
free her from those wounding imaginations, I told her, by the fate of
War <hi>Ascanius</hi> lost his Flag, and by the chance of War I recover'd it.
'Tis the Effigies of a <hi>Venus</hi> ascending from the Sea; but a <hi>Venus</hi> so like
the Princess <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> that no Production of Art was ever compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to it. I thereupon presented her with the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>'s Flag,
which contained a Copy, nothing but the Original could transcend.
She consider'd it a while, more I believe to gain time to form her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
than on any other score; for her Glass could alwayes entertain
her with a nobler Prospect: though whilst she was unresolved what to
say, she might the sooner be induced to grant my suit, than give Reasons
for denying it; and therefore I did with no small importunity, seek a
Return to my Request; which at last obtained from her these
words.</p>
               <p>I am wholly ignorant, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> of your Maritine Laws; but I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you are so just, as not to ask any thing from me, contrary to them;
and since you are on that Element where you give the Law, I must not
contradict what you assure is yours by it: though in my own Judgment,
I think it little just, that two Fleets which came to Fight in the same
Quarrel, the misfortune of the one, should compose the Trophies of the
other. Madam, I reply'd (expecting at least as much reservedness as I
found) 'tis not time, but possession which gives Armed numbers a Title
to what they possess; else those which did wrong the longest, should have
the greatest Right to what in wrong-doing they acquired. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Enemy being a while possest of this Flag, <hi>Ascanius</hi> lost his Title
to it, and the property was alter'd; which when it was our Adversaries,
was both lawful for me to recover, and keep when it was recover'd.
I know not, said the Princess, whether the Laws be not proportionate
to the Element, on which, or for which, they are made, and therefore
that being wild, those may be the like also, as best suted to it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
received as such, Custom may authorize what reason could not; else
if the possession of an Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alters the property of what is possessed, and
that this Rule went throughout in all Cases, (as what is Reason in one
particular, ought to be the like in every other of a parallel nature) then
Prisoners of your side which are taken by an Enemy, if recovered by
you, are Prisoners also to you; and so the success of their Friends changes
not their Condition, but their Masters. By this Law too, said the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
smiling, <hi>Tomsones, Rebadates,</hi> and to say no more, even <hi>Nerea</hi> her
self must be that to you, which your Valour and Civility have presently
freed them from being to another; and thus make one of the noblest
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:96335:347"/>
Actions of Friendship, become in its effect one of the highest impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Enmity; and thereby make what should nourish and encrease
Friendship, totally destroy it: by this rule also <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> must be <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>'s
Prisoner; and had both those Kings been recovered by their
Soldiers, they must have been such unto their very Subjects. I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
said <hi>Callimachus,</hi> this reasoning of the Princesses did not a
little surprize me; and her particularly specifying no higher than <hi>Nerea,</hi>
with that smile which accompanied it, seemed to tell me what she would
not speak. I therefore made no small haste to tell her, There is, Madam,
a vast difference between the exchanges and acquisitions in War; that
which is by Pact and Agreement, relishing more of the Civil, than the
Military nature, is exempted from these wild Rules which Force has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and Custom has authorized amongst Soldiers: besides, Madam,
things which men may buy and sell, and thereby may transfer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of them to the Master which last acquired them, may well have
that property transfer'd by the purchase of mens Swords, which may be
transfer'd by common ways of bargaining. But Women and Men, not
being vendable, are not subjected to the like rules that things which are
so, are liable unto: for liberty being not to be valued, ought not to be
sold, though it be lost: and so life, though it be above price, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
exempted from deprivation. But, Madam, I hope you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that when I first moved this unfortunate request, I told you what I
was to beg, was fit to be denied: and since I find the invinciblest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against me, is that of your not approving what I have implored,
I here put a period to my sute, and change those Prayers which I made
to obtain it, into as fervent ones for your pardon, that I durst desire it;
only Madam, I will earnestly beg that you will so dispose of it, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has the glory to bear your Image, may never be exposed to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of composing a Trophy to your Enemies; and for my particular,
I shall find my contentment in my obedience, and in carrying about me
an Image which much more resembles you, and which lies not in the
power of fate to take from me. <hi>Statira</hi> receiving the Flag which I then
presented her, told me; though I know few things I more desire, than to
receive evidences that <hi>Callimachus</hi> is of my opinion, yet not to appear
too unworthy thereof; and to owe that in some degree to his Justice, as
well as to his Civility; I will only mind him, that there are Slaves amongst
men, and made so by no law, but force; but yet are bought and sold,
as merchandize is; and though liberty to him that loses it, is above
price; yet he that takes it from him, values it to him that buys it of him:
Though thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gs inanimate taken by force of Arms, become the property
of those who take them, and are no longer so to those that lose them;
yet all such things are not subjected to that Law: for then the Images
of our Gods, in which we reverence themselves, might by the fate of
War become the property of men. 'Tis upon this score that I accept of
this Present; had it born any Image, but that of a Deity, I should have
rejoyced at your possessing of it. But since it carries the <hi>Effigies</hi> of a
Goddess you have formerly adored, in reverence to what she is in her
self, and for what she has been to you, allow me to restore her to her
Temple, from whence I shall oblige all the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> by solemn vow,
never to remove her; lest the needless exposing of their Goddess, may
make their whole Island indure the like misfortune, which their unhappy
King has been involved in; and whose fall I attribute to the impiety of
carrying that power he Worshipt, to a Forreign War, which should have
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:96335:348"/>
still resided in her Temple at home. The piety of my Princess in giving
me this refusal, and at the same time, confecrating her Picture to a
Temple, the just, though undesigned reward due unto it, gave me a full
Consolation, and made me admire the goodness of the gods, that in the
duty of taking their part, made her receive ever after her self, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
due unto themselves. For that noble <hi>Effigies</hi> being accepted of
by the chief Commander of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet, on the terms the Princess
prescribed, was by him sent unto <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and in the Temple at <hi>Paphos</hi>
is worshipped unto this day. Yet <hi>Statira,</hi> to hinder as much as in her
lay any Glory, which her resemblance to that Picture might cast upon
her, Caused to be written over it in great Letters of Gold, <hi>The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
Venus.</hi> The fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> having thus taken, or rather accepted
from me, the highest prize of that dayes Victory, did by many repeated
Civilities convince me, that that Action proceeded from her respect to
the gods, and not out of want of it to me; so that I received more from
her denial of what I had asked, than I could have received in the grant
of it. I decline particularlizing all those discourses which then past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us; mine chiefly consisting in the expressions of my Joy for her
Deliverance, and hers in expressions of Acknowledgments to me for
it.</p>
               <p>Whilst we were making ready to Sail for <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> whither the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Affairs did call me, as well as the restoring the
Princess to her Father; I entertained with many embraces, <hi>Rebadates,
Tomsones,</hi> and those other Gentlemen, to whose Valour and Friendship
I owed so much; and having ordered the <hi>Cilician,</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Fleets
their Stations, for blocking up the Island, and residue of the Enemies
Fleet, till with mine I had transported the Prince <hi>Ataphernes</hi>'s Army;
I assembled the chief <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Commanders, and desired to
know of them, what instructions they had in case of their King's death,
which now was happened; and if they had none, what resolutions they
had Elected, in which if any assistance of mine were necessary, I might
pay it them. They told me their Instructions were, in case that misery
should befall them, which now had happened, never to stir from <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>'s
Service, till the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> was at liberty; and then to
obey her Commands, whilst his Successor allowed them that Honour.
This made me accompany them to the Princess, who was not a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
at this assurance; but having declined that power <hi>Ascanius</hi> had
given her, and they protesting a perfect Obedience to it; She told them,
that she thought she could no way better use that unexpected Authority
which their dead King had given her, than imploying it in Orders which
might evidence the Value and Honour she had for him; that therefore
they should keep about the Island, till the Solemnites there, of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
were ended, and then attend his Body to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and obey the
Orders of their new King. This they all declared they would punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
obey. Having thus setled things, that Fleet which was to wait on
the Princess, and transport her Brother's Army, weighed Anchor, and
steer'd their Course towards the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which the neerer we
came unto, the more I found my Joys clouded; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igh Honour of
the <hi>Pontick</hi> King's Alliance, and the higher of possessing the Princess
<hi>Mithridatia,</hi> would, I knew to well, draw all the Eastern Kings to his
Court; and thereby only alter my Rivals, not suppress my Fears.
Whilst I was entertaining my self with these sad thoughts in my Cabbin,
which was under the Princesses, they forced from me such loud and
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:96335:348"/>
violent sighs, that even <hi>Statira</hi> heard them; which perswaded her to
send <hi>Nerea</hi> to visit me, lest some unexpected indisposition might have
seized me. I was ashamed when <hi>Nerea</hi> came with this message, that my
troubles had been so loud in their effects; and therefore finding by her,
that <hi>Statira</hi> was not in any entertainment, which my waiting on her
might offensively interrupt: I went to her Cabbin with <hi>Nerea,</hi> to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize
for the rudeness of my Griefs, which yet had obtained the honour
of her sending to enquire after me.</p>
               <p>I thought, said <hi>Statira,</hi> that the Glory you had this day acquired, and
the Obligations which you have laid upon me, would have exempted
you from troubles like unto those which you have often assured me,
my Captivity did only occasion. I observed when the Princess was
speaking these words to me, that the motion of the Galley having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
<hi>Nerea,</hi> she retired to a small Cabbin at the door of the great
one; which made me to kneel at <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s feet, and tell her; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
Madam, in the Day of your Deliverance, I ought to entertain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but raptures of Joy; and that I ought not to admit of a grief,
whose troublesome productions have even reached your Ears: Judg,
Madam, what my Griefs must be, when in such an occasion of Joy, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suppress them, nay, from coming to your Knowledg. Had they
been confined to my own Breast, they would have acted that miracle
of becoming at once the more great, and the more supportable; the
giving of vent to Sorrow, which to others is an ease, in me is a sin:
For my afflictions are of such a Quality, that they appear as great a Crime,
as a Punishment to me; and could I tell the Cause of my Sorrows to any,
they could no more pity, or advise me, than I can pity or advise my
self. Yes, Madam, the knowledg of what I ought to do, is not more
evident, than is the impossibility of doing it; I am necessitated at the
same time to condemn what I act, and still to act what I condemn. I
thought, and hoped, replyed the Princess, that since you could find by
your own confession, even my Captivity a mercy from the gods, which
at first you had considered as their sharpest Judgment; you would in
that past Event, have found wherewith to have raised your Faith in any
other in the future; I rather expected you would have contributed to
ease those Sorrows <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s death hath rais'd in me, than add unto them,
by acquainting me with your own. I could bring, Madam, I answer'd,
but a few reasons to console you for the Death of one, whose Condition
has always had, and now does deserve rather my Envy, than my Sorrow.
That Generous Prince lived in your favour, and died in your Service;
what life could be more happy, and what Death could be more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Do not therefore, Madam, I humbly conjure you, expect that I
should console You for that Fate in another, which I ambition for my
self; and if you are capable of such a condescention, as to entertain a
grief for either, bestow yours upon him, who aspires at no better a
Destiny than that, which even in another you think fit to lament: If he
deserves your weepings, who had all that I wish; what then do I, who
want all that he had, and wish no more than what he possess'd? You
are, said the Princess, casting on me a languishing look, too too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
to torment me; <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s death, which is my Sorrow, you
tell me is your Envy; And <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s life, which is my contentment,
you tell me is his Trouble. But, O gods! <hi>Callimachus,</hi> What new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
can those be, since I saw you last, which can raise such a storm
in you? Madam, I answer'd, no new afflictions have befaln me; But only a
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:96335:349"/>
more clear contemplation of those I am already involved in: whilst you
were in troubles, the duty I owed you, and the care of ending them, so
intirely took me up, that I neither had the time, nor the will to reflect
on my own; as the greater Sorrow suspends the Actings and Effects of
the lesser: But now that the Justice of the gods have put a period to
yours; the same Justice revives mine: For I have that sensible accession
to my sufferings, as to be convinced, my Ambition does deserve them:
And I think by the rest they have had, gathering new strength, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
me with the more unsupportable Violence; possibly in revenge,
that having been so vast, I could so long neglect them. Alas, Madam,
could you condescend to a thorough consideration of the causes of my
Sorrow, you could not but pity, if not excuse their production; for
what is there now for the unhappy <hi>Callimachus</hi> to expect? He has nothing
which can be so much as acceptable by you, but his Services to you; and
those, the height of your condition, and the lowness of his own, renders
his hopes of paying, equal impossibilities: I am so far from the expectancy
of Happiness, that I am not within the wishes of it; for though by the
Crime of Fate, my Sword has been render'd serviceable to you, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be guilty of the Crime of wishing you may ever be reduced to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of repeating that misery, though I were certain of repeating that
Honour. You see, Madam, how desirous soever I am to serve you, yet I
am much more desirous you may never stand in need of being served by
me; And even whilst by the sin of your Destiny, I derived an occasion
to serve you, yet I shall call it the Sin of your Destiny; and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
it presented me, could not bribe me to call it by another Name:
Nay, the sorrow that you were in captivity, silenced the Joy of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instrumental to end it. Sure, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> said <hi>Statira,</hi> interrupting
me, you cannot notwithstanding all that you have said, esteem your
self more unhappy, than you esteem me unjust; you first make me bad,
thereby to make your Condition worse: Do you think your Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are so small, and my sense of them the like, that unless you still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
me with new ones, those I have already been loaded with, will lose
their Efficacy; I am not a little pleased you have told me the cause of
your Troubles, how wounding soever they are to me, both upon your
account and mine also; since thereby I find in freeing you from being
unjust to me, I free you from being the like unto your self. And in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
I need fresh and unintermitted Obligations from you, you injure
me as much as you oblige me by your favours to me: which are of a
nature, that whilst I have life, I must remember them; and whilst I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, I must rather be troubled, considering my incapacity to
acknowledg them as I ought, and as they deserved, that they are so
many, than that they are no more. Your past Actions have hitherto
obliged me in a degree, that nothing can equal, but the generosity with
which they were confer'd, and the sense with which they were received;
and for the future, what can be more obliging, than after your eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
your great concernment to serve me, you evidence a greater, that
I may never be in a Condition to be served by you? By which its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posible,
but that I must still be obliged to your performances, or to
your wishes. Alas, Madam, I reply'd, if my Services be valued by you,
how unhappy have I been, that I have pay'd you so few; and how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
am I, that I can neither hope, or so much as wish ever to pay you
any more? I see your goodness endeavours to repair the Deficiencies of
my Fate; and finding I am never likely in the future to serve you but in
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:96335:349"/>
wishes, you would have me believe, that even those are accepted of by
you; when that Condescention rather increases my debt, than any way
lessens my Trouble: But, Madam, since by your Mercy, you seem not to
be unmoved at my Sorrow; and since it's above me ever to cast it off. I
will endeavour to cloud that which I cannot conquer; and so confine my
Afflictions to my heart, that I will keep them as invisible to your Eyes,
as I have beg'd of the gods I could have kept that Adoration which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a greater confidence in me to acknowledg, than it was an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to avoid. Perhaps, Madam, I may not tell you an untruth, if I should
assure you, that my Ambition cannot be more strange than is my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of its punishment: For whereas in other Afflictions, it's a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
not to deserve them; in mine, the contrary is the only one I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:
for by the knowledg of the vastness of my Crimes, I derive some
support in the enduring of their Punishment. For since all that I do suffer,
nay all that I can suffer (if at least both those be not the same in me) is in
my own Estimation much disproportionate to the height of my aspiring,
the Justice of the punishment hinders me from repining at it, though not
from being sensible of it; and the less you condemn my offence, the more
just I esteem my sufferings, and the less impatiently I will bear them. Yes,
Madam, though I know by attending you back to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> I shall
restore you to the capacity of repeating that fatal Obedience for some
other King, which the Justice of the gods has punished <hi>Ascanius</hi> for soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
and accepting; and though by my waiting on you to your Father,
I am like to see what I most fear; yet I will go: yes, I will pay you my
duty, though to the encrease of my Torment. But, Madam, if some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
look, if some unsuppressible groan force it self from me, pardon, I
beg you a Fault, which you cannot be so much troubled to see, as I shall
be to commit; And ascribe all to a sorrow which possibly will not be
above your pity, since 'tis for having offended you, that 'tis so great and
unconfinable: Or else, Madam, permit me, rather than to be still a trouble
to you, and a greater to my self, because I am such to you, to seek that
Death on some Enemies Sword, which you have prohibited my own from
acting; you shall then soon be convinced, that I have not so willingly
offended you, as I am ready to punish my self for having done so; and that
nothing is more preferable to me, than revenging of you. But fair Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
if my sin be such, that your Justice decrees me rather to a lingring,
than a speedy Death: and that you therefore condemn me to see all those
Kings prostrate at your Feet, which the priviledg <hi>Mithridates</hi> gave <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
will invite unto that happy Posture: (For no Monarch that knows
the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> is to be obtained, but will flie to be that happy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that shall obtain her). If, I say, Madam, you Destine me to this misery,
I have destined my self to an entire submission to it; and I shall think my
Torments my Happiness, if by undergoing the greatness of them you may
be convinced, my Passion, and my Obedience, are proportionate to your
Beauties, and to the Duty I owe you.</p>
               <p>Though possibly, said <hi>Statira,</hi> this Discourse might as much trouble me,
as the condition you apprehend your self in, does you; and that some
parts of it might justly exempt me from answering any of it: yet to let you
see, That your past Obligations, and your present Wishes have that
Operation on me which I even now assured you they had, I will not
only pass over, without any further notice, what you have spoke; but
advise you too, not to afflict your self with antedated fears, which is to
abuse your Reason, and make that wound you, which should help you.
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:96335:350"/>
Our highest Prerogative so imployed, will make the condition of Beast
preferable to that of Man; they feel nothing but what actually is: and if you
so injure that noble Gift, as thereby to sink your self below the state of
irrational Creatures, 'tis but just that even that blessing should be your
Tormentor.</p>
               <p>Ah Madam! I reply'd, Judg then of my condition, when that which
in it self is given for a Preservative against sorrow, and often a Cure of it,
changes its nature, and becomes the cause of that, whose effects it should
remedy. Reason, reply'd the Princess, is still it self, and therefore still a help;
if ever it be other, 'tis in the abuse, not in the nature of it. If by a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of things to come, I have more reason to fear the Ill, than to
hope the Good, I have then Reason not to entertain those considerations;
and if it cannot hinder me from being miserable, when I must be so, it shall
hinder me from being so, before I am so: Nay, after I actually am miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
Reason leads me into a contemplation of the gods, who inflict the
punishments, as well as they bestow the blessings; and who being just in
all their ways, I am taught by it to believe, I deserve what they impose;
and therefore should with cheerfulness submit to what they determine,
especially, when by repining at what I must acknowledg, I deserve (or
else I must not acknowledg them to be just; and to deny any of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
is in effect to deny them), I provoke the continuance of their
Judgments, and by an entire resignation I hasten their forgiveness. Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> I teach you the Theory of what I have practised my self;
and when I advise you to that which I follow, though you may suspect
the advice, yet you cannot the Adviser. Since, Madam, I reply'd, your
goodness does not decline the condescention of giving advice to so unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and low a Person as I am, permit it, I beseech you, to continue its
actings; and having told me what I should not do, that is not reflect upon
what is to come, and not express a sadness for what is, let it also tell me
what I shall do. Wait upon the good pleasure of the gods, said <hi>Statira,</hi>
they know better what is fit for you, than you know what is fit for your
self; and their Time is the best. But to fortifie you in the duty of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
remember, That nothing can be more improbable in the time
to come, than you have seen Acted in the time that is past; and this also
you may believe, if you please, That he whose Death I deplore, and
whose condition you say you envy, had not more of my esteem than
you have: and perhaps had not so many assurances thereof from me, as
you have had. Let this suffice, continued the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> rising up, and
Blushing; and if you have that Friendship for me, that I believe you
have, do not force me to give you such (I will only say) uneasie evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mine. These words, said <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and the obliging Majesty
with which they were spoke, charmed all my despair, and my Tongue
also; for I had not words to declare my thoughts, nor gestures to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the raptures of my Gratitude: which possibly yet might expose
my Acknowledgment to her apprehension, in more lively and significant
Characters, than any other way they could have been exprest in. As
soon as <hi>Statira</hi> was risen, she told me, I doubt <hi>Nerea</hi> will think I am more
concerned for your indisposition, than I should be, and less for hers than
I ought to be: Let us therefore go and visit her. <hi>Statira</hi> went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to her Cabbin, which was at the door of her own, and finding
She was at most ease, when she lay on her Bed, would not permit her
to rise; but went her self upon the Deck, to take the fresh Air; and to
see at what rate she hastened towards <hi>Nicomedia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="773" facs="tcp:96335:350"/>
As soon as we were come upon the Deck, an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captain came
close up to my Galley in his own; and told me, That the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whose Valour I had so much esteemed, was recover'd out of his
fainting, and was desirous to be carried to <hi>Nicomedia</hi> to be cured of his
Wounds. The Sea, and the ill accommodations on it, being not only
troublesome, but dangerous to him; I forthwith stopt my Course, hoised
out my Boat, and received the Valiant Stranger with his Servants into my
Galley; but the motion in his removal, made him again to swound; and
<hi>Tomsones</hi> being present, calling hastily for some Vinegar, and chafing his
Temples and his Nostrils with it, he perceived the Blackness of his Face
to vanish with the force of his rubbing, and the sharpness of the Liquor:
and by degrees the whole coming off, he discovered a Countenance which
even in the paleness and disfigurings of Death, was not without Graces
and Charms which merited an Admiration. The Princess <hi>Statira</hi> at so
unexpected an Accident, went to see this strange mutation; and while
we were in the discourses of it, His chief Servant who was gone under
the Decks to prepare a Cabbin for him, returned: and finding what
<hi>Tomsones</hi> had done, exprest so much of grief more than astonishment,
that we all concluded, he was not a stranger to that Disguisement, nor a
little troubled at our discovery of it; but his Master's fainting beginning
to leave him, he carried him to his Bed. The Night of this day I sent
for the wounded Stranger's Servant, who called himself <hi>Photinus,</hi> and
desired him to acquaint me with his Lord's Name and Condition, and
why he had assumed such a Disguse? <hi>Photinus</hi> reply'd; I am Sir, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to Secresie in all these particulars, by such Sacred Ties, that should
I break them, I believe you would esteem my Obedience a greater
Crime than my Disobedience, for which yet I most humbly beg your
pardon: But this I will assure you, that his Quality and his Merit is
such, that you will not I hope repent your care of him; nor possibly,
when he knows how he ows you his Life or Liberty, and your Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to be acquainted who he is, will he decline satisfying you therein.
This Answer made me press him no farther, and made me enjoyn him to
acquaint me from time to time, how his Lord did, and whether any thing
was in my Power to serve him. I further desired him when we came to
<hi>Nicomedia,</hi> that he would carry him to my Appartment; where Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
should be provided for him, and all other Accomodations. <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>
promised me all that I expected, and having made me many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,
went to pay his usual care to his wounded Master.</p>

               <p>OUR Navigation was so prosperous, that the Sun at his rising
the second Day, discovered unto us the North-west Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
of the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and by Noon we were
come so near it, that to our wonder we perceived several
Horsemen quit their Horses: and with their Swords drawn,
run into a Wood, in which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had made a Wilderness, and often
delighted himself in visiting it. Remembring this, and seeing what I
did, I told my Apprehensions to the Princess, who was come on the
Deck at this News; and though we could not imagine the Cause of what
we beheld: yet the late Treachery that had been acted on her self, made
me doubt something of the same nature might have been practiced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the King. Which being her apprehensions as well as mine, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that my Galley should be rowed as near the Shore as might be;
and ordered all that Gallant Nobility, and Youth which was in it, to
Arm themselves, and follow me. This was immediately performed, and
our Boats had no sooner set some fifty of us on Shore, but we were too
well guided by the Shreeks of some Women, to the Center of the Wood,
where we found all the King's Guards kill'd, or routed: and by one that
was flying away, we learned, that about three Hundred select Men had
lain in Ambush in the Wilderness. And when the King with the Prince
<hi>Atafernes,</hi> the Queen, the Princess <hi>Nisa,</hi> and the Princess <hi>Cleopatra</hi> were
diverting themselves in that pleasant Place, they were forthwith assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by unknown Men; And the Guards running to their Rescue, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to make use of their Horses by reason of the thickness of the
Wood, were after a brisk Fight, killed and dispersed; only the King,
and Prince with some of their Attendants, getting into a Summer-House
where the Queen and Princess were, defended the door of it in hope of
Relief; but he had even then seen it forced, and many of the Enemy
enter it. This Relation he told us, whilst we were running to their Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue;
and lest our endeavours might be fruitless, I sent forthwith Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to my Galley, which was advanced a League before all the rest of
the Fleet, to make all possible diligence to the Western part of the
North-west Promontory, to hinder any Vessels from escaping that way:
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:96335:351"/>
for the place in which this Attempt was made, easily perswaded me to
believe it was from the Sea that these Enemies were come. These Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
given, we continued our March with such speed, that we discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Enemies, whom immediately we assaulted; and who received us
with that Resolution which became Men, that attempted their Design.
The Fight was bloody, and my small Troop being heightened by the
glory of so Noble an occasion to evidence their Courages, did it in so
unresistable a degree, that the resolutest of our Adversaries began to lose
their Ground as well as their Number, though still fighting and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the Sea-side. I easily judged thereby, that their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was to recover their Vessel; and therefore by a resolute Charge, we
so discomposed them, that they turned their backs, and made precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately
to their Boats, into two whereof some of them got, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Launced out towards a Galley, which then we discover'd riding
in a Creek in the Promontory. The trouble we received by their then
Escape, was raised to a height above my description; when by one of
our Prisoners we learned that in the largest of those Boats they sent
away the King, and Prince much wounded; and all the Princesses, Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
'Twas time to act, and therefore though we had cause, yet we
had not leisure to grieve: we seized upon one Boat that remained, and
pursued after them, as well as four Oars could carry us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were all
we could find. But alas! we soon found how fruitlesly we labour'd; for
before we could get half way to their Galley, we saw them enter into
it with their Noble Prize: and cutting their Cables with as much hast as
Oars and Sails could lend them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bent their course for <hi>Greece.</hi> Whilst we
were in the trouble of this Prospect, I was revived by the fight of my
own Galley, doubling the Point. Her Celerity in the obedience of my
Orders was unspeakably welcome. I hastily got on Board, told the fair
<hi>Statira</hi> what we had done, and what we had failed of; and promising
all the Slaves their Liberty if they overtook the flying Galley, they so
powerfully plied their Oars, that we immediately found we gained visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of them. The rest of my Fleet, which were above twenty Furlongs
behind, seeing me alter my course, and not knowing the cause of it; for
though I saw the Galley I pursued, and my Fleet saw mine, yet by the
interposition of the Head-Land they saw not what I chased: And having
positive Order to sail directly into the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and none to
the contrary, continued their Course thither; so that by the time I was
gotten within half a League of the Enemy, they could discover no Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel was within two Leagues of me; and therefore scorning to flye from
a single Galley, saved me the labour of following them, and turning
about their Prow, came as fast towards me, as a little before she had fled
from me.</p>
               <p>Over-joyed with this unlooked for Gallantry, I went into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
Cabbin; and told her, I hope now, Madam, (telling her what
the Enemy had done) to do you that Service on the Sea, that I fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of paying you on the Shore: and I am come now only to beg you to
permit the lights of your Cabbin to be stopt up, lest any Darts or Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
of the Enemy might fly into them. You see, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
how the sins of our Family afford you too often occasions to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
it; and you may perceive how fallacious even the best judgments
are in Humane things: when you could yesterday believe, I was in a
Condition above your Services, and this Day all the Royal House of
<hi>Pontus,</hi> depend upon your Sword. The gods, I reply'd, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:96335:352"/>
it to so high a Glory, will, I question not, give it a proportionate
Success: And having only permitted the Royal House of <hi>Pontus</hi> to receive
some of their frowns, that it may be the more sensible of their smiles;
they had rais'd it so high, that it being uncapable of accessions, they
have subjected it to Changes, and then to Restaurations; that in those
vicissitudes, the impossibilities of additions might be repaired. Your
Virtues, Madam, are a security to your whole Family; and since I now
fight to restore them, and to preserve you, to doubt Success were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
me to a denial of it. The Princess at the end of what I had spoke,
perceiving some blood trickle down from a Wound I had received in my
left Arm, had the mercy to lament it, and the condescension to take
off a Ribband of her own, and to bind it up; which unvaluable Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was no sooner conferred, than <hi>Demetrius</hi> came to the Cabbin-Door
to tell me the Enemy was at hand. I therefore hastily took my
leave, and was scarce got at the head of my Men, when our Galleys
shook one another with their Brazen Prows; and then, as if it had been
by mutual consent, grappled so strongly, that nothing but Victory was
able to unloose them: never possibly in so little Room was performed so
great things; our Numbers seemed equal, and our Resolutions the same,
which were to Conquer or to Die. Twice they got into my Galley, and
once oftner I got into theirs, which in the End proved fatal to them; for
perceiving with how much difficulty we had purchas'd that advantage,
we as resolutely kept it; and so many of mine got in after me, that the
Commander of our Enemies, called <hi>Enastes,</hi> who was a Lord of <hi>Pontus,</hi>
who was in highest esteem with <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and his Vice-Admiral, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
since they could not keep us out, it would be difficult, if possible
to keep us from vanquishing them now we were got in, with a loud
Voice called me twice by my name; and told me, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> There
is already too much blood spilt on either side; but since that precious
loss is not to be repaired, Let us prevent the increase of it, and let
thou and I decide the Quarrel. I was not a little pleased at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which gave me an opportunity singly to do a Service to my Princess
and all her Family, which otherwise had been divided amongst so many,
that my share of it had been inconsiderable. I therefore told him, The
advantage which my Friends have over thine, is already so visible, that
in this Combat they have acquired as much Honour as it is capable to
present them. A farther progress may increase the number of the Dead,
not the visibility of their Success; and though thou esteemest it no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopeful
expedient, in the ruinous Condition to which thou art reduced,
to bring the decision now to an equal number, which the Valour of my
Friends have reduced to an unequal one: Yet to let thee see the justice
of my Quarrel needs no advantage to end it, I accept of thy desire.</p>
               <p>Both parties at what we had said, suspended fighting; and mine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten the Prow of his Galley, and his defending the residue of it,
we had close by the Main-mast a Stage for our Duel, in which <hi>Enastes</hi>
was as Unfortunate as Valiant: and after no inconsiderable resistance, he
fell dead under my Sword, oppressed with Wounds. I was sorry at his
Death for the obligation he had laid on me, by inviting me to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and by declining a further Flight. When he saw himself pursued
by one Galley, all his Soldiers when he was vanquish'd, in the fury of
that loss renewed the Fight with much obstinacy; and one of them see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all was lost, resolved to accompany his own Death with an Action
which might take from us all cause of rejoycing at it; for running hastily
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:96335:352"/>
to the Stern-Cabbin, where the Queen, the two Princesses, <hi>Atafernes</hi> and
<hi>Mithridates</hi> were kept Prisoners; he opened the Door, and in a furious
Voice he cryed out, King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> I must now be revenged on thee,
for having so long usurped the Throne of the King of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> and
Thine, and thy Sons Blood, must answer for the Blood of so many of my
Friends, as thine have spilt, and which but in this way I cannot revenge.
This threatning was not more Cruel, than Friendly to those against whom
it was made; for the warning it gave them, not only raised them from
their Beds on which they were laid for the ease of their Wounds: but
also gave <hi>Monyma,</hi> the Princess <hi>Nisa,</hi> and the Princess <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> leisure
to put themselves before the King and the Prince; and by their shreeks
to call for assistance, which admitted no delay. The Galleys being grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the sides of each of them touched one another; and therefore those
Cries reached the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> who abandoning her Cabbin, came upon
the Deck, and told me, Alas <hi>Callimachus</hi> Whilst you dispute my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
and Brother's Liberty, they are losing their Lives. This Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
made me fly to the Cabbin, and so timely, that the Monster in
it having flung down all those weak impediments which had opposed
him, had his Sword bloody with one Wound he had given the King,
and with another he had made in <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s shoulder; who being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to stand to defend <hi>Mithridates,</hi> had generously cast himself on his
knees before him: and with some of his Bed-cloaths wrapped about his
Arm, endeavoured in that posture, and with that pitiful defence, to save
his Father's Life with the loss of his own. The horrid Cruelty of this
<hi>Bithynian,</hi> and the admirable piety of this great Prince, gave such Wings
to my Revenge, that they saw that Monster kill'd, before they saw him
who did it; But as soon as I had lifted up the fight of my Helmet, and
that thereby they discovered who had paid them so seasonable a Service,
I saw in <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Countenance a Joy as great, that I had saved his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and him, as that they were so unexpectedly saved. <hi>Mithridates</hi>
too, though much wounded, took me in his Arms, and in Elogies and
Embraces testified his Joy and his Kindness. The Queen in the raptures
of this unlooked-for Safety, gave me Eminent marks of her Satisfaction
and Friendship; And, though possibly they might have been mixed with
fome other Ingredient; yet all was attributed meerly to the Transports
of their then Condition, compared with what so lately it had been. In
the midst of this Noble Entertainment, the Princely <hi>Statira</hi> came into
the Cabbin. The sight of her fill'd all that were in it with new Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
for the King having in the cool of the Morning left <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the
Galley I had sent to advertise him of our Victory, was not then arrived,
which had hinder'd him from receiving an Account of it. <hi>Mithridatia</hi>
therefore told him of our Naval Success, of the rate at which we had
bought it; and how she was exchanged. The loss of <hi>Ascanius,</hi> who the
<hi>Pontick</hi> King intirely loved, qualified not a little the Extacies he was in;
and even in his Sorrow for the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he evidenced how much
he had esteemed him. But at last <hi>Mithridates</hi> thinking 'twas to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to the gods, to let one cause of Trouble cloud so many causes
of Satisfaction, He wiped off those Tears he had shed for his intended
Son-in-Law; and in embracing his Favourite-Daughter, seemed by that
happy priviledg and posture, to know and act a certain Cure for the
deepest Afflictions. I therefore told him, Now that you have the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Statira</hi> in your Arms, I believe Sir, you will think your Civilities
to <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> whilst he was your Prisoner, were not misplaced; for
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:96335:353"/>
but in the Duty he owed her, and the retributions he owed you for
them, he could not have made so unequal a Bargain, as to have exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Princess above Ransom, for the dying Body of <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> And
if I presumed to dispose of such a Prisoner without your knowledg, I
will hope for your Pardon upon two Accounts; The first is, his Wounds
were so many and dangerous, that had I sent for your Orders, he might
have been unexchangeable before I had received them. The second is,
That having an offered Exchange for the Princess, the Crime of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
permitting her so long to continue Prisoner, as must have been
employed in sending for your Commands, and receiving them, would
have been greater, than the releasing her without them. These were my
Inducements, Sir, to do it, when I lay before the Island of <hi>Scyros;</hi> but
now I find that the gods themselves have approved thereof. For had I
not done what I did, the Punishment would have equalled the Sin; for
the Royal House of <hi>Pontus</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d now been what the Princess lately was:
whereas by her freedom the gods have acted yours, and made that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
or Product of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates,</hi> though the Chyrurgeons were dressing his, and the
Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Wounds, made me this Reply. You have, <hi>Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
employed that Power I gave you, so much to my Honour and
Satisfaction, that your desiring a forgiveness is really a greater Offence,
than that for which you ask it; and to evidence you have not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
me to the height, but that I am sensible you have done so, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
before the gods and all these Witnesses, that whatever you ask
of me, without any exception, I will grant it you; for you have
given me more than you can ask of me. And lest your Modesty might
hinder you from asking, I enjoyn you to ask; nay, by that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
you have for me, I command you to do it: but lest this Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might be a surprise, I give you three days time to deliberate, that
you may think of something worthy your mentioning, and worthy my
giving. To convince you too, how fixed I am in this Resolution,
and how knowing I am in your Vertue, I conjure you make me no
Reply, nor Excuses; and grant me this Request, as an Evidence you
believe, I will grant you yours. All the while the King was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these charming words, my Eyes were fixed on my Princess; and
her Blushes thereat told me her Apprehensions were, I would fix my
Request where I had fixed my Sight: But <hi>Mithridates</hi> having done
speaking, to obey him, I only bowed my self to his Feet, as an evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both of my Joy and Obedience. The generous <hi>Atafernes</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
observed my Looks, and his fair Sisters Blushes; and had the
goodness to whisper me these ravishing Words: Your Eyes, <hi>Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
have spoke your Request; and <hi>Statira</hi>'s readiness seems to be no
Irreconcilable Enemy to it: Leave the Management of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to my care. I whispered to him this Answer, 'Tis the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Great Prince, and not the want of resentment, that hinders me
from prostrating my self at your Feet, as some sign of my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
My Fortune cannot be but glorious, since you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the care of it: And what I despair of on my own account,
I will presume of upon yours. I will not, generous Princes, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> particularize all the Discourses which then entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Company; Only I observed the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> who in less
Services had honoured me with her taking notice of them, did not so
much as speak to me of this; which I durst not so flatter my self, as to
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:96335:353"/>
attribute to her intentions of giving me more lively and ambitioned Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of her Resentment, than Verbal acknowledgments could be: But
rather to her fear, That I would by my request to the King, owe that
to her Obedience which I could not hope for from her Inclination or
Justice; and thereby punish my offence, before I had committed it. To
remove therefore from the observation of others, those disorders which
such thoughts raised in me, I told the King, That all his Enemies having
paid by their Deaths the last Crime of their Lives, I came to receive his
Commands for his return to <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and how the Enemies Galley,
and their dead Bodies should be disposed of: begging him to remove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mine from the blood and noysomness of that he then was in. He
forthwith appointed all those dead Bodies to be flung over-Board, That
they might, as he said, receive their Burial where they had acted their Sin,
and suffered their Punishment; and that if any one of them were alive,
he should be brought to him, who should save him the sending of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld
to <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> The Galley being diligently searched, one Soldier
was found, who having bloodied himself all over, lay amongst the Dead
to avoid encreasing their number: But when he found they were cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Companions into the Sea, he discovered himself, hoping the fury
of the Execution was over. He was therefore brought to <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
who told him, I thought thy King would have endeavoured to recover
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> only by such Arms, and by such ways as he lost it: but since
with the loss of his Kingdom, he has lost his Kingly Vertues, and employs
his Soldiers to surprize Women, and murther his Enemies after they are
his Prisoners; Tell him from me, That by all the gods, and the Sacred
Ashes of my glorious Ancestors, if ever he comes into my hands, he shall
suffer that Death which it seems he had appointed for me. I give thee,
he continued thy life and liberty, to carry <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> if living, this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;
and I shall appoint thee a Vessel to transport thee to him. The
trembling Prisoner, who expected Death himself, was so confounded with
the assurance of life and liberty, and at the rate at which he was to buy it,
that he could not speak: and his silence being taken for his consent,
the King appointed the Captain of my Galley to see him sent away from
<hi>Nicomedia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Obligation I so recently had received from <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and the
high and just Value I paid his Gallantry, made me abhor this Oath and
Message; And therefore I began to move the <hi>Pontick</hi> King to consider,
how much better it would be to stop, than to send such a Denunciation.
I represented to him, That if <hi>Nicomedes</hi> had given Orders to kill him,
he had not been made a Prisoner; for it was easie to have acted the first.
Therefore that his having been taken alive whilst <hi>Enestes</hi> Commanded
his Enemies, and his being in danger of being Murthered, but <hi>Enestes</hi>
was killed, evidenced that the first proceeded from <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Orders,
the last from a Soldiers despair; that the Noble usage the Princess <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>
had received, and the Prince <hi>Pharnaces</hi> does receive, were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Manifestations how much a friend he was ever to Civility: and
therefore could not be capable of a Sin so far below a King, that it
was below a Man. Consider, reply'd <hi>Mithridates,</hi> Whether one of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>'s
Subjects durst kill a King that was his Prisoner, had their Orders
been only to have made me such; and had he not known that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
intitled him rather to Rewards than Punishments. To which
I answered; Consider also, I beseech you, Sir, that when that Monster was
about to kill you, you were not likely to be his King's Prisoner, nor
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:96335:354"/>
he himself ever to see his King; and therefore neither to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or Punishments from him. Even that, said <hi>Mithridates,</hi> evidences
the Truth of my belief; for 'tis not probable, that a Subject which
endures Banishment for the Love and Duty he owes his Prince, and
daily in his Service ventures his Life, would make the last Action of it
a violation of his Commands. If he thought you should be Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
how durst he have rob'd his King of such a Prisoner as I was?
Nay, and believing what you believe, against his Kings Orders: And
if he thought you would be Victorious, how drust he contrary also to
those supposed Orders, have taken away a Life which he could not but
know you would revenge by the loss of his, and all his parties. No,
no, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> he was confined to what he did by <hi>Nicomedes;</hi> and
nothing but Obedience could have tied him to his Attempts. Sir, I
replyed, even the unseasonableness of his Attempts, evinces it rather
an Action of despair, than obedience; no Duty to reasonable Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greater, than the Duty to Reason. His was a fury, and pardon me
if I say, 'tis not fit to judg by the Rules of Reason, of an irrational Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But if the contrary were allowable, I might say, he never began
his Villany, but when he was certain never to be accountable for it to
his King. And since the design denied him the hope of Life, if your
Servants had Success; and that he was so confident of their having it,
that he fled from the Combat; we may well ascribe his Action to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair:
and having failed of being Famous for succeeding in a bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
he resolved to make himself so for an impious one: The height
of wickedness is not attained unto at once, but gradually. The attempt
against your person being such; and <hi>Nicomedes</hi> in the whole course of
his life, having never done what misbecomes a Prince, proves him free
from Commanding, or permitting such a Crime. 'Tis but a Justice due
unto the whole course of his Gallantry, to believe him free from one
Action of the highest Guilt; at least, Sir, whatever you judg him to
be in your own thoughts, it will be but consonant to your usual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
not to condemn him till you hear him: you would not deal so with
your meanest Subjects. Therefore I will believe you will not use a great
Prince worse; if he owns the Action, he Authorises your intended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of it: and if he denies it, why should you credit the despair of a
Subject, more than the word and assurance of his King.</p>
               <p>Whoever, replyed <hi>Mithridates,</hi> has the wickedness to Command
such an attempt, will not want enough to deny it: And though I
have not a sufficient proof thereof judicially; yet I have as much
proof of it as the Nature of the Design can, or will admit. Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Darkness are rather judged by Circumstances, than Proofs.
'Tis enough I am satisfied of <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s guilt; and the Oath I have
sworn, is too Sacred to be recalled, or violated; therefore I conjure
you speak to me no more of it. I was, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> silenced,
but not convinced; and the King, whose Wounds hinder'd him not
from being able to go with help, led <hi>Monyma</hi> out of the Galley he was
in, into mine. The Prince <hi>Atafernes</hi> supported by two, was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thither, and the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> I led. But as if <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s
Vow of granting me my request, what ever it were, had a Magick-Charm
annexed unto it, I neither had the confidence to speak to her, nor she
the condescension to speak to me. <hi>Rebadates</hi> led the Princes <hi>Nisa,</hi> and
the Captain of my Galley the Princess <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> By that time we were
moving towards <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> we discovered the whole Fleet making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:96335:354"/>
us with all the celerity their Sails and Oars could give them; for
being come near unto the Shore, they learnt how the King had been
surprized, and therefore came to his Rescue. <hi>Galatides</hi> assured me, that
when I had doubled the North-west Cape, he thought I had Rowed
close along the Northern-shore; and that the darkness thereof had taken
away his sight of us, else he had steered as I did: but as soon as they
found their mistake, and learned the sad accident had befaln <hi>Mitbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
they flew to serve him, and follow me. The whole Fleet being
met, <hi>Mithridates</hi> made a Triumphant entry into <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and to
avoid the like hazard again, order'd a Fort to be built at the end of the
North-west Cape, where the Enemies Galley had concealed it self: and
such of his Guards as had fled from his defence, he put to death in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pontick</hi> King was no sooner come into his Palace, but the Princess
<hi>Nisa</hi> cast her self at his Feet; and in Tears and Prayers as moving as her
Tears, besought him to permit her now, to accomplish her Vow of retiring
into the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which his Commands only had so
long hinder'd her from accomplishing; and she made use of the late dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he had been in, as an Argument to perswade to allow one of that
Family, to be constantly interceding with the gods for the safety of the
rest, which had been so many times, and now so recently was endanger'd:
but the King not denying her Request, but only putting off the acting
it for a season, so grieved her, that she said, Since she was denied to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
her Vows at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> she was resolved to pay them to the gods at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia;</hi>
and since she could not be allowed to go from a Court to a
Temple, she would change a Court into a Temple: and from that hour
so wholly confined her self to her Devotions in the Palace, that she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
no force can hinder a resolved mind from serving the gods; and
that they can be adored out of a Cloyster, as acceptably as in one.
The Kings Wound requiring his silence, as well as bodily rest, all the
Company that waited on him, paid him the Duty of retiring as soon
as he was come to his Chamber; and the Queen, either to take from
me the opportunity and happiness of conversing with my Princess, or to
evidence the delight she had in being with her, accompanied me to her
Appartment: where perceiving those sleight hurts I had received, were
still undrest, they united their Commands unto me to retire to have
them looked after. This Injunction gave me, a deeper Wound than
any which their care was concerned for; But before the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
visited me, I visited the Generous <hi>Atafernes,</hi> who was inviron'd
by <hi>Craterus,</hi> and such a great croud of congratulating Friends and
Servants, that I was unable to obtain a particular Entertainment
with him. The best Lodgings in my Appartment, I had resigned to
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Stranger, of whom I then acquainted the Prince; who
therefore enjoyned me to lodg in the next Chamber to his: which I
obeyed until the hour destined to rest was come. <hi>Atafernes</hi> received
the intermissive respects of his Friends and Servants; and when it was
come and they gone, I thought it too rude by my waiting on him, to keep
him longer from it: and therefore withdrew my self into the Chamber
designed me, where most of the Night I had but too much Entertainment.
To make no request to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> was to disobey him: to make any
but that which I had not the presumption to make, was to injure my
self: to beg to know of <hi>Statira</hi> what I should ask, was if she vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
me any answer, certainly to receive one I wished not for; and which
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:96335:355"/>
yet I must not disobey. To speak any thing to <hi>Ataphernes</hi> after what
he had spoken to me, was to doubt he intended not what he profer'd
and promised; especially too, when what he mentioned was the only
thing I could desire, and his mentioning it freed me from the guilt of
having solicited him to so unjust an Action: and left me no other Crime,
but not having declined what I acknowledg my self too too unworthy
of. After having turned my affairs into all the postures my Reason or
Fancy suggested to me, I determined it was best to wait the result of the
Prince his undertaking: And if nothing could be acted by him before
the time limited by the King for me to make my request in, then by a strict
silence to evidence my request was of a Quality not to be spoken: and
thus by not speaking, manifest what only I could speak for.</p>
               <p>The succeeding day I paid my duty to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who used me at a
Rate, which might have assured me he would deny me nothing, but that
alone which I feared to ask; And yet when I was going away, as if he
had read my apprehensions to suppress them, he told me: <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
you have now but a little time left to acquaint me with your desire,
which again I protest before all the gods, I will grant whatever it be.
Nothing could have been more welcome than that repeated Oath, unless
to have had it reiterated. After I had made my Request, or rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Prince <hi>Ataphernes</hi> had made it for me, from the King's Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I returned to my own; where I learn'd <hi>Monyma,</hi> and the fair
<hi>Mithridatia</hi> had sent two of their Gentlemen to visit me, and know
how I did. All that afternoon <hi>Ataphernes</hi> was visited by <hi>Statira</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra;</hi> for <hi>Roxana</hi> stir'd no more out of her Lodgings: and towards
the Evening <hi>Monyma</hi> came thither. I do not acquaint you with the
particulars of their discourses; for as soon as I found they consisted
chiefly of those Obligations they all had to me, and of the Frights and
Dangers they had been in, I gave my self wholly up to contemplate
my Princess: in whom appeared a sadness so visible, that some of the
Company took notice of it; and then of mine, as a consequence of it.
<hi>Statira</hi> to take them off from that consideration, desired me to give the
Queen some news of the Aegyptian-Gentleman; to whom I gave in brief
an account of his Gallantry in the Battel: and how fainting in his being
removed to my Galley, in the absence of his own Servant, <hi>Tomsones</hi>
having cast Water in his Face, and rub'd his Temples and his Nostrils
with Vinegar, the seeming blackness of his Skin had vanished; and he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a meen, that even in the paleness of Death appeared lovely,
and therefore could not be but charming in a perfect Health. And
though I had done what Civilly I might, to learn from his Servant his
Quality, and the Reason of Disguisement; yet could I not make any
discovery of either, he having been tied to a strict secresie: But he gave
me hopes, as soon as his Master was in a condition to do it, I might be
satisfied in those desires from himself. All that generous Company after
this short Relation, did express no small Concernment to know who this
stranger was; which made me promise them, That the next day (which
my Chirurgeons had assured me, would be the soonest that he could be
able without danger to discourse) I would endeavour to learn of him
that which every one of them seemed so intently curious to know. I
was not long after called away from <hi>At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phernes</hi> by <hi>Craterus,</hi> to whom
the King had left the care of drawing to the Sea-side so much of the
Prince's Army, as was esteemed convenient to be landed in the Island
of <hi>Scyros,</hi> to reduce it, and suppress the King in it; <hi>Ataphernes</hi>'s own
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:96335:355"/>
wounds denying him the strength to undertake that expedition, I
found by the Generous <hi>Craterus</hi>'s diligence, that by the Evening of that
day, in which I was to make my Request, all would be in a readiness to
set to Sea. At my return to the Prince's Chamber, I found none in it
with him, but the fair <hi>Statira;</hi> and they were so taken up in what they
were discoursing of, That though I presented my self before them, yet
neither of them took any notice of me: which made me retire into my
own Chamber, imagining what was the occasion of their entertainment.
I had not been long there, but the Aegyptian-Strangers Servant came in
to me from his Lord, to tell me, That being now in some degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
out of his fainting weakness, he beg'd me to oblige him with
my company for a few Moments. I obeyed him, and was no sooner come
to his Bed-side, than he told me, I have learnt, generous <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
from <hi>Photinus,</hi> all that you have done for me; how, That by your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
I live, and by your Civility I am now in this place; I owe you
so much, That not to acknowledg to you my Obligations, and the sense
I have of them, would have more endangered me, than the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
tell me I may endanger my self, by so much, and so soon speaking.
Generous Stranger, I reply'd, the Valour you manifested in that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Quarrel in which we bore Arms together, and those fatal, yet noble
Marks you carry about you, of having so prodigally acted in it, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me to those Services which are so much my debt to you, that they
merit not your Acknowledgments to me; Especially such, as while you
give them, you prejudice the giver of them. I conjure you therefore,
not to hazard a Life by an excess of Civility, which by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
seen of it, is too precious to let it be endangered on any Account,
especially on mine. Though I know few things, the other reply'd,
which I more Ambition, than to assure you of my acknowledgments,
unless it be the Acting of them; yet I should not, to have told you so
much, been guilty of the confidence of inviting you to this place to have
done it; but that <hi>Photinus</hi> having told me how desirous you were to
know who I am, I have beg'd the honour of your Company, only to
pay you that Obedience which his duty to me hindered him from; and
thereby to convince you, by satisfying you in what is within my power,
I would do it in all things, were my ability proportionate to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments.</p>
               <p>I shall, he continued, (having first made me sit down by his Bed-side
in a Chair which <hi>Photinus</hi> brought me) trust you with a secret, which is
such to all the World, but to these in this Chamber; and which I will
not beg you, may be continued such, because you will find how requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
it is, and that will exempt me from the need of making such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
My true Name is <hi>Auletes,</hi> my disguised is <hi>Achillas.</hi> I am by birth
Prince of <hi>Egypt. Ptolomy</hi> my Father, who possesses that Kingdom, found
from my infancy something in my humour or meen, that made his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affection receive so large an Accession, that possibly never Parent
loved a Son more than he did me. All that Education could confer,
'tis my own fault if I received it not; and finding my Proficiency in what
was taught me, was as much his contentment as mine; it doubled my
Inclination, and my Endeavours: but as soon as I was capable to endure
Travelling, I had a longing to form my self by the choice of my own
Judgment, having first seen and experimented whatever was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in <hi>Asia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> This intention I communicated to
my Father, but his fondness of me, made me receive a Denial, clouding
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:96335:356"/>
what disgusted him, with an assurance that it would disgust all <hi>Egypt;</hi>
who having no Prince but I to succeed, he would not expose me to the
hazard of Travelling in remote Countreys. I would not disobey a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom by Nature and Friendship I was so bound; and though
I paid him an actual observance, yet I could not hide my sorrow for his
Denial: the visibility thereof, though it could not produce what only
could end it, yet it made <hi>Ptolomy</hi> seek out all those Divertisements for
me, which he thought might mitigate it. <hi>Alexandria</hi> was therefore fill'd
with all things which might invite me to esteem it a more agreeable resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
than any else I could elect; amongst other things, the greatest
Gallery in the Palace was furnished on one side with the Pictures and
Stories of all the great Men and Women of our Family, from <hi>Lagus</hi> to
my Father: and on the other side, with the Pictures of all the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
persons of either Sex in that Age in which we live: And because
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> found that in this Room and Furniture I took most satisfaction:
he built another Gallery, which he intended to imbellish with the like
Ornaments; and therefore imployed skilful Painters into the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
parts of the World to Act this Design: who performed so well what
they were imployed about, that when those sent into <hi>Asia</hi> were returned,
they boasted the Furniture of the new Gallery, would much transcend
that of the old: But above all the rest, The Artist which had been at
<hi>Heraclea</hi>
publickly avowed, that the piece he had drawn of the Princess
<hi>Statira,</hi> had nothing comparable to it but the Original. It happened at
the same time the Prince <hi>Ascanius</hi> was then in his Travels visiting <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>'s
Court; for his Father had permitted that to him, which mine had
denied me. He exprest a curiosity of seeing what was so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
I waited on him to satisfie it; and having considered with
much intentness all those pieces which adorned one side of the Room:
at the last the Picture he was so impatient to look upon, was showed
him. I never saw any surprize like unto his, even at the very first sight
of it; and after he had a while contemplated it in silence, he broke it
off to ask him that drew it, Whether <hi>Statira</hi> owed nothing to his Pencil?
Yes, Sir, the Painter reply'd, She owes a Pardon to it for having done so
little, where I should have done so much; for I could never get any
opportunity to draw it, but when the Princess was at her Devotions:
and then too, but by stealths and in imperfect lights. I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
He continued, that till I saw her, I believed I could produce a
greater Beauty than Nature; for by my Skill I could make a Collection
of all the exactest parts of every Woman, and draw them in one: so
that Nature, whose productions are subjected to a Thousand casualties;
and who cannot repair the least if it happen, which is an infelicity the
Pencil is not confined unto; I did esteem my belief was rational: But
when I saw the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and began to draw her, I found expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
she had an Air, a Vivacity, and such a Harmony springing
from the result of all her Motions and Graces, that I owned my self a
Convert, and must own her above the faint representations of Art. And
therefore I have endeavoured by my Words, to draw her better than I
have done by my Pencil.</p>
               <p>All the while this Artist was thus speaking, methought I saw <hi>Ascanius</hi>
receive Love by two senses at once; and indeed he was so wholly taken
up with what he had heard and seen, That I think he had not stir'd out
of the Place all that day, had not he been summoned thence to a Ball,
which only waited his coming to be begun: And though he danced in
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:96335:356"/>
it, yet it was with a face so full of thoughts, and so little like unto that,
in which in former ones he had assisted, that the effects were not more
visible to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and all the Court, than the cause was to me. Seven
days he continued at this rate, and the eighth a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Lord brought
him the news of his Father's Death, who dyed of an Apoplexy; and
the desires of all his Subjects by his presence to repair that loss, and fill
the Throne. This sad and hasty Summons, accelerated his return to his
Kingdom; from whence he sent Ambassadors to obtain <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s
permission of making his addresses to that admirable Princess. His go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither after he had obtained that leave he so passionately ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
his losing his Brother in a Naval battel against the King of <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi>
and on the day of his intended Nuptials, losing another within the
prospect of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and his liberty also; the Princess being carried
away by the Treachery of some of the Inhabitants, and his Exchange
for the King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> are better known to you than to me. I have
therefore only to add, That he being engaged by three the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Motives to repair his Misfortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Those of <hi>Love, Glory,</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi>
he left no means unattempted to assemble a Fleet powerful enough to
act his desires; and because the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were pre-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the service of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> though in the same War; yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting
as much to end the War by his own Forces, as to have it ended,
he came himself to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to desire his permission to form a Fleet of
his Subjects, which more through my perswasion than his own, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
leave to do. The growing-greatness of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Government of the World, which they aspired unto, making it
the Interest of all Princes to oppose them that had not resolved to submit
unto them. I had too a particular Interest of my own, which engaged
me to joyn my request to <hi>Ascanius;</hi> for I desired to command this Fleet
in this Action: But the first motion I made of it to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> I found the
impossibility of its success; intending therefore to do that by stealth,
which I perceived was not otherwise to be acted, I seemed not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the refusal, to take from my Father the jealousie of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As soon as the Fleet was formed, without acquainting any Person
living with it but <hi>Photinus,</hi> no not the Admiral, lest his knowledg of it
might have been penal to him in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s resentments, disguising my
Face with a Colour as black as any Egyptians, I went on Board the
Galley of the Vice-Admiral, who was a particular Friend to <hi>Photinus;</hi>
and who in the first Fury of the Naval-Battel being killed, I assumed
his place: and had no other Honour, but a while to fight Single against
some of the Enemies Galleyes, and to avoid being made a Prisoner by
part of a conquered Fleet. But I owe the avoiding of that unhappiness
to your Civility and Courage, which I can in no way requite, but in
owning it to all the World; and in assuring you, That what I owe unto
you, I will on all occasions imploy and hazard for you: and in acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you that my chief Motive to this Voyage and Disguise, proceeded
from a passion I had assumed at the Noble and high Character which <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius</hi>
when last in Aegypt gave me of the Princess.</p>
               <p>At this very word, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> the Prince of Aegypt's
senses abandon'd him; which made <hi>Photinus</hi> and I hasten to afford him
all the help we could: but finding ours was not proportionable to his
necessity, we called in the Physician and Chirurgeons which were in the
next Room; who having done all that their Art suggested to them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
us to withdraw, and to leave him to that silence, the breaking
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:96335:357"/>
whereof had cast him into that faintness, <hi>Photinus</hi> and I observed a little
before, that his words came more languishingly from him, than when
he began his Narrative: But both of us attributing it to the sense he had
of his being reduced to need my assistance in that Battel, in which he
had promised himself so much Glory, we did neither of us desire him to
forbear prosecuting his Relation, till the swound he fell into, put a period
to it. I was not a little concerned to ask of <hi>Photinus</hi> one word more
than his Prince had spoke; But he protested to me, that was as great a
secret to him, as it was to me. He only knew that as <hi>Ascanius</hi> had fallen
in Love by the sight of a Picture, his Prince had assumed the same passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by a Relation of the King of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> but who the Object of his
Passion was, he was a perfect stranger unto. <hi>Photinus</hi> having accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me to my Appartment, returned to pay his Duty to his Prince, and
left me in no small perplexities; which had he spoke one word more,
might have been increased or supprest. I was not without my Fears,
that the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Beauty had ingaged him in this Voyage; for
since the Description which had kindled his flame, had been made by
<hi>Ascanius,</hi> 'twas but too likely he would most exalt that Perfection which
in captivating him, had evinced it self to be the greatest, as well in Truth,
as in his Estimation. Neither could I believe that the fear of speaking
the Truth to <hi>Auletes,</hi> might have any Operation on the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>
in raising him so dangerous a Rival; since he had already engaged <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
and secured his raptures to a degree above the apprehension
of Danger. I was too the more confirmed in that belief, by reason that
<hi>Auletes</hi> kept himself disguised to <hi>Ascanius</hi> as well as any other; which
sure he had not much cause to do, if his Aims had not been such, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
him to such a proceeding: for if his Love was paid to any else,
he might expect from the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>'s assistance, a powerful help;
which by his not discovering himself to him, he was certainly to fail of.
This consideration left me abundant cause to believe my apprehensions
were but too rational; and therefore in <hi>Auletes</hi>'s Person and Quality I
found cause to think <hi>Ascanius</hi> had raised me as powerful a Rival as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and I remained only with this consolation, That by <hi>Ataphernes</hi>'s
favour I should know my Fate, before the Prince <hi>Auletes</hi> could be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
to the felicity of it. With these thoughts I went to wait upon my
Prince, who though I had left in his Bed; yet I found him not in his
Chamber. Some of those Gentlemen that waited on him in it, telling
me he was gone to <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Apartment in no small pain, I fear'd I
was the cause of this trouble; for the time of making my request was to
end the next day: and he had undertaken my Destiny. I learned also,
That all that time I had spent with the Prince of Aegypt, He had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in private the Princess <hi>Statira.</hi> I resolved therefore in his Chamber to
expect his return, which I did in impatiencies and fears that were almost
equal. I never had been in such troubles. When I was ignorant to what
the gods had reserved me to, and when I thought they had alotted for
me the deepest Affliction, as now I was in, when I was positively to learn
what I was designed unto; My entertainments on this subject were so
confused and irrational, that I will not trouble you with a repetition of
them: neither did they cease, till the Gentleman came from <hi>Mithridates</hi>
to call me to him.</p>
               <p>I found the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> in his Bed, and the Prince <hi>Ataphernes</hi> sitting
by him; as soon as I came in, the King commanded every one besides to
withdraw: then calling me to him, he told me; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you may
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:96335:357"/>
conclude it was an important Affair which made me send to my Son to
come to me, considering the indisposition he is under; and to let you see
I will have nothing in reserve for you, I will now communicate to you
what I have imparted to him: for owing all that I have to you, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
nothing from you. There is at this hour in this Palace, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
disguised, who have brought me strange news, and presented to me
glorious offers, they are all three <hi>Romans:</hi> The first is <hi>Martius Variu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lieutenant-General to the Great <hi>Sertorius;</hi> the other two are <hi>Lucius
Mannius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Fannius,</hi> Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Cabbinet-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
to <hi>Sertorius.</hi> They assure me, the gods by an immediate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their own, have taken out of this World my only dreaded Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<hi>Cornelius Sylla;</hi> which has filled not only <hi>Rome,</hi> but even all the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire with such high confusions, as every one is now striving
to diminish that entire greatness which so lately every one endeavoured
to augment. <hi>Sertorius</hi> has already appropriated to himself all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and raised so powerful an Army there, and of his other
Confederates; as even at that distance, the Capitol does tremble. He
has got together so many of the Senatorian Order, that he has already
constituted a <hi>Roman</hi> Senate in <hi>Spain;</hi> and disowns any Senate but that:
so that he has not alone the power, but the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> People.
He intends immediately to carry his Ensigns to <hi>Rome</hi> it self; and wants
not Friends and Confederates there, nor at the East and Western-feet
of the <hi>Alps:</hi> so that he is not only confident of an uninterrupted passage
thither, but of Success and Victory when he comes there. Yet to expose
his attempts to as little incertitude as actions of War can admit, He has
sent to invite my assistance; assuring me, that if my Forces from the East,
and his from the West, do unite in one common Design, the success can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more great than it will be certain: But then we must move at once.
He offers me for my Part, and to confirm it by a Decree of the Senate,
That I shall for ever without acknowledging any thing to <hi>Rome,</hi> possess
<hi>Asia</hi> so properly called, <hi>Bithynia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Comagena,
Pamphilia, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia.</hi> He desires to oblige me to this, That if
he needs my Armies, or Navies, I must afford him their help under his
Pay; and offers me if I need his, he will afford me them under my Pay.
These Proposals I did but this morning receive, and have accepted of
them; only I have insisted upon this Addition of having into my Portion
the Republick Cities and Countries of <hi>Greece,</hi> that <hi>Asia</hi> may have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sea and Bulwork between <hi>Italy</hi> and it. This they have not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to grant; But rather than not conclude the League, they have
assured me of their utmost endeavours to have it granted by <hi>Sertorius</hi>
and the Senate with him; or something else contented: and this Night I
am to sign that Agreement which is to make <hi>Sertorius</hi> Lord of the
West of the World, and me of the East. We must therefore divert to a
Nobler End all our Preparatives for the reduction of <hi>Scyros,</hi> which will
be as a consequence of our other successes; and if attempted now, would
probably hinder us in one Moon, from greater advantages than it can
ever present us. I have therefore designed out of <hi>Ataphernes</hi> and <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>
Armies, to compose two others which I will strengthen with great
recruits, that shall meet them on their March; and a small Army drawn
out of both, shall under <hi>Craterus</hi> attend my Person, and secure <hi>Pithynia,</hi>
which I find is so ready to revolt. To <hi>Ataphernes</hi> I have designed the
conquest of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> and <hi>Phrygia;</hi> to <hi>Callimachus</hi> I have designed the
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:96335:358"/>
Conquest of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia:</hi> And because I will not always be
obliged by him, and never oblige him, I now require him to make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
unto me, which I again vow before all the gods I will grant him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> at the end of these Words, paused a while; and having
then twice commanded me to speak; and I as often looked upon <hi>Atafer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
but not answering; the <hi>Pontick</hi> King thus continued: Since <hi>Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
you will not make me a desire, I will make you an offer. Your
Friend here has acquainted me with that great and respectful passion
which you have for <hi>Statira;</hi> your not making her your request, tyes me
to make her my grant. I do therefore not only give you my permission
to solicite her affection; but I will also injoyn her to give it you: and if
I mistake not, she has obeyed some Commands of mine with more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
than she will do this.</p>
               <p>Judg, Generous Princes, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> Judg, if ever any
Astonishment could equal mine; if ever any Raptures of Joy could come
near those I then resented. I cast my self on my Knees by <hi>Mithridates</hi> his
Bed; and having kissed his Hand with transports, I told him; I confess
Great King, I confess, That the first hour I saw the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> I ador'd
her: but it was with an adoration like unto that we pay the gods, who
while we yield them all our Services, we expect no return, or reward,
but their acceptance. I found the impossibility of expecting more, could
not transcend the injustice of desiring more; and having placed such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Limits to my Flame, I thought it not unworthy of her; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
continued the duty of it: But this you have now condescended to
mention, is so infinitely below her, and above me, That to make any
other use thereof, than to admire your goodness, were almost as highly
to injure it, as her. No, Sir, my Passion and Ambition have not so much
blinded my Duty and my Reason, as to accept of exalting my own Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
on so criminal a Foundation as the making of you unjust, and her
unhappy. If your intention be to confine me eternally to your Service,
the Offer more than the Acceptance will do it; for in that, I have already
received too vast a reward, both for what I have, and for all that I can
do: But in this, I should be as guilty as happy; and the way would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the end. I have by your mercy a double Glory, That of the
Offer of the Princess, and that of having in duty adjudged my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to accept it. I can now convince Her, as well as the World and
my self, That my adoration was as perfect, as it was great; and being free
from those common and mean ends which other passions are animated
with, I may in the future with the more satisfaction pay her mine: and
she with the less reluctancy receive them. Rise <hi>Callimachus,</hi> rise, reply'd
<hi>Mithridates;</hi> whilst you thus plead against what I offer, you but the
more entitle your self to it. Besides I hope, you will allow that no man is
a fit Judg in his own case; and that a Father has the best right to dispose
of his Daughrer. These being granted, as they can hardly be well deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I command you to dispute no more against what I have as rationally,
as resolutely fixed upon; and because that either Nature, or the Ignorance
of your condition has denied you a Crown, and that I never designed
my Daughter to less, I give you an Army to Conquer <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia:</hi>
and I give those Kingdoms to you and your Heirs for ever, to
hold of the Crown of <hi>Pontus;</hi> and wanting of Heirs, to revert unto my
Successors again. But because <hi>Statira</hi> was so near being <hi>Ascanius</hi> his
Wife, That meer decency will require she should for some time decline
actually marrying another; and that I would not by a delay make any
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:96335:358"/>
suspect my intentions to you, are no as clear and sincere as my Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
to answer these two ends, I declare, That the twentieth Day after
this, you shall solemnly be contracted before me to <hi>Statira;</hi> and as soon
as by your Sword you have made your self Lord of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia,</hi>
and thereby prepared a Throne for her to sit in, you shall as
publickly marry her: and govern there as a King, with the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have mentioned. Ah! Sir, I reply'd, since you Command me
to dispute no more, I will obey you; and in that Obedience I hope
you will be convinced of mine in all things else: for doubtless never
man had at once so much Reason to be ravish'd with Joys, and so
little Title to them. For to be the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Servant by
your Commands, and consequently by her permission, is a Glory above
the Empire of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia;</hi> nay, of the whole World:
But by what you have done, you have so transcended all that I can
express, that I must not only be obliged to you for my happiness, but
also for believing my sense of it is at once as great as it can be, and yet
less than it should be. Alas! Mighty Prince, Why do you confer Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
on me which have no Limits? and command me services which
have such narrow ones? I am but to conquer <hi>Galatia,</hi> and I am to be
the happy Servant of the Princess: rather Sir, Command me to carry
your Ensigns to the Capitol; and cast that proud Senate as low by your
Arms, as they have exalted themselves by their own. Command me
to make her Empire as large as her Title is to Empire; and then you
shall see I will present her with that of the Universe, or perish in the
duty of attempting it: and thereby gain what she is worthy of, or lose
him that is unworthy of her. I do not, reply'd <hi>Mithridates,</hi> end your
Victories in the conquest of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> I do but begin them
there; <hi>Comagena</hi> is the next Country to which you shall carry your
Conquest. And possibly by then, new Objects may be presented to
your Volour; and the occasions of Glory will proportionate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of it. Retire your self now, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and leave <hi>Atafernes</hi>
with me; for <hi>Statira</hi> by my appointment is coming hither, that I may
signifie to her, what I have acquainted you with. This Command I
obeyed; but before I did so, I again cast my self on my knees by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>'s
bed-side, and kiss'd his hands with such transports, that he told
the Prince when I was gone, In those Actions he read my resentments as
visibly, as in all my other expressions.</p>
               <p>I was not many steps out of the King's Chamber, when I met the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Statira</hi> going thither; who asked of me, Whether I then came
from thence? I told her I did. She enquired then of me, Whether
<hi>Atafernes,</hi> was there? I told her he was. She then demanded, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I knew what the occasion could be which made her Father send for
her Brother in the unfit condition he was in to stir out of his Bed; much
more out of his Chamber? and whether I knew what She was sent for
about? Yes, Madam, I reply'd, with a deep sigh twice repeated, I can
answer all your Demands; but 'twill be less unfit you should receive an
account of all those Questions from the King, than from me. But yet,
Madam, to obey you as much as I can, I will presume to tell you, That
you are now sent for, to be either the most disobedient, or the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
person living; and I have endeavoured to prevent your being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
though you are too likely only to find thereby, that your being
made so, is rather an effect of my Obedience than Solicitation. By
this time we were come to <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Chamber-door, where
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:96335:359"/>
                  <hi>Statira</hi> saluting me, with no little trouble in her Countenance, went in,
and left me to pursue my first intention of going to <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there to wait the result of her attendance on the King.</p>
               <p>I had not above half an hour entertained my self with the Felicities of
my then Condition, but the Prince was brought back to his Chamber:
and immediately being put to Bed, he commanded all his Servants to
leave him and I alone.</p>
               <p>The Room was no sooner emptied, than I cast my self on my knees by
his Bed-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide; and there in innumerable Actions and Words, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to assure him of those Resentments which were above Demonstration.
He had the goodness to embrace me, and to assure me, though he had
done all he could, yet he had done too little in proportion to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he had for me. He then was pleased to acquaint me, how <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
had disclosed his pleasure concerning me to the Princess; how he
had particularized all those Services I had done for him, and had paid
to her; how Miraculously her intended Nuptials had been broken off;
and how when <hi>Ascanius</hi> was released, she was a Prisoner; and when she
was released, he was defeated and kill'd: All which seem'd to evidence
the gods were not more concerned in interrupting that Marriage, than
in my Services, they seem'd to design me alone to that Glory. That
he neither would nor could oppose what was so declaredly their Wills,
and therefore whatever my extraction was, my Actions and his Bounty
had made me worthy of, and should make me possessor of a Crown; and
consequently not unfit for her Acceptance, or his Alliance. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did not only desire her to receive me as her intended Husband,
but he enjoined her to do it; and that the more positively, because she
was not ignorant who I was, and that my preceding Services had given
me no small Title to the subsequent Honour he designed me to. I tell
you in brief, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> Generous Princes, what the oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Atafernes</hi> told me at large; But when he began to relate the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
Answer; The confidence I had in her exact obedience to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in her unequalled affection to her Brother, and in that glorious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
when she was to marry <hi>Ascanius,</hi> which she gave me in these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-to-be
forgotten Words, <hi>I attest the gods, had they made me the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributer
of their Rewards, I would place</hi> Callimachus <hi>in whatever he
ambitions, and that without any Reservation;</hi> could not secure me from
a Fear which invaded me with Confusions; and those in such excess,
That the Prince taking notice of them, interrupted his Relation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of me whether I were ill? I told him I was, and till I knew what
the Authoress of my Fate had decreed of it, I should be in Horrors, whose visible Effects were the least uneasie part of them. I will then, reply'd,
<hi>Atafernes,</hi> hasten to free you from sufferings in which I sympathize, by
telling you, that after <hi>Mithridates</hi> had done speaking, <hi>Statira</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
silent for some time; which made him say, I will not so much doubt
your Obedience, as to think I need a verbal Assurance of it. I know
you pay me an exact Affection and Duty; and I have enjoined you by
both those to observe what I have signified to you.</p>
               <p>Within twenty days my Army designed for the Conquest of <hi>Galatia</hi>
and <hi>Pamphilia</hi> will be moving, and before <hi>Callimachus</hi> is at the head
of it, I have resolved to contract you to him; and when he has subdued
that Kingdom, to place you and him in the Throne thereof; <hi>Mithridates</hi>
having done speaking, turned himself to me, and told me; <hi>Atafernes,</hi>
I doubt I have too long detained you from your rest; to which now you
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:96335:359"/>
may retire; I leave it to your care to perfect with your Sister, what I
have so far advanced for your Friend: I did therefore cause my self to
be carried hither, and desired <hi>Statira</hi> forthwith to follow me, which she
assured me she would: I believe she will be immediately here, therefore
I would have you withdraw into the next Room, and as soon as I call
you, to come hither again; for I am determined before I rest, to make my
Sister give you such assurances as shall leave you no grounds to doubt
of her Obedience to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> her Friendship to me, and her esteem
of, if not affection for you. I was going again by new Evincements of
gratitude to shew him some sense of my Resentments, when I heard the
Princess coming: I did therefore hastily retire into my generous Friend's
Closet which was contiguous to his Chamber, and had no sooner shut
the Door, than <hi>Mithridatia</hi> came to her Brother's Bed-side; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all out of the Chamber, and to let none come in till he Called.
The Closet was so near the Bed, That I heard <hi>Atafernes</hi> thus discourse to
his Sister.</p>

               <p>YOU have now, dear <hi>Statira,</hi> received a Command from
<hi>Mithridates</hi> to permit <hi>Callimachus</hi> his Addresses, and I
have received a Command from the King to see that finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which he has begun: though the distemper of my Body
needs sleep, yet the satisfaction of my mind does more
need the placing of my Friend in a Condition above the Reverse of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
I am uncapable of my Rest, till you have established his, by such
assurances as you may convince him you are not insensible of your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to your Father, of your Friendship to your Brother, and all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to you and your Family. I confess Brother (the Princess reply'd)
in the whole course of my life I never was more surprised, than at the
command my Father laid upon me; it was the least of my Expectations:
not that I think any thing in his Power, was too great a Reward for
what he owed <hi>Callimachus,</hi> but that he could think I was a sufficient one.
And that with one of the unworthiest of his Family, he could design to
pay the Debts of all of it. I shall also confess I am not a little troubled
at the Injunction, not that I do not prefer your Friend above any Man,
but that I prefer a single life before any other: both as it is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to my Nature, and that by it I may be still in a condition to
live near <hi>Atafernes,</hi> in whose Company and Friendship I have establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my highest Satisfaction. I can (reply'd <hi>Atafernes</hi>) make you the
like assurance; for 'tis in your Friendship and Company I take most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and therefore in order to that end, I am the more concerned in the
Success of what I now solicite. You know <hi>Pharnaces is to succeed in
all Mithridates</hi>'s Kingdoms, and you know how little I am to expect
from his Friendship when he comes to the Power; your being setled in
<hi>Galatia</hi> will be a safe and happy Retreat for me. And with you and
<hi>Callimachus</hi> I can enjoy a contentment preferable to all my Father's
Empires; 'tis therefore that by thus disposing of your self, you are most
likely to continue in the condition you desire, and I ambition. I know
you will obey the King; I know you will not deny my Happiness. But
'tis not enough I know it, unless I do so by your assurance of it to me,
and to my Friend. Before I will obey any of your Commands (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:96335:360"/>
                  <hi>Statira</hi>) I must beg the knowledg of one particular, and in that I
must not be denied; 'tis to tell me, by what inducement <hi>Mithridates</hi>
was led to what he has now enjoined me: for I cannot imagine how
he could know that <hi>Callimachus</hi> had an esteem for me more than for any
other; and as little believe, unless he thought so, how he could fancy
me, the Recompence he intended him? And I can as uneasily believe,
that <hi>Callimachus</hi> would make me his Request, without having ever
sounded my Inclinations therein, either by himself or by you. Though
I am certain (<hi>Atafernes</hi> answer'd) That all the desires of Mankind uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
cannot transcend the passion which he desires to serve you; yet I'le
assure you, he was so far from making you his Request, that when the
King made you his Offer, he did so generously acknowledg his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of you, and so civilly tax the King's Justice in that Offer; that
had you heard what he said, and seen what he did, you could no more
have declined admiring his Respect, than without Injustice you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
rewarding it. But to obey your Commands I will ingenuously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that when <hi>Mithridates</hi> had acquainted me with his new League
with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and with his intent, to employ <hi>Callimachus</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> he commanded me to Acquaint him if
I knew what he intended to ask: I protested to him I was intirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
thereof; and that I was more perswaded he would ask nothing, than
any thing. The King then commanded me to tell him, what I thought
would be most grateful to him, and whether I had any apprehensions
consonant to the Queens, of his having a passion for you; I told him, if
he was capable of any, for any, possibly it might be for you. <hi>Mithridates</hi>
having a while consider'd, told me, That he intended him the greatest
Gift, and he considered you to be That; and because you should not be
married to any but a King, he would with you give <hi>Callimachus</hi> an Army
to present you a Crown. This was so suited to my Intentions, that I did
all I could to confirm the King in his, and prevailed with him to send
forthwith for <hi>Callimachus:</hi> whom he enjoyned three times to make his
Request, and he as often by an unconquerable silence declining it; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
then made him his greatest Offer, and was necessitated to make
use of his Command to make him keep that Silence after his Proposal:
which three reiterations of it, could not make him break before; having
thus satisfied your desire, I not only hope but expect you will satisfie
mine, which is exacted from you by Duty, Friendship and Gratitude; and
which you cannot either deny or delay, without giving me as much
trouble, as by granting it you will give <hi>Callimachus</hi> and me raptures of
Satisfaction. You are so importunate (the Princess reply'd) that I know
not what particularly to say to you; and therefore I will in General pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be ruled by you. Ah <hi>Statira,</hi> (the Prince answer'd) embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her, You have now given me a greater and more welcom Evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your kindness, than you can ever repeat.</p>
               <p>I heard, Generous Princes, I heard distinctly this Ravishing Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and soon after <hi>Atafernes</hi> called me out of his Closet; from whence
I came with such Extasies, as nothing could transcend them, but their
Cause. And being come to the Prince's Bed-side, He told me, I did
acquaint you <hi>Callimachus,</hi> with <hi>Mithridates</hi> Commands to <hi>Statira,</hi> and
with my passionate Desires to her in your Favour; and now I can tell
you, you need no more doubt your Felicity, than my Friendship; for she
has promised to be Ruled by me in this greatest Concernment of hers and
yours. Sir, I reply'd; The Princess <hi>Statira</hi> esteems it some Mercy, that I
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:96335:361"/>
should not receive my Condemnation from her own Mouth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
has substituted you to pronounce it for her; but since I must receive
the Fatal sentence, I most humbly beg it may be from her self; for my
perfect Obedience to all her Commands, will make me that way embrace
my Destiny with more Resignation, and make you consider it with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
less sorrow when you only see my Misery, and do not by speaking
those words, act what must cause it. Yes Sir, I know I esteem, nay, I
admire that Friendship you have always blest me with; but I know also,
I should be more unworthy of it by my Actions, than I am by the insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy
of my Condition and Services, could I solicite, nay, could I
so much as hope that to be the most obliging to me, you should be the
most injurious to her; and since my cruel Fate has denyed my Actions
the Power to express the lively Sense I have of your goodness, Permit
me to evidence that high Truth by my sufferings, and by my silence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. She has done much in leaving it in your Power to make me
happy above Imagination; and possibly I have not done a little in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
you, and that with earnestness, that you will not abuse that unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Trust; She has too highly rewarded my unavoidable Ambition in
not punishing it, and you will highly reward my passionate desires to
serve you, in granting me a Request which must convince you I would
not be ungrateful; since as a Pregnant evidence thereof, I solicite to be
the miserablest of men, to preserve you from being the unjustest. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> said <hi>Atafernes,</hi> Your memory is very bad, or you
esteem mine so, for you have so often and so signally served, nay, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Mithridates, Statira,</hi> and all the Royal House of <hi>Pontus,</hi> that it is
more necessary you should receive the proof of our gratitude, than that
you should think we need any fresh ones of yours; and if you longer
persist in Pleading at this rate, we must believe you esteem your Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
above Reward, by declining the highest we can present you. Do
not think <hi>Statira</hi> has left the pronouncing of your Destiny to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she would her self avoid ruining you; for I know she loves me too
well to lay such an Imposition on me, and she knows I love you too
well to accept it; No, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> she has Elected this way to satisfie
both our Debts: Mine, by speaking our happiness; and hers, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I shall speak; for she is not ignorant that my Ingagements to you
are too vast to be paid by me alone; and that it will make my Joy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to yours, by ordering her self in such a manner as in one pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
she may satisfie both our Debts. Oh gods, Sir! I cryed out, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him: I had much rather you should condemn me to death, than
condemn me to hear expressions which are more wounding than death
it self. Esteem me not, I beseech you, so ignorant of what my Services
are, and what the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> is, as to fancy I think they are above
all Reward, because I decline the highest; No, Generous Prince, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of that belief ought to be yours, and is mine; I had much rather
be the miserablest of our Sex, than that she should be the like of hers; to
bestow her on any Man, is the greatest Sin; but to believe she can be any
Mans as a Debt; whoever were capable of entertaining such a Crime, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the greatest punishment, as the lowest reward of it: And though
I am as far from believing what you said (pardon me Sir, the fault and
duty of that Expression) as deserving it; Yet to repair your offence
against the Princess, I will revenge it on my self, which is the Duty I
should pay her, and the respect I owe you. Oh miserable <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
I continued! Oh Fatal Services! which has reduced the greatest Beauty
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:96335:361"/>
and Virtue that ever shined, to be disobedient to her Father, and disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
to her Brother, or unjust to her self! Ah Madam, (I proceeded
prostrating my self at her Feet and kissing them); At least be so Just
to this unfortunate person, as to believe the necessities to which you
are undesignedly reduced unto by him, are more wounding to him, than
they can be to you; and oblige your Adorer so far as to be satisfied, that
for all those Services he endeavoured to present you, he ambitioned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but that you should receive them, and that you would pardon
their being so few, and so disproportionate to the person to whom they
were paid, and to the desires and duty of him that paid them: Above this
I swear by your self (too great an Oath to be violated) I covet nothing;
and if your goodness induce you to credit so much, I shall never aspire at
more, but that by a resolute denial of what the great <hi>Mithridates</hi> has
commanded you, and your Generous Brother has implored of you, you
would evidence to them and all the World besides, that you know your
self; and believe me, <hi>Statira,</hi> dear <hi>Statira,</hi> (the obliging <hi>Atafernes</hi> cryed
out) Will you then by your fatal Silence manifest you have no Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for your Fathers Commands, but when they are imposed on you for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Ascanius?</hi> and shall that Friendship you have always vowed to me, and
still blest me with, only fail me, where I most desire and am most concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to receive the effects of it? Alas <hi>Atafernes,</hi> the fair <hi>Mithridatia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
What is it you expect from me? I thought I had at least done
enough in leaving it to you to dispose of me; Yes, yes, said <hi>Atafernes,</hi>
that had been enough in any Man's Case but <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s: But you see
'tis not enough that you permit me to make him happy, you your self
must command him to be so, or else you must resolve to see me as miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as he would make himself in his Respects for you. At these words,
<hi>Statira</hi> at once cast off all those disorders which had been but too visible
in her Looks, in her Words, and in her Actions, and with that Empire
which still I admired, as much as I heard; casting her Eyes upon me, she
said, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you are too cruel in making <hi>Atafernes</hi> to press me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what I have already spoke; But since—Ah! Madam, I cryed out,
Do not call that my Crime which is my Torment. If my Arguings, if my
praying against my self, produced such guilty desires in your Generous
Brother; Be pleas'd to let me only endure the punishment thereof, but do
not impute to me the sin; I would have died, I would have kill'd my self
to have exempted you from those difficulties, your obedience to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
and your affection for <hi>Atafernes</hi> have ingaged you in; when you
denied me that just and only prevention, I held my peace; but then my
Silence pleaded against you, and for me; I then argued and prayed
against my self; but both those produced the like effect: what therefore
does remain, but that now you permit me to embrace that Remedy which
hitherto your Commands, nay, your reiterated Commands, prohibited
me to Act; I am as ready now to present your Vertues, your Beauty and
your Quality, that cure as ever: nay, I am more ready to do it now, than
before, being more convinced now than ever, that the necessity of that
performance is now as great as the Duty; but if your goodness declines
to behold what I now mention, my Respect shall carry me into some
remote Countrey, where on the point of your Enemies Swords I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Fate my Crimes and your sufferings have made you deny me
to receive from mine own hand. <hi>Atafernes</hi> at the conclusion of these
words, overwhelmed with the sorrow they had invaded him with, sunk
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:96335:362"/>
down into his Bed, and his spirits abandoning him, he remained pale and
speechless in his Sister's and my Arms, for we were both run to his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
which proved so effectual, that in a few Moments he opened his
Eyes again, and casting them languishingly on his weeping Sister, he
told her, <hi>Statira,</hi> You imploy your goodness where it is not needed, and
decline it, where 'tis. But all these evincements of your Love to me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you confer yours on my Friend, I shall receive as Manifestations of
your Hate: for to live and to see <hi>Callimachus</hi> miserable, is more cruelty,
than to let me die. Since, reply'd the fair <hi>Statira,</hi> you will have me
speak that, which possibly were enough in me if I obeyed, I will force
my self to an intire observance of your Commands. Then turning her
self to me, she spoke these charming words: <hi>Callimachus;</hi> The Duty I
owe my Father, The Friendship I pay my Brother, The true Sense I have
of those eminent Obligations you have loaded us with, and the more Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Vertues the gods have blest you with, make me give you this Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Assurance before them and him, That I will be as obedient for you,
as lately I should have been against you: And if I have that Empire
over you, which you still assured me I had, shew it in making no reply to
what I have now promis'd you. The gods (continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi>
speaking to his Generous Hearers) only knew the Raptures with which
I celebrated such a Promise and such a Command; the first had made me
still defend my self, if the last had not made that great Duty a greater Sin;
But yet casting my self again at my Princess's Feet, I could not hinder
my self from saying in unfanciable Ttrnsports: The gods, Madam, shall
be my Witnesses, that I never did any thing more with the obedience of
a Subject, than in the accepting that Felility which raises me infinitely
above the Condition of any King; nor had you any way to perswade me
to this happiness, but making me receive it as an effect of my Obedience;
and if ever I perform an Action; Nay, if ever I enterrain a thought, but
what may be Consonant to this high Truth; May my Miseries be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
as my Joys, or which is more, as the Mercy which had placed
me in them.</p>
               <p>Why should I (continued <hi>Callimachus</hi>) speaking to <hi>Artabanus</hi> and
<hi>Artavasdes,</hi> trouble you with particularizing those Transports which are
so far from being describable, that they are not imaginable; Let it sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
you to know, <hi>Atafernes</hi> at that assurance recovered out of his faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and heard his fair Sisters words, with Extasies which nothing but
Mine could transcend: and from that hour the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> used me
at a Rate which evidenced, she was resolved to Act that Happiness she
had then assured me of. <hi>Mithridates</hi> also the next Morning visited <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes,</hi>
and there enquired of, and learned from him the Result of that
blessed Nights Discourse, at which he exprest a satisfaction so sublime;
that I then was confident my Felicities were as far from being reverst, as
of admitting an Accession.</p>
               <p>The next day I attended on <hi>Auletes,</hi> who then told me, what his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
indisposition had interrupted when I last waited on him; He confest
the Beauty which had conquered him was the Princess <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
me neither to disclose his Passion, or his Quality, till by some hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Services, he might find an opportunity to reveal both: and conjur'd
me with all the pressings of a Generous Lover and Prince, to take all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
to prepare the fair <hi>Cleopatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> to entertain his Adorations, when he
should find the Ambitioned season of paying them to her; This I faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:96335:362"/>
assured him of; and as the hopefullest way to that end, I advised
and prevailed with him to permit me to acquaint the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> and
the Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> who he was, and what he aspired unto; for I knew
the lovely <hi>Cleopatra</hi> guided all her Actions by their Advices: and if they
could be engaged for him, his happiness would be half perfected. I
found <hi>Auletes</hi> so Worthy a Person, and I had found in my self how vast the
miseries are of a Lover in suspence, and his Joys when certain, as in all
those Knowledges I esteemed my self the more engaged to serve him;
and did discover his Secret to the admirable Sister and Brother, so much
to his advantage, that all things concurred, in the Prince of <hi>Egypt:</hi>
which could make <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Happiness. They assured me, that to
Act it should be their endeavours, and they hoped should also be
their Success. <hi>Auletes</hi> a few days after received a private Visit from
<hi>Ata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ernes,</hi> and such assurances both of his Esteem of him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to oblige him in his Addresses to his Sister, that those Promises
made him recover faster than all the Art of his Physicians, and made
him ever as much a Friend to the Brother, as he was a Lover to the
Sister.</p>
               <p>Whilst I was thus contributing to the Happiness of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prince,
the Glorious Day of my own advanced, and by that time the Army was
raised, with which I was to conquer <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia:</hi> The Eve of
it was come; but the nearer I came to my Felicity, the greater inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I made into it, and consonantly I judged my self more unworthy of it;
I past much of the Evening which preceded that Memorable Day, in the
fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s Appartment, where by <hi>Atafernes</hi>'s Conjurations, and her
unlimited Goodness, I received such new Evincements of her Esteem,
that I knew not which was greater, my Joy that I received them, or my
Grief that I neither did, nor could so much as rationally hope ever to
deserve them: and though many admirable particularities were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in those few Moments, yet I will not retail them, reserving the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of your attentions for those Prodigious Events, which a few hours
after were by the gods destined to follow.</p>
               <p>The Morning at last came, in which by Sacred Contract I was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
assurances of a Blessing, my Enemies could not think me more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of, than I thought my self; That Justice against my self was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to preserve me from Death by an excess of Joy, as the Princess <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>'s
Promises and Commands had been to preserve me from it by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Extream. But that Day no sooner dawn'd, than I rose to Celebrate
an Engagement, which was to give me more pregnant Invitations to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
the Conquest of <hi>Galatia,</hi> than the wearing the Crown of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Glory of that Victory could present me. Never did War
provoke the aspiring to success, with a Recompence proportionate to
Mine: neither could I have been more certain of Victory, after I had
Acted it, than I was before I began to court it; I considered whilst I was
dressing my self, that the Sacred Promises the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> was that day
to give me after my subduing of <hi>Galatia,</hi> as a certain evidence of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
of it; And methought no Obstacles which could oppose that
end, but would be rather Foils than Impediments to my Glory: nay, the
suspension of my Joys, till I presented her with a Crown, did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
them; for I thought it but just I should pay my Debts before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
my Reward; and if any thing in that happy Morning clouded my
Raptures, 'twas only that I was designed to do so little, and to receive
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:96335:363"/>
so much. Had I been destined to present her with the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi>
instead of that of <hi>Galatia,</hi> I should more joyfully have attempted that,
than this; and the length of the trouble would have been abundantly
repaired by the Glory of the attempt, and the proportionateness of the
Present, if I succeeded; and with the Honour and Justice of the attempt,
if I succeeded not. Whilst I was entertaining my self with these pleasing
Imaginations, they were interrupted by the visit of the Generous <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>
who had so much joy in his looks, that had I never received
any other evidence of the height and reality of his Friendship, I might
even in those only have read the certainty of both; A thousand times
he embraced me, and seemed as happy in having made me so, as I was
in being so. I paid him all the humble Acknowledgments I was capable
of, and I believe he easily saw I was troubled I could present him with
no more. But I beg'd him, that the same goodness which had valued me
above my Services, would also accept of my desires, as my performances.
To cut off such expressions (as he told me), he led me soon after to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
Appartment, at the door of which he met him, and all the
considerable Persons of the Court: Who by the Example of my Princes
Gallantry appeared in all theirs; which so far exceeded what had been
seen at <hi>Ascanius</hi> intended Nuptials, that I flattered my self with a belief,
their satisfaction at my condition transcended theirs for his. The King
of <hi>Pontus</hi> by many reiterated assurances of his Favour, endeavoured
by word to oblige me, as much as he had done by Actions, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
me with the excesses of his Favour, that I hope he read in my
silence a livelier Character of my Resentments, than my words could
have presented him: from thence he led me to the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
who that day having cast off her Mourning for the King of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> seemed to be the goddess of that Island; and had she made the
Fourth of that Number where the happy <hi>Paris</hi> was Judg, she must have
been the First in Beauty by his sentence, or rather the other three durst
not have stood in Competition for it with her. Her Beauty so dazled
all our Eyes, and so blinded Mine, that I was a Thousand times ready to
have violated her last Commands, and again to have beg'd of her to
make me rather the Miserablest, than the Happiest of Men; But the
Generous <hi>Atafernes</hi> observing both in my silence and my looks, the
height of my confusions, and apprehending their effects, told <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
all things were ready for the Celebration of that Solemnity: who
thereupon leading me by the hand to the Princess <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> on whom
I durst not so much as lift up my Eyes; He commanded her to give me
hers, which she did, and which I received, prostrate at her Feet; and
should have done it in a more humble and acknowledging Posture, if
any such had been. The fair <hi>Statira</hi> had the goodness to Command me
to rise; which after three Commands to do it, I obeyed. The <hi>Pontick</hi>
King then led the way to his Domestick-Temple; And by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
immediately after him, I waited on the Princess. <hi>Atafernes</hi> led
the Queen, on whose face only any sadness was visible, which yet she
attributed to an indisposition which had hindred her from Rest all the
preceding Night. The rest of that Noble company followed in Order,
till we came to the holy Place, where at the Altar stood the Priest, who
was to perform the requisite Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> having caused a deep silence to be observed; In an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
speech declared the perfect affection he had for his Admirable
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:96335:363"/>
Daughter, and then in Elogies was pleased to Magnifie those low services
I had paid his Family and Crown, concluding with these words; That
since my Actings had been the highest, he had proportioned thereunto
the Recompence of his Acknowledgments and Bounty; And as well to
pay my past Services, as to encourage my future, he had set this day apart,
to contract his best Daughter to me, whom he then declared he would
give me in marriage, as soon as ever I had with the Army then raised,
conquered <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and by my Valour and Conduct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that for her, which her Merit and Extraction deserved, and the
ignorance of my Birth denied me any other way to present her.</p>
               <p>At the end of these expressions he commanded the Priest to do his
Office; who immediately pronounced those Glorious words which the
Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and I on my knees spoke after him; By which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an assurance before the gods above, and before the greatest As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
in the World, That the highest Beauty in it had condescended to
give her self to me, and that nothing but Death should ever dissolve
that contract: The contemplation of this Felicity made me cast my self
again at <hi>Statira</hi>'s Feet, and there in Actions, rather than in Words, I
acknowledged her Mercy, and my unworthiness of it. In the midst of
my Acknowledgments, we heard many loud and repeated shouts of Joy
in the City, which still seemed to advance nearer to the Palace, and at
last we heard them continued even in the Gates of it; and soon after
we distinctly heard in the Court the like Cryes, often intermixt with
them the names <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Ascanius,</hi> which drew many out of the
Temple to learn their Cause, which immediately after was made evident,
even in the Temple it self, by <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Ascanius</hi> entring into it. The
first running to salute <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and the last with the like haste cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself before the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> and embracing her knees in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nothing in degrees could transcend but her wonder and Mine at
that Miracle: His weakness, or his joy was so great, That in that Action
only, for some time, he evidenced his transports; But as soon as he could
break his silence, he did it in these words. You see, Madam, at your
Feet, he that lately lost his life in the Honour of your Service, and he
that would not admit of a second life, but to imploy and end it in the
like glorious Duty. My supposed Death in designing the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s
Deliverance, manifests what I would have done to have Acted it; and it
was more painful to me, than those Wounds which gave me a seeming
Death, that what was my intention, was not my performance. I knew
to dye for you, was fitter for me, than that Felicity your Mercy had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
me unto: I submitted to the first, as more just than the last; and
being unworthy of the highest happiness, I repined not that I underwent
the highest Duty. But those powers which know he is least unworthy
of you, which does most perfectly adore you, have raised me to life,
that by your Mercy and Condescention, the World and <hi>Ascanius</hi> may
know by the Recompence of that Truth, how intirely you believe the
reality of it; my unsuccessfulness in your Deliverance merited my seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death, and my unequal'd Flame merited that Resurrection, without
which your mercy in crowning it, would have been render'd ineffectual;
so that in those several Fates the gods have imposed on <hi>Ascanius,</hi> you may
see, fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> how equally just they are, both to my unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and my Adorations. After these words, the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> told
the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> how whilst some of his Nobility were preparing
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:96335:364"/>
for his Body the requisite Solemnities due to the Monarchs of that Island,
they found some Symptoms of life remaining in it, which they improved
with such Art, Care, Diligence, and Secresie, that in a few Hours their
hopes of his recovery had wiped away their Tears for his imaginary
Death: That the better to cloud the transports of that change, and
the more successfully to enjoy the fruits of their Endeavours and Duty,
they caused the dead Body of a young <hi>Cyprian</hi> Lord to receive all the
Ceremonies due unto his own, and did not communicate the Fallacy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any, but those who could not but know it, who yet they tied by
sacred Oaths to inviolable secresie, even from the rest of the <hi>Cyprians</hi>
themselves; whose tears and sorrows so well deluded the Subjects and
Servants of <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> that they never had the least
umbrage of the Truth; whereby when the thirty dayes of the usual Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rites were efflux'd, the two Kings permitted a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Galley to
transport his supposed Embalmed Corps to <hi>Cyprus.</hi> As soon as the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Galley had recovered the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Fleet, he shewed himself unto
them; their surprize was not greater than his own, when he found in
the same Galley with him the Prince <hi>Pharnaces;</hi> who had also recovered
his liberty by an unexpected Accident: For <hi>Enestes</hi> who was Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> having lost his life, attempting to carry away by
surprize the Royal Family of <hi>Pontus;</hi> Many of the <hi>Bithynian</hi> Nobility
were Solicitors to succeed him in that high imployment; and amongst
those, <hi>Cleomax,</hi> favorite to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> upon that score was most earnest,
and had most hopes; but his King as a reward of the high attempt of
the Father, conferred that Office on <hi>Lixcestes</hi> his Son, who by many
signal Actions of Conduct and Courage, had a double Title to that
Command, to which he added the most powerful one of silence to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<hi>Cleomax,</hi> though sensibly wounded by his failer, suppresses all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
by Words, and resolves to manifest them by Actions; so that
soon after, having got an opportunity of a private Conference with <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi>
offered him to set him at Liberty, and to depend on his Favour
for his future Fortunes. The Prince of <hi>Pontus</hi> joyfully laid hold of this
Overture, and Promises <hi>Cleomax</hi> rewards proportionate to his Service,
so that when the Funeral-Galley was to begin her Voyage, <hi>Cleomax</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises
<hi>Pharnaces</hi> and himself, and thrusting themselves into the Croud
of that solemnity without, interruption got into the Galley and escaped.
Whilst <hi>Ascauius,</hi> said <hi>Callimachus</hi> to his Generous hearers was thus telling
the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> these admirable Accidents, <hi>Pharnaces</hi> was relating
them to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and then presented <hi>Cleomax</hi> to him, whom the
<hi>Pontick</hi> King received with all manner of Acknowledgments, and
on the Place ordered him rewards as great as his Infidelity; this being
done, the <hi>Pontick</hi> King came to Embrace <hi>Ascanius,</hi> to whom the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
had not answered one word to all he had said, so great was her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and her trouble at once.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> after his Acknowledgments were paid in the
most passionate Words and Actions, summoned <hi>Mithridates</hi> of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and implored, that as in the publick Temple he had been divorced
from his blessing, so in the Domestick-Temple he might be possest of
it. I perceive, Generous Prince, reply'd <hi>Mithridates,</hi> by this request
you are ignorant of the occasion which has brought this Assembly hither;
No Sir, <hi>Ascanius</hi> answered, I heard it since my Landing: But Great
King, I know 'twas only my supposed Death led you to what you have
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:96335:364"/>
done, the Cause ceasing, the Effects should do the like, the chief Motive
to the performance failing, 'tis a necessary Consequence, that all built
on it, should fail with it. You would not have given the fair <hi>Statira</hi>
to <hi>Callimachus,</hi> had you known <hi>Ascanius</hi> was alive. 'Tis too much
your ignorance of my Condition has so much wounded me; let not
your Knowledg of it wound me more. Had I known you were living,
the <hi>Pontick</hi> King reply'd, interrupting him, I would in some other way
have endeavoured to reward <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s innumerable Services; but
I doubt <hi>Statira</hi>'s Engagements and mine are too far past to be recalled;
so that if I should not keep my Engagements to the Generous <hi>Ascanius,</hi>
'tis not my Crime, but the Crime of his own Fate. Would to the gods,
the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> answered, I had really dyed, rather than live to hear
these killing words! What Sir, shall your promises be thus observed?
and shall my Services and Sufferings be thus rewarded? Did you only
raise my hopes to the most Glorious height, that ever any attain'd unto,
only with more cruelty to precipitate me and them? shall your mistake
be more powerful for my Ruine, than your knowledg for my preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Oh Sir, give me not so much cause to believe, that what you say
proceeded from your Ignorance, proceeded from your Design; and let
not that Princess <hi>Mithridatia</hi> be made a Sacrifice to Gratitude, who is a
Blessing above all that Services can pretend unto; do not give <hi>Callima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
more than you should, and do not give me less than you promised.
The Services of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> said <hi>Mithridates,</hi> deserve my highest Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments;
And in giving him <hi>Statira,</hi> you therefore see how
highly I valued <hi>Ascanius,</hi> since to him I once had destined what I thought
a full recompence for preserving and restoring my whole Family and my
self: If these intentions have not had the success, I meant them possibly
it is not more your trouble, than it is mine. But my intentions and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
said <hi>Ascanius,</hi> have been greater than his; in what depended of
our selves, I have been as much his superiour, as in what depended on
Chance he has been mine: Do not therefore reward Fortune, more than
you will reward Virtue; and let me not so much doubt your Justice, as
experimentally to feel you give more to my sollicitations, than to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
since only to Crown the First, you design'd for me the Princess
<hi>Mithridatia,</hi> and to recompence the last you condemn me to a loss, as
much transcending Death, as his Condition who shall possess the Princess,
will transcend the condition of all others. While I did nothing, you
gave me all I could wish; and when I have done all I could, you deny
me what you promis'd; <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s Services have the highest Favour,
but mine are denied the lowest Justice. Excuse me, Sir, if what you
spoke as a doubt, I resent as a certainty; I know you are too just, and
too Generous to violate your solemn ingagements; and that I need no
other Argument to incline you to observe them, but to remember you
of them: I will therefore no longer plead them, but only lay before
you, what is your Debt to the Princess, who ought (if bestowed on any)
to be given to him, who by the highest Flame, has the least unworthy
Title to her; she merits more than to sit in the Throne of the Universe:
and therefore though to fit in that of <hi>Cyprus</hi> be below her, yet 'ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much
more below her to be given to one, who is so far from having a Throne
to invite her to, that he has not so much as a certain residence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her; whose Birth is not known to you, and possibly to himself: or
if he be not ignorant of it, yet his not discovering of it, may justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:96335:365"/>
you to believe the lowness of it, is the cause why he conceals it;
for 'tis better to doubt that evil, than to be certain of it, whereby
your admirable Daughter will be made a Sacrifice to your Ignorance,
instead of your Gratitude, and perhaps after her Condition is irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
you may find, that she who Merits the whole World, may be cast
away upon one who is of the lowest degree in it, and who has nothing
considerable but his Fortune and his Sword.</p>
               <p>While I perceived, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> that <hi>Mithridates</hi> opposed
the desires of <hi>Ascanius,</hi> I did without interrupting his Solicitations,
listen to them; but when so rudely he reflected on me, and that at the
end of what he had said, I observed the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, and the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
turned their Eyes upon me, and thereby seemed to tell me, They
expected I should answer for my self: I did immediately upon my knees
kiss the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s hand, which during the Glorious words of
Contract, and till then, I had by her permission held in Mine: and then
rising and turning my self to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> with a look which some of my
Friends afterwards assured me, made him look paler than his wounds
had done, I told him; King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> while you did plead the Great
<hi>Mithridates</hi> Promises, the only Title you could show for the Confidence
of your Ambition; and while you owned every man unworthy of that
Blessing you solicited, I kept that silence, which my respect to the highest
Assembly in the World, render'd my duty; But, now that you have
broken those Bounds, and that you endeavour to raise your own Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
to my prejudice, I must tell you, That if the highest and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Flame that ever burnt, renders him that is blest with it, the least un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s esteem, 'tis <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and not <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
has the best Title to that Happiness; which in any part of the World,
but before those which are the chiefest in it, I will justifie. The Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of my Birth which you upbraid me with, is that I glory in; for
'tis more to perform the Actions of a King, than only to be born
One; and the Sword which can conquer Kingdoms, is more to be valued
than that King whose Sword does lose them. In what quarrel is it, you
can flatter your self with Hope of success, when even in the Princess
<hi>Statira</hi>'s Service, nay, even in her sight, you have twice fail'd of it?
By your first drawing of your Sword, she lost her precious Liberty; and
by your second, she had lost even the hopes of recovering it, if this
<hi>Callimachus,</hi> whose Birth is unknown, or possibly is of the lowest in the
whole World, had not paid her those Duties, which your exalted Birth
were unable to present her. <hi>Ascanius,</hi> said <hi>Callimachus,</hi> had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to hear, me out, but interrupting me at these Words, reply'd, Were
not this glorious Assembly, and the sacred Place in which thou dost speak
thy insolent Words, thy double Sanctuary; thou shouldst before now
have felt thy punishment from that Sword, which thy Pride does so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue:
if it should not serve me in this reparation, I would eternally
forswear wearing it; but I may live to see thee before other company,
and in another place. If that were really thy desire, I answered, thou
wouldst not have taken so hopeful a way of preventing it, as to have made
this Declaration before so many Witnesses; neither could'st thou have
more evidently manifested my Adorations for the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
thine, than in promising thy self more success from thy Sword, in
revenging thy own Quarrel, than revenging hers, when even thy own
Faults made her Revenge a double duty. Thou dost allow me two Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries,
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:96335:365"/>
but I allow thee but one; for were it not in reverence to this
Assembly, thou should'st find that neither the Temple we are in, nor the
Altar of it, should be thy Protection. Would to the gods, <hi>Ascanius</hi> furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
reply'd, that only the Sword thou so magnifi'st, and that Sword thou
so undervaluest, were to decide who is least unworthy of the Princess
<hi>Statira;</hi> Thou should'st soon feel the highest Birth is capable only of the
highest Passion: And though I might with Justice promise my self upon
my own account a Victory against thy Sword; yet I would ascertain it by
making the fair <hi>Mithridatia,</hi> not only the Cause of our dispute, but the
Reward of it; thou would'st then learn, that all those Laurels Fortune has
heaped upon thy Head, were but prepared for me; that I was seemingly
unsuccessful, but to become more really the contrary; and what thou
did'st obtain more from the Valour of those thou had'st the Honour to
lead, than from thine own, would by my Swords purchase, become my
Right; yes, presumptuous <hi>Callimachus,</hi> I renounce the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> his
engagements to me; I renounce the superiority of my Title and Birth;
I will forget the Ignorance, or meanness of thine; do but singly dispute
the Princess <hi>Statira</hi> with me, and I will forgive thy past insolencies to her
and me, if thou wilt put me but in so certain a way of hindering thee from
repeating them in the Future. This Generosity, I reply'd, with raptures
of Joy I accept; give me so certain away of punishing thee I will renounce
my Glorious Contract, I will forget thy being twice defeated, I will only
consider thee as a Rival worthy of my Sword; and leave it to the gods,
whether a Third time they think fit to declare, what they have twice
declared already. <hi>Ascanius</hi> without listening further to what I was about
to say, or answering what I had said, turned himself to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and
in the most moving Actions and Expressions he was capable of, solicited
his permission to that offer which he had made, and I had so joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
Possibly, Generous Princes, <hi>Callimachus</hi> continued, you may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
that <hi>Mithridates</hi> did not interpose his Authority at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these Discourses between the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and me. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you will do so no longer, when I have told you, That when our First
heats began, <hi>Cleomax</hi> having whispered to <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> that Prince forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
told his Father in his Ear something, at which he was so surprized,
that he was so far from interrupting what had past betwixt us, that he
scarcely listened unto it; for he had taken <hi>Cleomax</hi> aside, with <hi>Pharnaces,</hi>
with whom he so intently did Discourse, that all the while <hi>Ascanius</hi> was
imploring a Concession to his request, the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him, nor so much as looked towards him; And by that time the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> had finished his Request, <hi>Mithridates</hi> having done speaking with
his Son, and with <hi>Cleomax, Ascanius</hi> fell a repeating that suit which he
had so lately made, and to which he had received no return; having the
second time ended what he would say, <hi>Mithridates</hi> desired his Excuse
for having given so little attention to his First Solicitation; for he had
been taken up in an imployment, which possibly might render unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the yielding to his desires. Then turning himself to me, with his voice
raised more than ordinarily, he told me; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> what I have done
this day for you, before I knew of the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> being alive; and
what I have said for you, since I knew it, gives you no shadow to doubt
that I not only value your Eminent services, but made it my care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them in a way at least answerable to their greatness, and the just sense
I had of them: But I have been now assured of that, which if true, I shall
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:96335:366"/>
more repent my Favours, than ever I was desirous to load you with them;
had it been what only my Informer would have told me, and not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to your Face, I had received his Intelligence with as much contempt,
as now I entertain it with trouble; but since he desires, I will believe what
he told me to be true or false, but as you shall confess, or deny, I will not
scruple to put that to a tryal, where you are Party, Witness, and Judg.
My Informer is <hi>Cleomax;</hi> my Information is, That 'twas not only <hi>Ostanes</hi>
which helped you to escape, but that he did it by <hi>Nicomedes's</hi> Orders; and
that the banished <hi>Bithynian</hi> King laid the Design for your Flight, by a
joint contrivance of it with your self; whether this be true or false, you
your self can best tell me: and till you give me your answer, I will believe
neither; but I expect, nay, I enjoyn you to deal clearly with me, and to
disguise nothing; the freedom I have used merits what I demand, and
I know you will not give me an answer which may render you unworthy
of such an usage. Never, Generous Princes, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> was
any Man's surprize comparable to Mine, at this fatal Question; to deny
the Truth was to wound that Sincerity which my Words and Actions
had alwayes observed; and to confess the Truth, was to Wound
me mortally in those hopes, whose Death I most apprehended: This
unexpected fatal discovery and question, and the ruinous Consequences
of not answering at all, or answering the Truth, so confounded me, that
I remained speechless so long, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> told me; if I would not
answer, he would take my silence for a Confession. This cruel Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
forced me to say, Sir, You should not have needed a second, and a
threatning Command, if by solemn Engagements, I had not bound my
self to silence, in what I now seem to be accused of. Sir, said <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
to his Father, you need no greater evincement of <hi>Cleomax</hi>'s Fidelity
to your Service, and of <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s guilt, than his not answering this
Charge; and he that is so much a Friend to your Mortallest Enemy, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
not to be trusted against him; Much less to have your Favorite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Daughter,
made the reward of his Services. To which the Generous
<hi>Atafernes</hi> interrupting what I was going to answer, reply'd, Allow Sir,
that what <hi>Cleomax</hi> informs were true: I hope Sir, you will not think it
Just to credit inferences above actual Services: he values still his Duty
to you, above his Gratitude to <hi>Nicomedes:</hi> and he that cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by such Obligations, is uncapable of that sin; so that even his
accusation is so far from rendering him the less capable of your Favour,
that he thereby becomes more deserving of it. The Prince <hi>Atafernes,</hi> I
answered <hi>Mithridates,</hi> has said so much, in so little, that he leaves me
nothing to do, but only to mind you, Sir, That I was guilty once before
I had the Honour to know the great <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to draw my Sword in
<hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s Quarrel against yours. His Generosity possibly remembred
more what I had at first done for him, than what since I had done against
him, and if I submitted to his Resentments (for by all the gods, I never
courted them, no not so much as moved him to them) it was with this
firm assurance, that nothing he could do for me, should diminish in the
least, thezeal I had to your Service, and what I then might have told him,
I have since fully Acted: But why, reply'd the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, with a furious
look, did you wholly ascribe your Deliverance to <hi>Ostanes</hi>'s kindness? And
why did you conceal from me <hi>Nicomedes</hi>'s? Perhaps, Sir, I answer'd, <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
was resolv'd to oblige me entirely; he might doubt, should you
know his Favour only had given me my liberty; you might suspect me
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:96335:366"/>
so far, as to decline receiving those Services which your Ignorance of it
might enable me to present you: He knew my Nature, and my Justice
tied me to acknowledg Obligations, till I could with Honour pay them;
And to prevent my receiving a prejudice where he intended me a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
he might confine me to that Silence which now you seem to ascribe
unto my guilt. Since, reply'd <hi>Mithridates</hi> with an inflamed Countenance,
I find <hi>Cleomax</hi> has told me the Truth, I since find you acknowledg an
high Obligation to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and a Duty therefore upon you to repay
it; And since you have declared your Resolution never to part from my
Service, I must conclude you intend whilst in that, to serve him; so that
even out of your own Mouth I find it but just, not to give my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Friend of my Enemy; And not to trust any of my Armies or
Fleets to one whom I cannot believe, or else must believe him unworthy
that high Alliance and Trust. Now I see what made you forward to
exchange him without my consent, nay, without my knowledg. And
now I call to mind the Earnest you lately gave, of your resolutions
to oblige <hi>Nicomedes</hi> since, after his having designed my Captivity, nay,
I believe my Murther also, when I exprest my just detestations of that
most Barbarous proceeding, and bound my self to revenge it by my most
inviolable Oaths, you would have had me forgot both my Injuries and
Vows. No, no, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you have but too much forfeited all my good
Opinion of you, and all my intentions for you, and thereby have made
it but Reasonable that I should send you to that <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to whom
you are so much indebted, that by your services to him, you may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
some of those Obligations you acknowledg you owe him.</p>
               <p>I was, continued <hi>Callimachus,</hi> wounded to the heart at these piercing
words: and therefore told the King, Because <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was so generous
to me, Because I was so just to him as to pay him that Gratitude and
Obedience I might present him without Infidelity to you; nay, which
was more for your Service than his; for had I told you my Obligations
to him, your suspicion had disabled me from paying you these Services
of defeating his Fleet, and of saving your precious Life, and the Lives
and Liberties of the Royal House of <hi>Pontus.</hi> Must his Gallantry, and
my Innocent Retributions for it, be esteemed my Guilt? And must weak
Inferences be more Credited against me, than signal Actions be Credited
for me? Must the Exchanging of a dying Prisoner for the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi>
be now esteemed a Crime, which so lately was esteemed a considerable
Service? Had I stayed for receiving your Commands, I might have lost
the power of obeying them; And shall the exchanging a Prisoner loaden
with Wounds, for that divine Princess which is above Ransom, be thought
a greater Guilt, than reducing that great Prisoner to that Condition, is
thought a Service? Shall my pleading against a Vow, which pregnant
Evincements manifested to be mistakenly grounded, and which was to
hinder the great <hi>Mithridates</hi> from what I thought unjust, be now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as my Crime? Shall my words Pleading for you as much, if not
more than for him, be more operative against me, than my Actions and
my Wounds are perswasive for me? Alas! it is high time to despair, when
what was my Merit, is now considered as my Guilt. No, Sir, think not
of sending me to <hi>Nicomedes;</hi> though I acknowledg I owe him much, yet
I prefer Affronts in your Service above Glory in his; And if your diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
should never be reconciled, I had rather die ungrateful to him,
than ever separate my self one Moment from your Interests, Pardon me,
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:96335:367"/>
Sir, if I say, I find my only Guilt is <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s Resurrection; You owe
the Princess <hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s Vertue and Birth, more than you owe the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of my Services; and since you see nothing can pay them, but what
does over-pay them, and that you think it juster to give her to him who
can place her in a Throne, than to him who has only a Sword to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
one for her, you therefore chuse to pay my performances by blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; and rob me of all Title to Happiness, by laying to my
charge an imaginary Crime; but though my respect to the great <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
and which is more, to the Father of the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> will bind
me not to repine at what he shall decree: yet having no obligation to
the <hi>Cyprian</hi> King, I must and do now solemnly Vow before those gods to
whom this Temple is dedicated, and who were invoked to be Witnesses
of my Felicity, as now they are of my Disgrace, That if he solicites the
breaking of that Glorious Contract, your Commands and the Princess
<hi>Mithridatia</hi>'s condescension has blessed me with, though he still should
sit in his Throne, and should still be guarded by all his Subjects, yet
through all their Swords, Mine shall force a passage to his Breast, and
make him feel, and the World see the vastness of my Passion, in that of
my Revenges, overcoming all those difficulties which could oppose it.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> at these words losing all his Temper, in Raptures of Fury
told me, Art thou not only contented with having owned thy self a
Friend to my Enemy, but wilt also declare thy self the intended Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
of that King to whom I will give <hi>Statira?</hi> Since thy Insolence
has made thee discover thy Criminal Intentions, my Justice shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
thy Acting them; Then turning to the Captain of his Guards, he
commanded him and them to seize on me. Whilst the Captain of the
Guards, and the Guards themselves, in their amazement or trouble at that
fatal and unjust Command, continued Moveless; <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Ascanius</hi>
drawing their Swords, came towards me to execute that Order, which
those to whom only it was given, wanted Power, or had too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
to perform. This made me immediately draw Mine, and having
told <hi>Pharnaces</hi> the employment he took was below a Prince, and a
Prince that was the Princess <hi>Statira</hi>'s Brother, against whom I durst not
lift up my hands, but would offer to his Sword my unguarded Breast,
rather than employ it against one so nearly related to her; I put by that
thrust <hi>Ascanius</hi> in the mean time made at me, and closing with him, I
flung him down, disarmed him, and had then and there Acted my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
if the fair <hi>Statira</hi>'s Commands, more than all those Guards which
at last by their Kings repeated Orders had inviron'd me, and forced from
my hands my own Sword, had not hinder'd me from the Execution of
my just Resentments. But those being supprest by the highest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
I turned my self towards her who had imposed them on me, and
with the deepest submission imaginable, I told her; The gods, Madam,
even in their Temple, and in their presence, and yours also, have so much
eased that weight of these miseries I am loaden with, that even in that
way my Rival Elected to decide who is the least unworthy of you, have
declared their Sentence in that great Cause, in favour of him to whom
the right did belong; Your Mercy, Fair Princess, is not more evident to
him, than my Success is; and instead of punishing the Presumptuous aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Addresses, and his unsuccessfulness in your Quarrel, by which
you were made a Prisoner, you were pleased to save his life, for 'twas
only your Commands which did it; and I glory more in my Obedience,
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:96335:367"/>
than my Victory, since in that I powerfully evidence all your Commands
are Sacred to me; nor can you doubt I will disobey any of them, since I
even obey those for him, whose injuries to you are greater than those he
has cast upon me. <hi>Mithridates</hi> inflamed at what I had done, beyond the
capability of Accession, Commanded me forthwith to be carried close
Prisoner to <hi>Heraclia:</hi> Solemnly vowing, that if I escaped thence, the
Governor's life should answer it; and then observing the Dejectedness
of <hi>Ascanius,</hi> to revive him, and the more sensibly to be revenged on me,
He turned himself to the Princess, and told her, <hi>Statira, Callimachus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus forfeited all my good intentions for him; and that Prince to
whom I first designed you, being restored to Life, I command you to
perfect in this Temple that happiness for him, which you were interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from conferring on him, in the other. This Injunction, continued <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
wounded me more than all those unparallel'd Miseries Fortune
had that Day heaped upon me; and whilst I was sinking under their
weight, I observed the Princess <hi>Mithridatia</hi> at that fatal Command
change Colour, and continued in a deep Silence, which made the <hi>Pontick</hi>
King tell her; I shall think your cruelty, not kindness, made you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to save <hi>Ascanius</hi>'s life, unless in the way I enjoyn you, you forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
do ask his Blessing. At this second Assault she continued as Silent,
and under the same, found higher Disorders than at the First time: which
so incensed her inraged Father, that he told her; What, <hi>Statira,</hi> Have
you also lost that Obedience, which till this Moment you so exactly paid
to all my Commands? Can you think That <hi>Callimachus</hi> worthy of my
Daughter, that I think unworthy of Liberty, perhaps of Life? and,
Can you for such a Man decline a Prince, as great in his Passion as in his
Birth, who has expos'd the Forces of his Kingdom, and his Life also, for
your Service? and if his Success has not proportion'd his Courage, or
his Vertue, yet he that so nearly had lost his Life to obtain the Victory,
shewed how much he deserved it; and if you value not him above the
false <hi>Callimachus,</hi> you manifest, you esteem Merit less than Fortune; I
require you, nay, I Command you to place the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in that
Felicity I had designed for one you must acknowledg unworthy of it.
And let me not meet with a disobedience in an Injunction which I am
concerned should be observ'd in Honour to my self, Affection to you,
and Revenge to <hi>Callimachus,</hi> Alas, Sir, reply'd the Princess <hi>Statira,</hi> with
the deepest submission and midness; What is it you Command me? The
gods are my Witnesses, I have in all things paid you an Obedience so
perfect, that 'tis in the last evincement of that Truth, that you have
now render'd me uncapable to present you with this other which now
you require from me. For to obey your Commands I have Solemnly
Vowed before all the gods, and the Great Assembly, That I will be no
Man's but <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s, and that I will be his; A higher Duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
than that I owe my Father and my King, renders me unable to obey
him; and since my Obedience justifies my now disobedience, you will not
I hope call that my Crime which is my Religion. By all those gods, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
furiously Answer'd, You shall never be <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s; You
may, Sir, (reply'd the Princess, in her former submissiveness) hinder me
from being his: But Sir, I can never be any Man's but his. At these
Glorious words, breaking out of the hands of those Guards which held
me, I cast my self at her Feet, and told her, This Charming Assurance,
divine Princess, gives me a Joy which does overbalance all those Miseries
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:96335:368"/>
I have had this day hurl'd upon me; you show your self in this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Action, worthy of greater Empires than your Piety makes you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline;
your vouchsafing to own your despised <hi>Callimachus,</hi> when Men,
nay, when Fortune and Justice it self abandons him, puts him in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to out-brave all Misfortunes; Yes, divine <hi>Statira,</hi> I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
now all my sufferings with contentment, since 'tis those only have
invited you to say more in my Favour, than all my Services could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
from you; I now no more condemn my Destiny, 'tis so Glorious,
it rather Merits Envy than Pity; now I despise Captivity, nay, Death it
self, having in this one moment heard assurances from the justest and
fairest Lips, which are Felicities enough for an Age, and those Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
the gods deny me in length, their perfectest Resembler confers on
me in weight. I had longer continued in Raptures of this Nature, but
that I was by <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Commands forced from that happy posture
in which I had entertained and delivered them, who exasperated to the
highest at his Admirable Daughters Refusal, and at my Triumphing at it,
ordered me furiously to be carried to the place of my appointed close
Imprisonment. And the Excellent <hi>Statira</hi> having not only once more
declined that Obedience he exacted from her, but besought him ever in
Tears to suspend his Resentment against me for an Action whose effects
had preserved him and her self from Ruine, and by which he was restored
to the power of using me with such Violence, his Choler grew so blind
and boundless, that he forthwith confined to her Appartment the greatest
Beauty and Vertue of the World; and all that the Generous <hi>Atafernes</hi>
could say and beg for us both, was so far from hindring our Restraints,
that it had like to have made him share in them.</p>
