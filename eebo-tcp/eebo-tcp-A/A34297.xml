            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AMENDMENTS OF <hi>Mr.</hi> COLLIER'<hi>s False and Imperfect CITATIONS,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have been told by some, That they should think me very idle, if I threw away any time in taking notice ev'n of so much of Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s late Treatise of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Stage, as related to my self, in respect of some Plays written by me: For that his malicious and strain'd Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my Words were so gross and palpable, that any indifferent and unprejudic'd Reader would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately condemn him upon his own Evidence, and acquit me before I could make my Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48600:3"/>On the other hand, I have been tax'd of Laziness, and too much Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in neglecting thus long to do my self a necessary Right, which might be effected with so very little Pains; since very little more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in my Vindication, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present truly and at length, those Passages which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has shewn imperfectly, and for the most part by halves. I would rather be thought Idle than Lazy; and so the last Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice prevail'd with me.</p>
            <p>I have no Intention to examine all the Absurdities and Falshoods in Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book; to use the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's own Metaphor in his Preface, <hi>An Inventory of such a Ware-house would be a large Work.</hi> My Detection of his Malice and Ignorance, of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry and vast Assurance, will lie within a narrow Compass, and only bear a Proportion to so much of his Book as concerns my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48600:3"/>Least of all, would I undertake to defend the Corruptions of the Stage; indeed if I were so inclin'd, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has given me no occasion; for the greater part of those Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he has produc'd, are only Demonstrations of his own Impurity, they only savour of his Utterance, and were sweet enough till tainted by his Breath.</p>
            <p>I will not justifie any of my own Errors; I am sensible of many; and if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has by any Accident stumbled on one or two, I will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give them up to him, <hi>Nullum un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ingenium placuit sine venia.</hi> But I hope I have done nothing that can deprive me of the Benefit of my Clergy; and tho' Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself were the Ordinary, I may hope to be acquitted.</p>
            <p>My Intention therefore, is to do little else, but to restore those Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to their primitive Station, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48600:4"/>
have suffer'd so much in being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by him: I will remove 'em from his Dunghil, and replant 'em in the Field of Nature; and when I have wash'd 'em of that Filth which they have contracted in passing thro' his very dirty hands, let their own Innocence protect them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> in the high Vigour of his Obscenity, first commits a Rape upon my Words, and then arraigns 'em of Immodesty; he has Barbarity enough to accuse the very Virgins that he has deflowr'd, and to make sure of their Condemnation, he has himself made 'em guilty: But he forgets that while he publishes their shame he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulges his own.</p>
            <p>His Artifice to make Words guilty of Profaness, is of the same nature; for where the Expression is unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its own clear and genuine Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, he enters into it himself like the evil Spirit; he possesses the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48600:4"/>
Phrase, and makes it bellow forth his own Blasphemies; so <hi>that one</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. <hi>p. 81.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>would think the Muse was Legion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reprimand him a little in his own Words, if these Passages produc'd<note place="margin">p. 70, 71.</note> by Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> are obscene and profane, <hi>Why were they rak'd in and disturb'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were to conjure up Vice, and revive Impurities? Indeed Mr.</hi> Collier <hi>has a very untoward way with him; his Pen has such a Libertine Stroke, that 'tis a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether the Practice or the Reproof be the more licentious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He teaches those Vices he would correct, and writes more like a Pimp than a Pâ. Since the business must be undertaken, why was not the Thought blanch'd, the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made remote, and the ill Features cast into Shadows?</hi> So far from this, which is his own Instruction in his own words, is Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s way of Proceeding, that he has blackned the Thoughts with his own <hi>Smut;</hi> the Expression that was remote, he has brought near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48600:5"/>
and lest by being brought near its native Innocence might be more visible, he has frequently varied it, he has new-molded it, and stamp'd his own Image on it; so that it at length is become Current Deformity, and fit to be paid into the Devil's Exchequer.</p>
            <p>I will therefore take the Liberty to exorcise this evil Spirit, and whip him out of my Plays, where-ever I can meet with him. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd the Story which he relates from <hi>Tertullian;</hi> and after his Visitation of<note place="margin">p. 257.</note> the Play-house returns, having left the Devil behind him.</p>
            <p>If I do not return his Civilities in calling him Names, it is because I am not very well vers'd in his <hi>Nomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clatures;</hi> therefore for his <hi>Foot pads,</hi> which he calls us in his Preface, and for his <hi>Buffoons</hi> and <hi>Slaves in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia,</hi> which he frequently bestows<note place="margin">p. 81, 63, 175.</note> on us in the rest of his Book, I will onely call him Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> and that I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48600:5"/>
will call him as often as I think he shall deserve it.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed, for methods sake, I must premise some few things to the Reader, which if he thinks in his Conscience are too much to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, I desire he would proceed no further in his Perusal of these Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions, but return to Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s <hi>Short View,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I desire that I may lay down <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Definition of Comedy; which has been the Compass by which all the Comick Poets, since his time, have steer'd their Course. I mean them whom Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> so very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently calls <hi>Comedians;</hi> for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between <hi>Comicus</hi> and <hi>Comaedus,</hi> and <hi>Tragicus</hi> and <hi>Tragaedus</hi> is what he has not met with in the long Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of his Reading.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Comedy</hi> (says <hi>Aristotle</hi>) is an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worst sort of People. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>imitatio pejorum.</hi> He
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48600:6"/>
does not mean the worse sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in respect to their Quality, but in respect to their Manners. This is plain, from his telling you immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, that he does not mean <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, relating to all kinds of Vice: there are Crimes too daring and too horrid for Comedy. But the Vices most frequent, and which are the common Practice of the looser sort of Livers, are the subject Matter of Comedy. He tells us farther, that they must be exposed after a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous manner: For Men are to be laugh'd out of their Vices in Comedy; the Business of Comedy is to delight, as well as to instruct: And as vicious People are made asham'd of their Follies or Faults, by seeing them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in a ridiculous manner, so are good People at once both warn'd and diverted at their Expence.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought necessary to premise, that by shewing the Nature
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48600:6"/>
and End of Comedy, we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to expect Characters agreeable to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since Comick Poets are oblig'd by the Laws of Comedy, and to the intent that Comedy may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer its true end and purpose above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, to represent vicious and foolish Characters: In Consideration of this, I desire that it may not be imputed to the Perswasion or private Sentiments of the Author, if at any time one of these vicious Characters in any of his Plays shall behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self foolishly, or immorally in Word or Deed. I hope I am not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable; it were very hard that a Painter should be believ'd to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the ugly Faces that he draws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I must desire the impartial Reader, not to consider any Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Passage cited from any Play, as it appears in Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book; nor to pass any Sentence or Censure
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48600:7"/>
upon it, out of its proper Scene, or alienated from the Character by which it is spoken; for in that place alone, and in his Mouth alone, can it have its proper and true Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I cannot think it reasonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is pleas'd to write one Chapter of <hi>Immodesty,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Profaneness,</hi> that therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Expression traduc'd by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those Heads, shall be condemn'd as obscene and profane immediately, and without any further Enquiry. Perhaps Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is acquainted with the <hi>deceptio visus,</hi> and presents Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the View through a stain'd Glass; things may appear seemingly profane, when in reality they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen through a profane <hi>Medium,</hi> and the true Colour is dissembled by the help of a Sophistical Varnish: Therefore, I demand the Privilege of the <hi>habeas Corpus</hi> Act, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48600:7"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in his Chapter of the Profaneness of the Stage, has founded great part of his Accusation upon the Liberty which Poets take of using some Words in their Plays, which have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times employed by the Translators of the Holy Scriptures: I desire that the following Distinction may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz.</hi> That when Words are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to sacred things, and with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to treat of sacred things; they ought to be understood accordingly: But when they are otherwise apply'd, the Diversity of the Subject gives a Diversity of Signification. And in truth, he might as well except against the common use of the Alphabet in Poetry, because the same Letters are necessary to the spelling of Words which are mention'd in sacred Writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48600:8"/>Tho' I have thought it requisite, and but reasonable to premise these few things, to which, as to so many <hi>postulata,</hi> I may when occasion offers, refer my self; yet if the Reader should have any Objection to the Latitude which at first sight they may seem to comprehend, I dare venture to assure him that it shall be remov'd by the Caution which I shall use, and those Limits by which I shall restrain my self, when I shall judge it proper for me to refer to them.</p>
            <p>It may not be impertinent in this place, to remind the Reader of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common Expedient, which is made use of to recommend the Instruction of our Plays; which is this. After the Action of the Play is over, and the Delight of the Representation at an end; there is generally Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the Moral of the whole shall be summ'd up, and deliver'd to the Audience, in the very last and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48600:8"/>
concluding Lines of the Poem. The Intention of this is, that the Delight of the Representation may not so strongly possess the Minds of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as to make them forget or oversee the Instruction: It is the last thing said, that it may make the last Impression; and it is always compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in a few Lines, and put into Rhyme, that it may be easy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to the Memory.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> divides his Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Stage into these four heads, Immodesty, Profaneness, Abuse of the Clergy, and Encouragement of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</p>
            <p>I have yet written but four poor Plays; and this Author, out of his very particular Favour to me, has found the means to accuse 'em every one of one or more of these four Crimes. I will examine each in its turn, by his Citations; and begin with the Plays in the order that they were written.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48600:9"/>In his Chapter of the Immodesty of the Stage, he has not made any Quotation from my Comedies: But in general, finds fault with the lightness of some Characters. He mentions slightly, and I think with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">p. 10, 12.</note> any Accusation, <hi>Belinda</hi> in the <hi>Old Batchelor,</hi> and <hi>Miss Prue</hi> in <hi>Love for Love. Miss Prue,</hi> he says, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>silly to screen her Impudence,</hi> which <hi>amounts to this Confession, that Women when they have their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings about them, ought to Converse</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>otherwise.</hi> I grant it; this is in truth the Moral of the Character. If Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> would examine still at this rate, we should agree very well. <hi>Belinda</hi> he produces as a Character <hi>under Disorders of Liberty;</hi> this last<note place="margin">p. 12.</note> is what I do not understand, and therefore desire to be excused, if I can make no Answer to it. I only refer those two Characters to the Judgment of any impartial Reader,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48600:9"/>
to determine whether they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented so as to engage any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator to imitate the Impudence of one, or the Affectation of the other; and whether they are not both ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed rather than recommended.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds, <hi>the Double-dealer</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 12.</note> 
               <hi>is particularly remarkable. There are but four Ladies in this Play, and three of the biggest of them are Whores.</hi> These are very <hi>big</hi> Words; very much too <hi>big</hi> for the Sense, for to say <hi>three of the biggest,</hi> when there are but four in Number, is stark Nonsense: Whatever the <hi>Matter</hi> may be in this Gentleman's Book, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his <hi>Stile</hi> at least is admirable.</p>
            <p>Well, suppose he had saidâand the three Biggest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for I am sure he cannot part with <hi>biggest,</hi> he has occasion to use it so often in the rest of his Book. But mark, he gives us an instance of his <hi>big</hi> good Breeding. <hi>A great Complement to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48600:10"/>
               <hi>to tell them, there is not above a quarter of them honest!</hi> This Computation I suppose he makes by the help of political Arithmetick. As thus; the Stage is the Image of the World; by the Men and Women represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, are signified all the Men and Women in the World; so that if four Women are shewn upon the Stage, and three of them are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, it is as much as to say, that three parts in four of the whole Sex are stark naught. He who dares be so hardy as to gain-say this Argument, let him do it; for my part, I love to meddle with my Match. It was a mercy that all the four Women were not naught; for that had been maintaining that there was not one Woman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity honest. What has <hi>Virgil</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for at this rate, in his <hi>Aeneis?</hi> Where, for two of the Fair Sex that do good, <hi>viz. Venus</hi> and the

            <p>
               <hi>Iuvenal</hi> by the help of an <hi>Irony,</hi> has in these three Lines, lash'd the Vices of great Persons with more Severity, than he could have done by the means of a direct and point-blank Invective, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is in plain terms, for having<note place="margin">p. 12, 173, 175.</note> Complements pass'd on Persons of Quality, and neither will allow their Follies nor their Vices to be expos'd.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48600:12"/>
Mr. <hi>Collier?</hi> In the Conclusion of his Preface he is quite of another Opinion; there <hi>he confesses he has no Ceremony for Debauchery, for to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement Vice, is but one remove from worshipping the Devil;</hi> now that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> complements Vice is plain. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is his own Confession, and so I leave him to lick himself whole with one of his own Absolutions.</p>
            <p>When Vice shall be allowed as an Indication of Quality and good Breeding, then it may also pass for a piece of good Breeding to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Vice in Quality: But till then, I humbly conceive, that to expose and ridicule it, will altogether do as well.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>This litter of Epithets makes the Poem look like a Bitch over-stock'd with Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and sucks the Sence almost to skin and bone.</hi> The Comparison is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, I must needs say; but I desire the Reader to consider that it is Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> the Critick, that talks at this odd rate; not Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: I would not, by any means,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48600:17"/>
that he should mistake one for the other.</p>
            <p>If it is necessary for me to give any reason in this place, why I have used Epithets and Figures in this Scene, I will do it in few words. First I desire the Reader to remove my Verses from amongst Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Interlineations of sad Drollery; and reinstate 'em in the Scene of the Play from whence they were torn. If there is found Passion in those parts of the Scene where those Epithets and Figures are used, they will stand in need of no Vindication; for every body knows that Discourses of men in Passion, naturally abound in Epithets and Figures, in Agravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Hyperboles. To this I add, That the Diction of Poetry consists of Figures; by the frequent use of bold and daring Figures, it is distinguish'd from Prose and Oratory. Epithets are beautiful in Poetry, but make Prose
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48600:17"/>
languishing and cold; and the frequent<note place="margin">Arist. Rhet. <hi>L. 3. C. 3.</hi>
               </note> use of them in Prose, makes it pretend too much and approach too near to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry. If Figures and Epithets are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Passion, and if they compose the Diction of Poetry, certainly Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, which is of the sublime and first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Poetry, and which ought every where to abound in <hi>Passion,</hi> may very well be allow'd to use Epithets and Figures, more especially in a Scene consisting entirely of Passion, and still more particularly in the most violent part of that Scene. Thus much, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the use and frequency of Epithets and Figures in the Scene abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd. Ay, but Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> says some of the Figures there are <hi>Stiff:</hi> He says so, I confess; but what then? Why in answer, I say they are not, and so leave it to be determin'd by better Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48600:18"/>Having shewn that men in Passion, naturally make use of violent Figures and Epithets; I will produce no less a Man than Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself for an Example: If you would behold the Gentleman beginning to swell, see him in Page 80. there he puffs and blows, and deals mightily in short periods: At first he is scarce able to Breath, but at length he O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; and anon finds vent for a very odd Expression. He is angry with some Play or other, and saysâ<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made the ferment and rising of the Blood, for such occasions.</hi> I hope he speaks Figuratively, or else I am sure he speaks at least Prophanely; for we know who is meant by <hi>Nature in the Language of Christianity, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. p. 72.</note> 
               <hi>especially under the Notion of a</hi> Maker.</p>
            <p>He discovers in this Expression, that his Religion and his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy are both of a size.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48600:18"/>
He has declared the very Source of Living, and the Spring of Motion in the Mechanical Part of Man, to be no more than the Fountain-Head of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Passions; and intimates very strongly, That <hi>Nature</hi> made it only for that purpose.</p>
            <p>But I think nothing that he says, should be consider'd seriously; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will proceed, and produce Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> as he stands advanc'd both in <hi>ferment</hi> and <hi>figure.</hi> In (p. 84.) he has drawn Quotations from Comedies, <hi>that look Reeking as it were from</hi> Pande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium, <hi>and almost smell of Fire and Brimstone; Eruptions of Hell with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! He almost wonders the Smoak of them has not darkned the Sun, and turn'd the Air to Plague and Poison. Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enough to Arm all Nature in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; to exhaust the Iudgments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. He goes on with such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Stuff for a considerable while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I give this only as a Sample
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48600:19"/>
of some of this Gentleman's Figures.</p>
            <p>Methinks I hear him pronounce 'em every time I behold 'em, they are almost Noisy and Turbulent, even in the Print. In short, they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious; and I find he that will speak of them, is in great danger to speak like them. But why does Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> use all this Vehemence in a Written Argument? If he were to Preach, I grant it might be necessary for him to make a Noise, that he might be sure to be heard: But why all this Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Paper? Judgment is never Outrageous; and Christianity is ever Meek and Mild.</p>
            <p>I have read it somewhere as the Remark of St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> That the Prophets of God were as much distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd from the Prophets of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by their Behaviour, as by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths which they utter'd. The former gave Oracles with all Mildness and Temper; the other were ever
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48600:19"/>
Bellowing with Fury and Madness; no wonder (says he) for the first were inspir'd with the Holy Ghost; and the last were possess'd with the Devil. So the reason is plain.</p>
            <p>But I have employ'd too much time in digressing from my purpose, which is chiefly to Vindicate my self; and only from Casual Observation, to take Notice of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Errors, as they shall appear Blazing up and down in those Pages where I am concern'd, or others into which I may dip acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, in searching for Expressions cited from my own Plays.</p>
            <p>I have done with him in his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Immodesty. The Reader has seen his Charge against the <hi>Mourning Bride,</hi> and is a Judge of the Justness and Strength of it. I confess I have not much to say in Commendation of any thing that I have Written: But if a fair-dealing-man, or a candid Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick had examin'd that Tragedy, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48600:20"/>
that neither the general Moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the two last Lines; nor the several particular Morals interwoven with the success of every principal Character, would have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen by him.</p>
            <p>The Reward of Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in <hi>Almeria,</hi> of the same Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, together with filial Piety and Love to his Country in <hi>Osmin;</hi> the Punishment of Tyranny in <hi>Manuel,</hi> of Ambition in <hi>Gonzalez,</hi> of violent Passions, and unlawful Love in <hi>Zara:</hi> These it may be were Parts of the Poem as worthy to be observed, as one or two erroneous Expressions; and admit they were such, might in some measure have aton'd for them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in his second Chapter, Charges the Stage with Profaness. Almost all the Quotations which he has made from my Plays in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are represented falsly, or by halves;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48600:20"/>
so that I have very little to do in their Vindication, but to represent 'em as they are in the Original, fairly and at length; and to fill up the Blanks which this worthy honest Gentleman has left.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Old Batchelour</hi> (says he) <hi>Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love asks</hi> Bellmour, <hi>Could you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. P. 62.</note> 
               <hi>to go to Heav'n?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bell. <hi>Hum, not immediately, in my Conscience not Heartily</hi>â</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> concludes this Quotation with a dash, as if both the Sense and the Words of the whole Sentence, were at an end. But the remainder of it in the Play <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>Scene</hi> 2. is in these wordsâ<hi>I would do a little more good in my generation first, in order to deserve it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think the meaning of the whole is very different from the meaning of the first half of this Expression. 'Tis one thing for a Man to say positively, he will not go to Heaven; and another
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48600:21"/>
to say, that he does not think himself worthy, till he is better prepared. But Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> undoubtedly was in the right, to take just as much as would serve his own turn. The Stile of this Expression is Light, and suitable to Comedy, and the Character of a wild Debauchee of the Town; but there is a Moral meaning contain'd in it, when it is not represented by halves.</p>
            <p>From Scene 3. of the <hi>4th</hi> Act of the same Comedy, he makes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Quotation. <hi>Fondlewife</hi> a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Puritan is obliged for some time to be absent from his Wife:</p>
            <p>Fond. <hi>Have you throughly consider'd how detestable, how heinous, and how Crying a Sin the sin of Adultery is? Have you weigh'd it, I say? for it is a very weighty sin: and although it may lieâyet thy Husband must also bear his part; for thy Iuiquity will fall upon his Head.</hi> Here is another Dash in this Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I refer the Reader to the Play
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48600:21"/>
to see what words Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has Omitted; and from thence he may guess at the Strength of his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>For this Quotation, the Reader sees it in the same Condition that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> thinks fit to shew it: His Notes upon it are as follow.</p>
            <q>This fit of Buffoonry and Profaneness, was to settle the Conscience of Young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, and to make the Terrors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion insignificant.</q>
            <p>Indeed I cannot hold Laughing, when I compare his dreadful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with such poor silly words as are in the Text: especially when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how <hi>young a beginner,</hi> and how very much a Boy I was when that Comedy was Written; which several know was some years before it was Acted: When I wrote it I had little thoughts of the Stage; but did it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse my self in a slow Recovery from a Fit of Sickness. Afterwards through
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48600:22"/>
my Indiscretion it was seen; and in some little time more it was Acted: And I through the remainder of my Indiscretion, suffer'd my self to be drawn in, to the prosecution of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and thankless Study; and to be involved in a perpetual War with Knaves and Fools. Which reflection makes me return to the Subject in hand.</p>
            <p>Bellmour <hi>desires</hi> Laetitia <hi>to give him leave to Swear by her Eyes and her Lips.</hi> Well, I am very glad Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has so much Devotion for the Lips and Eyes of a Pretty Woman, that he thinks it Profanation to Swear by 'em. I'll give him up this, if he pleases. To the next.</p>
            <q>He kisses the Strumpet, and tells herâEternity was in that Moment.</q>
            <p>To say <hi>Eternity is in a Moment,</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Profane nor Sacred, nor good nor bad. With Reverence of my Friend the Author be it spoken, I take it to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48600:22"/>
be stark Nonsense; and I had not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> had discover'd it.</p>
            <p>Something or other he saw amiss in it, and Writing a Chapter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness at that time, like little <hi>Bays,</hi> he popt it down for his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laetitia</hi> when her Intrigue was like to be discover'd, says of her Lover,</p>
            <q>All my Comfort lies in his Impudence, and Heav'n be prais'd, he has a considerable Portion.</q>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> calls the <hi>Play-house Grace.</hi> It is the expression of a wanton and a vicious Character, in the Distress and Confusion of her Guilt. She is discover'd in her Lewdness, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to come no more upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>In the end of the last Act <hi>Sharper</hi> says to <hi>Vain-love:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>I have been a kind of Godfather to you yonder:</p>
               <p>I have promis'd and vow'd some things in your name, which I think you are bound to perform.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48600:23"/>I meant no ill by this Allegory, nor do I perceive any in it now. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> says it was meant for Drollery on the Catechism; but he has a way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Drollery where it never was intended; and of intending Drollery where it can never be discovered. So much for the <hi>Old Batchelour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Double-Dealer</hi> (he says) <hi>Lady Plyant cries out Iesu, and talks Smut in the same Sentence.</hi> That Exclamation I give him up freely. I had my self long since condemn'd it, and resolv'd to strike it out in the next Impression. I will not urge the <hi>folly,</hi> viciousness, or affectation of the Character to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it. Here I think my self oblig'd to make my Acknowledgments for a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I receiv'd after the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Play, relating to this very Passage. It came from an Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman and a Widow, as she said, and very well to pass: It contain'd very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48600:23"/>
good Advice, and requir'd an Answer, but the Direction for the Superscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was forgot. If the good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman is yet in being, I desire her to receive my Thanks for her good Counsel, and for her Approbation of all the Comedy, that Word alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>That Lady <hi>Plyant</hi> talks <hi>Smut</hi> in the same Sentence, lies yet upon Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> to prove. His bare Assertion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Instance, is not sufficient. If he can prove that there is downright <hi>Smut</hi> in it, why e'en let him take it for his pains: I am willing to part with it.</p>
            <p>His next Objection is, that Sir <hi>Paul,</hi> who he observes bears the Character of a Fool, makes mention too often of the word <hi>Providence;</hi> for says Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 62<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>the meaning must be</hi> (by the way, that <hi>must</hi> is a little hard upon me) <hi>that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48600:24"/>
               <hi>is a ridiculous Supposition; and that none but Blockheads pretend to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> What will it avail me in this place to signifie my own meaning, when this modest Gentleman says, I <hi>must mean</hi> quite contrary?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lady Froth is pleased to call</hi> Jehu <hi>a Hackney Coachman.</hi> (Ibid.)</p>
            <p>Lady <hi>Froth</hi>'s words are as followâ<hi>Our Iehu was a Hackney Coachman when my Lord took him.</hi> Which is as much as to say, that the Coachman's Name is <hi>Iehu:</hi> And why might it not be <hi>Iehu</hi> as well as <hi>Ieremy,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Ioseph,</hi> or any other Jewish or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Name? <hi>Brisk</hi> desires that this may be put into a Marginal Note in Lady Froth's Poem.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> says, is meant to <hi>burlesque the Text, and Comment under one.</hi> What Text, or what Comment,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48600:24"/>
or what other earthly Thing he can mean, I cannot possibly imagine. These Remarks are very Wise; therefore I shall not Fool away any time about them.</p>

But Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> makes a terrible thing of it, and compares it to the <hi>Language of Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans, who made the Creation to be the Work of the Devil.</hi> After which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy solves all by saying, <hi>the Poet was</hi> Jeremy's <hi>Tutor, and so the Mystery is at an end.</hi> This by a Periphrasis is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me <hi>Manichean;</hi> well let him call me what he pleases, he cannot call me <hi>Ieremy Collier.</hi>

            <p>His next Quotation is of one line taken out of the middle of eight more in a Speech of Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> in the second Act of this Comedy: he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

it as an Aphorism by it self, and without any regard to what either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds or follows it. I desire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused from transcribing the whole Scene or Speech. I refer to my third Proposition, and desire the Reader to view it in its place. Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on isâ<hi>Nature has been provident only to Bears and Spiders.</hi> I beg the Reader to peruse that Scene, and than to look into the 139 <hi>Psalm,</hi> because <hi>Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> says it is paraphrased by me in this Place. I wonder how such remote Wickedness can enter into a Man's Head. I dare affirm the Scene has no more resemblance of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> than <hi>Mr. Collier</hi> has of the Character of a Christian Priest, which he gives us in page 127, 128. of his own Book. Towards the end of the third Act, <hi>Scandal</hi> has occasion to flatter Old <hi>Foresight.</hi> He talks to him, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours him in the Cant of his own Character, recites Quotations in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48600:28"/>
of Astrology, and tells him the wisest Men have been beholding to that Scienceâ<note place="margin">P. 75.</note>

               <hi>Solomon</hi> (says he) <hi>was Wise, but how? By his Iudgment in Astrology.</hi> So <hi>says</hi> Pineda <hi>in his third Book and eight Chap.</hi> But the Quotation of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is omitted by Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because he would represent it as my own Observation to ridicule the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or else because he was indeed Ignorant that it belong'd to any Body else.</p>
            <p>The Words which gave me the Hint are as above cited. </p>

            </q>
            <p>Do's Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> believe in Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stications from Judicial Astrology? Do's he think that <hi>Solomon</hi> had his Wisdom only from thence? If he does not, why will he not permit the Superstitions growing from that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48600:28"/>
to be expos'd? Why will he not understand that the exposing them in this Place and Manner, does not ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but the Folly of <hi>Foresight?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scandal</hi> he says, continues his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and says, <hi>The Wise Men of the East ow'd their Instruction to a Star, which is rightly observ'd by</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great, in favour of Astrology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scandal</hi> indeed Banters <hi>Foresight,</hi> but he does not banter the Audience, in mentioning <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great: Take his own Words.</p>
            <q>Deus accommodate ad eorum scientiam docuit, ut qui in Stellarum Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatione versabantur ex stellis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum discerent.</q>
            <p>The rest of the Banter is what <hi>Scandal</hi> relates from <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> who makes it the most <hi>valuable Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, because it teaches us to consider the Causation of Causes in the Causes of things.</hi>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48600:29"/>I am but a bare Translator in this place; for example:</p>

            <p>Is not all this stuff, and fit to be exposed; yet these and some other like Sayings, have I sometimes met with as Authorities in Vindication of Judicial Astrology.</p>
            <p>In Page 76. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is very angry that Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> has not another Name; because <hi>Sampson</hi> is a Name in the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>He says it is Burlesquing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred History, for Sir <hi>Sampson</hi> to boast of his Strength; because <hi>Sampson</hi> in the Testament is said to be very strong. The rest that he quarrels at is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical expression or two, of less Consideration if possible, than any of his former Cavils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48600:29"/>I refer the Reader to the Scene, which is the last in the Play: And for an Answer, to what has before been said on the word <hi>Martyr.</hi> When I read in this page these words of <hi>Mr. Collierâto draw towards an end of this Play,</hi> I thought he had no more to say to it; but his method is so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that he never knows where to begin, nor when to make an end. Five or six pages farther I find another of his Remarks.<note place="margin">Coll. p. 83.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Love, Valentine</hi> says, <hi>I am Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Reader pleases to consult the Fourth Act of that Comedy, he will there find a Scene, wherein <hi>Valentine</hi> counterfeits madness.</p>
            <p>One reason of his Counterfeiting in that manner, is, that it conduces somewhat to the design and end of the Play. Another reason is, that it makes a Variation of the Character; and has the same effect in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48600:30"/>
of the Play, as if a new Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter were introduc'd. A third use of this pretended madness is, that it gives a Liberty to Satire; and authorises a Bluntness, which would otherwise have been a Breach in the Manners of the Character. Mad-men have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally some one Expression which they use more frequently than any other. <hi>Valentine</hi> to prepare his Satire, fixes on one which may give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that he will speak nothing but Truth; and so before and after most of his Observations saysâ<hi>I am Truth.</hi> For example. <hi>Foresight</hi> asks him</p>
            <q>
               <sp>

                  <p> Scandal will tell youâI am Truth, I never come there.</p>
               </sp>
            </q>
            <p>I had at first made him say, <hi>I am Tom-tell-troth;</hi> but the sound and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Expression displeas'd me: and I alter'd it for one shorter, that might signifie the same thing. What a Charitable and Christian-like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48600:30"/>
my dear Friend <hi>Mr. Collier</hi> has given to this Expression, is fit only to be seen in his own Book; and thither I refer the Reader: I will only repeat his Remark as it personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aims at meâ<hi>Now a Poet that had not been smitten with the pleasure of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, would not have furnish'd Frenzy with Inspiration,</hi> &amp;c. Now I say, a Priest who was not himself furnish'd with Frenzy instead of Inspiration, would never have mistaken one for the other.</p>
            <p>In his next Chapter he Charges the Stage with the Abuse of the Clergy. He quotes me so little in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and has so little reason even for that little, that it is hardly worth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Perhaps that is a Mistake; many damnable Plots have miscarried, wherein Priests have been concern'd.</p>
            <p>After this, he has transcrib'd a broken Piece of a Dialogue between <hi>Maskwell</hi> and <hi>Saygrace,</hi> which I leave to shift for it self; having nothing in it worth an Accusation, or needing a Defence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is very florid in this Chapter; but it is very hard to know what he would be at. He seems to be be apprehensive of being brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage, and in some Places endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove, that as he is a Priest, he should be exempted from the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">P. 124, 127.</note> of the <hi>Drama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48600:32"/>In other Places he does not seem to be averse to treading the Stage; but he would do it in Buskins: He would be <hi>all Gold, Purple, Scarlet, and Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery; and as rich as Nature, Art, and Rhetorick, can make him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 118.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We will first enquire whether he may be brought on the Stage or not; and then shew both how he would, and how he should be represented; granting the Representation of his Character to be lawful.</p>
            <p>Here he lays down something with<note place="margin">p. 127.</note> the appearing face of an Argument, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 3. Heads, to shew that the Clergy have a <hi>Right to Regard and fair Usage.</hi> I'm sure I will never dispute that with him in the general Terms. But I suppose he is particular here; and means that they have a Right to be exempted from the Theater. Whether they have or not I will not pretend to determin; This I know, that the Custom of the Theater in all Ages and Countries is against
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48600:32"/>
this Opinion; which in this Chapter is sufficiently prov'd by the Examples which himself has produc'd.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is in earnest of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, he has behav'd himself either very treacherously or very weakly, in offering to assert it by a false and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical Argument. His Proof begins.</p>
            <p>1. Because of their relation to the Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now (says he) the Credit of the Service always rises in Proportion to the Quality and Greatness of the Master.</hi> Upon this Position he builds all the argument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this first Head. The Position is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical, &amp; his Inferences consequently false. The trick lies here. It being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that the Credit of the <hi>Service</hi> rises in Proportion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he slily infers, that the Credit of the <hi>Servant</hi> also rises in proportion to the Credit of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> which is false: For every body knows that an ill Servant both discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits his Service, and is discredited by it. And by how much the more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48600:33"/>
the Service is in which he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, so much the more is he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an ill Man who behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unworthily in that Service.</p>
            <p>If an offending Servant is punish'd by the Law, the honour of the Service is not by that means violated; so far from that, that it is rather vindicated: Neither on the Stage is the divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ridicul'd, only the ridiculous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is expos'd.</p>
            <p>2. Because of the Importance of their Office. And,</p>
            <p>3. They have Prescription for their Privilege, their Function has been in Possession of Esteem in all Ages and Countries.</p>
            <p>These 2. are but Branches of the first Head: for <hi>their relation to the Deity</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the <hi>importance of their Office;</hi> and bespeaks that Privilege and Esteem which ever ought to be paid to their Holy Function.</p>
            <p>But here again Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> confounds
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48600:33"/>
the Function with the Person, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with the Servant: He is Father <hi>Dominick</hi> still.</p>
            <p>I would ask Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> whether a Man, after he has receiv'd holy Orders, is become incapable of either playing the Knave, or the Fool?</p>
            <p>If he is not incapable, it is possible that some time or other his Capacity may exert it self to Action.</p>
            <p>If he is found to play the Knave, he is subject to the Penalties of the Law, equally with a Lay-man; if he plays the Fool, he is equally with a Lay-fool, the subject of Laughter and Contempt.</p>
            <p>By this Behaviour the <hi>Man</hi> becomes alienated from the <hi>Priest;</hi> as such Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in their own nature separate and very far remov'd from his function, and when such a one is brought on the Stage, the folly is expos'd, not the function; the <hi>Man</hi> is ridicul'd, and not the <hi>Priest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a Character neither does nor can asperse the sacred Order of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48600:34"/>
neither does it at all reflect upon the persons of the pious and good Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: For as <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> observes on the same occasion from St. <hi>Hierome, Ubi gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis est de vitiis disputatio, Ibi nullius esse personae injuriam,</hi> where the business is to expose and reprehend Folly and Vice in general, no particular person ought to take offence. And such business is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the business of Comedy.</p>
            <p>That this may not look like a sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical distinction in me, to say that the <hi>Man</hi> does, by his behaviour, as it were alienate himself from the <hi>Priest,</hi> and become liable to an ill Character, apart from his Office: I desire it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that the Church it self makes the same Distinction.</p>
            <p>It was foreseen by the Reverend Bishops and Clergy of this Realm, in their Convocations for establishing the 39. Articles of our Religion in the Years 1562. and 1604. that evil Men (unperceiv'd to be such) might
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48600:34"/>
creep into the Ministry of the Church. That afterwards they might become openly profligate, and notoriously Scandalous in their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations; even to that Degree, that some scrupulous Christians, and of a very tender Conscience, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably take such Offence at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness of their Minister, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously to avoid his Administration of the Holy Word and Sacraments: To refrain from publick Worship, and to lose the real Benefit of the Communion, thro' a misconceiv'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the invalidity of it when Administred by unclean and wicked Hands.</p>
            <p>They might (and not without some reasonable Grounds) doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same Man who was personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impious, could be spiritually Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred; whether he who by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would seduce 'em to the Devil, could by his Precepts be conducing to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48600:35"/>
their Salvation. This I say, they might doubt; and not without some reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grounds; and not without the Opinions of two of the Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and St. <hi>Origen</hi> to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize their Distrust.</p>
            <p>But to remove this Doubt, and to invalidate the Authorities of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the six and twentieth Article of Religion was thus Established by the Convocations abovementioned.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Article 26.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although in the visible Church the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be ever mingled with the Good, and sometime the Evil have chief Authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Yet for as much as they do not the same in their own Name, but in Christ's, and do Minister by his Commission and Authority; we may use their Ministery both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's Ordinance taken away
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48600:35"/>
by their Wickedness, nor the Grace of God's Gifts diminished from such, as by Faith, and rightly do receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Ministred unto them; which are effectual, because of Christ's Institution and Promise, although they be Ministred by evil Men.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless it appertaineth to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, that enquiry be made of evil Ministers: And that they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by those that have knowledge of their Offences; and finally being found Guilty by just Iudgment be deposed.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here is a most manifest Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made between the Man and the Priest. Between the regard to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the respect to his Function.</p>
            <p>I will shew anon, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself has made this very Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he is pleased to approve of the Characters of <hi>Ioida</hi> and <hi>Mathan</hi> in the <hi>Athalia</hi> of <hi>Racine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Man has in any Play ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Priest, as a Priest, and with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48600:36"/>
an intimation, that as such, his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is ridiculous: I will agree hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to condemn both the Play and the Author. I am confident no Man can defend such an Impiety; and whoever is guilty of it, my Advice to him is, that he acknowlege his Error, that he repent of it and sin no more.</p>
            <p>I confess I do not remember any such Character, Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> who is more conversant with bad Plays than any Man that I know, perhaps may.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in this Chapter produces many Instances of the Characters of Priests in the Poems of Heathen Writers; he is extreamly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Distinctions of their Habits, with the Show and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in which they appear'd. The Crown and guilt Scepter of <hi>Chryses,</hi> with the valuable Ransom which he had in his Power, are Objects that gratifie his vain Imagination extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He is indeed so rapt with his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48600:36"/>
splendid Ideas of <hi>Chryses, Laocoon,</hi> and <hi>Chloreus,</hi> that to use his own Phrase, he <hi>runs riot</hi> upon their Description from <hi>page</hi> 112 to 118. he seems to have quite laid aside the Thoughts of the <hi>twelve poor Men who over-bore all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of Power and Learning,</hi> in pag. 81.</p>
            <p>He now talks of nothing but great Families, great Places, wealthy and honourable Marriages, fine Cloaths, and in short, of all the Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this wicked World. To give him his Due, as in some Places of his Book he criticizes more like a Pedant than a Scholar; argues more like a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister than a right Reasoner, and ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies more like a Waterman than a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; so in this Place he talks more like a Herald-Painter than a Priest, and insists more upon Pedigrees and Coats of Arms, than on moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or a generous Education.</p>
            <p>He tells us the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Priests, the <hi>Persian Magi,</hi> and <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids</hi>

of <hi>Gaul</hi> were all at the <hi>upper end of the Government,</hi> p. 131. What then? What is that to us, any more than if they were used to sit at the upper end of the Table? No doubt this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Affection for such a Seat, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd him with this florid and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porical Expression.</p>
            <p>In p. 132. He says <hi>the Priesthood was for some time confin'd to the Patrician Order.</hi> Very well: we know the Reason of that; but with Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is not the same thing as if the <hi>Patrician</hi> Order had been confin'd to the Priesthood. However, this Gentleman's Meaning is plain; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if he were Pope, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Title of <hi>Servus Servorum Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He quotes <hi>Tully</hi> for his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same Person's being set at<note place="margin">p. 133.</note> the Head both of Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. What does he mean by this? What Occasion is there of this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48600:37"/>
Quotation, in our Country? Is not our King both at the Head of our Religion and Government? When Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> allows him one, perhaps he will not deny him the other.</p>
            <p>But to come to his Meaning (if he has any) thro' all this vain Stuff. I take it, he would give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that in all Ages the Function of a Priest was held to be a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Function. Did Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ever meet with any Body Fool enough to engage him to assert that?</p>
            <p>He tells us that Men of the first Quality; nay, Kings and Emperors have been employ'd in the sacred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry: And I can tell him that Kings and Emperors have been in all Ages expos'd on the Stage; their Ambition, Tyrannies and Cruelties, all the Follies and Vices which were Consequences of their arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ungovern'd Appetites, have been laid open to the Peoples View.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48600:38"/>
They have been punish'd, depos'd, and put to Death on the Stage; yet never any King complain'd of the Theater, or the Poets. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all great Princes have cherish'd and supported them so long as they themselves were great; till they have diminish'd in their own Characters, and turn'd to Bigotry and Enthusiasm; and of this a living Instance might be given.</p>
            <p>Yet, 1. Kings have a Relation to the Deity.</p>
            <p>They are his Deputies and Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> They are possess'd of a very important Office. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Their Function has been in Possession of Esteem in all Ages and Countries.</p>
            <p>That Men of Quality have always been, and are now employ'd in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ministry, is evidently true; and I could heartily wish that more were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48600:38"/>
still employ'd in it: So should the most honourable Office be executed by the most honourable Hands. So should we behold Men of Birth, Title, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry, despising tinsel Shew, Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s beloved Bells, Bawbles, and Trinkets. And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Decency, Humility, Charity, and other Christian Virtues, to shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ornaments; or even the <hi>upper End of a Government.</hi> How ill such temporal Bride agrees with the Person and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a truly pious and exemplary Divine, I will not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I will only transcribe the Words of a learn'd and honour'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister<note place="margin">Vid. his Tract concerning Schism. p. 224, 225.</note> of the Church, to this purpose; and that is the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton.</hi>

            <q>For we have believ'd him that hath told us, <hi>That in Iesus Christ there is neither high nor low; and that in giving Honour, every Man should be ready to prefer another before himself;</hi> which

Sayings cut off all Claim most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to Superiority, by Title of Christianity, except Men can think that these things were spoken only to poor and private Men. Nature and Religion agree in this, that neither of them hath a hand in this Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of <hi>secundum sub &amp; supra;</hi> all this comes from Composition and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men among themselves. Wherefore this Abuse of Christianity, to make it <hi>Lacquey</hi> to Ambition, is a Vice for which I have no extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name of Ignominy, and an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I will not give it, lest you should take so transcendent a Vice to be but trivial.</q>

To profess the Service of God would be a Punishment, if the Title of Clerk were not at least equal to that of Gentleman. Well,â<hi>The Heraldry is every Iot as safe in the Church, as 'twas in the State.

            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48600:40"/>I know many Reverend Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men now living, whose Names I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear without Awe and Reverence: And why is that? Not from their Heraldry, but their Humility, their Humanity, their exceeding Learning, which is yet exceeded by their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; their exemplary Behaviour in their whole Lives and Conversations; their Charitable Censures, of Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Errors and Negligences, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and tender Admonitions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with all sweetness of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and full of mild yet forcible Perswasion.</p>
            <p>He were next to a <hi>Manichean</hi> that would not hold such Men's Persons in a degree of Veneration, next to their Profession. But a Mr. <hi>Prig,</hi> a Mr. <hi>Smirk,</hi> and I'm afraid a Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> are Names implying Characters worthy of Aversion and Contempt.</p>
            <p>Now let us take a View of Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> as he appears upon the Stage;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48600:40"/>
for while he is examining of Plays; I look upon him as one who has <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> from his Pulpit and Strayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the inclosures of the Theatre; and I do not see why the Players should not lay hold of him, and pound him till he has given them Absolution. Why does he abandon his Gown and Cassock to come Capering and Frisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his Lay-Doublet and Drawers, between the Scenes? Is he Master of the Revels? Is the Stage under his Discipline? <hi>And is he fit to Correct the</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. Coll. p. 139.</note> 
               <hi>Theatre who is not fit to come into it?</hi> He is not fit to come into it. First, Because his Office requires him in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place. And Secondly, Because he makes naughty uses of innocent Plays, and writes Baudy, and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Comments, on the Poets Works.</p>
            <p>Well, he has at length discovered a Play which is <hi>an Exception to what he has observed in</hi> France, (Coll.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48600:41"/>
124.) the Play is the <hi>Athalia</hi> of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</hi> In this Play are the Characters of two Priests <hi>Ioida</hi> and <hi>Mathan;</hi> of both which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is pleased to admit: By enquiring into his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for Licensing this Play, we shall see in what manner he will allow a Priest to be represented on the Stage; and from thence we may guess how he himself would be contented to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioida</hi> (says he) <hi>the High-Priest has a large Part, but then the Poet does him Iustice in his Station; he makes him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and Brave, and gives him a shining Character throughout.</hi> That's well. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is another Priest in the same Tragedy, he turns Renegado, and revolts from God to Baal.</hi> That is not altogether so well. But has not the Poet done him Justice too, in giving him the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that belong'd to him? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has or not, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> thinks he has made him ample reparation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48600:41"/>
and more than amends, as you shall see. He goes on. <hi>He is a very ill Man But</hi>âay, now for the <hi>BUT.</hi>âHe has turn'd Renegado, has revolted from God to <hi>Baal,</hi> is <hi>positively</hi> a very Ill-Man, But, what? O, <hi>BUT makes a considerable Appearance.</hi> There, now 'tis out, and all's well. If he has but <hi>a guilt Crown, and Scepter, Scarlet and Embroidery in abundance,</hi> let him rebel or revolt, he makes a good Figure, and it becomes him very well. Your Servant Mr. <hi>Racine,</hi> 'twas well for you that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> gave good Benefices, and his Priests could afford to make a considerable Appearance: Or <hi>Mathan</hi>'s Revolt had not been so well taken at your Hands. But hold, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> goes on.</p>
            <p>I'm afraid the Reparation enlarges, and the Complement rises. For the sake of Connexion let us repeat.â</p>
            <p>â<hi>But makes a considerable Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> And,â</p>
            <p>Ay now, what can follow this <hi>AND</hi> in the Name of <hi>Climax?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48600:42"/>You shall see.â<hi>And is one of the Top of</hi> Athalia's <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, then there is no more to be said. If he had fine Cloaths, and was set at the Top, or rather at the <hi>upper End</hi> of a Faction too, he had his hearts Content: A reasonable <hi>Mathan</hi> would have been satisfied with any one of those Blessings. Tho' I would not answer for Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Continence; at this time, especially: he is so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Mr. <hi>Racine</hi>'s Bounty to <hi>Mathan,</hi> that he excuses him frankly for shewing him a Renegado.</p>
            <p>He goes on.â<hi>As for the Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of his Life, they stick all upon his own Honour, and reach no farther than his Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think I have now kep't the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that I made not long since, to shew that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself, when he is in the Humour, will allow of the Distinction betwixt the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Priest,</hi> the Person and the Function.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48600:42"/>But to shew that I can be as cross as he; now when he would admit of this distinction, I should rather say when he alledges it, it shall not by any means be granted him. Here is a renegade Priest, that revolts from the true God to <hi>Baal:</hi> And this Man is only branded with a Blemish on his Person. What, is it no Affront to his Function then? I take it to be no excuse for him that he should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards become a Priest of <hi>Baal.</hi> Sure Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> does not mean to make use of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Key as he calls it, and say that <hi>Priests of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,</hi> &amp;c. Well, 'tis only a Blemish upon his Person; or if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> pleases, because he delights in Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Heraldry, 'tis only a Blot in his Scutcheon. Let Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for this, to those who have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to examine him further. He is in every Line growing more and more gracious to Mr. <hi>Racine.</hi> And
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48600:43"/>
now he is come to the very <hi>top</hi> or <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-end</hi> of his Civility; and says with a <hi>bon grace</hi> and <hi>belle air,</hi> that</p>
            <q>âin fine, the Play is a very religious Poem.</q>
            <p>Indeed! why then <hi>in fine</hi> we are tack'd about; then a Play <hi>in fine,</hi> may be a religious Poem it seems: Why then Sir <hi>Martin</hi> with his, <hi>in fine,</hi> here has quite unravel'd his own Plot. Ay, ay, the Play is a very religious Poem; if Faction and fine Cloaths wont make a religious Poem, it must be made of strange Stuff indeed.</p>
            <q>â'Tis upon the Matter all Sermon and Anthemâ</q>
            <p>O Lord! nay, now I protest Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> this must not be; nay now you're so infinitely obliging! fye, this is too much on t'other side: You quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Fathers indeed Sir, and the Bishop of <hi>Arras.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>âAnd if it were not design'd for the Theatreâ</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48600:43"/>Out with it Man.â</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I have nothing to Object.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Why that's well, now he's come to himself. O' my Word, I was half afraid he would have play'd the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and have revolted to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre. The Mischief is, this naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Theatre will be interloping; when Sermon and Anthem, become the Stage as ill, as Faction and fine Cloaths do the Pulpit: But Men sometimes travel into Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces for Vari<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear enquiring into one Example more, which this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman offers us in the very next Page.</p>
            <q>In the History of Sir <hi>John Oldcastle,</hi> Sir <hi>John,</hi> Parson of <hi>Wrotham,</hi> Swears, Games, Wenches, Pads, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ilts and Drinks; this is extremely bad.</q>
            <p>Extremely bad? Can any thing be worse? and yet (says he) <hi>Shakespear's Sir</hi> John, <hi>has some advantage in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> Now who can forbear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48600:44"/>
what advantage a Character can possibly have, consistent with such abominable Vices? First, <hi>He appears loyal and stout; he brings in Sir</hi> John, Acton, <hi>and other Rebels, Prisoners.</hi> So! as 'tis in the <hi>Spanish Fryar,</hi> a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Member of the Church Militant! That he was Stout, was plain before, from his Padding and Tilting. But this will not do; the advantage does not yet appear. No! why then.</p>
            <q>âHe is rewarded by the King, and the Iudge uses him civilly and with Respect.</q>
            <p>This Advantage appears still but coldly. Kings reward Spys and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners, and necessary Instruments of Policy and Punishment. And Judges are generally Men of Years, Temper and Wisdom, and use all Gentlemen with Civility. Ay, say you so? why thenâ<hi>in short</hi>âay, now for the Iliads in a Nut-shell. Here is the <hi>But</hi> coming again, I had a glimpse of him just now. <hi>ex. gr.</hi>

            <q>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48600:44"/>In short he is represented <hi>Lewd, but</hi> not <hi>Little.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>There is an Advantage for you now; <hi>in short, Lewd</hi> but not <hi>Little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concise and pretty! the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had best take it for a Motto, and have it annex'd to his Coat-Armour, when he can get <hi>his Heraldry regulated by Garter, and blazon'd by Stones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, I confess I have been in an Error; I thought a Man never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd so very little, as when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd extremely lewd. If I have undervalued Lewdness, I ask Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Pardon.</p>
            <q>And the Disgrace falls rather on the Person than the Office.</q>
            <p>Here again you see, he will allow this Distinction to all his Favourites. Here is the Person and the Function separated again; the Priest and the Man: In short, he answers himself so often, that I will dispute this Point no more with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48600:45"/>But you may see what this poor Gentleman in the wretched Pride of his little Heart, thinks a sufficient Alloy to make current a most disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or impious Character. Though you expose a Priest revolting from God to <hi>Baal,</hi> yet if you let him make a considerable Figure, and place him at the Head of a Faction, all is well enough; and the Poem may be a <hi>religious Poem,</hi> &amp;c. Shew another in Comedy, let him Swear, Game, Wench, Pad, Tilt and Drink, but withal let him keep good Company; let a Judge, or some Great Man treat him with Respect, that he may not appear little, though he appear lewd, and you give <hi>some advantage to his Character;</hi> at least you will shew that he <hi>understands his Post, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses with the Freedom of a Gentleman.</hi>

            <p>In Page 122, Our Author has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd <hi>how the Heathen Poets behav'd themselves in the Argument. Priests sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

               <hi>appear in their Plays; and when they come, 'tis business of Credit that brings them. They are treated like Persons of Condition; they act up to their Relation, neither sneak, nor prevaricate, nor do any thing unbecoming their Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed when Men neither sneak, nor prevaricate, nor do any thing unbecoming their Office in the World, they ought not to be represented o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise on the Stage: Nay, they ought not to be expos'd at all in Comedy; for the Characters expos'd there, should be of those only, who misbehave themselves.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose that the Character of this Author were to be shown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage: he who should repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him behaving himself as he ought, would be to blame, and that for these Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To represent him behaving himself as he ought, would be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him in the discharge of some
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48600:46"/>
part of his Holy Office, which is by no means fit to be shewn on the Stage; especially in Comedy, where Mens Vices and Follies are expos'd: That would be to bring Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Function, not his Person on the Stage, which is not to be permitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He that should represent Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> behaving himself as he ought, would very much misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> in respect to the Manners of his Character.</p>
            <p>Let us take a slight Sketch of him as he presents himself to us in his Book. Let Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> be represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he is, not as he ought to be; that by seeing what he is, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> may be asham'd of what he is, and endeavour at what he ought to be.</p>
            <p>And that the Instruction of the Representation may not be lost, let us borrow that Distinction which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Priest from the Man: If <hi>Mathan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Wrotham,</hi> have
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48600:46"/>
done with it, they may lend it to us; 'tis for the use of an Humble Servant of theirs, and whenever the Humour takes 'em to Revolt, Pad, Tilt, Wench, Drink, and soforth, let 'em give us a Quarter of an Hours Notice, and they shall have it again.</p>
            <p>Well, Our Author being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, we will desire the better Part of him, to take his Place in the Pit, and let the other appear to him like his evil Genius on the Stage.</p>

            <p>'Tis a strange thing that a Man should write such Stuff as this, who is capable of making the following<note place="margin">Coll. 205.</note> Observation.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Offensive Language, like Offensive Smells, does but make a Man's Senses a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and affords him nothing but loathing and Aversion.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48600:49"/>For these Reasons, 'tis a Maxim in good Breeding never to shock the Senses or Imagination.</p>
            </q>
            <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            <p>Indeed there are few things which distinguish the manner of a Man's Breeding and Conversation, more visibly, than the Metaphors which he uses in Writing; I mean in writing from himself, and in his own Name and Character, A Metaphor is a similitude in a Word, a short Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; and it is used as a similitude, to illustrate and explain the meaning. The Variety of <hi>Ideas</hi> in the Mind, furnish it with variety of Matter for Similitudes; and those <hi>Ideas</hi> are only so many Impressions made on the Memory, by the force and frequency of external Objects.</p>
            <p>Pitiful and mean Comparisons, proceed from pitiful and mean <hi>Ideas;</hi> and such <hi>Ideas</hi> have their beginning from a familiarity with such Objects. From this Author's poor and filthy
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48600:50"/>
Metaphors and Similitudes, we may learn the Filthiness of his Imagination; and from the Uncleanness of that, we may make a reasonable guess at his rate of Education, and those Objects with which he has been most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant and familiar.</p>
            <p>To conclude with him in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; I will only say that no Man living has a greater respect for a good Clergy-man, nor more contempt for an ill one, than my self; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I have often been proud to shew, the latter never fell in my way till now. I never yet introduced the Character of a Clergy-man in any of my Plays, excepting that little Apparition of <hi>Say-grace,</hi> in the <hi>Double-Dealer;</hi> and I am very indifferent whether ever the Gown appear upon the Stage, or not: If it does, I think it should not be worn by the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a good Man; for such a one ought not to be made the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48600:50"/>
of foolish Characters. If ever it is shewn there, it ought to be hung loosely on the shoulders of such a one as I have lately instanced; but to no other end, than to demonstrate that even the sacred Habit is abus'd by some; but by their Characters and Manners the Audience may observe what manner of Men they are. And no question but if our Author, in the Pit, did behold his Counterpart on the Stage, thus egregiously to play the Fool in his <hi>Pontificalibus, the rebuke</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. 111.</note> 
               <hi>would strike stronger upon his sense,</hi> and prove more effectual to his Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I come now to his Chapter of the Immorality of the Stage.</p>
            <p>His Objections here are rather Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against Comedy in general, than against mine, or any bodies Comedies in particular. He says the Sparks that <hi>marry up the Top-Ladies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 142.</note> and are rewarded with Wives and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48600:51"/>
Fortunes in the last <hi>Acts,</hi> are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debauch'd Characters. In answer to this, I refer to my first and second Proposition. He is a little particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his Remarks upon <hi>Valentine,</hi> in <hi>Love for Love.</hi> He says,</p>
            <q>This Spark, the Poet would pass for a<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Person of Vertue; but he speaks too late.</q>
            <p>I know who, and what he is, that always speaks too soon. Why is he to be pass'd for a Person of Vertue? Or where is it said that his Character makes extraordinary Pretensions to it! <hi>Valentine</hi> is in <hi>Debt,</hi> and in <hi>Love;</hi> he has honesty enough to close with a hard Bargain, rather than not pay his Debts, in the first <hi>Act;</hi> and he has Generosity and Sincerity enough, in the last <hi>Act,</hi> to sacrifice every thing to his Love; and when he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of losing his Mistress, thinks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing else of little worth. This, I hope, may be allow'd a Reason for the Lady to say, <hi>He has Vertues:</hi> They
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48600:51"/>
are such in respect to her; and her once saying so, in the last <hi>Act,</hi> is all the notice that is taken of his <hi>Vertue</hi> quite thro' the Play.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> says, he <hi>is Prodigal.</hi> He was prodigal, and is shewn, in the first <hi>Act</hi> under hard Circumstances, which are the Effects of his Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. That he is unnatural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful, I don't understand: He has indeed a very unnatural Father; and if he does not very passively submit to his Tyranny and barbarous Usage, I conceive there is a Moral to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd from thence to such Fathers. That he is <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>obscene,</hi> is a false Accusation, and without any Evidence. In short, the Character is a mix'd Character; his Faults are fewer than his good Qualities; and, as the World goes, he may pass well enough for the best Character in a Comedy; where even the best must be shewn to have Faults, that the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48600:52"/>
best Spectators may be warn'd not to think too well of themselves.</p>
            <p>He quotes the <hi>Old Batchelor</hi> twice<note place="margin">P. 171. 172.</note> in this Chapter. His first Quotation is made with his usual assurance and fair dealing.</p>

                  <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                  <p> That's as much as to say, The Pox take me.</p>
               </sp>
            </q>
            <p>It is his Interpretation; and it is agreeable to his Character. He is a Debauchee, and he thinks there is but one way for Women to be kind
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48600:52"/>
and tender-hearted; and, I think, his threat'ning them with such a Curse as the consequence of too much easiness, does not seem to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Vice at all, but rather to forbid it: His very Leudness, in this place, is made moral and instructive.</p>
            <p>I am very glad our Author is in such Circumstances, in this Chapter, that he can bear the sight of that <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Syllable, Pox;</hi> and prevail with himself to write it at its full length. <hi>Non ita pridem.</hi> In Page 82. he loves his Love with a Pâbut no naming: That is not like a Cavalier.

            <p>These are the Words just as the Gentleman quotes'em; but why, or wherefore, he is not pleas'd to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for he says not one Syllable, for, nor against 'em: I suppose he thinks the Proof plain, and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence firm without a Coroborator.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will not forget, that these Instances are produc'd, to prove that I have encourag'd Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in my Plays. I thought the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, above-mentioned, had been a gentle Reproof to the Ladies that are addicted to railing; and since Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has not said that it <hi>must</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48600:53"/>
mean the contrary, I don't see why it may not be understood so still?</p>
            <p>I have now gone thorough with all Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Quotations; I have been as short as I could possibly in their Vindication; I have avoided all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations, and have not so much as made one Citation from any of my Plays in favour of them: Whatever they contain of Morality, or Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives against Folly and Vice, is no more than what ought to be in them; therefore I do not urge it as a Merit.</p>
            <p>My Business was not to paint, but to wash; not to shew Beauties, but to wipe off Stains.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has indeed given me an opportunity of reforming many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, by obliging me to a review of my own Plays.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48600:54"/>But I must affirm, that they are only Errors occasion'd by Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Inexperience, and that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of nothing that can make me liable to his Censure, or rather Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I am as ready to own the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages I have received from his Book, as to demonstrate the Wrongs; if I resent the latter, it is because they were intended me; and if I do not thank him for the other, it is because they were not: He would have poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd me, but he overdosed it, and the Excess of his Malice has been my Security.</p>
            <p>To give him his due, he seems every where to write more from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, than Opinion; he rails when he should reason; and for gentle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, uses scurrilous Reproaches. He looks upon his Adversaries to be his Enemies; and to justifie his Opinion in that Particular, before he has done with them,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48600:54"/>
he makes them so. If there is any Spirit in his Arguments, it evaporates and flies off unseen, thro' the heat of his Passion. His Passion does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make him appear in many Places to be in the wrong, but it also makes him appear to be conscious of it. That which shews the Face of Wit in his Writing, has indeed no more than the Face; for the Head is wanting. Wit is at the best but the <hi>Sign</hi> to good understanding; it is hung out to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Entertainment which may be found within: And it is very well when the Invitation can be made good. As the outward Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is Hypocrisie, which very often conceals Irreligion and Immorality; so is Wit also very often an Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, a Superficies glaz'd upon false Judgment, a good Face set on a bad Understanding.</p>
            <p>It is a Mask which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> sometimes wears, but it does not fit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48600:55"/>
the Mold of his Face; he presumes too much on the Security of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and very often ventures till he is discover'd: He does not know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Foreign Dress, and from thence concludes that no body else can. His Ancestor of honour'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, recorded in <hi>Aesop,</hi> miscarried thro' the same Self-sufficiency. Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> when he cloathed himself in the Lion's Skin, should have thought of an Expedient to have conceal'd his Ears: But, it may be, he is proud of them, and thinks it proper to shew that he has them <hi>both,</hi> and at their full length.</p>
            <p>He has put himself to some pain to shew his Reading; and his Reading is such, that it puts us to pain to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. He discovers an ill Taste in Books, and a worse Digestion. He has swallow'd so much of the Scum of Authors, that the overflowing of his own Gall was superfluous to make
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48600:55"/>
it rise upon his Stomach. But he ought in good Manners to have stept aside, and not to have been thus nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous and offensive to the Noses of the whole Country. But as his Reading would not stay with him, so his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ran away with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ben Iohnson,</hi> in his Discoveries, says, <hi>There be some Men are born only to suck</hi>

Something farther in the same Discoveries, He is speaking again very much to our purpose; for it is in justification of presenting vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and foolish Characters on the Stage in Comedy. It seems some People were angry at it then; let us compare his Picture of them, with<note place="margin">Iohns. Disc. <hi>P. 714.</hi>
               </note> the Characters of those who quarrel at it now. <hi>It sufficeth</hi> (says he) <hi>I</hi>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis strange that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> should oversee these two Passages, when he was simpling in the same Field where they both grow. This is pretty plain; because in the 51st Page of his Book he presents you with a Quotation from the same <hi>Discoveries,</hi> as one intire Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, tho' severally collected from the 706 and 717th Pages of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; so that he has read both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and beyond these Passages. But a Man that looks in a Glass often, walks away, and forgets his resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Vanity in pretending
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48600:56"/>
to Criticism, has extremely betray'd his Ignorance in the Art of Poetry; this is manifest to all that understand it. And methinks his Affectation of seeming to have read every thing, sometimes betrays him to Confessions that are not much to his Advantage.

strange number of Authors Names: But as <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Army of Two and thirty thousand was order'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Three hundred; so his rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Citations, without any loss to him, might be reduc'd to a much less number: But his Business is not <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> but <hi>Tumult.</hi> He appears like Captain <hi>Tom</hi> at the Head of a People that are shuffled together, neither the World, nor they, nor <hi>He,</hi> can tell why; but since they are met, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is the Word, and the Play-house is first to be demolish'd.</p>
            <p>He has outdone <hi>Bays</hi> in his grand Dance; nay, the Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in their Notions of the grand Chaos, never imagin'd a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.

not scatter'd elsewhere; for here I think they will hardly thrive.

            <p>I am not the only one who look on this Pamphlet of his to be a Gun le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd at the whole Laity, while the shot only glances on the Theatre; what he means by the Attack, or what may be its Consequences, I know not, and I suppose he cares not. <hi>Bellum inchoant inertes, fortes finiunt.</hi> But there are those who will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd at an occasion of making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations. With respect to his Parts, it is no wise thing to give any body an Example of searching into Books for negligent and foolish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.

Divines have sometimes forgot themselves in Controversial Writings; Disputes begun, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been begun on Points of Faith, have ended in scurrilous and personal Reflections; and from Tracts of Divinity, have degenerated into <hi>Pasquils</hi> and <hi>Lampoons.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> has laid the Foundation of such a Controversie, I think is apparent; but I hope his Credit is not sufficient to engage any body to go on with the Building.</p>
            <p>He has assaulted the Town in the Seat of their principal, and most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Pleasure. Down with the Theatre right or wrong. <hi>Delenda est Carthago,</hi> let the Consequence be what it will.

weak, and barbarous Piece of Policy.</p>
            <p>Persecution makes Men persevere in the right; and Persecution may make 'em persist in the wrong. Men may, by ill usage, be irritated some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to assert and maintain, even their very Errors. Perhaps there is a vicious Pride of triumphing in the worst of the Argument, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prevailing with the Vanity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; I cannot help thinking that our Author is not without his share of this Vanity. I think truly he had a fair appearance of Right on his side in the Title Page of his Book; but with reason I think I may also affirm, that by his mis-management he has very much weak'ned his Title. He that goes to Law for more than his Right, makes his Pretensions, even to that which is his Right, suspected; as a true Story loses its Credit, when rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Mouth of a known Liar.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s many false Citations,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48600:59"/>
make his true suspected; and his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of his true Citations, very much arraign both his Judgment and Sincerity. His Authorities from the Fathers (with all due respect to them) are certainly no more to the purpose, than if he had cited the two <hi>Attick</hi> Laws against the Licentiousness of the Old Comedy; in Truth not so much: For the Invectives of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were levell'd at the Cruelty of the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and the Obscenity of the <hi>Partomimes.</hi> If some of them have confounded the <hi>Drama</hi> with such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, it was an oversight of Zeal very allowable in those days; and in the Infaney of Christianity, when the Religion of the Heathens was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with their Poetry and Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral Representations; therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, then, might very well be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to frequent even the best of them. As for our Theatres, St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> knew no more of them,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48600:60"/>
than they did of the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. St.</hi> Aust. de Civ. Dei. l. 16. c. 9. &amp; Lact. de fals. Sap. 23.</note> they might with as much difficulty have been perswaded, that the former would in after-times be tolerated in a Christian State, as that the latter wou'd be receiv'd for a manifest and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Truth, and made intelligible to the Capacity of every Child.</p>
            <p>To what end has he made such a Bugbear of the Theatre? Why would he possess the Minds of weak and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick People with such frightful <hi>Ideas</hi> of a poor Play? Unless to sowre the humours of the People of most leisure, that they might be more apt to mis-employ their vacant hours. It may be there is not any where a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who should less be debarr'd of innocent Diversions, than the People of <hi>England.</hi> I will not argue this Point; but I will strengthen my Observation with one Parallel to it from <hi>Polybius;</hi> That excellent Author, who always moralizes in his History, and instructs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48600:60"/>
as faithfully as he relates; in his 4th Book, attributes the the Ruin of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethia</hi> by the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> in plain Terms, to their degeneracy from their <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Ancestors, in their neglect of Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral and Musical Performances. The <hi>Cynethians</hi> (says my Author) had their Situation the farthest <hi>North</hi> in all <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia;</hi> they were subjected to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement and uncertain Air, and for the most part cold and melancholick; and, for this reason, they of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should last have parted with the innocent and wholesome Remedies, which the Diversions of Musick admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to that sowrness of Temper, and sullenness of Disposition, which of necessity they must partake from the Disposition and Influence of their Climate; <q>For they no sooner fell to<note place="margin">

Manners, that their Crimes in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and measure surpass'd all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Greeks</hi> beside.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He gives us to understand, that their <hi>Chorus</hi>'s on the Theatres, their frequent Assemblies of young People, Men and Women, mingling in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Performances, were not institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Ancestors out of Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Luxury, but out of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; from a deliberated and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Policy, and for the Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove noted. Much more might be cited from <hi>Polybius,</hi> who has made a very considerable digression on this occasion.</p>
            <p>The Application of what I have borrow'd, is very plain. Is there in the World a Climate more uncertain than our own? And which is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Consequence, Is there any where a People more unsteady, more apt to discontent, more <hi>saturnine, dark,</hi> and <hi>melancholick</hi> than our selves? Are we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48600:61"/>
not of all People the most unfit to be alone, and most unsafe to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our selves? Are there not more Self-murderers, and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Lunaticks in <hi>England,</hi> heard of in one Year, than in a great part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> besides? From whence are all our Sects, Schisms, and innumerable Subdivisions in Religion? Whence our Plots, Conspiracies, and Seditions? Who are the the Authors and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of these things? Not they who frequent the Theatres and Consorts of Musick. No, if they had, it may be Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Invective had not been levell'd that way; his <hi>Gun-Powder-Treason</hi> Plot upon Musick and Plays (for he says <hi>Musick is as dangerous as</hi>
