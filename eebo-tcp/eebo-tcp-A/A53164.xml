            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I HAVE great Obligations to, and Honour for, my Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and am therefore concern'd for him in his preſent Condition: For though he finiſh'd his laſt Weſtern Campagn with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, this ſeems to have the Face of more Danger. His Enemys then being Incamped in ſtrong Walls with Irons on their Feet, but now in the Field with Iron in their Rebellious Hands. I underſtand his Lordſhip's great Loyal Soul reſolves to accompany His Majeſty in the Camp, and partake of his Hazards, and to that end his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has Prudently provided Two or Three Suits of ſtout Armour; but Madam theſe Rebels they ſay, are Plaguy, Impudent, Fighting Fellows, and will not fall before his Lordſhip's uſuall Shot of Rogues, Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls, Villains &amp;c: But will be apt to return Bullets in Anſwer, that may put him into great Fright, if they don't deſtroy him Some other proviſions therefore will be neceſſary, which perhaps his preſent Hurry may make him forget, and are proper for your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Care. I don't mean a Suit of Armour for his Conſcience, for that I Believe, is ſo fear'd and hardned, as to be proof as well againſt Bullets, as it is againſt all Sence of Honour, Juſtice, Religion, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. But Madam, it will be convenient for your Honour to provide him Five or Six Dozen of Double Clouts, and Two or Three Dozen of Drawers to keep him ſweet and clean; elſe he may ſtink in His Majeſty's Noſtrils, as he does already in Gods, and the whole Nations, and that you know Madam, will be unlike a Courtier, and may hazard the loſs of the Purſe. The Infirmity he ſhow'd in the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> when that Seditious Rabble, took him to Task, made me think this Advice ſeaſonable, that if his Lordſhip ſhould be taken by his Enemies, he might not be found Reeking in his Paſteries, as his Lordſhip found the Young P —</p>
