            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>DESCRIPTION</hi> of The <hi>TUBA STENTORO-PHONICA</hi> In different <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Dimenſions;</hi> TOGETHER WITH A brief <hi>ACCOUNT</hi> of what <hi>Tryals</hi> and <hi>Experiments</hi> have been made of them, both at Sea and Land.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt Inſtrument of this kind (though the Invention had been long before digeſted in my thoughts!) was by my directions made in Glaſs, in the Year 1670. and is deſcribed in <hi>Poniſm.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> A.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>Num.</hi> 1.</note> being about 2 Foot 8 Inches in length, the Diameter of the great end 11 Inches, and the Diameter of the little end 2 ½.</p>
            <p>In this Inſtrument I was heard ſpeaking at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance, by ſeveral Perſons, and they likewiſe were heard by me, and found that it did very conſiderably magnifie (or rather multiply) the Voice. Whereupon I cauſed another to be made in Braſs, about 4 Foot ½ in length, the Diameter of the greater end 12 Inches, and of the leſs, 2 Inches; as in <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>num.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>Num.</hi> 2.</note> is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. And for the better conveniency of opening and ſhutting the mouth without loſing any part of the breath (the loſs of a ſmall part whereof ſenſibly abates the lowdneſs of the voice) I cauſed the Mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece (deſcribed <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>num.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>Num.</hi> 3.</note>) to be made ſomewhat after the manner of Bellows, that ſo by opening and ſhutting, it might anſwer the motion of the mouth exactly, and yet be held ſo cloſe, that it might not loſe any part of the breath in ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Of this ſecond Inſtrument, there were two tryals made very ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park; where, at one time, the Lord <hi>Angier</hi> ſtanding by the Park wall near <hi>Goring-Houſe,</hi> heard me ſpeaking (and that very diſtinctly) from the end of the Mall near <hi>Old Spring-Garden:</hi> And at another time, His Majeſty, His Royal Highneſs, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and divers of the Nobility and Gentry, ſtanding at the end of the Mall near <hi>Old Spring-Garden,</hi> heard me ſpeaking (word for word) from the other end of the Mall, (though the wind were contrary;) which is 850 Yards, or near ½ of a meaſured <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile.</p>
            <p>Being much encouraged by theſe Tryals, and by His Majeſties moſt gracious approbation of the Invention, I reſolved to make ſome further Experiments of this Matter, and cauſed a third Inſtrument to be made

of Copper, in the form of an ordinary Trumpet, (as is deſcribed in <hi>Fig.</hi> B.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> B.</note>) the length 16 Foot 8 Inches, the Diameter of the great end 19 Inches, and of the little end 2 Inches.</p>
            <p>This Inſtrument I carried down below the Bridge (being accompanied with a Gentleman or two of my acquaintance) as far as a place called <hi>Cuckolds-point,</hi> and leaving it there in the hands of a Waterman, we Rowed down very near <hi>Deptford</hi>; and there, notwithſtanding the noiſe of Seamen and Carpenters in divers Ships both before and behind us, we heard very diſtinctly moſt words the ſaid Waterman ſpoke in it, whom we judged to be at leaſt a Mile and an half diſtant from us, and concluded that had the River been free from noiſe, we might have heard and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood much further.</p>
            <p>After that, I cauſed to be made a fourth Inſtrument of Copper (as is deſcribed <hi>Fig.</hi> C.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> C.</note>) about 21 Feet in length, the Diameter of the great end 2 Foot, and of the little end 2 ¼; and of the ſame Figure and Shape with the former, only it was more exactly wrought.</p>
            <p>I gave likewiſe directions at the ſame time (for variety ſake) for a fifth Inſtrument of Copper, the length whereof was 5 Foot 6 Inches, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the great end 21 Inches, and of the little end 2 Inches, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> D.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> D. <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> E.</note> As likewiſe for two ſmaller Inſtruments, whoſe length was each 5 Foot 6 Inches, the Diameter of the great end 10 Inches 1/<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and of the little end 1 Inch ⅙.</p>
            <p>The third and fourth of theſe Inſtruments were, at one Tryal, heard from off the River over againſt <hi>Faux-Hall,</hi> to the neareſt part of <hi>Batterſey</hi> over againſt <hi>Chelſey:</hi> And at another, from <hi>Hide-Park-Gate</hi> to <hi>Chelſey-Colledge</hi>; either of which diſtances was judged to be above a Mile and an half. And by what Tryals I have made of the two leaſt of all, I conceive they may maintain a conference, in a ſtill calm evening, at the leaſt three quarters of a meaſured Mile.</p>
            <p>After this, by His Majeſties ſpecial Command, the three largeſt of theſe Inſtruments were ſent to <hi>Deal</hi> Caſtle, and there ſeveral Tryals were made of them by the Honourable <hi>Francis Digby</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governour of that Caſtle; a particular Relation whereof was given under his own hand to the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> His Majeſties Principal Secretary of State, in a Letter bearing Date the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1671.

                  <p>SIr <hi>Samuel Morland</hi> having by the Kings Order ſent hither three of his new Speaking-Trumpets, I have found them, upon ſeveral Tryals to anſwer, if not exceed what could be expected from them; which I thought neceſſary to let your Lordſhip know, as the beſt way of ſatisfying His Majeſty concerning them. The firſt Experiment I made, was between <hi>Waumer</hi> Caſtle and <hi>Deal</hi> Caſtle, with the diſadvantage of a ſide Wind and ſome noiſe of the Sea, and yet we heard very diſtinctly from Caſtle to Caſtle, which are about a meaſured Mile aſunder. Since that I have tryed the biggeſt of the three, which is turned Trumpet-wiſe, and when the Wind blows from the Shore, we hear plainly off at Sea as far as the Kings Ships uſual ride, which is between two and three Miles. This we have done ſeveral times, but particularly ſome days ſince, we heard from the Caſtle, to Sir <hi>John Chichley</hi>'s Ship, which lay in the beſt of the Road. So that without queſtion, they will be of great uſe in all occaſions where it's neceſſary to give Orders or Intelligence at a diſtance; but moſt of all at Sea, where we can give and take the advantage of the Wind, as is beſt for hearing. We have found likewiſe, that by laying one of theſe Inſtruments to the Ear, the Words are heard more diſtinctly; and I am confident, there will be found ſeveral other ways of improving them to greater perfection, ſince the improvement has been ſo conſiderable at firſt.

            <head>A SHORT DISCOURSE Touching the <hi>Nature of Sounds,</hi> and the manner how (as I conceive) they are magnified, or rather multiplied by the <hi>Tuba Stentoro-Phonica.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not here engage my ſelf in any tedious Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Diſcourſe touching the Nature of <hi>Sounds,</hi> foraſmuch as I believe it equally myſterious with that of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Colours,</hi> and conſequently too fine and too ſubtil a thing for humane reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to comprehend.</p>
            <p>True it is, as to the act of Viſion, that by the help of curious Anatomiſts, we may trace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted Rays of viſible Objects (more or fewer in number as the <hi>Pupilla</hi> is dilated or contracted) through the ſeveral pellucid Tunicks and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Eye, till we find their Pictures or Images (their poſtures only inverted!) fairly lodg'd in the <hi>Tunica Retiformis.</hi> But how theſe Images or Repreſentations are afterwards tranſmitted to the reaſonable Soul? whether by the mediation only of that incredible number of <hi>Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamenta</hi> (or ſmall Threds) of which the Optick Nerve is compoſed? and if ſo, how the various percuſſions of the extremities of thoſe <hi>Capillaments</hi> in the <hi>Tunica Retina,</hi> are repeated by the other extremities of the ſame <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaments</hi> in the Brain? and how the Soul by contemplating the one, can diſcern the other, with ſo great a variety of Figures and Colours? Or whether that immortal Fire, in the act of Viſion, makes any uſe of the Animal Spirits (thoſe nimble <hi>Mercurys</hi> of which it has ſuch plentiful Repoſitories in the Ventricles of the Brain) to conduct the Species into its private Receſſes there, as ſhe does undoubtedly employ and ſend them forth in greater and leſſer numbers, to animate the Muſcles, and ſo give diverſities of Motions to our bodily and living Engins? And laſtly, what manner of Creatures thoſe little active Spirits are? and how they are commanded? and how they obey? is beſt known to the God of Nature, whoſe wonderful Workmanſhip we all are.</p>
            <p>In like manner, as to the Nature of Sounds and Voices; I muſt confeſs, that the circular Undulations of a Veſſel of Water, by the percuſſion of any part of its Superficies, and the reverberations of thoſe Undulations when they meet with oppoſition by the ſides of ſuch Veſſels, makes it ſeem more than probable, that the percuſſions of the Air by any Sound, ſpreads and dilates it ſelf by a ſpherical Undulation (greater, or leſs, according to the ſtrength and virtue of that percuſſion) till it meet with ſome oppoſition, and ſo echoes back again. And there

is great reaſon to believe that Voices being firſt modulated and articulated by the <hi>Glottis</hi> of the <hi>Larinx,</hi> and the ſeveral parts of the Mouth, make ſpherical Undulations in the Air, till they meet with the Acouſtick Organ, whoſe excellent Fabrick we may indeed with admiration contemplate, and give a gueſs for what Uſes each part was ordained, namely the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as likewiſe the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> together with the <hi>Malleus, Incus,</hi> and <hi>Stapes:</hi> But what manner of Images or Species ſuch Percuſſions make; with ſuch an infinity of diſtinctions and varieties? and how they fly about like Atoms in the Air? and are to be found in each point of the <hi>Medium?</hi> (and anon vaniſh into nothing?) and by what ſtupendious agility they are conveyed to the Soul? and how that does to receive ſo many millions of meſſages from without? and to diſpatch and ſend out as many more from within? and that in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time? the more we torment our thoughts about it, the leſs we underſtand it, and are forced to confeſs our Ignorance. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>All therefore that I ſhall adventure to ſay upon this Subject, is only to give the Reader a ſhort account of what Obſervations I have made, relating to this Inſtrument; and where I attempt to give a reaſon, it ſhall be with all ſubmiſſion to Men of greater Learning and better Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I do find that a ſmall Tube (as for example, that of an ordinary Trumpet) does not at all magnifie the Sounds, or Words, or Syllables; but on the contrary does much leſſen and diminiſh it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I do find it neceſſary, that the Diameter of the leaſt end of one of theſe Inſtruments muſt be equal to (if not greater then) the Diameter of the Orifice of the Speakers Mouth; and that what it wants of that, ſo much the leſs does the Inſtrument magnifie (or multiply) the Voice. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: I made 2 Mouth-pieces for the Inſtrument in <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> D. <hi>num.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and 4, 5, 6.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> D. <hi>Num.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and 4, 5, 6.</note> the Diameter of the middle part (2) was an Inch, and of (5) about ½ of an Inch, but found that the one did not magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ½, nor the other ¼ ſo much as the ſame Inſtrument with a Mouth-piece like unto that in <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>num.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> A. <hi>Num.</hi> 3.</note> And indeed it ſeems reaſonable, that the Mouth of Man being an Inſtrument that Nature has already fitted for the work; to apply to it an Orifice leſs than its own, is, in truth, to put a check to the motion of the Air and Breath, and conſequently to leſſen the Sound of the Voice.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I find that the Inſtrument muſt be enlarged by degrees, and not too ſuddenly. For Example: I made ſuch a one as in <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> D.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. <hi>Fig.</hi> D.</note> which did not magnifie the Voice in any proportion, as did thoſe in <hi>Fig.</hi> B, C, or E.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> B, C, E.</note> which I cannot attribute to any thing, but its not being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by degrees, as the others are; as by comparing their reſpective dimenſions will better appear.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the leaſt end, or rather the Mouth-piece of this Inſtrument, muſt be ſo applied and fitted to the Speakers Mouth, that no Air or Breath be loſt, and yet that the Mouth have free liberty of opening and ſhutting, that ſo the Articulation be entirely preſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47046:6"/>
               <figure>
                  <head>ICONISMUS II.</head>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47046:6"/>V. I do find by divers Experiments, that the <hi>Polyphoniſmus</hi> (that is to ſay, the <hi>Focus,</hi> or Point where the Voice is moſt magnified or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied) is the Center of its greater Orifice, as in <hi>Iconiſm.</hi> 2. <hi>Lit.</hi> B.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icon.</hi> 2. <hi>Lit.</hi> B.</note> And from that point, to the Center of the leaſt Orifice (which is indeed the whole length of the Axis) it is magnified leſs and leſs, in proportion, as the Diameter is ſhortened.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. I find, that the turning and winding of this Inſtrument, either Trumpet-wiſe, or in any other Circular Figure, does not at all prejudice it: On the contrary, I do believe it rather ſtrengthens and confirms the Voice.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I humbly conceive (with ſubmiſſion to better judgments) that the Voice, as it is tranſmitted through this Inſtrument (A B C D) from the Mouth A, endeavours all the way, to ſpread and dilate it ſelf by ſpherical Undulations; but finding oppoſition on every ſide, makes a percuſſion in every point of each imaginary Circle of the Tube, <hi>viz.</hi> V V, T T, S S, R R, Q Q, P P, O O, N N, M M, L L, K K, C D, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo reundulates back to the reſpective Centers of every ſuch imaginary Circle; That is to ſay, The Circle Q Q to its Center <hi>c</hi>; The Circle P P to its Center <hi>b</hi>; The Circle O O to its Center <hi>a</hi>; The Circle N N to its Center <hi>z</hi>; The Circle M M to its Center Y; The Circle C B to its Center B, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, it is to be ſuppoſed, that the Percuſſion in the Circle Q Q being reundulated to the Center <hi>c,</hi> makes there a much ſtronger per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion than that which was made in any ſingle point or part of the Circle Q Q, foraſmuch as it may be preſumed, that all the percuſſions that were made in the Circle Q Q are now united in the Center <hi>c</hi>; and that this percuſſion in the Center <hi>c</hi> would again ſpread and dilate it ſelf by a ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Undulation; but meeting with oppoſition in every point of the Tube (ſuppoſe η η) an entire Cone of imaginary Rays of Sound, of which <hi>c</hi> η and <hi>c</hi> η are two, are reverberated to ſome Center (ſuppoſe it <hi>b</hi>) in the ſame manner as the Rays of the Sun are reverberated from a poliſh'd Superficies of a parabolical Concave to its proper <hi>Focus</hi>; Of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation I had a fair Experiment, in a <hi>parabolical</hi> Concave of fine Pewter, which I cauſed to be made in the Year 1670. by a very exact Workman, and found that in the very ſame <hi>Focus,</hi> where the Rays of the Sun were ſo united, that in a minute of time they ſet on Fire a Deal Board, was the Voice of a man ſpeaking near it, ſenſibly magnified. So that after the ſame manner an entire Cone of Rays, of which <hi>b</hi> ψ, <hi>b</hi> ψ, are two, muſt be ſuppoſed to be reverberated to ſome Center (ſuppoſe <hi>a</hi>; for in this Figure it was not poſſible to obſerve Geometrically the Angles of Incidence and Reflection, without confounding the other more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Lines and Figures.) And ſo a <hi>Cone</hi> of Rays, of which W O+ and W O+ are two, are united in their Center or <hi>Focus,</hi> ſuppoſe B, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that there ſeems to be throughout this Inſtrument A B C D an united force as well of Reverberations, as of Reundulations, which beget a a kind of <hi>Focus</hi> in every point of the imaginary Axis A B: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Tube enlarges it ſelf, and the Circles both of Reundulation and Reverberation become greater, there muſt needs be imagined
<pb facs="tcp:47046:7"/>
               <figure>
                  <head>ICONISMUS II.</head>
               </figure>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47046:7"/>
a greater number of reundulating Circles, and reverberating Rays to meet in each reſpective Center and <hi>Focus,</hi> whereby the ſame Voice is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly magnified and augmented.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if this Inſtrument A B C D were cut off in the points M M, it would not magnifie ⅛ of what it does at the whole length, which I have ſufficiently experimented, and am entirely ſatisfied therein.</p>
            <p>And as to the points of Reundulation and Reverberation, my opinion was very much confirmed to me by a late Experiment I made with a Veſſel of Quickſilver, of the ſame Figure with this <hi>Iconiſmus</hi> H E G F I, in the midſt whereof were ſmall thin Hoops, or pieces of wood bent and fixed in the ſame Figure as is C K O V A V O K D, being cloſed at the end A, and open at the end C D. Into this Veſſel I put Quickſilver enough to cover the whole Figure, and conſequently the Figure A B C D. And then ſtriking the Quickſilver ſmartly in A with the end of a ſtick, it begot a numberleſs number of Curvilineal Undulating and Reundulating Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, not unlike to the Figures V V, T T, S S, R R, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the point A, to the point B, which were reverberated from the ſides A N C, and A N D, as they were driven along one by another.</p>
            <p>This Experiment, together with another which I lately made, by carrying one Ear along the Line E F and W G, with what exactneſs I poſſibly could, whilſt a Gentleman did me the favour to read ſome pages of a Book, with an even tone, in each of the four Inſtruments B, C, D, and E, in <hi>Iconiſm.</hi> 1. ſeparately and diſtinctly: At which time I plainly found, that as my Ear advanced towards the point B, the Voice was ſenſibly magnified; but as it was removed towards W, it was ſomewhat abated; and as it was removed either towards C, D, or G, it was abated two, three, four, five, ſix, and more degrees; made me conclude for certain, that in every point of the imaginary Axis there is a <hi>Focus</hi> or <hi>Polyphoniſmus,</hi> but that the principal and chiefeſt <hi>Focus</hi> where the greateſt <hi>Polyphoniſmus</hi> of all is, that is to ſay, the point where the Voice is moſt of all magnified or multiplied; is B.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Focus</hi> (or <hi>Polyphoniſmus)</hi> being now no longer impriſoned in the Tube, dilates it ſelf by ſpherical Undulations into the <hi>Medium</hi> (as in <hi>Icon.</hi> 2. may more plainly appear) till ſuch time as it meets with ſome oppoſition; as for example, let us ſuppoſe it in the points H, E, G, F, I, from which points, and innumerable others, it is reundulated, multiplied, and reverberated throughout the Sphere of its activity: For by how much ſtronger the percuſſion is in B, ſo much greater is the Sphere of Undulation and Reverberation, and conſequently the Voice is heard at a greater diſtance.</p>
            <p>And that ſuch Reundulations and Reverberations do exceedingly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie or multiply Sounds, I cannot but recommend to the Readers contemplation, a famous Experiment made in the Year of Our Lord 1615. by one <hi>Bernardus Varenius</hi> (a ſober and learned Writer) as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf relates it in his <hi>Geographia Generalis, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 41. who, after he had with much pains and difficulty climb'd up to the top of <hi>Carpathus,</hi> a Mountain of <hi>Hungary,</hi> (whoſe perpendicular height he judged to be

a <hi>German</hi> Mile, and above all Winds and Motions of the Air) he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a Piſtol, which made at firſt no greater noiſe, than if he had ſnapt a ſtick in ſunder; till after ſome ſmall ſpace of time, being dilated, it waxed greater and ſtronger, and filled the Woods and Dales beneath. But deſcending through the annual Snows, towards the lower part of the Mountain, he diſcharged a ſecond time, and the noiſe was ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that it exceeded the Report of the greateſt Cannon; inſomuch that he feared leſt the whole Mountain would have fallen with him. This noiſe laſted about ⅛ of an hour, till it had been multiplied and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated from the moſt abſtruſe Caverns of the Mountain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is better expreſſed in the Authors own words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Varen Geograph. Gen. l.</hi> 1. <hi>prop.</hi> 41.</note>

            </p>
            <p>So that from this Experiment of <hi>Varenius,</hi> we are to conclude with him, That the percuſſion of the Air made by the firſt diſcharging of his Piſtol on the utmoſt top and ſharpeſt point of the Mountain, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a ſpherical Undulation, and meeting with no Objects to reun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulate it, was at the firſt ſcarcely heard by him who diſcharged it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſecond Report, being nearer to the Caverns and Woods beneath, were ſuddenly and prodigiouſly multiplied and reverberated.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. But in the laſt place, as to the demonſtrative part of this <hi>Tuba Stentoro-Phonica,</hi> together with the exact Figure and Dimenſions of it, That is to ſay,
<q>
                  <l>"What is that Right-lined, Curvilineal, or mixt</l>
                  <l>"Figure? And what are its exact Dimenſions?</l>

                  <l>"Syllables, Words, and Sentences?</l>
               </q>
is a new <hi>Problem,</hi> which I humbly propoſe to the learned Philoſophers, and Criticks of this our Age, as a thing that merits their Studies and Contemplations, hoping that ſome one or other of them, either at his own, or his Princes charge, may happily find a way how it may be clearly ſolved and demonſtrated, whereby the Invention may come to be of greater uſe and benefit to Mankind, than from this firſt Adventure of mine could reaſonably be expected.</p>

And if that be ſo ſtrong, that but one of the Ships can have any opportunity of ſpeaking with the Wind, the other may anſwer by ſigns, though directly againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In a Storm, it is of great uſe in a ſingle Ship, that one mans Voice giving Orders for governing and ſteering the Veſſel, may be heard diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all the Mariners. Of which His Majeſty, who perfectly underſtands all Maritine Affairs, is ſo ſenſible, that He has already given order for ſome of theſe Inſtruments of the ſmaller ſize (as judging them moſt uſeful) to be made and put into ſeveral of His Royal Ships. And it is to be believed, that when the uſe of them ſhall be more publickly known, few Ships (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men of War or Merchant-men) will go to Sea without them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In Calm weather, an Admiral may give Orders to his whole Fleet, though they lay two or three miles about, without ſending out Boats and Meſſengers from Ship to Ship.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In caſes of great Expedition, Orders may be given from ſuch Forts as the Caſtle of <hi>Deal, &amp;c.</hi> to any one or all the Ships riding in the Road. And if it be a matter of ſecrecy, it may be ſpoken in Cypher, being before hand agreed on between the Governour of ſuch a Caſtle, and the Admiral or chief Commander aboard thoſe Ships.</p>

IN caſe a Town or City be Beſieged, and ſo cloſe girt about, that there can be no meſſage ſent in; by this Inſtrument at one, two, or three miles diſtance, they may be told that there is Relief coming, and what number, and when they are to expect them, and how they are to behave themſelves upon their approach; and this by ſpeaking in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47046:9"/>
Cypher, as is before mentioned. And ſo on the contrary, may the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers make as good uſe of this Inſtrument to threaten and diſcourage the Beſieged, not only the Officers and Souldiers on the Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, but all the People and Inhabitants, how great and ſpacious ſoever the Town or City be.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A General may himſelf ſpeak to his whole Army, though forty or fifty thouſand men or more, either to give Orders to his Commanders and Officers, or to encourage and put life into his common Souldiers.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Whereas now a Herald at Arms making a Proclamation, though of never ſo great concernment and importance, can ſcarcely be heard by above thirty or forty Standers-by; by the help of this Inſtrument he may be heard very diſtinctly by many thouſands. And the Caſe is almoſt the ſame in ſuch Courts of Judicature as the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in <hi>Weſtminster-Hall, &amp;c.</hi> where many of His Majeſties Subjects are puniſht for not hearing the Call of the Common Cryer, further, and beyond the ſphere of activity of the ſaid Cryer's ſpeaking Organ.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. An Overſeer of Works, of what kind ſoever, may by this give Orders to many hundreds of Workmem, without once removing his ſtation.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In caſe of great Fires, where uſually all people are in a hurry, the Officers and Commanders may by this Inſtrument ſo govern the Aſſiſtants, as to prevent diſorder and confuſion, and conſequently may ſave a Town or City from periſhing.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. In caſe a number of Thieves and Robbers attaque a Houſe that is lonely, and far from Neighbours, by ſuch an Inſtrument as this, may all the Dwellers round about, within the compaſs of a Mile or more, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately informed, upon whoſe Houſe ſuch an attaque is made, the number of Thieves or Robbers, how armed and equipped, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons, with the colour and faſhion of their Habits, and by what way they have made their eſcape, with any ſuch like circumſtances; whereby they would certainly know, with what ſtrength to come upon thoſe Houſe-breakers, where readily to find them, or which way to purſue them. No particular whereof can be performed by either Drum, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, Bell, or any other Engin or Inſtument, hitherto in uſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many more may be the Advantages of this New Inſtrument, as it is already invented: And I do not doubt, but were the Dimenſions of the <hi>Fig.</hi> C. in <hi>Icon.</hi> 1. ſufficiently enlarged, it might render a Voice audible at the leaſt eight or ten Miles, either at Sea or Land, with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Wind. And what further additions to, and improvements of this Invention may hereafter, by the Art and Induſtry of Ingenious and Learned Men, be found out, Time and Experience will better ſhew. In the mean time, if the World ſhall kindly accept theſe my firſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, it will be an Encouragement to me hereafter to produce others.</p>
