         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN compliance with your deſire, (to which I can
hardly refuſe any thing) I have ſent you this
Sermon. I know 'tis the noiſe has been made
about it that prompts your curioſity to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. It had indeed the good fortune to be
favourably received by an Auditory, which (I need not
tell you) is one of the moſt learned and judicious perhaps
in the whole World. But yet on the other hand it has
met with as ill luck, to be moſt unjuſtly miſrepreſented
by ſome of the Romiſh Communion, who have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon its account to tax me as guilty of ſome ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
deſign to amuſe the people with Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of Popery, and thereby diſpoſe them for thoſe evils
that are ordinarily conſequent upon ſuch prepoſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>I was indeed much ſurpriſed and troubled to ſee ſuch
a ſtrange gloſs put upon it and me. And had I but
foreſeen that it could have been liable to any ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction,
I had rather chus'd even to ſuppreſs a
<pb facs="tcp:94350:3"/>
Zeal, which otherwiſe was certainly very ſeaſonable,
and altogether neceſſary for my own particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
than have given the very remoteſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for any to entertain ſuch bad thoughts of me; my
Loyalty being as dear to me as my Religion, becauſe
I reckon that I cannot have the one without the other.</p>
            <p>But there cannot be any thing more viſible, than
that the exhortatory part of that Diſcourſe (at which
the great Scandal was taken) was levelled merely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a voluntary defection; I mean, ſuch a falling
away from the true Religion, as it wrought by other
enticements than thoſe which Truth it ſelf uſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
For it is moſtly expreſt in the words of the
Apoſtle, applied in his very ſenſe and meaning, and
upon the like occaſion. And ſure none will ſay that
he had any ſeditious Deſign when he wrote his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
Beſides, are not all the Arguments upon which
it is founded, evidently of ſuch a nature that they
ſuppoſe the whole affair to depend upon the Liberty of
every bodies own Will, without the leaſt ſyllable that
can inſinuate or ſuggeſt any external violence to be
done unto our Religion, or any thing to be impoſed upon
us as to it? And he would have treated his Theme ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
impertinently, that had ſuch a wicked deſign in his
view, had he ſpoke at no other rate than I did. Why
then ſhould ſuch an exhortation be reputed apt to allarm
the People, and prepare them for Tumulis and Rebellion,
when thereby they could not be rendred jealous of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but their own ſelves; ſince none elſe was ſuppoſed to
deprive them of their Religion? And if Miniſters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exhort their Auditory conſtantly to adhere to their
Religion, without becoming criminal upon that account,
<pb facs="tcp:94350:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then why ſhould they be allowed to preach againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
at all? For the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe muſt needs always follow the
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But farther, You'll ſee that the Sermon is as bitter
againſt the Fanatical Principles and Methods, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Popery it ſelf; and that it does commend our
Religion as much for its <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as for its <hi>Truth.</hi>
So that unleſs People would be ſo very diſingenuous, as
to follow their Preacher onely where he ſeems moſt to
pleaſe and tickle their Humours, (and ſo not he, but
they onely would be to blame,) there could be no fear
of any diſloyal apprehenſions to be raiſed by ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
Why then ſhould the moſt uncharitable ſenſe
be made of one part, and ſuch too as it flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by another? This is truly to take things by
the wrong handle.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially ſince, as you can bear Witneſs, I have
always been as much an Enemy to all manner of Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,
as ever I was to Popery. And I bleſs God I was
educated in ſuch Principles by a Father, who in the
late Troubles was a conſiderable Sufferer for them, that
to this very hour I never knew what it was to have the
leaſt Kindneſs for any thing that but looked diſloyal. And
it has been much my buſineſs in my preſent Charge to
preach up Loyalty, and to perſuade my Hearers to reſt
ſecurely in the Royal Promiſe for their Religion. My
great Zeal in this, and particularly expreſt in that
Sermon I preached on the twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi> laſt, and
allowed to be printed in the very time of thoſe infamous
Rebellions that then were raging, did expoſe me ſo
much to the fury and malice of that bloud-thirſty and
<pb facs="tcp:94350:4"/>
murthering Crew, as that ever ſince I have been thoug<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
unſafe even in my own houſe. Why ſhould I then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as any-wiſe ill affected to the Government,
or diſpoſed to eſpouſe the Popular humour? And muſt
now one Sermon againſt Popery make me be ſuſpected
to be ſo? Should not rather the whole tenour of my
life be the Expoſitor of that Diſcourſe, than any other
conſiderations that are but extrinſick to it, and relate
onely to the timing of the thing; whereas the Apoſtle
bids us preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon? And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when one of the chief grounds for which I am
diſſatisfied with Popery, is, becauſe I certainly know
that it is of diſloyal Principles, and vaſtly prejudicial
to the Rights of Princes, how much ſoever the contrary
be alledged by thoſe among us, who in their preſent
circumſtances find it their intereſt to juggle in the
matter?</p>
            <p>Neither can it ever be imagined that now to Preach
againſt that Religion, does practically contradict thoſe
Principles. For his Majeſty himſelf (whom God bleſs
and long preſerve) has been ſo far from ſhewing that
he thinks ſo, that in his Gratious Letter to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among us, he aſſures us, that, as nothing has a
greater tendency to ſecure our Privileges and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
than the aggrandizing his Power and Authority;
ſo he propoſes no other end for maintaining it in its
greateſt luſtre, than to be the more enabled to defend
and protect our Religion as eſtabliſhed by Law, and
all our Rights and Properties. So that to aſſert and
vindicate our Religion, and to ſhew the falſeneſs of
that which now ſtands moſt in competition with it,
ſeem'd to me exactly to comply with the deſign of the
<pb facs="tcp:94350:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King; for which we have the greateſt reaſon in the
world to be gratefull and loyal.</p>
            <p>But they go farther than this, and, according to
what is objected by a late Pamphleteer, ſay that the
preaching againſt Popery, ſo as to render it odious to
the People, is ill ſervice done to his Majeſty, becauſe
manifeſtly tending to alienate the hearts of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and incenſe the Rabble, whoſe ungratious temper
cannot love the Perſon, whilſt they hate the Religion
of the Prince.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, I never rais'd any more odious conſequence
againſt Popery, than this is againſt us. But we never
thought that any, who pretend to be his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
would have dar'd to do him ſo ill ſervice, as to
drive the affair to this height. For at this rate they
render it Leaſing-making and Leſe-Majeſty, to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Popery at all. Becauſe no Proteſtant can ſpeak
againſt it, but he muſt call it ſuch a Religion as is not
the ſafe way to Salvation. Otherwiſe he behov'd to
embrace it, and be Papiſt himſelf. Since there is but
one Religion, that as ſuch can lead one to Heaven, and
he is obliged to be of that. But according to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
the charging Popery with any odious thing, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which nothing can be more ſo than what is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable)
tends to alienate the hearts of his Majeſty's
Subjects from him, and to beget in them a hatred of
his Perſon. And ſure to do any thing that has ſuch a
tendency, is as horrid a Treaſon and Villany as is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
Wherefore I do appeal to all the World,
if ever there was any thing of a greater tendency to
alienate the hearts of his Majeſty's Subjects from him,
<pb facs="tcp:94350:5"/>
than for the Papiſts thus to ſcrue up the quarrel about
Religion, till it become one of the Crown, and to muzzle
up our Mouths from uttering one ſyllable againſt Popery,
whatever the buſie Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould ſay in
behalf of it? For if <hi>the fears of Popery be very apt
to produce the greateſt miſchiefs,</hi> as certainly they are,
then queſtionleſs the drawing ſuch conſequences from our
owning our Religion, and ſhewing how falſe that great
Rival Popery is, (which neceſſarily we muſt do if we
own our own Religion) muſt be very apt to produce theſe
evils; there being nothing more apt to engender thoſe
fears, than thus to carry the matter to ſo dreadfull an
event.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be God, we know abundantly that theſe
pragmatical Gentlemen do run without a Commiſſion,
and that his Gratious Majeſty himſelf has no ſuch
thoughts of us, as they have. And we hope there is
no ground for any to have them. For the reaſon why
that Gentleman imagines, that the hearts of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Subjects are thus alienated from him, is, becauſe
they cannot love the Perſon, whilſt they hate the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Prince. Truly I would not have thought
that any Papiſt ſhould have been ſo little conſiderate,
as to own and declare that Principle, That the People
cannot love the Perſon, whilſt they hate the Religion of
the Prince. For this is a plain confeſſion, and not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular
either, that ſince Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days there has
not been a Prince among us loved by his Popiſh Subjects;
and that in all times coming no Proteſtant Prince can
ever expect any of their affection or kindneſs. And it
is certain, that, as the Prieſts and Jeſuits have made
it their buſineſs to render Proteſtanc as yodious and
<pb facs="tcp:94350:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abominable as it was poſſible for them to doe, ſo they will
always continue to do ſo. What then has become of all
the Popiſh Loyalty that has been ſo much talkt of? And
are not Proteſtant Kings in a brave and glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when they have Popiſh Subjects? But what if
<hi>Britain</hi> were as much Popiſh as now it is the contrary,
and a Proteſtant King were ruling over it, would he
not have a pretty Tenure for his Crown? And would
theſe Gentlemen ſpeak ſo in ſuch a caſe? Indeed too
much fondneſs, without any ground at all, has made
them very far alter their Dialect of late. Though at
leaſt Policy and Prudence ſhould reſtrain them from
ſuch Arguments. For we hope they will not be ſo bold
as to ſay but that their preſent circumſtances may be
changed, and that <hi>Britain</hi> may have a Proteſtant Prince
again; although it is our Prayers (as fervently and
zealouſly as 'tis any Papiſts) that we may enjoy our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Great One reigning over us, till he ſhall have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
all his Predeceſſours, as much in Years, as in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But moreover, I would ask theſe Gentlemen whether
or no they think that the Primitive Chriſtians were but
very cold to their Princes, nay that they went ſo far
as even to hate their Perſons, becauſe they were not of
their Religion? Sure I am they will not ſay but that
it was their Duty to do otherwiſe. And if it was their
Duty, ſure they will be ſo charitable to them, as to
think they did not prevaricate in it. So that Chriſtian
Subjects not onely ought to love the Perſon of their
Prince, even out of mere Duty, whatever be the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Religion between them; but we muſt preſume
that they have actually done ſo, there being nothing to
recommend thoſe Princes unto them, but onely that they
were ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94350:6"/>
But when we have a King whoſe Perſonal Excellencies
are as vaſt as his Title is, and whoſe Goodneſs to us
(and eſpecially manifeſted in allowing us the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of our Religion, according to the full extent of all
the Laws we have in the behalf of it,) is as great as
either: And ſo when the Ingenuity of our rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the moſt preſſing gratitude, together with the
higheſt Duty, ties us as with a threefold cord, that
cannot eaſily be broken, to love and admire him, and to
devote our Lives and Fortunes to His Service: His
Proteſtant Subjects (and theſe are all the three Nations
almoſt) muſt be firſt repreſented as worſe than Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blas
and Devils, before they can be imagined to be
guilty of the contrary; And the Miniſters muſt be lookt
upon as the baſeſt and uglieſt Monſters that ever deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that Name, before they can be ſuppoſed to deſign
the preaching them into the being ſo.</p>
            <p>Wherefore notwithſtanding all that theſe Gentlemen
can doe or ſay, we will love him as our Happineſs, as
our Glory, as our Defence, as the very breath of our
Noſtrils, and as the Anointed of the Lord, and as much
as they for their Hearts and Souls can do, though we
have reaſon to con them our Thanks for having extorted
this competition from us.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, their miſtake in all this lies here, that it
is ſuppoſed that whatever is charged on the Religion, as
it is abſtractly conſidered, is likewiſe directed to the
Perſons of thoſe who profeſs it. And as nothing can be
more malitious than to ſuggeſt this, ſo neither could any
thing be more unjuſt: For whoever among us ſaid, that
<pb facs="tcp:94350:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will inevitably incur thoſe
conſequences whereof we challenge the Religion it ſelf?
God forbid that we ſhould. And I am very certainly
perſuaded that there are many good and juſt, vertuous
and devout perſons in that Communion; and that thoſe
circumſtances which I preſume they do invincibly lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
are not prejudicial to that ſincere intention for the
Manner, and thoſe fundamental Doctrines and Laws for
the Matter, of their Piety, which they may enjoy in
that Church. But yet we muſt ſay that all this good
comes not by virtue of any thing of Popery as ſuch.
And that thus to diſtinguiſh is very reaſonable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from this, that the Papiſts themſelves do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſame Method in diſpenſing their Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us. So that in this caſe we form a twofold judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
one directed to the Religion it ſelf, which is the
judgment of ſtrict arguing; and another to the Perſons
of thoſe who are of that Religion, which is the judgment
of Charity. And the Conſequences of the one do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infer, nor claſh with, thoſe of the other. And
thus the way of ſpeaking of Things, without involving
the Perſons to whom they belong, has obtained to be
common in the World. And without a new regulation of
Speech were firſt indtroduced, ſuch a Conſtruction of
ſpeaking againſt Popery, as theſe Gentlemen fanſie, can
never be made, nor ſuch conſequences follow upon it.</p>
            <p>And here I would have you take notice that there
is a great difference between the preaching what has
any proper tendency to poſſeſs the people with Fears and
Jealouſies of Popery, (which without all doubt is very
prejudicial to the Government, and as ſuch ought to be
utterly abſtained from;) and what onely repreſents Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
<pb facs="tcp:94350:7"/>
as a thing falſe and odious in it ſelf, without any
direct or indirect inſinuation that it will be impoſed upon
us. For the firſt does palpably reflect upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
themſelves, and levels all that is odious, not at
their Religion ſo much as at their Temper and Perſons:
whereas the ſecond abſtracts wholly from the Perſon,
and ſtrikes merely at the Religion; and does onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by way of Argument and Perſuaſion to prevail with
thoſe who are of that Religion, to forſake it, and with
thoſe who are not, never to embrace it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it would ſeem that theſe Gentlemen do
principally aim at this, <hi>viz.</hi> To have our People led
back again to as great an ignorance as was that from
which the Reformation reſcued them, and as is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſary for their deſigns of wheedling them over
to Popery. For either they underſtand their Religion
ſufficiently already, and need not be inſtructed by any
Preacher; and then, though there were never a word
of Popery in all <hi>Britain,</hi> but what the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do ſpeak, yet (according to that Principle which
theſe Gentlemen make uſe of) they would be as much
diſpoſed to hate the Perſon, becauſe of the Religion of
the Prince, as when the Pulpits did thunder never ſo
loudly againſt it; becauſe in that caſe they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and know all the ill things of it, that were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to render it odious unto them. Or elſe there is need
that the Preachers ſhould both inſtruct and exhort their
Hearers, and as the Apoſtle ſays, tell the ſame things
over and over again; and then to have them ſilenced from
preaching againſt Popery, as theſe Gentlemen would have
them, were to have the People left quite to themſelves,
till by degrees they ſhould become ignorant enough for
<pb facs="tcp:94350:7"/>
their purpoſe. And ſo in a few years Proteſtancy would
wear out of its own accord.</p>
            <p>But after all this, I am very far from thinking that
Miniſters ſhould treat the Popiſh Religion more harſhly
than mere neceſſity requires them to do; eſpecially ſince
they ſee that ſome people are pleaſed to make ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions,
and to draw ſuch conſequences. It is true I
have endeavoured in this Sermon to ſhew how far the
conſequences of Popery in ſome caſes do amount. But
never having heard that this gave offence, I thought I
had the liberty to manage my Subject to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
I could. And unleſs thoſe who are content that we
ſhould preach againſt Popery, would ſtint and limit the
ſcope of our Conſequences, how ſhould we know where to
ſtop? For 'tis rare to find any Man undertake the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a thing, but he will even naturally be led on to
impeach it of all the evil that can render it odious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he ſees himſelf ſufficiently furniſhed with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to make out his charge.</p>
            <p>But I bleſs God, that as there is no Man upon earth
that I entertain any malitious thought againſt, ſo I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found my ſelf much enclined to render things more
odious than I was convinced that really they were. And
with all my heart I could wiſh that the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Popiſh Religion and ours were brought to as
narrow a compaſs, and to as fair an accommodation, as
is poſſible. Neither ſhall it ever be my deſign to widen
them. But the truth on't is, how to make up one of both,
is a thing I could never underſtand, the Extreames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at too great a diſtance to be ever brought to one
Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94350:8"/>
But what ſhall we ſay of the Conſequences which the
Papiſts do endeavour to draw from our Religion? That
fore-cited Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>Popery Anatomiz'd,</hi>
expreſly charging all the Rebellions that have been ſince
the Forty-one, upon this bleſſed Principle, (as in his
Drollery he is pleaſed to call it) that every Man muſt
be allowed a judgment of Diſcretion to reade and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Scripture for himſelf, ſo as not to pin his
Religion on the ſleeve of the Church. I wonder what
can be more odious againſt Popery in all my Sermon.
But how very groſs, and abſurd, and ridiculous, and
monſtrous, and abominable the Writers for <hi>Rome</hi> have
ſtudied to repreſent our Religion, is as well known, as is
the Sun in the firmament.</p>
            <p>As for the alledged virulency of my ſtyle, you'll ſee,
Sir, by the Sermon it ſelf, that there is not one expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in it but what has been commonly uſed by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of theſe Controverſies upon which it treats. And
the Authour of the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> is in ſeveral
places content to take with as hard language, if ſuch or
ſuch things be made out againſt him: which I think
clearly done already. So that if the Reaſons be good,
they juſtifie the ſeverity of the Terms, for then things
are only called by their proper Names. And who ſhould
be angry that they are ſo?</p>
            <p>Yet I am ſo far from approving any ſcurrilous or
ſcolding Language in the handling of Controverſies, or
in publick Sermons, that I have ever been much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
againſt thoſe Books and Diſcourſes that are loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with it. And ſo long as good manners can be kept
<pb facs="tcp:94350:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up without any injury done to the Truth, certainly there
can be no ſuch ingenuous pleaſure in venting ſome Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
wit, as to be more prevalent with any ſober Man
than they can be. And therefore in all the occaſions I
ſhall have to deal with Popery, I am reſolved never to
aſſault it ſo much with hard Words, as hard Arguments,
being too well furniſhed with the one to need run for any
recourſe unto the other.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, what touched the Loyalty of the Sermon
was not all. For it is alſo ſaid to be wholly ſtuff'd with
Lies and Calumnies. It is good luck I ſtand not here
alone, it being now the common cry that Popery is Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented.
And we no ſooner unveil the Myſtery, but
the Papiſts proteſt againſt Proteſtant Popery. And it
is called our ordinary artifice to keep up our People, to
draw the moſt ugly, and ſo moſt falſe characters of that
Religion, which we can only ſcold at, but not refute. It
is pretty indeed to ſee the chaſe ſo turned. For the
<hi>piae fraudes</hi> were wont to be as much the profeſſed as
peculiar Doctrine and Practice of their own Church. We
thank God ours needs no ſuch Supporters. And our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours
are not ſo much kept in ignorance as to be eaſily
impos'd upon. And now, Sir, you have the Sermon.
And if it appear not by it, that whatever I have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them withall, is, if not the direct Doctrine of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> yet at leaſt the moſt common ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Doctors, and that all my Deductions are
truly conſequential and juſt, then I ſhall willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your cenſure, which will be more ſevere to me
than any that my avowed enemies can inflict.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94350:9"/>
Now, Sir, to complete all, it is ſaid that I ſhould
have been civil to a Religion I was once of. 'Tis true,
I went abroad about nine years ago, ſcarcely being then
of Age, and very unſetled in my judgment, and unripe
in my Reaſon: and then I was abuſed by the Sophiſtry
of ſome Jeſuits, ſeveral unlucky circumſtances concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to favour their ill deſigns upon me. And thus I
continued with them till towards three years, that
through the mercy of God I was brought back again to
that pure and reaſonable Religion from which I had ſo
fooliſhly Apoſtatiz'd. And indeed I was not long at
<hi>Rome</hi> when I began to diſcover what a lamentable
change I had made. For to any ingenuous Man there
can hardly be a more convincing demonſtration, than
that Ocular one which is daily to be ſeen there. So that
if Papiſts will deal prudently with their new Proſelytes,
they'll be very wary to ſend them too ſoon unto that
place.</p>
            <p>But in all this my caſe was but ſuch, as if one in
a violent Fever ſhould through his raving diſtemper cry
out that he was a Papiſt; but ſo ſoon as he recovered
his ſenſes and judgment again, would ſcarcely believe
he was ever ſo wonderfully tranſported by his diſeaſe,
and was mightily aſtoniſhed, that even in thoſe Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms
he could run ſo far beſide himſelf. Now why ſhould
either they have any thing to brag that one in a very
reſembling condition was ſo greatly deluded; or ſhould
I owe any other civility to that Religion now, but to let
all the World ſee how much ground I had to forſake it.
But ſure I am, I was never uncivil to any perſon of
that Religion, but have ever made it my buſineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb facs="tcp:94350:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my ſelf toward them of all the obligations they
ever laid upon me.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, you'll perhaps wonder that, after there
was no more to be ſaid againſt the Sermon, or directly
againſt me, becauſe of it, they ſhould come at laſt in the
general to vent themſelves againſt my having abandon'd
their Communion; alledging, that I was influenc'd by
other Motives, than thoſe which are proper for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
I am not to fix meaſures to any bodies charity.
But God is the ſearcher of all hearts, and I have a
Soul to anſwer unto him for whatever I do here in the
Body, when that great day of accounts ſhall come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Motives upon which all Men do embrace their
Religion, will be laid open and made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, to ſatisfie the World I have this to ſay,
that I am ready upon all occaſions to give a reaſon for
the hope that is in me to every body that ſhall ask about
it. So that I doubt not to ſhew (and I promiſe my
ſelf that this Sermon will partly do it) that, whatever
were my Motives; yet I have done what was juſt and
reaſonable in it ſelf, and what I ought to have done
however.</p>
            <p>Yet nothing they can ſay ſhall ever trouble or ſurprize
me; for I know that it is <hi>through good report and evil
report</hi> that I muſt enter into the Kingdom of God. And
it is my comfort, that there is a bleſſing annext to us,
<hi>when men ſhall revile us, and perſecute us, and ſhall
ſay all manner of evil againſt us falſly for Chriſt's
ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94350:10"/>
But, in fine, Sir, to return to the chief occaſion of
this long Letter (which I had never ventured upon
without your expreſs Command) ſo long as thoſe Jeſuits
and Prieſts, and other truckling Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi>
continue to buſie themſelves ſo extraordinarily in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
their Faith, as they have done of late, they will
always furniſh their Miniſters with Apology enough for
preaching againſt Popery. For how can we betray our
truſt ſo groſly, as to ſuffer our People to be ſhamm'd away
from us by the crafty inſinuations of a Set of Men, who
are inceſſant upon all occaſions to advance their deſign,
without doing what in us lyes to prevent any inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
miſchief that may happen to our Church that way,
as if we were no farther concerned than to be mere Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
of the affair? So that it is not out of the leaſt
apprehenſion that Popery will ever be impos'd upon us by
our King, that we Preach and Exhort againſt it. No
certainly. For we look upon our ſelves as no leſs ſecure
upon that head, than it is poſſible for us to be; having
all our Laws in favour of our Religion confirmed to us
by his Gratious Sanction, and being fully encouraged in
that Royal Promiſe, of which we cannot doubt before we
be heinouſly guilty of a very great wickedneſs and ſin.
But becauſe ſome eminent defections give us, alas! but
too good ground to fear, that the endeavours of theſe our
reſtleſs Enemies may prove too ſucceſsfull with many,
whoſe pliant inclinations (upon what Motives themſelves
know beſt, and I will not preſume to determine) ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
diſpoſeth for that Religion. And that my Sermon
did but too luckily hit the juncture of that day wherein
it was preach'd, you will certainly acknowledge when you
know that on that very day a Presbyter of our Church
<pb facs="tcp:94350:10"/>
abjur'd its Communion. Had therefore the Miniſters
of Chriſt's Goſpel ever more reaſon to beſtir themſelves
in maintaining and defending the truth of it, than in
theſe our circumſtances? That therefore we have ſince
theſe few Months appear'd ſomewhat more zealous than
ordinarily againſt Popery, others than we ought to be
thanked for it; theſe having forc'd us either to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
to our God, and his Son, whoſe Miniſters we are,
or elſe to preach againſt that Religion, which we ſaw was
like to become ſo common and ala-mode.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I do endeavour to vindicate my Self and
Sermon; and I have written more largely to you, not
only to approve my ſelf to one of my beſt friends, but
alſo becauſe I know that you'll repreſent theſe things in
my behalf wherever you hear theſe Objections made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me. But whatever thoſe Gentlemen ſhall ſay, I
am reſolved to ſhelter my ſelf in the peace of a good
conſcience, and the protection of the juſteſt King on this
ſide Heaven.</p>

               <q>For in Jeſus Chriſt neither Circumciſion availeth
any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion: but Faith which
worketh by Love.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THat which through the aſſiſtance of God I intend
to purſue from this Text is, That the Chriſtian
Religion is of the moſt ſpiritual Frame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the moſt exactly fitted and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
as to the immaterial Being of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
which it regards, ſo to the reaſonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Subject in which it ought to reſide; That it is of a
more noble and elevated Deſign, than were any of thoſe courſe
Models, which either Wickedneſs or the Neceſſity of Affairs did
ever introduce among Men: And ſo, that it does not conſiſt in
outward performances and bodily geſtures, in certain Schemes of
Sacrifices, or a ceremonial Worſhip, in ſolemn Pageantries and
pompous Shews, in external Rites and Uſages, or carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and a ſenſible Oeconomie; but in a holy and virtuous Life
and Converſation, in Faith, Love, Devotion, Humility, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Contentment, Sobriety, Temperance, Chaſtity, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
Charity, Sincerity, Meekneſs, Generoſity, and all
thoſe other Graces which concur to renew the Image of God in
the Soul of Man, and to diſpoſe him for that pureſt Fruition of
the Original it ſelf in Heaven, which is equally apt to encourage
him in the diligent practice, and to teach him what ſhould be
the peculiar Kind of his Obedience upon Earth: <hi>For in Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And indeed this Character I have given of the Religion which
is acceptable to God through Chriſt Jeſus, is ſo obviouſly held
forth to us in theſe Words, that it ought rather to be reckoned as
a Paraphraſe of, than any formal Deduction from, them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94350:12"/>
For by Circumciſion muſt be underſtood the whole ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Inſtitution of the Jewiſh Law; that word being ordinarily
uſed in this ſenſe by our Apoſtle in all his Epiſtles: becauſe the
Circumciſion was the moſt eminent Ceremony of that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo moſt proper to give a Name to the whole. And by
Uncircumciſion we muſt alſo mean any other kind of carnal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
of a like nature unto that of the Jews, and which was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cuſtomary among the Heathens, or ſhould afterwards be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by any of thoſe who ſhould pretend to follow the Doctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt. For by it the Apoſtle could not intend any other
form of Religion but what was animal, and was chiefly conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in corporeal Obſervances, and outward Formalities; ſince
there is none of a middle kind, which could be directed to the
true God, that can imaginably fall between the notion of ſuch a
one, and that genuine ſort which is expreſt by the ſubſequent
part of the Text, Faith which worketh by Love; as is palpable.
And therefore it is certain that he could not uſe both theſe two,
Uncircumciſion, and Faith which worketh by Love, as but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Phraſes for the ſame thing; becauſe then he had really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
himſelf, by ſaying, that the former availeth not in Jeſus
Chriſt, when immediately he did inſinuate the contrary of the
latter. And ſo by Uncircumciſion he muſt needs have meant
that kind of Religion which ſtood in contradiſtinction to this
other; and conſequently that which I have now deſcribed as the
true importance of that word. So that the Expoſition of the
Text runs moſt naturally thus; Neither ſuch an Adminiſtration
as was that of the Jews, nor any other whatſoever, of no finer
Eſſence nor Intent, can ſignifie any thing to thoſe who look for
Salvation through the Holy Jeſus; for the main deſign and ſcope
of that Religion, whereof he was the Authour, is onely Faith
which worketh by Love.</p>
            <p>Now by this we can onely underſtand that generous and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
temper of mind, whereby the Nature of Man is exalted to
the greateſt height of Perfection that it is capable of on this ſide
of its glorious Eſtate. For 'tis not poſſible to conceive a more
emphatick or comprehenſive account of all that is requiſite for
making up the moſt ſpiritual and divine Religion, than what is
implied in <hi>Faith working by Love;</hi> all that can be called Sanctity or
Goodneſs, being fully compriſed in that <hi>Grace,</hi> thus operative
and prolifick. It were eaſie to ſhew this, both from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94350:12"/>
of ſuch a lively Faith, and from the dependance which
all that is truly great or noble has upon it. But that lies out of
my preſent Road; and ſo it ſhall ſuffice to vouch it by thoſe two
other places, where the Apoſtle repeats this ſame Text, and onely
alters the Expreſſion here; in the one calling it the <hi>keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God,</hi> and in the other <hi>a new Creature.</hi> Chriſtianity
then, or that which availeth in Jeſus Chriſt, is a complete Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme
of the moſt refined and improved Morality, ſuch as wholly
tends to accompliſh and adorn the Souls of Men. And therefore
it is ſuch an ingenuous and ſpiritual Religion, ſo reaſonable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as equally excludes, and does tranſcend all thoſe low and
carnal Schemes, which either Childiſhneſs or Superſtition did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
to thoſe fond and doting Creatures that have ever been
wheedled with them.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that I have not raiſed any other Doctrine from
this Text, but what the Apoſtle himſelf did directly intend when
he wrote it, and ſo what is the immediate ſenſe of the Words;
and that I have not ventured ſo much upon Inferences, as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
in making it afford a Subject patly enough accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
for that which this Diſcourſe has ſtill in its view. And
now that I may go on the more methodically with it, I ſhall,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Give a ſhort account of Religion before Chriſt. And,
Secondly, What was the ſpecial and principal Deſign of that
which he preached to the World.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, It is certain that in the State of Innocence our
firſt Parents were wholly employed in gratitude and love to their
Maker, in admiring the beautifull Frame of this World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
the Glory of ſuch a Workmanſhip upon him by whoſe
fingers it was faſhioned, in mutual love to, and complacency in,
each other; and ſuch like pure and ſuitable Virtues. And all this
without any external Ceremonies or Formalities, any outward
Schemes of Religion, or Models of Devotion, ſave onely that
they, being lodged in Fleſh as well as we, could not but uſe
thoſe geſtures and poſtures which were neceſſary for them in any
publick Worſhip; ſo, to wit, as the Saints will do in Heaven
after the Reſurrection. And the reaſon is, becauſe God being
a Spirit, and ſo not capable to be the direct Object of material
Motions, thoſe which formally reſpect him muſt needs proceed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94350:13"/>
from a Spirit too. And therefore all corporeal Actions come in
but by accident into Religion, and cannot be pertinent to it, but
ſo far as either they tend to occaſion ſome proportionable ones in
the Soul, (as when one in a proſtrate poſture is thereby moved to
thoughts of Humility,) or elſe for the mutual ſubſerviency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
adminiſtration of publick Worſhip among many. Now in
that bleſſed Eſtate there could not but be ſo very little need of
any outward Obſervances, upon either of theſe reſpects, that it
were very unreaſonable to encreaſe them beyond what was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary and indiſpenſible.</p>
            <p>But when Sin had overturned all things, and ſubjected the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and leading Faculties in Man, to thoſe low and carnal
Members wherein he was but a ſharer with the Beaſts that periſh,
then Almighty God, to upbraid his fall, did enjoin him a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as groſs and carnal as himſelf was become, and appointed
him to make Attonement by the Bloud of Beaſts, for that beaſtly
Nature he had degenerated into. Not that thoſe material Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
were capable to afford any congruous ſatisfaction to that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Being, the very Kind of whoſe Nature, as well as the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, did infinitely tranſcend and undervalue them. Neither
was there any thing intrinſick in thoſe animal performances to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
them for ſuch an end. And therefore it was not merely
theſe that were exacted, but alſo, and eſpecially, the inward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and offering up of the Mind. Thus though both <hi>Cain</hi> and
<hi>Abel</hi> did equally acquit themſelves as to the outward part of the
Oblation, yet not doing ſo as to the ſpiritual too, the one was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and the other not. So that the external obſervation had
no other excellency to recommend it, but what it borrowed from
the ingenuous and devout Intention of thoſe by whom it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and whatever was done by the Body, could not pretend
to any kind of Worthineſs in the ſight of God, as it did proceed
from it, but only as it was informed with the pious affection of the
Soul. And conſequently all thoſe outward Miniſtrations did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to the true deſign of Religion, but materially at beſt; and it
was ſtill thoſe Principles of inward Honeſty and Religion, which
were preſerved after the Fall, that gave the formal value to them,
which were the Salt that ſeaſoned all the Sacrifices, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
which ſanctified the Gifts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94350:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
However that great enemy of Mankind, who was but the
more enraged to a freſh aſſault by that New Covenant of Grace,
whereby all the ſucceſs of his former was ſo much defeated, did
now look upon himſelf as furniſhed with a favourable enough op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to attempt his old project once again, and to make an
eſſay how he might enveigle poor Man into a ſecond Fall. For
finding that an external and ſenſible Religion was allowed him,
he plies himſelf with all the dexterity of his Nature to improve
that while it ſhould ſupplant it ſelf, and by the numerous croud
of its performances, either quite ſmother that Mark whereto ſuch
a ſhower of Arrows were directed, or elſe tear it in pieces by the
ſeveral and various points which ſhould fix in it. And thus by
degrees he got Superſtition, and Idolatry, and Atheiſm, ſo to
overwhelm the face of the earth, as to need even a deluge to waſh
it from ſo much filthineſs and abomination.</p>
            <p>The like ſtrategeme did ſucceed too well alſo in that new
World, which by ſeeing the ruines of the old, ſhould at leaſt
have kept off thoſe rocks that it was daſht upon. But the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
was cunning, and they were frail; ſo that the thing that
prevented a ſecond deluge was not the want of a ſecond occaſion
for one, but the mere promiſe of God, who was reſolved not to
ſtrive any more with ſuch backſliding creatures. And therefore
thought fit to form a peculiar Church and People to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuch was the natural complexion and genius of that
ſame Race which he made choice of, that at the Inſtitution of
their Law, their fondneſs to that carnal and ſenſible Worſhip, to
which they had been inured among the Egyptians, was ſo very
invincible, as in a manner even to conſtrain him to humour them
in the very kind of that ſervice they were to pay to him, and ſo
to indulge them a Religion ſymbolical to that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though
applied to a better purpoſe; their Ceremonies being an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
that proceeded from no other motive than did their liberty
to divorce their Wives; namely, <hi>becauſe of the hardneſs of their
hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet even this Condeſcenſion had not its due effect. For
as their Law was at firſt occaſioned by their froward and carnal
diſpoſition, with which the infinite goodneſs of God chus'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a time to comply, than perpetually contend. So having
once obtain'd a Religion ſo gratefull to thoſe fulſome inclinations
which did thus cloſely ſtick to them, they ſoon perverted that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94350:14"/>
gratious condeſcention to which they ow'd it, and looking upon
it, as if it had been to be the main and principal deſign of that
Covenant whereof their <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediatour; they fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagin'd that their God was altogether ſuch a one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſo more apt to be pleaſed with the ſparkling grandure
and magnificence of a flaunting and gaudy devotion, than all
thoſe ghoſtly and inviſible motions, which reach not beyond the
dark retirement of that breaſt wherein they are performed.
And thus did they run ſo far in advancing the credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of bodily performances, as at laſt to become wholly poſſeſt
with the opinion of an abundant ſufficiency in them, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their account they became righteous in the ſight of God, ſo
as that by the very <hi>opus operatum</hi> of thoſe Sacrifices and Luſtrations
which he appointed, their ſins and offences were fully expiated,
and he ſufficiently attoned for them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Moral Law, they own'd no farther concernment
in it, than merely to let it alone; that is, being it wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in Negatives, not to break forth into any outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of thoſe things which were forbidden by it: looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it rather as an extrinſecal Circumſtance, than any conſtituent
part of their Religion.</p>
            <p>Yea ſo vaſtly did this prevail, that nothing happened to their
Works, but what became the very fate of their Faith too. For
the hopes they had of that happineſs, which ſhould accrue to them
from the coming of the Meſſias, did chiefly reſpect that worldly
honour, glory and greatneſs which they imagin'd was to attend
him. And when ſo great and learned a part of their Rabbies
were ſo much immers'd in Matter, as to deny even the being of
any thing elſe, we may eaſily gueſs how little they were diſpoſed
to ſpiritual things, and how great influence their ceremonial Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
had upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the original and progreſs of a ceremonial Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
upon what account it was firſt condeſcended unto, and
what were the ill effects it produc'd.</p>
            <p>Let us now come to the other thing propos'd, the <hi>ſpecial deſign
of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And that, as S. <hi>John</hi> 1 Ep. 3. 8. tells us,
was <hi>to deſtroy the works of the Devil;</hi> namely, thoſe that either were
directly ſuggeſted by him, or which he had been the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of. For the Son of God took upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
not only to be obedient unto the death of the Croſs, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94350:14"/>
be a propitiation for the Sins of the World; But alſo to be a
Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and to reduce affairs as near as poſſible
to that poſture they were in, when there was no need of one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Office and Character. And therefore when he went up
to the Mount, in imitation of <hi>Moſes</hi> 'tis like, to publiſh that New
Law whereby he would have the lives of Men to be governed,
there was nothing he propounded but what was of an exact Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and goodneſs, of an abſolute and intrinſick rectitude and
excellency, and which was altogether congruous and ſuitable to
our Rational Nature, and no leſs fitted to defecate and refine us
from ſenſe and corruption, than to render us meet to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the inheritance of the Saints in light; the one being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the other. So that his Religion appear'd rather to be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for thoſe unbodied ſpirits, that are not encumbred with the
propenſions of fleſh, than for ſuch as are even ſunk in matter, and
heavily clogg'd with thoſe earthly Tabernacles they carry about
with them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Ceremonies of the Jewiſh Law; Since he was
the Truth and Subſtance of which they were but the Type and
Shadow, his very Being, without any more ado, did fully eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
and aboliſh them; as is clearly demonſtrated by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in
ſeveral of his Epiſtles, and eſpecially in that to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Nay
moreover, our Lord himſelf did expreſly ſhew us ſo much, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.
21, 23. and he gives the reaſon thereof, <hi>verſ. 24. For God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and he muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> Add to this,
that he did inſtitute new Sacraments in lieu of the old ones,
which, by conſequence at leaſt, was an entire abrogation of thoſe,
and of that Law to which they did pertain. So that the whole
eſſence and deſign of that Religion did conſiſt in true holineſs and
virtue, in the improvement of the Soul, and renovation of the
inward Man.</p>
            <p>Neither did he join thoſe new Sacraments unto it, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to introduce one Ceremonial Religion in place of another,
or to give encouragement thereby to any to load it with all the
arbitrary inventions their fondneſs could put them upon. No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly.
'Tis true indeed, he ſaw that the preſent circumſtances of
our frail condition did neceſſarily require ſome external and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
means, to diſtinguiſh us from the reſt of the world in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſion; the better to keep us in mind of the import and
obligation thereof; and to prompt us to a ſevere examination of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94350:15"/>
our ways, a high gratitude to our Redeemer, and an Univerſal
Love among our ſelves. But yet thoſe which he did appoint
were of ſo ſimple a nature, and ſo common an uſe in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of our life, that in reaſon it could never be preſum'd
they would furniſh occaſion for any acceſſionary throng of pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Ceremonies, at once to ſmother their original ſimplicity and
deſign too. Wherefore in all the New Teſtament there is not
the leaſt footſtep of any thing that looks like the giving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
unto ſuch. And it was in conſequence to the contrary
that our Text was written, when ſeveral perſons that ſaid they
were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would have had That Religion prophaned with
them. For the Apoſtle knowing, not onely that it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to truſt thoſe, who had been train'd up from their infancy
amidſt a croud of Ceremonies, with any thing that might lead
them back to theſe again, or at leaſt divert them from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Righteouſneſs whereof already they were become ſo ſhy;
But alſo, that even in the nature of things an outward and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Religion did afford matter of tentation to draw aſide the moſt
of Men from paying that due attention to thoſe unſeen and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
exerciſes, which are onely proper to a ſpiritual piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
the Apoſtle, I ſay, perceiving theſe, did therefore by the
bulk diſcharge them all manner of ſuch obſervances and cuſtoms,
and univerſally remove all theſe or the like Ceremonies from
Chriſtianity, as wholly inconſiſtent with, and prejudicial to ſuch
a ſpiritual diſpenſation: <hi>For in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. So that no Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
but ſuch as mere neceſſity, or a diſcreet decency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
does require, can be at all allowable unto thoſe who expect
any good from that Religion, which is to be meaſured by the
Will of Jeſus Chriſt, and not by the fancies of bold and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men.</p>
            <p>Now that during the firſt Ages of that holy Religion its firſt
and main deſign, which was ſo very viſible and conſpicuous, was
carried on with a candour and integrity ſuitable to it ſelf, is more
certain than that it can well be doubted of. And I ſhall clearly
evince it by the two following Arguments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it could be nothing elſe but the ſtrictneſs of its
commands, and that exemplary purity of life which theſe did
enjoyn, that occaſioned all the perſecution that was rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94350:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And ſecondly, becauſe the Primitive Chriſtians exerciſed
their Religion in the moſt ſimple manner that was poſſible.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, 'Twas certainly upon the account of the Excellency
of that Morality, and of that ſublime Obedience which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
introduc'd, that it met with ſo bad entertainment in the
world, and was perſecuted with all the rigour and cruelty that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Tyrants could invent. For the believing and ſpeculative
part of the Chriſtian Religion, in ſo far as it has no influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the life and converſation of Men, was of no ſuch provoking
nature, as to have embroil'd the world ſo ſadly, and rais'd the
moſt diſturbing commotions that ever ſet its people in a flame.
Since the appearing wildneſs and paradoxy of its moſt abſtruſe
and unexplicable Myſteries, could at worſt have been but reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
to that of thoſe frantick opinions, which in the greateſt part
of Religions were admitted with the profoundeſt reverence and
veneration; and which had given a precedent for the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances
to gain credit and regard, were they but once ſhrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the common pretext of pertaining to things ſacred. And
ſo as the no leſs abſurd and inconſiſtent, than unworthy and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
fancies about the Heathen Deities, were ſo far from incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or offending the Higher Powers, that on the contrary they
became the Objects of their adoration; So it is never to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
that any Doctrine or Tenents whatſoever could have
wrought that effect, ſo long as they went no farther, than merely
to be ſuch, and did not exact any other obſervance but the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
aſſent of an eaſie underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Neither could it be the external Worſhip and Devotion
whereof it made a ſhew, that could give ſo much offence. For
ſuppoſing that it had made its appearance in the world with the
greateſt pomp and ſplendour; Yet how can it be imagin'd that
thoſe who had abandon'd themſelves to all the ſopperies and
trumpery that fond Idolary could inſpire Men withall, ſhould
have ever been ſo zealous of their own madneſs, as rather than
to ſuffer others be poſſeſt with a greater, to perſecute them with
nothing leſs than fire and ſword, deſtruction and ruine? This, I
ſay, could never have been, had there not been ſome other thing
of a nearer concern at the bottom of it. Nay ſo far was it from
this, that That very <hi>Rome</hi> which roſe up againſt the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
with all the violence and fury that was poſſible, was yet as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94350:16"/>
much accuſtom'd to enſlave her ſelf to all the Deities of other
Nations, as to enſlave theſe unto her ſelf: Not ſeeming more
ambitious to have her Empire and the World of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
than to have her <hi>Pantheon</hi> well crouded with all its Idols too;
as if nothing could have ſatisfied her, but to have all the Gods, as
well as Men, to be wholly her own. So that when Cats and
Crocodiles, and the uglieſt ſhapes that could be contriv'd were
advanced in her Temples, ſurely, had not the God of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
been more ungratefull upon ſome other account, than that
he would have engag'd her to ſome new ſuperſtition; ſhe had
rather took it as a kindneſs, than any injury, to have got him
mounted upon ſome of her Altars. And therefore it ſeems very
obvious from all this, that it was chiefly the preceptive and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
part of Chriſtianity, which was ſo much the ſtumbling-block,
and for which it came to be more inveterately hated, than any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that had ever before been propos'd to the conſciences of
Men.</p>
            <p>For all Mankind being deeply immers'd in the corruption of
fleſh and bloud, and univerſally addicted to indulge themſelves
in thoſe luſts and pleaſures, whoſe fulſome nature did beſt ſuit
with ſuch degenerate creatures, it was not to be expected but that
when ſo heavenly and divine a Religion came down from above
the clouds, to inſinuate it ſelf into their practice and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it ſhould encounter with all the ſpight and oppoſition that
ſuch an unwelcome, though generous, project could be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
withall; when the more excellent and loſty deſign it carried
along with it, the more directly did it contradict thoſe natural
inclinations, in whoſe ſatisfaction all the reputed happineſs of
the world was formerly placed. And upon that ſcore the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Holy Jeſus was lookt upon as ſome malevolent and
inſiduous deſign, to deſpoil the world of all that was dear unto
it; and to be as cruel an attempt, as if that had been even literally
directed to rob every body of his neareſt Relations, nay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of his right eye, and right hand, and leave him no
more but the paſſive trunk of a mutilous body to breathe into.
This is undoubtedly the moſt rational account that can be given,
wherefore, of all the Religions that ever ſet foot in the World,
the Chriſtian onely was that which lookt ſo terrible and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
as to raiſe all the Power and Wit of Mankind to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
enmity and violence againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94350:16"/>
Yea, not only is it thus evident that the ſignal and grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Chriſtianity was to reform and improve the lives of Men;
But alſo on the other hand it is palpable that in thoſe Primitive
Ages, all who made profeſſion thereof were as ſimple in the garb
of their Religion, as they were in that of their Bodies; and that
was ſimple enough. Indeed their circumſtances were ſuch, that
they were glad to have but any corner to aſſemble themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And they were ſo ill provided of what could advance any
external grandure, that it became one of the charges laid againſt
them, that their Religion behov'd to be ſome mean and skulking
thing, ſince of all the Religions that had ever appear'd in the
world, it onely had no Temples wherein ſolemnly to worſhip its
God. And till the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that Churches were built
in a Magnificent manner, they had ſcarcely Huts to preach in;
and the beſt they ordinarily made uſe of, was but ſome upper
Room in ſome private houſe or other. What therefore could
be the other pomp of that Service which was ſo ill lodged, and
which for the moſt part was brought forth, as was he to whom it
was directed, in an Inn or a Stable?</p>
            <p>But though they wanted thoſe outward advantages, yet as to
the genuine part of their duty, there was never any thing more
heavenly and devout, more zealous and fervent; and they were
frequent in Prayer and Exhortation, and in receiving the Holy
Euchariſt, without any noiſe or ſplendour, or any thing that could
look like vanity or ſuperſtition; being ſo extremely intent upon
the ſubſtance of the thing, as never to ſuffer one thought to be
diverted about the external form of it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto then did the Chriſtian Religion preſerve its native
Temper and Inſtitution. But, alas! not long after that, things
began to put on another face. For when once they got an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to be as much Chriſtian, as before him all of that Title were
the contrary: And ſo when Liberty and Riches, thoſe two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
things, if not cautiouſly made uſe of, began to flow in
upon them apace; then they quickly became proud and wanton,
ambitious and fancifull; and began to vye grandure and pomp
with all the world, and from one extreme running into another,
to busk every thing that related to their Religion in as gaudy a
dreſs, as that was ſimple and mean it had wont to be accoutred
withall: As if they had imagin'd, that ſince their Religion was
the moſt ſublime and excellent that ever adorned any ſociety of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94350:17"/>
Men; therefore it ought to be the moſt ſplendid and magnificent
too. So that the Fathers began to pray for the Perſecutions again,
to purge the Church of all thoſe ſupervenient deckings, and to
force thoſe who did haunt it unto their old humility and charity,
and unto that ingenuous and plain manner of Devotion, which
was onely ſuitable for ſo ſacred a place.</p>
            <p>But ſtill they went on, untill at laſt the Viſage of the Church
became to be ſo painted and patcht over, as that one who had
ſeen it before, ſhould not have now known it for his old and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
acquaintance. And thus at length affairs came up to that
height wherein they are in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day. A
Church that has been ſo much infected with the contagious ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
of other Religions, as to render her own but a Mongrel
compoſure of them all. A Church that has perverted the moſt
noble deſign into the worſt purpoſes, that has daub'd the moſt
beautifull Religion with the moſt ugly and preternatural inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that has tranſplanted the very Being of it from the Soul
to the Body, from a Spiritual to a Carnal Soil. But ſhould I
once launch out into this Subject, ſo vaſt and ſpatious is it, that
the whole day would not ſerve to go over it. I ſhall therefore
onely touch at ſome few things in general.</p>
            <p>And firſt, What ſhall be ſaid of the Rites and Ceremonies
of their Worſhip and Sacraments, and that outward pomp where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are performed? They are now become altogether Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical,
and their grand Maſs, eſpecially if ſaid by the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
is certainly one of the moſt bombaſt pieces of Pageantry the
world ever ſaw. The thing is too well known that I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon it; And therefore I ſhall onely refer thoſe who are not
ſufficiently informed, to the 2d and 3d Chapter of the firſt Book
of the Famous Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> his Hiſtorical Defence of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
where, though the Subject be not more lively than truly
deſcrib'd, yet it comes ſhort of what really it is; as any body
who has been at <hi>Rome</hi> eſpecially can atteſt; and as may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Deſcription of a Roman Service, written by a Jeſuit
in a Letter to a Friend of his. It runs thus: <hi>We are ſure</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>that the Society did employ 9000 Florens in the late Solemnity. They caus'd
to raiſe a great Machine in our Church of</hi> Farneſe <hi>at</hi> Rome, <hi>in honour
of the Holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt: It was 120 Palms high, and</hi>
80 <hi>in breadth; wonderfully adorned with excellent Statues, with delicate
Images, with rarely painted Hiſtories, and Emblemes, which did raviſh
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94350:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Eyes of all the Beholders; and having burning upon it upwards of four
thouſand Flambeaux, the light did ſhine ſo very radiantly all about in the
Church, as that one durſt hardly look up, for fear of being quite dazzled.
They did celebrate the Service with ſo much Pomp, and with ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
Conſort of the Popes Muſicians, that there wanted nothing but the
Preſence of the Pope himſelf to make up the moſt magnificent Shew that
ever was upon the Earth. The Archbiſhop of</hi> Rhodes <hi>ſaid the Maſs;
there were twenty two Cardinals preſent, and the whole Prelates almoſt of
the Roman Court, with all the Ambaſſadours of Kings and Princes, and
the greateſt part of the Religious Orders of</hi> Rome. We may conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from this, as <hi>ex ungue leonem,</hi> what is the ſuperſtition of that
Church.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly, there is nothing more viſible than that it has
been its great ſtudy and endeavour to take off all the burthen of
Religion from the Soul, and lay it upon the Body. For if this
but trudge and ſmart ſufficiently, the other will have but little to
doe. And that is evident,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By their Doctrine about the Sacrament of Penance;
where not onely they have fitted the word for the purpoſe, but
alſo have ſo ordered the matter, that there is no more inward ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
required in the mind, but what is animal, and what every
Beaſt has when it is dragged to the Shambles, that is Attrition,
or Sorrow proceeding merely from the fear of Danger. And if
the Penance enjoined be but exactly gone about, then all is well
enough. So that at this rate one needs never to be at the pains ſo
to wean his Soul from the World, as by a pure and benevolential
Love, or even complacential either, to fix it upon God; which
to doe is certainly both the greateſt Difficulty and Deſign of our
Religion. Becauſe he has no more to doe, but to be afraid of
Hell, and to run to a Prieſt for Abſolution, and then to perform
ſuch corporeal Exerciſes, as he ſhall preſcribe; and theſe, no
doubt, will not be too ſevere. Who then would not be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to ſin by this Doctrine, when they are taught by it how to
redeem the offence ſo eaſily? And though they require a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of ſinning no more, yet that being founded upon the ſame
motive, namely, the Fears of Hell, one may be in Heaven, or at
leaſt in Purgatory, before he begin to learn how he ſhould love
his God as he ought.</p>
            <p>But this may be prov'd, not onely by their Doctrine, about
this particular Sacrament, but even about them all in general. For
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94350:18"/>
what can doe it more, than that the very <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
produces Grace in the receiver of them? And therefore
they need not ſeek for Holineſs it ſelf, and a fully formed piety,
before they approach them, ſince they expect that from them as
their proper and formal effect; but onely for certain Diſpoſitions
and Perquiſites to it. And who knows not that the one is much
more eaſily acquired than the other?</p>
            <p>Nay, they go farther than all this, and to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> they
add the <hi>Sacramentalia;</hi> and theſe come ſwarming in upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as the Locuſts did upon <hi>Egypt.</hi> For they hold, that by pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
over the Lord's Prayer, by caſting the ſign of the Croſs,
by a daſh of Holy Water, by having a bit of an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> about
one, or the Relick of any Saint, nay, or even a Medall of one,
by being in ſuch a Confraternity, or Sodality, or by wearing ſuch
a Scapulary, or Frock; in a word, by doing any thing they have
a mind to, Grace is ſtill ready waiting on, and the Soul is thereby
ſanctified, and made holy.</p>
            <p>But moreover, their Doctrine of a general intention concurs
mightily to help up all: For if at the beginning of any duty they
ſhall but in the general intend to doe it for ſuch an end, then there
is no more required; and if the Body do but go about it, the
Soul needs not be at the fatigue of a conſtant attendance with its
Intention. So that the Soul gives out the orders at firſt to the
Body, to march there, or there, and after that it ſelf goes a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
where it pleaſes. Thus though the Office of their Church
takes up a conſiderable time, yet if a Prieſt addreſs himſelf to it
with a general intention, and his Lips but mutter it over, he may
be thinking all the time he ſays it, as he liſts. It is juſt the ſame
caſe with that of thoſe lewd kind of people, who being bid ſay
Grace before Meat, anſwer, that they did it in the morning for
all the Day.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance another Doctrine more, and that is their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
that the inherent Righteouſneſs whereby one is juſtified, does
not conſiſt in any temper or frame of the Soul; but in a certain
phyſical Quality which they call habitual Grace. So that it is not
upon the account of any Holineſs or Virtue reſident in the Soul
it ſelf, as contradiſtinguiſht from that Quality, that one is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
but merely by it, as that ſanctifying form by which onely
we are acceptable to God. Beſides the Nonſenſe of this, which
is as great as may be, certainly there is much prejudice in it to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94350:18"/>
true intent of Religion, eſpecially conſidering that it is produced,
not by the Soul it ſelf, but by the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the Sacraments.
I do not deny that many of them hold, that Faith which worketh
by love does formally juſtifie in the ſight of God. But firſt, this
is but the opinion of ſome, and very far from being that of all of
them. Then ſecondly, there is none of them but he looks upon
it as an extraordinary caſe, and ſo muſt maintain that there is no
neceſſity at all for one to be juſtified upon theſe terms. So that
if ever there was a carnal and external Religion in the World,
ſure that of <hi>Rome</hi> is much more ſo; for never was there any ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
and learned in the art of carrying it on ſo far as this.</p>
            <p>Now for improving what has been ſaid to our own uſe, I ſhall
onely recommend that Exhortation wherewith the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
the <hi>Galatians</hi> in the beginning of this Chapter, upon the
like occaſion, <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us
free, and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage; For in Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Ye have heard what is the peculiar Deſign of our
moſt holy Faith, and how much that is perverted and impoſed
upon by that Religion which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſhuffle in in its ſtead. And therefore if ye have any regard
to your Souls, ye'll never abandon ſo holy, ſo rational, ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Religion, and embrace ſo groſs and carnal a Superſtition in
place of it.</p>
            <p>I preſume I need not uſe any more Arguments from the compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of theſe two, after what has been already diſcourſed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all along ſo manifeſtly ſhewn how deſtructive and ruinous
any ſuch Religion, as the Roman, is to the main and ſpecial Deſign
of true Religion in the general, and far more of that which avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in Jeſus Chriſt. So that having ſo fully diſcovered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice,
it were to ſuppoſe an equal want of ſenſe both in the
Speaker and Hearers, to preſs you with any Reaſons not to leap
over it, when none but ſuch as really are uncapable of any, can
ever be guilty of the Folly.</p>
            <p>Yet I hope it will not be impertinent to offer ſome more general
Motives to your conſideration, that thoſe who either could not
follow the thread of the Diſcourſe cloſely enough, or who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done this, yet perhaps are not ſo nearly touched with it, as
they ought to be, may meet with what may happen to be both
more plain and convincing unto them, if indeed any thing can be
more ſo.</p>

Now our Saviour does aggravate the Infidelity of the Jews
with this, that if he had not come and ſpoken to them, they
had not had ſin; but now they have no cloak for their ſin: If
he had not done the works among them that no other Man did,
they had not had ſin, <hi>John</hi> 15, 22. 24. So ſay I to you; If ye
had not been educated and trained up in the true knowledge
of the Son of God; if ye were not furniſhed with all the
means neceſſary for being fully convinced of the Excellency
of our Religion, infinitely beyond all the falſe pretending ones
that ever inveigled the World, then perhaps ye would have no
ſin, that is, not ſo great a degree of it, though ye ſhould have
been of the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi> But now if ye ſhall fall away,
and turn your back upon that Church wherein ye have been bred,
and which comes as near to the primitive truth and ſimplicity
of the Chriſtian Religion, as that of <hi>Rome</hi> does to the Jewiſh and
Pagan, and that is as near as may be; if, I ſay, now ye ſhall
make Shipwreck of your Faith, then you will have no Cloak for
your ſin. 'Tis ſad Language in the 6th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and fourth
Verſe; <hi>It is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and taſted of
the heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and
taſted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, if
they once fall away, to be renewed again unto repentance, ſeeing they have
crucified the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which quadrates, even in the literal ſenſe, but too well
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her Maſs equally performing both theſe.</p>
            <p>And indeed if we be miſtaken in our Religion, as it ſtands in
oppoſition to Popery, we may juſtly uſe <hi>S. Victor</hi>'s Argument,
and tax God himſelf with it, ſaying, <hi>That it is He that hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and deluded us. For ſince we have got all our Faculties from him,
both thoſe of our Reaſon, and of our Senſes, it is evident that whatever
theſe do neceſſitate us unto, and do unavoidably force us to admit, muſt be
refounded upon him from whom that neceſſity was at firſt derived.</hi> But
ſure it is impoſſible for any (abſtractly ſpeaking) to advert unto
the native Dictates and Principles of his Reaſon, or ever conſult
the certainty which his ſenſes afford him, and yet be Popiſh too.
And of this the greateſt Champions for <hi>Rome</hi> have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious,
as not finding any imaginable way how to reconcile their
Religion with the Faculties of Man, to cut the troubleſome knot
they could not looſe, and cry down all Reaſon as the greateſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
in the World. And had but that ever been at <hi>Rome,</hi> or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94350:19"/>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> in ſuch a concrete manner, as that Fire or Rack could
have got hold of it, we ſhould long e'er now have heard of the
ſad tortures it had endured in the Inquiſition. And that I may
not be thought to ſay this <hi>gratis,</hi> I do appeal to <hi>Gonterius, Perro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Arnoldus,</hi> and that Jeſuite <hi>Verronius,</hi> who triumphed mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his bold Method, to confound all the Proteſtants, which was
by denying and renouncing all the Principles of Reaſon with an
open Mouth, and brazen Brow, and never to deign an Anſwer
to any Argument drawn from it againſt any of their Tenents, but
directly and downright to deny it. So that he maintained that
theſe Maxims of Reaſon, <hi>Impoſſibile eſt idem ſimul eſſe &amp; non eſſe,
Quidquid eſt, quamdiu eſt, neceſſario eſt, Non entis nulla ſunt accidentia
neque attributa,</hi> and ſuch like, ought utterly to be refuſed. And
let no Papiſts ſay that theſe were but private Authours, and they
are not concerned in them. For this Book of <hi>Verronius</hi> had all
the approbation that their Church could give it, unleſs a general
Council had been called for that end. For the Pope himſelf
hugg'd it very kindly; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> back'd it with his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
Cardinals, and Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, and the whole
Clergy of <hi>France</hi> recommended it; Nay the very <hi>Sorbon</hi> put its
Seal to it alſo. Sure the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Book, that makes
ſuch a noiſe, was never better vouched.</p>
            <p>But we need not run to this. For I defie them to ſhew me
any of their Writers upon Tranſubſtantiation, who has not ſome
whining kind of Language or other againſt our Reaſon and Senſes.
And the Authour of that late pretended Anſwer to the Funeral
of the Maſs, addreſſes himſelf to his Reader thus, <hi>pag. 4. Here I
humbly intreat the Proteſtant Reader</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to reflect, that in the
Myſteries of Religion we muſt captivate our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding (that is to
ſay, ſuſpend it from aſſerting what it might judge, had it nothing to relie
upon, but the ſole relation of our ſenſes) to obey Chriſt. God will have,
as an Homage due to him and his Veracity, this proud faculty of Man,
which is earneſt to judge of all, ſubmit to his word.</hi> Thus he; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very like the Wolf to the Sheep in the tender of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. For the firſt Article he propoſed to them, was,
that they would lay aſide all the Maſtives by which they were
guarded from him. For well he knew, that if once they were
rendred ſo defenceleſs, they would ſoon become his Prey. Juſt
ſo, if the Proteſtant Readers of that Book, would but once lay
down the certainty of their Reaſon and their Senſes, he would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94350:20"/>
find it no difficult task indeed <hi>then</hi> to perſuade them of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
if <hi>then</hi> they could be perſuaded of any thing at all.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtay any longer to confute this: Onely I muſt ſay,
that either we have certainty in the due exerciſe of our Faculties,
ſo that whatever we clearly and diſtinctly perceive to be true,
muſt neceſſarily be ſo; or elſe we are but Scepticks, without the
certainty of any Thing, or Religion, imaginable. And I would ask
any of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how, or by what principles he comes
to be perſuaded of that Infallibility they boaſt ſo much of? For
either he believes it rationally, and upon ſufficient grounds, or
not? If not; then whatever He does, yet we preſume he muſt
not take Us to be the Fools to be irrational too. But if he yields
his aſſent, becauſe of evident conviction, founded upon certain
Arguments, then I ask him how, or by what means he comes to
be aſſured of their certainty? Here he muſt either run on <hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum;</hi>
or at laſt muſt acknowledge an entire confidence in his
own Faculties, and that by an inward Conſcience and perſuaſion
of Mind, ariſing immediately out of the bright evidence which
ſhines from a clear perception. Now if his Church, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ſo much Infallibility, ſhould define any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
the certainty of thoſe Faculties; then I would deſire of
him, how he would behave himſelf: For it is an undoubted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
in nature, That no Conſequence can be more firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
than is the Antecedent upon which it is built. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Definition of that Church can be more certain, than it is
that ſhe is infallible. But the certainty of her Infallibility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
entirely upon the certainty of his Faculties, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated:
But now, by the very virtue of that Infallibility, his
Faculties are rendred uncertain, according to his own Conceſſion;
What then ſhall he doe? For now he muſt either hold this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
that his Faculties are both certain and not certain; or
elſe he muſt reject that Infallibility which ſupplants it ſelf, by
thus overturning and undermining that very ground upon which
it was rear'd.</p>
            <p>From all which it follows, that ſince the Arguments for which
the Infallibility is pretended, do equally involve the certainty
both of our Reaſon, and of our Senſes: And ſince the Doctrine
of that Church does not onely really contradict both, but is alſo
acknowledged to doe ſo; therefore that Infallibility, as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have actually intereſſed it ſelf in thoſe Definitions, is the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94350:20"/>
moſt abſurd and ſelf-murthering <hi>Chymera</hi> that ever was dream'd
of in the World. And if any Papiſt will anſwer me this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then I'll dare to ſay, we ſhould indeed turn Papiſts, but
then alſo we ſhould turn any thing elſe: For then we behov'd to
renounce all the certainty of our Faculties, to admit the greateſt
contradictions and nonſenſe imaginable; and if we were once at
that paſs, what ought we not to doe? Ye ſee then how far the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that we have of our Religion amounts; to wit, to no leſs than
to that we have of the Being of a God, that that God is not a cheat,
and that we our ſelves are reaſonable Creatures; and he that
would deſire any more would not know what he were deſiring.
Reflect therefore well upon that fore-cited paſſage out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi>
and conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelves what a degree of
illumination you have for your Religion, and what will be your
doom, if having ſuch, ye fall away from it.</p>
            <p>But though this be ſufficient to found the moſt preſſing
Exhortation to adhere with conſtancy unto our Religion; Yet
there is another ſecondary reaſon which I'll preſume to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to you; and that is, That our Religion is the moſt loyal
Religion in the World; ſo that the more cloſely we ſtick to it,
the more ground we give our King to truſt us, and to be aſſured
of our honeſty to him. For by our Religion we cannot fear our
God, but we muſt honour our king, and obey him for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-ſake.
We own a Religion that is both pure and gentle,
meek and peaceable; that teaches us all the ſuitable qualities that
can make us as good Subjects as Chriſtians. And for thoſe
wild and unaccountable Fanaticiſms that at every turn makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
their pretence for Sedition, Tumults and Rebellion, we
hate and deteſt them, and look upon them as the ſcandal of
Chriſtianity, and plague of humane Society.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we once become Papiſts, then let them talk what
they will, our Religion would oblige us to other things. It is
true the French have much ſhaken off that Yoke of bondage to
the Pope. And our Brittiſh Papiſts do now begin to be aſhamed of
the depoſing Power. But certain it is that the Pope himſelf is as
tenacious of the pretence as ever he was. And when he has the
Thunder of Heaven in his Hand, and all his Clergy ſo entirely
his vowed Slaves, there is not too much ſecurity to be had; but
eſpecially when all the Clergy pretend to an exemption from the
Juriſdiction of the Civil Magiſtrate, and that by Divine Right;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94350:21"/>
an opinion very proper to embolden them unto all the villany
imaginable; and when all the Laicks do ſo hang at the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Belt by their auricular Confeſſions; an artifice ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times more apt to blow up the People withall, than ever
was the whining tones of a Tub-preacher, though the World has
even ſadly enough experimented the influence of this: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that general Orders were given out by the Pope to all the
Confeſſours to inſtill the Depoſing Doctrine into the Conſciences
of their Penitents, and to deny abſolution to thoſe who would not
be prevailed upon, or at leaſt to manage it ſo warily as to make it
depend much upon that; ſuppoſing this, I ſay, would not the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of a Nation be much in hazard? Aſſuredly it would, unleſs
in ſuch a Kingdom as <hi>France,</hi> where 200000 Souldiers is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Counterpoiſe againſt ſuch a miſchief. And therefore a King
in a Popiſh Countrey, muſt always either live at his Holineſs's
Beck, or elſe, as if he had made but a new Conqueſt of it, upon
the confidence of an Army ſtill on foot. And he muſt be a great
ſtranger to the intrigues of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſees not that it
is but waiting for a favourable occaſion to pay back the dealing of
<hi>France</hi> in its own coin; and that ſo ſoon as that ſhall ever arrive,
it will not fail to doe ſo, even to the uttermoſt farthing.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as ye love your Reaſon, and your Souls, as ye love
your God, and eternal Happineſs, as ye love your King, and your
Countrey, hold faſt the profeſſion of your Faith without wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us
free, and be not entangled again in the Yoke of Bondage, of a
ſuperſtitious, and unreaſonable, and diſloyal Religion. <hi>For in
