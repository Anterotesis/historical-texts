            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Tender Viſitation And Friendly EXHORTATION To all the children of Truth to be Valiant in this day of Trial.</head>
            <p>UNto you the choſen and beloved of God born of the Royal ſeed, and brought forth of the womb of eternal love, and children of one Father nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and brought up by the nouriſhment of the ſincere milk of the living eternal Word; growing into the ſtature of Chriſt and of his fulneſs receiving ſtrength day by day, by which you are begotten unto this lively hope, to know the reſurrection of the Juſt, and holy off-ſpring and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life of the only Son of God, who is the brightneſs of the fathers glory, and is full of grace and truth: O how is my heart affected with the unchangable love and life, which dwells with him for ever, who is the fountain of living water, and from him doth plentifullie flow forth of the ſame, into the hearts of them that he hath freely called and choſen to bear his name in their foreheads, and hath received the lively image of his eternal power, which worketh mightilie in all that believe, and have waited for his ſalvation, which is now revealed in this the day of his might and power; O the great and notable day of God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40359:2"/>
that is come to us, with his wonderful arme of everlaſting ſtrength; to prepare us for himſelf, and to arm us with his armour that is invincible, that no aſſault of all the weapons of unrighteouſneſs can prevaile againſt. O now we are warriors in the lambs power, and with him do fight the great battail in this the day of God almightie; what remains for us? but to fill up the meaſure of his ſufferings, that if we ſuffer with him, we may raign in the glorious life which riſeth in our hearts, to give us the victorie over ſin, death and hell; and him that is the Prince of the power of the aire, the ſpirit that now rules in the children of diſobedience, which are ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeys the light by which they are lighted, and ſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the children of the light, and ſtill invents new wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of deceiveablneſs of unrighteouſneſs, with their wiles and ſnares if it were poſſible to draw us into the pit of darkneſs, in which they wallow up and down, and are drunk with the ſpirit of darkneſs, which makes them reel to and fro, but God hath made known unto us the ſtable everlaſting truth, and only way of ſalvation; that we may be a fixed people, not like wandring ſtars, nor blazing Comets to make a great appearance and ſhew in the time of proſperitie, when no perſecution is, but when the Dragon is up with the ſtrength of his power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that he appears in the open field like <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to incamp the Saints of the moſt high; And ſo appearing as if he would devoure and ſwallow up, and deſtroy all before him; and when the Captain of the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Band comes forth to defie the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to deſtroy his little Camp, then not to hide the head, but in the faith of little <hi>David</hi> to come forth, as with a ſling and a ſtone to the wounding of this great

               <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſo to diſcomfit the whole Hoaſt of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine</hi> Band of carnal Warriors; O my friends, we do not now Wreſtle with fleſh and blood, but againſt principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and againſt powers, and the rulers of the darkneſs of this World, and againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places, and therefore had need to be furniſhed with the ſpiritual Armour of God, and to be filled with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous power; And that now in this day to put on the whole armour of him; not here a little and there a piece, but to be like armed ſouldiers that is going into the open field, into a hot battail, and in the face of a cruel reſolved enemie to kill and lay waſte all before him; ſo that in this the day wherein every one having a teſtimony in their hearts for God may feele him preparing and furniſhing them with a full reſolution to encounter, and give this cruel reſolved enemy battail, that we may ſee <hi>the Lord fighting for mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and for the hill thereof</hi>; O my friends and brethren of this camp of God, we have a faithful and valiant Captain, whoſe cauſe it is that we are ingaged in, and can there be a more Nobler and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſe, then the cauſe we have undertaken, and God hath called us by the ſound of his eternal Word, that hath awakened our hearts, and is a furniſhing and arming of his with the ſpirit that yet was never overcome, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, nor never ſhall be; though many of his faithful Warriors have not loved their lives unto death for this cauſe, and ſo have falne a ſleep as to the outward man; yet hath been Conquerors in the Lord, and life of the Lamb, over all the enemies, and have had an eternal Crown of life and peace ſet upon their heads. And ſo it's not being conquered becauſe of ſuffering, but it's a Crown and Victory won by being faithful unto death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40359:3"/>
in the well-doing. And therefore this is a Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a brotherlie and friendly Invitation or Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to all to come forth in the true armour of light, to ingage in faithfulneſs in this bleſſed War, and Work of God. O let none be intangled with the fears of the loſs of this carnal outward life, neither let the hearts of any be incumbred with the many things of this World. O let all that makes mention of the name of the Lord and of his living truth, not be drawn aſide from the holding of it forth, by any fears of the looſing theſe outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, but let all be given up to the Lord, and for his living truth, that muſt raign and rule for ever, that ſo none may loſe their part and portion in it, when it ſhall have the throne over all. O we that are choſen and faithful, are the lambs Warriors, and muſt War in faithfulneſs unto the end of our race we have to run, while we have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this mortal, that mortalitie may be ſwallowed up of life. O every one that is turned to the light of the Lord, and from the darkneſs of this world is concerned in this day of the lambs War; and all who have waited for the great day of Gods ſalvation, to be redeemed out of the many things into that World that hath no end; O the Kingdom that we War for, is glorious, and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever; It is a Kingdom of righteouſneſs and of peace; its a Kingdom of life and love, reſt and aſſurance for ever; a Kingdom that hath no end. It's a Kingdome that raigns over all the Kingdoms of men, and all that are begotten by the Word of this Kingdom, and into the meaſure of this hope to wait to feel the reſurrection of the Juſt one, are ſubjects of this Kingdom, and have a part and portion therein, and ſo are concerned in the weightie matters of it. O my friends, let all that have a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40359:3"/>
part and portion in this Kingdom of Peace; be as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old in ſuch a capacitie as they were, that eat of the Paſſeover, ready with their ſtaves in their hands to paſſe out of <hi>Egipt</hi> to the land of Reſt, with reſolved mindes to encounter with all the difficulties that ſtands in the way, and that may purſue behind, that the Victorie may be known to be obtained by the Lambs povver: O the Lord doth ſight for Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as I ſaid, and for the hill thereof; and my dear friends, great is the love of God unto his people in this day, as in the daies of old, and his Cauſe the ſame: And much more glorie is to be revealed, it being the laſt daies: O let none ſtay behind, but as the Lord invites and draws forth, and inclines the heart and mind, ſo let obedience be to him, and every one be readie prepared to take part with the ſufferings for the Lords ſake, and his innocent Cauſe in this day; And let every one take heed of that ſpirit that draws back, and ſeeks to hide its head till the ſtorme be over, and leave ſome of the weak ones to the heat of the battail, who are but young and tender. O let the ſtrong come forth and ſhew their ſtrength, that the weak may be ſtrengthened, and the feeble be ſupported by their Valour and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that have had a time of growth, and have known the goings forth of the vvonderful povver of God in the daies that are paſt; vvhen they vvere young and tender. O it is a day that everie one muſt be tried, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the upright to be knovvn; therefore let everie one ſhake themſelves from the duſt of this vvorld, and put on ſtrength and courage to come forth, to meet vvith the dark enemie by the arme of light to encounter vvith him, and to put him to flight in all his ſhifts, and holes in vvhich he ſeeks to hide his head, and ever and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40359:4"/>
anon to ſtart forth when he thinks he hath advantage to deceive, and if he cannot deceive by his wiles and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then he will with rage and furious madneſs come forth to devoure and deſtroy if he could the innocent; Yet ſo to be found like valiant ſouldiers of the Lamb, as not to ſtart back, nor be afraid of any of his aſſaults, wiles, threats, nor cruelties, but to ſtand ſtill in the ſtrength of the Lambs power, in which the victorie is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over all, and certainlie the victorie is ſealed unto the faithful Warriors and followers of the Lamb, and we do ſee and feel that Victorie is obtained, and obtaining day by day, ſo that the Lord is known to take part with his innocent people in this the day of his mighty power, and we are more then conquerors in the life of the Lamb, which is over all; And that in the time of the greateſt need he is neere unto, to ſtand by and defend us, and to plead the cauſe of himſelf that he hath be truſted us with, and hath counted us worthie to ſuffer for, and to bear in our bodies the dying of our Lord Jeſus, that the life of Jeſus may be manifeſted in our mortal fleſh, ſo that his life may raigne and rule in all our hearts, and we to be ſubject to him, ſo that we may raign with him, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie we ſhall and do; as we ſuffer with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us arm our ſelves with patience, and wait to be armed with his power in a holy reſolution, and with a godlie fear and ſinceritie to undergo a great fight of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and to endure hardſhip as good ſouldiers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and not to fear none of the threats nor cruel dealings of our adverſaries, nor to be afraid of departing from our native countries, and relations, which may be neer and dear to us, but let the precious truth of our God be unto us the neareſt and deareſt of all. And let
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40359:4"/>
us give up life and libertie, and all unto the Lord, who takes care for us, and will never leave any that truſt in him. And this is my friendly exhortation, and brotherlie invitation to all the followers of the Lamb, in this the day of his battail and war with the dragon and his power. Dear friends, great is my love unto you all, who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and great is the tender deſires and breathings of my life for all the weak and feeble ones, and ſtrong is the conſolation that will be witneſſed in all that ſtands out of themſelves in this day of trial. And in that which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deny ſelf, in which the comfort and conſolation is known which is beyond all words. And ſo in the living eternal Word of God, which lives and abides for ever, feel to live in, in all times that in it you may be inriched with all ſpiritual Wiſdom and underſtanding, and ſo to depart from all that that would lead from God into the love of this world from which we are called, for therein is the darkneſs and the death, therefore let none of us in this day love the world, nor the things of the world, knowing this, that he that loveth the World, the love of the Father is not in him; ſo the mightie God of my life and my ſtrength preſerve you in the pure fear of his great Name, that is become as a pleaſant oyntment to all his beloved Virgins, which are chaſt unto him, and not joined unto any other lover, but he alone is the onely beloved of their ſouls; ſo my dear friends and brethren, in what ſtate and condition of ſufferings you be, or out of ſufferings let us all be readie with our Lamps trimmed and burning, that when the Lord calls to do his will for us to be witneſſes for his Name ſake, we may be alvvaies readie, and caſting of every vveight and burthen, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may hinder us in our journie to War vvith the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40359:5"/>
povver of darkneſs that is riſen to make War vvith the Lamb and his follovvers, but that vve may follovv the Lamb vvhether-ſoever he goes: And ſo this is my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Viſitation unto you, and a bidding of you to farevvel in the God of my life, vvho is my reſt and peace in this time of my outvvard impriſonment for the teſtimonie of his everlaſting truth, and by the vvills of men ſentenced for Tranſportation, but free in him vvho hath made free from ſin and death, and hath ſet our feet upon the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting rock, againſt vvhich the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile. But in the everlaſting arme of his Povver, vve ſhall be kept for ever as vve follovv him fullie, ſo God Almightie preſerve you all. Amen ſaith my ſoul.</p>
