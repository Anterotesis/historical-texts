         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
Of the
Small-Pox, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OUR late <hi>Universal Loss,</hi> as it has given op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to many Reverend, Learned and
Ingenious Persons to oblige the World
with the just Character of this Great and Good
<hi>PRINCESS,</hi> than whom, these Nations in
many Ages have not afforded a Nobler Subject:
So for the sake of all those who are yet to run the
Risque of this <hi>Distemper</hi> for their Lives; that the
lesser Barks may happily avoid those Rocks, on
which the <hi>Royal Soveraign</hi> was lost, I shall with all
plainness and brevity give an account of the Rise
and Nature of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and all Putrid Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
for if that be not throughly understood, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61067:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are liable to innumerable Errours and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
which too oft (God knows) prove fatal
to those they are concern'd about.</p>
            <p>I very well know what I have to say is unusual,
but since it is most true; for I take not these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on Trust but Tryal. I confess I can't but
deeply regret the World was not better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with what I now offer to their serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
before the Glory of our Age was past
receiving any Advantage by it.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: The very <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of my
Discourse is this; That the Venom of these <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers</hi>
is of a <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and <hi>Viscous</hi> Nature, and
being so, there is but one way to Expel or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it; all other Experiments being not only
altogether useless, but highly injurious.</p>
            <p>Those that have taken the pains to enquire into
the Causes of things, have found that <hi>Sulphurs</hi> are
both the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Venom</hi> of Bodies.</p>
            <p>The first of the Nature of <hi>Light,</hi> so rarified
that 'tis not perceptible, but by its Effects, some
of which are these, it <hi>Tinctures</hi> the Blood in which
is its chief Residence, it Irradiates and enlivens
the whole Body, every part of which is animated
by it: If it be supprest, Diseases prevail; if as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
it has power sufficient to work them off; if


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61067:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
extinguisht, Death necessarily and inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
for 'tis the <hi>Animal Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>Sulphureity</hi> is of a far different nature,
the Matter out of which all <hi>Fiery Diseases</hi> are shap't;
'tis <hi>Crude, Viscous, Corrosive</hi> and <hi>Malign;</hi> yet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deals well enough with it, throwing it off
continually by her proper Passages; till by some
accident or other they are obstructed, being pent
up it returns, and being a more materiated <hi>Fire,</hi>
feeds on the gross indigested humours, assimilating
to its likeness whatever it lays hold on, and thus
it grows more Corporeal, Dense, and a potent Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom;
insinuating its Contra-natural Heat into
the whole Mass of Blood, which is thereby imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inflam'd and corrupted: And according
to the quantity and Venemous quality of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Fire, the Distemper terminates in a <hi>Fever</hi>
less or more Malignant; or in <hi>Small-Pox,
Measles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Life, not able to keep House
with this Guest, there arises a terrible Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and since on the decision of this Quarrel no
less than Life depends, a Fundamental Knowlege
is here most necessary, not only of the Cause, but
of the Nature of the Cause; since it produces a
clear Judgment, and a certainty in Practice:


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61067:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whereas when People Act in the dark they are
always at a loss, and know not to what they owe
the success or misfortune that befals 'em: But
trying many Experiments the poor Patients of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as their last Refuge, are forc't into the cold
Arms of Death, the only shelter from so many
Calamities.</p>
            <p>To my Purpose; this Venom being, as I said
before, <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and <hi>Viscous,</hi> 'tis further requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to know the Nature of this Sulphureous Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosity,
since 'tis easie to deal with what we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>Now in few Words, the Nature of such Bodies
is at first to ascend in the form of a light and thin
Vapour, which unduly detain'd grows more pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,
gross and corporal, and then most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be expel'd, till by some inward Agent it
be again rarified into the form of a Vapour. And
this Task the Spirit of Life only is able to perform:
Tho' at present, being overpower'd by these Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
Mists and Fogs, it likes lie the <hi>Sun</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a thick Cloud unable to expand its Beams:
But when it receives auxilliary Force by proper
Cordials of a temperate and lively Nature, with
ease it drives out this Intruder, and restores the
Body to its former Vigour and strength. For do


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61067:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not mistake, and think that Cordials alone do this,
'tis impossible. And this is the reason why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
Ladies, Nurses and old Women, whom
Experience only makes Wise, often serve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of Nature by promoting her Design, tho'
by plain and Ordinary Means, which refresh the
Animal Spirits, and enable them to go through
their Task. Yet there is a vast difference in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
and things of that Nature given in this case;
for that only is a true Medicine which is so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that it chears the <hi>Spirits,</hi> expels the <hi>Distemper,</hi>
and at the same time abates the Fever; nay car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
off a great part of the Malignity insensibly
through the Pores, which would have turn'd to
<hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and tho' not an <hi>Opiate,</hi> gives an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
not to be understood, but by those
that feel it. And as <hi>Opiates</hi> always make dull,
stupid and Stomach sick; so this makes brisk,
lively and cheerful; and yet when the time of
rest comes, causes the Sleep to be sound and sweet.</p>
            <p>And now I'm oblig'd to show the uselessness
and danger of other Methods: And since <hi>Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
is the first thing commonly prescrib'd, I
shall begin with that, and do solemnly protest,
it is my Opinion, that in this Distemper there is
no more occasion for a <hi>Chyrurgion</hi> than there is for


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61067:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a <hi>Bone-setter;</hi> nor is it only useless, but highly
dangerous; for when the Blood is in a great Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in order to throw off what ever is obnoxious,
at that time to let any of it out, is as if we should
do so to Liquors in Fermentation, which every
Body knows would hinder their Working over; to
which there is required a fullness.</p>
            <p>To fat People 'tis more pernicious, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not so fiery, but more apt to receive a
check, and have the Venom congeal'd before it
reaches the <hi>Superficies;</hi> To lean hotter Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
'tis less dangerous, tho' safe for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
No fear People should burst or dye for
want of outlets, every <hi>Pore</hi> will prove a <hi>Portal</hi> wide
enough, when the Matter is sufficiently rarified from
within: But when the Blood is let out the empty
space is immediatly fill'd (for Nature admits no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum)
with a cool thin Air, which causes this
Vapour that is of a heavier Nature to flat; sink,
and fall back on the Vitals, of which an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Proof is the depression of the Spirits, and sick
Qualms of dangerous consequence, if immediate
relief be not given. Nor is this all, for the Blood
as I said before, being the very Mansion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Life, as the Scripture it self bears Witness,
you part with your dearest Friend, under pretence
of expelling an Enemy, which yet you can never


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61067:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do this way, tho' you should draw it half out; no
more than you can fine thick muddy Liquors by
such unlikely Experiments; For what's left is as
bad still. But we daily see when by a lively
Principle within they have work't out and
thrown off all that is of a contrary Nature, they
fine and grow clear, without any more adoe, and
then are at rest, as all <hi>Agents</hi> are when they have
attained their end.</p>
            <p>Another common Practice is <hi>Blistering</hi> and <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
which tho' not quite so bad, are yet without
use, but not without danger. For as it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to draw out inward fiery Venoms (unless they
were beforehand mounted near the Skin) by an
outward Application, which only attracts Watry
Substances: So considering this Distemper as
such, a fiery Venom, 'tis hereby depriv'd of the
Moisture necessary for its Latitude and Allay, in
both which respects 'tis of vast concern to keep it
within, that joining with the heat or unnatural
fire, they may between them from an <hi>Air,</hi> and so
rise with ease and safety to the <hi>Patient;</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus temper'd and allay'd they are generally
of a large sort, that don't leave deep Marks.
Whereas, were the the Moisture drawn off, as the
Heat wou'd grow violently intense, so neither


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61067:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would it (without great force) breath out: But
circulate and prey on all it finds within, to the
utter extinction of the Lamp of Life.</p>
            <p>I know the general Incentive both to <hi>Blood-letting</hi>
and <hi>Blistering,</hi> is that the <hi>Fever</hi> is high,
and they fear it may get into the Head, and
these are of great use to prevent it, as also to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a number of <hi>Small-Pox</hi> from coming out.</p>
            <p>I grant indeed there is a likelyhood of these <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
Fumes</hi> in their rising, to get into the Head,
nay of making the Patient talk Idly too, for they
are of an intoxicating Nature, but of no more
Danger than the <hi>Fumes</hi> of Wine, provided no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
be committed to make them strike back.
For when they come to the <hi>Superfices</hi> of the Skin,
the <hi>Watry</hi> and more <hi>Aerial</hi> Part, which as a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle</hi>
helpt it thither, easily passing through the
Pores Wings away; and the other being <hi>Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous</hi>
and gross, receiving a check from the Air,
settles there in its own <hi>Fiery from,</hi> and then the
Head is clear and settled, the Spirits brisk and
lively, the Appetite pretty good, and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
abated.</p>
            <p>As for the other Advantage pretended of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
a good Face, I have more than once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
this: That when <hi>Physitians</hi> by <hi>Drawing-Blood,</hi>


               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61067:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or giving cooling things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have sunk the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and hinder'd the kindly coming out, which
is never so well as at Natures first attempt, the
Patient on the return of the Venom, growing
Heart-sick and opprest almost to Death, to gain
the Point they have lost, they have been forc't to
double their Files, and heap <hi>Cordial</hi> upon <hi>Cordial,</hi>
which being Common Preparations, and so not
divested of their own unnatural heat, as they
ought to be, have increased the Fever, and drove
out more than can well be maintained: And these
Pit most, are a very smal sort, and of great viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and danger. Because Nature now having
done her utmost, if she be baffled once more, a
thousand to one resigns.</p>
            <p>But that I may comprize all in few words,
whatever rebates, drives back, stupifies, dejects,
overcools, makes great discharges of any kind;
or on the other hand, whatever over-heats, drives
out too forcibly, and fires the Spirits, is directly
contrary to these Distempers, which ought so to
be manag'd, that the Natural, not Unnatural
Heat be assisted, the former being the very Agent
that must do the Work; which if allow'd: A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
rightly qualifi'd ought to have these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties;
That it be stript of all false fire, which


<pb facs="tcp:61067:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would assist and heighten the Distemper. That
instead thereof it be plentifully furnisht with the
Salubrious Principles of Life and Sanity, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyning in this extremity with that <hi>Vital Spark</hi>
within us; That it be of Ability to clear the
first passages insensibly in the Operation; yet
most sensibly in the Effect: For this is no time
for Violent Means: That it likewise be endow'd
with a Power to compose and quiet the Spirits,
by bringing to equality and unity the Principles
which are at Variance: And not as <hi>Opiats</hi> (which
stupifying the Senses for a while) detain and tye
down, not only the Spirits, but the Distemper,
hindring its going off in its proper season, and
Nature from assisting; so that when its Somnife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Virtue is spent, you find you have lost time,
the Patient only growing sensibly weaker, but the
Distemper remaining in its full Vigor and more
Fatal.) And that in a word, by its innate Virtue
(with God's blessing) it can bring you safe thro'
this dangerous Disease to your desir'd Health, and
a more than ordinary Strength; and such a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
is the <hi>Panacea,</hi> of which the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
Treats.</p>

               <head>Some Account of a Universal Remedy.</head>
               <p>THE Contemplation of Man's Body (tho'
Dead) in its wonderful Structure by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical
Display is a curious View: But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of him alive in his vital Form and Spring
of Action enlivening the whole, is a more Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Review.</p>
               <p>'Tis to my purpose at present to behold him
inform'd with the principle of Coelestial Fire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling
vital <hi>Airs,</hi> and stretching 'em thro' the
whole Circumference, promoting thereby an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Nourishing Heat to every Organ of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and by a Magnetick Love, panting after the
Universal Breath of the World, and sucking thro'
the Medium of the <hi>Air,</hi> a continued Reparation
of Enlivening Beams to his <hi>Central Spirit,</hi> from the
Fountain of Life and Form, the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus United the Lesser to the greater
World, by joyning breath to breath, my design is
to shew how this inbred Fire is maintain'd, may
be enlarg'd, and when perverted and wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a destructive Heat and Fire against Nature, by
Art, may be reclaim'd to an Oleose, Soft, Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heat, from its harsh, inrag'd consuming Fire.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61067:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But before I proceed, I must take care to keep
under the warm influences of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and regard
him as the common Parent of us all, and the
Soul of the World, a Globe of Central Sulphur
Gloriously Illuminating dark and shady Bodies (I
had almost aid Understandings too) whose Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
Principle, endow'd with an hidden Fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
bestows quickening Virtues on all the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
Natures of the Earth, whereby numberless
Efficacies and vital Breathings are convey'd thro'
Spiritual Channels, for the avoiding Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and replenishing them with <hi>Light,</hi> Adequate
to that Tincture of <hi>Light</hi> which powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
mixt Bodies: So that <hi>He</hi> may truly be call'd
the <hi>Heart</hi> of the Universe, deriving Life to all
parts, and impregnating decaying Nature with
new Vitality.</p>
               <p>This Magazeen of the Empyrean Heaven,
where the <hi>Light</hi> first seiz'd upon matter, fills with
Light and Life, the soft and yeilding Natures of
the <hi>Air,</hi> which cannot be suppos'd a nothing, or
an empty space, but an Essential Body of its own,
admitting of great Powers and Virtues, where the
matter is swallow'd up by its Form, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into a Nature almost Spiritual. For where
Form and Matter meet in equal poise or just Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61067:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the matter's rescu'd from all Blemishes and
Accidents, and freed in a wonderful manner from
Infection and Corruption.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Air</hi> thus richly stor'd with beams of Life
and Universal Sperm supplies the various kinds
of being on the Earth, according to the strength
of their Specifick Magnets. And it does so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound
in Principles, they cannot take em off
her hands, and she so lusts to be Imbodied, that
where there's an aptness to Congelation, she'll
strike the form of her <hi>Spiritual Essence:</hi> As I have
strictly observ'd the Rime in an Hoar-Frosty
Morn exactly shot into <hi>Stiria,</hi> which are the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures
of abounding Volatiles.</p>
               <p>And now 'tis time to derive this flowing
Bounty to the Sons of Men, who lift up their
Heads to Heaven for Life and Breath, and all
things, and well they may; for I know not where
else they'l feed their vital Flame: Since nothing
more humours the <hi>Tincture of Life</hi> in Man,
or his animal Fire, than the Nutritive beams from
the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that Spark of Original <hi>Sulphur</hi> which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes
into Redness, the Mass of Blood is the
Spring of Natural Fire and radical Moisture, and
the <hi>Sun</hi> in the little World, <hi>Man;</hi> discenter'd from


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61067:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the great <hi>Luminary:</hi> But held in Life by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
of large Breathings, whereby he repairs
his Store from that inexhausted Fountain.</p>
               <p>In vain then shall I look for a fit Remedy amidst
the Domestick or Exotick Drugs for Man. By
Food he may, and must supply a <hi>Faecunda Terra,</hi>
but this is but dunging the Ground, by Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he must support his <hi>Vital Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus pointed out the Noblest Principle
of Life in Man, I wou'd give a little aim at a
suitable Medicine adequate thereto, as the most
apt to repair and set him right when decay'd or
over-power'd; and of such a Nature are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd
Sulphureous Sparks of the Universe
collected at certain Seasons of the year, when the
<hi>Air</hi> is richly impregnated: but the manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting,
and further knowledg of what is taken,
together with the Artful handling of the matter
are too curious and troublesome Niceties. For
who wou'd take the pains to reunite Atoms, and
consult the Poise so strictly in the cotempering of
Principles, as just to give the Dominion to a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sulphur: but such a temperament obtain'd
becomes a Medicine Spiritually fixt, and a noble
Preservative against the Spirit of Diseases, and its
consequent Materiation by contact with material


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61067:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus our internal <hi>Air</hi> maintain'd (by Art upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
free from disturbance or Venoms, is always
salubrious and pleasant.</p>
               <p>It plain enough appears, that the truest Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
for the Life of Man is a well exalted <hi>Sulphur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
whereby it becomes <hi>Spiritualiz'd,</hi> not <hi>Volatiliz</hi>'d. But
betwixt these two words lies seven years labour,
with brains too. 'Tis sufficient then to <hi>suggest the
Nature of it,</hi> that it may appear at least harmless.</p>
               <p>Since I assum'd this Notion of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as the
most Essential Principle of Life, I have revolv'd
again and again the most powerful Specifick Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs,
especially those of the Mineral Nature,
which are difficulty enough obtain'd in <hi>Purity,</hi>
and notwithstanding <hi>Art,</hi> they will retain some
Portion of <hi>their Specifick Venoms,</hi> which are not to
be destroy'd but by the Death of the <hi>Species:</hi> So
strongly is Nature determin'd to the preservation
of her <hi>Kind.</hi> I could Instance in many of 'em
that retain very <hi>Churlish Qualities</hi> after all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Art about them, such as <hi>Vomiting, Purging,
Sweating,</hi> &amp;c. meerly as Venemous to our <hi>Bodies,</hi>
tho they are banter'd off, as <hi>having a Contest only
with Offending Humours.</hi> I have us'd 'em in my
Practice, and know as well what they are, and can
do, as another.</p>

After abundance of Experiments and Tryals,
for the <hi>attaining of Noble Pleasant Medicines:</hi> I
must confess, I think my self not a little Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in my <hi>Art of drawing down</hi> from <hi>the Sun</hi> and <hi>Air</hi>
plenty of <hi>illuminated Sulphurs,</hi> and in my Skill of
<hi>ordering 'em</hi> so as to result in the most effectual and
pleasant <hi>Remedy;</hi> which is <hi>Preservative, Curative</hi>
and <hi>Restorative,</hi> able at once to season the whole
Fountain, so as to cleanse it self and all its
streams. Far unlike to <hi>other Medicines,</hi> which are
reputed Good for some <hi>One Disease,</hi> and that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
<hi>kill</hi> instead of <hi>cure.</hi> But <hi>this Medicine</hi> (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in an <hi>appropriate Vehicle,</hi>) is render'd dispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to all Persons, under any Circumstances, and
as salubrious as the most refin'd <hi>Air.</hi> And this I
call my <hi>Panacea,</hi> which I think abundantly more
<hi>difficult to make,</hi> than to make it appear to be of
such General Use, as the Nature of the Thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and the Experience of it can attest. But
I'le not much concern my self <hi>to gain Proselytes.</hi> I
would have it valu'd only at the <hi>Rate of its Real
worth,</hi> and my self <hi>not too much undervalu'd</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the Author of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Universal Matter</hi> once <hi>obtain'd,</hi> may be Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>thought productive</hi> of a <hi>Universal Remedy.</hi> Now
no <hi>passive actuated matter is undetermin'd,</hi> and I have


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61067:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
already declar'd <hi>against Specificks,</hi> and <hi>Dead Matter</hi>
is not for my turn. The <hi>Living, Permanent, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Matter of the World</hi> is my Subject, which (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
'tis render'd fusible by <hi>Art</hi>) penetrates the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Center of Life,</hi> bringing with it the Riches of
Superiour Orbs, Generously enriching Nature's
Store with <hi>Beams of Life</hi> and <hi>Balmy Fire,</hi> enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her <hi>Magnetick Virtue;</hi> whereby she <hi>Vigorously</hi>
attracts both <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Common Food,</hi> assimilating
them to her wholsom Nature. Hereby tender
<hi>Stamina Vitae</hi> become Robust, the body haile and
strong, quick and bright, able to dispel diseasie
Forms, and resist their first Attempts. For the due
Feeding, and Maintaining the Animal fire in its
Resplendent Lustre, at once forbids all Jars, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
False Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and gives a Free Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body in all its necessary and pleasant
Actions.</p>
               <p>Truly to sweeten, unite and strengthen the
Mass of Blood, is of huge Advantage: And 'tis
not Vomiting, Purging, nor Steel, nor Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
Powders, nor washing with Waters will do
the Business: A Course of pure <hi>Air,</hi> with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,

But to restore <hi>Essential Sulphur,</hi> the Origin of
the Tincture of the Blood, and subdue fixt Salts,
inferring Corrosive Fires, and renew and increase
a sweet Vital <hi>Air,</hi> is the Work rather of a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi>

Philosophical, and an entire <hi>Dispensatory.</hi>

               <p>Having now Regal'd the Spirits with this live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mellow Remedy; from so good a stock we may
derive fresh Vigour to the branches, Plumpness to
the whole, and cause every part to rejoyce with
'em; for their Nourishment depends so much on a
wholesome Fountain, that Health or Diseases are
communicated to 'em according to the decay or
strength, Purity or Impurity of it. And what a
<hi>Catalogue of Distempers</hi> is assign'd to the sundry <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of the Body,</hi> and Elaborate Methods and
Medicines for their Cure? When as a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<hi>Principle of Life,</hi> benignly darts at once
kind Rays throughout the whole, assisting with
proper Vigour the Faculties, duely to separate
what ought to be discharg'd through the cleansing
<hi>Ducts,</hi> and refine and purifie what should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>

What need then is there to run out the Ordure
by Violent Purgatives, and the wholesome Juices
too, sharpened and envenom'd first by Physick,
even to the Excoriation of Bowels, and damage
of the adjacent parts? Many are mistaken in
this Point, and many take the Advantage of it.
The blood is not at all purified thereby, nor
sweetened; but often exasperated and fretted by
such Contraries. Besides, the bowels well fill'd
keep out <hi>Wind, Cholicks, Gripes, Twistings,</hi> and
many more <hi>Disorders:</hi> And what Hurt in the
Congestion of wholesome Food?</p>
               <p>It seems to be the design of Nature, by the
<hi>Length, Windings</hi> and <hi>Position of the Guts</hi> in such
order, that there should be due Retentions. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
in Dung</hi> we that experiment by Heats, know
to be the Truest and most Natural. The Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
then of the Great Gut call'd <hi>Colon,</hi> the last
but one, and the Amassment of the <hi>Feces</hi> in it, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the <hi>Great Organs</hi> of <hi>Digestion and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
shew that Nature had a design from that <hi>warm
bed</hi> to comfort and assist the Neighbouring <hi>Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For such as are always flurting and jerking their
bowels with <hi>purging Physick,</hi> less than one yard of


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61067:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a strait Gut (from the <hi>Pylorus</hi> to the <hi>Anus</hi>) had been
better for them. Nevertheless, I don't say, but
discreet Evacuations, at some times, are truely
Necessary for some, and the <hi>Drinking of Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Waters,</hi> in their Seasons, as <hi>Epsom, North-hall,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danger</hi> of <hi>Vomits, Diaphoreticks, Blisters, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livations,
improper Bleedings, Opiates, internal Stiptick
Medicines,</hi> &amp;c. ought to be discover'd; but I'le pass
'em by at present; for the <hi>very thoughts of 'em</hi> Jar
my Nerves.</p>
               <p>Since I can with this Remedy keep the stomach
and bowels clean from <hi>Choler, Flegm</hi> and <hi>Wind,</hi>
and make a quick and clean <hi>Digestion,</hi> what needs
<hi>Vomiting and Purging?</hi> 'Twill cause a Generous
Transpiration; No occasion then to melt and

               <p>It helps to sound and undisturbed sleep; No

While some lay on with <hi>Vomit, Purge, Blister, Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Helter, Skelter, blowing up, pulling down,</hi> like the

instead of crying <hi>Oh!</hi> I sweetly feed her Vital
Flame, and give fresh Vigour to her <hi>Languishing</hi> or
<hi>Fretted Spirits:</hi> And from a Rich Store-House
derive 'em strong and mellow to all the withering
and enfeebled branches, Reconciling Feuds and
Quarrels by giving satisfaction to every disturb'd
Member of the Body. All the Juices thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd,

parts supply'd with both are Agil, Plump and

               <p>I have been more than Twenty Years a Great

every way about 'em, and have at any Rate
possess'd my self of the Reputed Best. And I sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61067:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
profess I slight 'em all for this, knowing it

               <p>The Height of common <hi>Chymistry</hi> is to mount
a Volatile Salt, that is quick, pungent and fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
This Medicine is no such thing: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatly enricht with <hi>spiritual Sulphurs,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

               <p>But that <hi>the design'd Benefit of this Discourse</hi>
may not be lost, I must, for the sake of some
persons, descend to particulars.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Declining Age,</hi> when the Fire abates,
and Moisture, Clouds and Cold Diseases pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
with the <hi>Decay of Organs</hi> by the Impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
of <hi>Spirits,</hi> through their often Eclips'd
and declining Sun: Nothing more aptly repairs
the Central Fire and Radical Moisture; whereby
not only <hi>Diseases</hi> are dispers'd, but the whole body
is replenish'd with proper Nourishing Juices: So
as to recover, in some measure, Quickness and
Strength of Parts; at least to furnish 'em with
Good Appetite, strong Digestion, liberal Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Wind, Large and Clean Breathings, free
from Clammy, Tough Humours; Clarity of
Brain and Senses, and an entire dissipation of the


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61067:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Winter Diseases. So that Prolongation of Life,
and pleasant Enjoyment of it need not to be
doubted, since God gives means thereto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be perswaded at Seventy to sit quietly
down with the Common Wear and Tare of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is more than needs: For such hail Principles
as could reach thither, may with timely good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
pass on I know not whither.</p>
               <p>To such as are coming into the World, as well as
those that are going out, and bring with them he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Diseases, or an unthriving Nature, 'tis
of singular Advantage: For next to the benefit of
being deriv'd from Parents of a sound and strong
Constitution, there is nothing more beneficial than
to convey by their first Food Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Health, which may prove as lasting as
their Lives. To be drank by the Nurses while the
Children suck.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Compleat Medicine to such as have a
general disorder, or decay of body and spirits,
and know not where to lay the blame.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Consumptive Persons,</hi> and those endangered
by it, aptly suits all their Complaints, and needs
no Second, provided there be a proper Regimen,
and careful avoiding of injurious things. For in
a <hi>Hectick</hi> the blood having suffered a <hi>great dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61067:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and separation,</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> of it are turned into a
kind of <hi>Wildfire,</hi> which flies about, and wanting
allay, burns and consumes a person almost to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Now this excellent Medicine here becomes
a <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> sweetly attracting back again (by
Vertue of its <hi>Magnetick</hi> Quality) the dispersed
Spirits; and by reason of its likeness to the most
constituent parts of the blood, joyns it again, and
determines its Action within its own proper
Sphere. And then all things go well, and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
disappear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus this <hi>Distemper,</hi> commonly
accounted incurable, is forc'd to yeild the Victory to
this salutiferous Remedy.</p>
               <p>In every <hi>Scorbutick Distemper</hi> 'tis very available,
and acts as variously as the Scorbutick Form is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
for being a Medicine truly Natural, Nature
can use it any way to her own benefit. And it is
so Fortunate, that it cannot be taken to amend the
blood, but 'twill into the bargain communicate
Health and Vigour to all the parts of the body.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Fevers</hi> of all sorts, especially malignant, 'tis
incomparable. Whereas in the use of other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
these Distempers hold a considerable time,
with imminent danger, and often end in Death;
I have many a time, with great pleasure, beheld,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61067:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Noble Medicine surprising us with its admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Effects; taking off common <hi>Fevers</hi> in a few
Days; sometimes in 24 Hours totally. And as
for <hi>malignant Fevers,</hi> it secures the Vitals from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome by their Venom; and keeps 'em up
through the whole Course of their sickness, from
<hi>running very low.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I omit to account for the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Preceeding <hi>Discourse.</hi> Yet I may say
thus much; That I have had five Patients at one
time sick of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and through the bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God on this Medicine, not one miscarried;
altho I did <hi>not visit</hi> after they were out (having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had 'em my self) but only gave directions to
those who attended 'em.</p>
               <p>I might mention the several Concerns of Women
and Virgins, to whom I abundantly dispense it:
