         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conſider, that whiles the Prelates contend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to have it without ſpot, by their contentions they have left the Church
this Coat of Chriſt full of both. I know it is your work and wiſedome to
labour for the things that make for Peace in the Churches of the Saints.
As for a State-peace, or State-union, that's more proper for Stateſmen;
I ſhould not deſire to live to that day, to ſee the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

Power, They have gotten Power into their hands by policy, exerciſe it by
cruelty, and they will loſe it with ignominy. As it was ſaid of <hi>Boniface,</hi> he
entred the Popedome like a Fox, reigned like a Lyon, but dyed like a Dog:
Reverend Fathers and Brethren, as you have not bin aſhamed of my chain,

            <p>I May ſay as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, though a good Conſcience be ſufficient for my ſelf,
yet a good name is neceſſary for others; a good name is as precious oyntment,
yet there will not be wanting many flying reports to corrupt it; many are
the obloquies and reproaches which by the Sonnes of ſlander are caſt upon
me, they would faine have my name to be buried and rot above ground, before
my friends can bury my body under it, yet herein is my comfort, there will be a
reſurrection of names as well as of bodies at the laſt day; I am aſſured that God
will not only wipe off all tears from mine eyes, but all reproaches from my name
alſo; I am, as ſaith the Apoſtle, counted a Deceiver, yet True; as an Apoſtate, yet
firm to my firſt principles.</p>
            <p>There are two things at which offence is taken, firſt my Petitioning for my
life to the Parliament (ſo called;) ſecondly, my giving in a Narrative of
the whole matter; to both which I ſhall give full ſatisfaction. About my Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,
a double offence is taken, firſt at the titles of my Petitions; ſecondly at the
matter of them. I ſhall ſpeak briefly to both, to take away any ſtumbling block
out of the way of any. Touching the Titles of my four Petitions they run in this
forme.</p>
            <p>To the Supreme Authority, the Parliament of the Common-wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although I am far from going about to juſtifie their right to this Title to whom
I give it, yet I ſhall juſtifie the lawfulneſſe of my practice in giving them this Title
which they aſſume to themſelves, eſpecially in a caſe of life as mine is: for in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
matters I had rather loſe my own right which belongs to me, than give
them this Title which belongs not to them.</p>
            <p>The reaſons which ſway with me why I gave them this Title (though I am not
ſatisfied they have a right to it) are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. They would not receive my Petitions without giving them their aſſumed Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;
yea to my knowledge they have rejected Petitions which have not had theſe
Titles.</p>
            <p>2. I am upon ſure and clear grounds perſwaded, that giving to men Titles
they aſſume to themſelves, is not a reall owning that they have a right to thoſe
Titles. Titular and reall are uſually diſtinguiſhed; by giving them the Title of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, and Parliament, I do acknowledge them a Titular Authority,
and a Titular Parliament, but by ingaging to them (which I have never done, and
I hope ſhall never do) I do acknowledge them a reall Authority, and a reall
Parliament: that I may further evince the truth of this ſecond reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that
giving of Titles to men they aſſume to themſelves, is not a reall owning that they
have a reall right to thoſe Titles, I ſhall give ſundry inſtances in Scripture to make
it good;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. &amp; 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Titles, but ſeems meerly to diſtinguiſh thoſe perſons or things from others that
are called by other names or Titles; as I call them at Whitehall a Councell of
State, to diſtinguiſh them from a Councell of Warre, I call thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
the Parliament of the Common-wealth, to diſtinguiſh them from the Lords and
Commons aſſembled in Parliament.</p>
            <p>4. Titles are giving to things or perſons ſometimes meerly by alluſion, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
as in Scripture phraſe ſin is ſaid to reigne, and the Devils are ſaid to
rule, not that either the one or the other hath an approved right to
rule over man, as a lawfull Prince hath to rule over his Subjects, but they are
ſaid to reign or rule by way of alluſion to the reign of Princes in their Dominions.</p>
            <p>5. Titles may be given without ſin to perſons or things, though of right they
belong not to them, where they are generally received or mentioned by ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
by the people where I live. About names and titles much indulgence is to be
given to the common uſages and cuſtomes of the people; I may call things or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
by ſuch names or titles as I know belongs not of right unto them, becauſe they
are ordinarily knowne, and generally received by ſuch names and titles. I could
give manifold inſtances out of Scripture to prove this; <hi>David</hi> called <hi>Abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lom</hi>
King, not that he thought him ſo of right, but becauſe he was commonly known
and generally received by that title among the people. So <hi>Herod</hi> was called by the
Evangeliſt King of the Jews, ſo did the Jews generally call him by that title, yet
none but that ſect or ſort of people called the Herodians did owne it as <hi>Herods</hi>
right to be the King of the Iews, who were ſo called becauſe they pleaded for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
to be the lawfull King of the Iews, which the Phariſes and others withſtood,
becauſe he was not one of the Iewiſh Nation, as he ought to be. <hi>Deut</hi> 17. 15. Yet
all the Iews called <hi>Herod</hi> King, though they did not acknowledge him to be
their lawfull King; tis manifeſt giving of titles are but titular acknowledgments and
no more.</p>
            <p>6. If names may without ſin be given to places and things (which belong not
to them) I ſee no reaſon why they may not be given to perſons. There are
names and titles given to many places both upon ſuperſtitious and idolatrous
grounds, yet may without ſin be uſed (I ſpeak not of the firſt impoſers) when
thoſe places are ſo called and commonly knowne by ſuch names. <hi>Luke</hi> that writ
the Acts of the Apoſtles, calls a place in <hi>Athens, Mars-hill</hi> (as it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115114:4"/>
called) and this he might do without ſin, though this name was originally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on that place in honour of <hi>Mars,</hi> yet he calls the place as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called, though called ſo upon an Idolatrous ground. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 22. So for
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings alſo we may without ſin call them by thoſe names which others give them,
though they may deal ſuperſtitiouſly or ſinfully in the firſt impoſition of ſuch names.
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> mentions a ſhip of <hi>Alexandria</hi> whoſe ſigne was <hi>Caſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi>
names originally impoſed by the Gentiles, upon an idolatrous ground, yet being
generally received, <hi>Paul</hi> calls the ſhip after this name.</p>
            <p>7. It was a matter of abſolute neceſſity (as to my life) for me to Petition them,
I being condemned to dye; tis true for a trivial, or ordinary occaſion I ſhould
never Petition them, but in an extraordinary caſe I might lawfully do it;
<hi>David</hi> in a caſe of extreme neceſſity did eat the Shew-bread, which in an ordinary
caſe he might not do. Tis true indeed, <hi>Cato</hi> would not Petition <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his life,
he had rather dye than Petition, but that I conceive was rather out of ſome animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
or height of Spirit, or petty diſcontent, than out of a rectified judgment;
for my part I am fully ſatisfied that I have not ſinned in giving them their aſſumed
Titles; Names and Titles do not determine rights, <hi>conveniunt rebus nemina ſaepe ſuis,</hi>
it is true ſometimes, but not alwayes:</p>
            <p>8. Titles men aſſume to themſelves, or are generally given by others, may be
given them by me without ſin, or without owning a right to thoſe titles; this I may
make appear by ſundry late inſtances; <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had this title given him,
<hi>Defender of the faith,</hi> yet he had no right to this title; for he defended only the
Popiſh Religion; he oppoſed the Faith rather than defended the Faith, and the
true reaſon why the Pope gave him this title <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> was becauſe
he oppoſed the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and wrote againſt him; yet none ſcrupled
to call him and the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Defenders of the Faith.</hi> So the
King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is called the Catholick King, yet he hath no true right to this title,
for he is not a Catholick or univerſall Monarch, yet our new State have lately
ſent to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> under this title, <hi>The Catholick King;</hi> ſo the King of
<hi>France</hi> is call'd the moſt Chriſtian King; ſo the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having by arms eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> writes himſelfe Prince Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſo the
King of <hi>Poland</hi> takes this title to himſelfe <hi>King of Sweden,</hi> yet hath no right to that
Kingdom; yet none that ever I heard of ſcrupled to give theſe titles to them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that titles do not determine rights, and conſidering alſo, that no addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to them will be received by them, unleſſe the titles they aſſume to themſelves
be given them by thoſe who make applications to them.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken to juſtifie the lawfulneſſe of the titles of my Petitions, I
come now to juſtifie the matter of my Petitions. Before I ſpeak to the matter of my
Petitions poſitively, I ſhall in a word declare negatively what was not the matter
of my Petitions, as,</p>
            <p>1. I did not promiſe to act any thing for the promoting and maintaining this
preſent Government, that had been equivalent to taking the engagement.</p>
            <p>2. I did not promiſe to joyne with the preſent power to oppoſe the Scotiſh Army
though I was often ſollicited to it.</p>
            <p>3. I did not declare that for which I was condemned was a ſin againſt God, I
am of the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mind I was when at the High Court after I had my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
I ſaid, Though they Condemned me, yet God and my owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
did not Condemne me, they Condemned me for Treaſon, yet my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115114:5"/>
did not tell me that it was a ſinne againſt God which they counted Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I confeſſed it was a tranſgreſſion of their Lawes, but no tranſgreſſion of any
command of God. In my firſt Petition I have theſe words,</hi> That I lay my mouth
in the duſt, that there may be hope that the Lord will pardon his manifold iniquities,
and that your Honours will paſſe by his offences contrary to your Lawes. <hi>In my ſecond
Petition I have theſe words,</hi> through unadviſedneſſe and weakneſſe he is fallen under
your ſad and heavy diſpleaſure, and hath offended againſt the Lawes of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<hi>In my third there is no mention of ſinne at all. In my fourth Petition
there is this paſſage,</hi> The conſideration whereof melteth the heart of your Petitioner,
and makes him (after a more narrow ſearch of his heart and wayes) more deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
than ever of his ſinne againſt God, and more ſorrowfull for his crimes and offences
againſt the Parliament in his late and great miſcarriages. <hi>In all which paſſages I
have not renounced the righteouſneſſe of the cauſe for which I ſuffer, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the thing it ſelfe to be ſinfull, which I ſtill maintaine as juſtifiable, and
can ſay with the Apoſtle, Happy is he that condemneth not himſelfe in the thing
which he alloweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I did not in my Petition juſtifie the acts upon which I was condemned to be
righteous; nor the Court to be legall: I do publickly proteſt againſt the former
to be moſt unrighteous, unmercifull, and ſevere Lawes, as <hi>Draco's</hi> written in
blood; and have before the High Court proteſted againſt the latter, that they
were not a leagall Court of judicature to judge me for my life, therefore I did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
plead it was my birthright to have a jury, my duty to demand it, though their
pleaſure to deny it.</p>
            <p>5. I did not abſolutely juſtifie the ſentence of the High Court, I had rather
patiently undergoe the ſentence than abſolutely to juſtifie it; I muſt confeſſe
through advice of Lawyers, and earneſt ſolicitatious of friends, I did in my laſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
after a ſort, and in ſome ſence ſay the Sentence was juſt (in what ſence I
ſhall by and by ſhew) My words are theſe, <hi>He humbly acknowledgeth he hath ſo
highly violated the Lawes of the Commonwealth, as that thereby he hath rendred
himſelfe guilty of the ſentence of death, juſtly paſt upon him by the high Court of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
In which words, firſt, I do not juſtifie their Lawes, nor, ſecondly, the
Legality of the Court, thirdly, nor the ſufficiency of the teſtimony of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
There did not any two Witneſſes evidence any one fact againſt me that was
treaſon by their new Acts, and that ſome Members of the High Court have confeſt
unto me.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken Negatively what was not the matter of my Petitions, I now come
to ſpeake poſitively what was the matter of my Petitions, wherein I
have ſaid or done nothing contrary to Conſcience, or my former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>The matter of my Petitions containes three parts, firſt, the Narratory part,
ſecondly, the Promiſſory part, thirdly the Petitionary part; At the laſt none
can be offended, (unleſſe ſuch as thirſted after my blood) in that I did but
begge a grant of my life, that I might bee reſcued from going downe
into the Grave. None can juſtly blame mee for begging my life from
any who have my life in the power of their hands; I neede not ſpeak to
that.</p>
            <p>But the two former parts of my Petitions (<hi>viz.</hi> the narratory and promiſſory
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115114:5"/>
parts) require more to be ſpoken concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As touching the Narratory part, I ſhall begin with the firſt Petition, the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
part runs thus.</hi> Most humbly ſheweth, Your Petitioner having received the
ſentence of Death by the High Court of Juſtice, is preparing himſelf in all humility,
and ſerious ſubmiſſion to drink that bitter cup, the terrour whereof, though much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
through the pardoning mercies of God, in the blood of ſprinkling, yet your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
being brought down to the duſt of Death, deſires to ſee the righteous Lord in this
Sentence; acknowledging it to be juſt with the the moſt High to cut him off, both in the
midſt of his dayes, and the midſt of his Miniſtry; but deſires to be deeply humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the mighty hand of God, lying low before the Lord and you, putting his mouth in
the duſt, that there may be hope that the Lord will pardon his manifold Iniquities,
and that your Honours would paſſe by his offences, done contrary to your Laws, which
as he formerly did, ſo ſtill doth confeſſe renders him faulty, for which he is unfeignedly
ſorry; your Petitioner goeth not about to plead excuſe, but with an humble ſubmiſſion
proſtrates himſelf at your feet, acknowledging he hath offended againſt the acts of this
Commonwealth, and thereby is fallen under your ſore diſpleaſure, of which he is very
deeply ſenſible and ſorrowfull alſo.</p>
            <p>This is all the narratory part, which I hope offends no ſober minde, nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ear, it offends ſome I have ſaid no more, it offends none (I hope) that I
have ſaid ſo much. I deſire to give you a few things to obſerve out of theſe words
in my firſt Petition. 1. I ſaid, <hi>I deſire to ſee the righteous Lord in this Sentence.</hi>
I doe acknowledge God to be righteous (what ever men are) in all that is brought
upon me, he is righteous ſhould a worſe Sentence than Death paſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I do acknowledge it to be juſt with the moſt High to cut me off, both in the
midſt of my dayes, and in the midſt of my Miniſtery.</hi> I doe not ſay it is juſt with
men, they ſhall anſwer for what they have done; but it is juſt with God, he is juſt
in mens injuſtice, and righteous in mens unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>3. I ſay in my Petition, That <hi>I deſire to be deeply humbled under the mighty hand
of God, lying low before the Lord and you, putting his mouth in the duſt, if there may
be hope that God will pardon his manifold Iniquities, and your Honours paſſe by his
offence done contrary to your Laws, which as formerly did, ſo I doe ſtill confeſſe renders
me faulty, for which I am unfeignedly ſorry.</hi> In which words I deſire the Reader
to obſerve I doe onely in the generall beg pardon for my manifold Iniquities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſtraining it to this particular fact for which I am condemned. I am aſſured
that what they count Sin is Duty, and what they judge Treaſon is Loyalty. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
when I beg their Honours to paſſe by my offences done contrary to their
Laws, I do not intend it as if my offending againſt their Laws made me a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
againſt Gods Lawes; no they are tranſgreſſors againſt Gods Law for making
ſuch Laws, not I for breaking them. Thirdly, I uſed this paſſage [againſt your
Lawes] on purpoſe to diſtinguiſh their new Lawes from the Ancient and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Lawes of this Nation. Fourthly, when I ſay I am by their Laws rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
faulty, I doe not, nor never did intend it as to God, but if I reſpect their laws
ſingly I am faulty by them, for I confeſſe I have broken them; yet as to God they
are faulty in making them, not I in breaking them. Fifthly, when I ſay <hi>I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
ſorry that I have done it contrary to their Laws,</hi> My meaning is, becauſe
of the penalty their Lawes inflict, <hi>viz.</hi> Impriſonment and Death, for this I am
ſorry; As for Gods Law I deſire to grieve more for the offence than the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115114:6"/>
but as for their Laws I am not bound to doe ſo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when I ſay <hi>I proſtrate my ſelfe at your feet, acknowledging I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
againſt the Acts of this Commonwealth, and thereby am fallen under your ſore
diſpleaſure, of which I am very deeply ſenſible and ſorrowfull alſo,</hi> I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to obſerve, 1. I call their Laws the Acts of this Common-wealth, to diſtinguiſh
them from Acts of Parliament. 2. By theſe words you may underſtand my intent
in the foregoing Clauſe, where I ſaid I was ſorry for my offences done contrary
to their Laws, theſe words explain thoſe, that my ſorrow is that I have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their ſore diſpleaſure (which I feel by Impriſonment and ſentence of death)
rather than tranſgreſſing their Acts; I have more cauſe of grief that their Laws are
not aboliſhed, than that they are broken.</p>
            <p>This is all I have to ſay about the narratory part of the firſt Petition, the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of my ſecond Petition is as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt humbly ſheweth, That your Petitioner doth with all thankefulneſſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it a ſingular Providence of God, and ſpeciall favour of the Parliament, that a
dore of hope is yet open, and opportunity once more offered to proſtrate himſelf at your
feet for a grant of his life, which if you vouchſafe, he ſhall accept as an Act of great
grace and mercy. It is no little grief of heart to your Petitioner, that through unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedneſſe
and weakneſſe he is fallen under your ſad and heavy diſpleaſure, and hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
againſt the Lawes of this Commonwealth, for which he is unfeignedly ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
And now by the ſentence of the High Court (to which he ſubmits with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
meekneſſe and humble acknowledgement of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and therein) is in inevitable
and ſuddon danger to loſe his life, without your mercifull interpoſition. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there is ſurmiſe of a plot continued againſt the peace and welfare of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
he doth proteſt in the preſence of GOD, the ſearcher of all hearts, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of no plot or deſigne againſt the preſent Government, nor it privy in the leaſt to
any preparations or intendments towards any inteſtine Inſurrections, or forreign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
or to any Correſpondency now held with any in, or of the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Nation, or any
other whatſoever. He is not ignorant how much Malignants will triumph at his death,
nor is he without naturall affections to his dear Wife and Children, nor without real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
deſires of life to doe GOD and his Countrey ſervice, which are powerfull perſwaſives
to him to doe what ever he can, without wounding his Conſcience.</hi> In which words I
deſire the Reader to take notice, 1. That by uſing the word Parliament, I doe not
own them as a reall, but as a titular Parliament. 2. When I mention unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and weakneſſe, I underſtand it in the manner of management of ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
that is, was without that caution and care that became a buſineſſe of ſuch
a nature. It was my unadviſedneſſe and weakneſſe, I confeſſe, that I ever met with
ſuch perſons who were ſome of them ſo falſe, others ſo fearfull, moſt of them ſo
undiſcreeet, yea it was my unadviſedneſſe to meet with ſo many of them. 3. When
I ſay <hi>I am unfeignedly ſorrowfull,</hi> it is not ſingly for offending againſt their Laws,
but conjunctly, becauſe <hi>I am fallen under their ſad and heavy diſpleaſure, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt their Lawes.</hi> This explains a like clauſe in my firſt Petition, it implies
I am ſorrowfull for the penalty their Lawes inflict (<hi>viz.</hi> Impriſonment and Death)
for therein I finde the ſad effect of their heavy diſpleaſure, ſo that my ſorrow is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that I am a ſufferer by their cruell Laws, than that I am a breaker of them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as to the Laws of God, and the unqueſtionable Lawes of this Nation, a man
ought to be more ſenſible that he is a tranſgreſſor, than that he is a ſufferer: But a
man is not bound to be ſo for tranſgreſſing their treaſonable Lawes. 4. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115114:6"/>
I call their new Lawes the Lawes of this Commonwealth, to diſtinguiſh them
from the old Lawes of this Kingdome, which I will keep, not only for Fear, but
for Conſcience ſake, but as for their Laws a man may forbear to break them, out of
Fear, or in Prudence, but not for Conſcience ſake. 5. When I ſpeak to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Court, take notice I onely ſay, That <hi>I ſubmit to the Sentence of the high
Court with all Chriſtian meekneſſe, and humble acknowledgment of Gods hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
Take notice I doe here ſubmit to the ſentence, not juſtifie it; and I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
therein God to be righteous; for he is righteous in the unrighteouſneſs
of men. I doe acknowledge Gods hand in this Sentence to be juſt, though mans
hand to be cruell. As for other paſſages in the narratory part there is nothing
queſtionable, therefore I ſhall ſpeak no more to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The narratory part of my third Petition is as followeth.</hi> Most humbly ſheweth,
That whereas there are but a few hours between your Petitioner and Death, he is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bold, before he breath out his Soul to God, to breath out his request to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by making his laſt addreſſe to you, humbly acknowledging he hath incurred your
high diſpleaſure, of which he is deeply ſenſible, and violated the Lawes of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
for which he is unfeignedly ſorrowfull, and now alſo ſubmits to the ſentence
of the High-Court. <hi>I deſire the Reader to obſerve, that this third Petition for the
narratory part of it, is but a repetition of what was in the two former Petitions,
therefore what I have ſaid to the former, will ſuffice for this alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The naratory part of my fourth Petition is as followeth.</hi> Sheweth, That your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
doth humbly adore the wonderfull goodneſſe of God, &amp; moſt thankfully acknowledge
the great mercy of the Parliament, for ſo ſeaſonable and acceptable an Act of Grace,
to ſuch an offending Suppliant, that when there was but a ſtep between him and death,
the number of his dayes being accompliſhed, and he almoſt cut off from the Land of
the living, then you mercifully interpoſed, and gave him his life for a moneth longer,
which was to him as a Reſurrection from the dead; the Conſideration whereof, melteth
the heart of your Petitioner, and makes him, after a more narrow ſearch into his heart
and wayes, more deeply ſenſible than ever of his ſinne againſt God, and more ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for his high crimes and offences againſt the Parliament, in his late and great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.
He humbly acknowledgeth he hath ſo highly violated the Laws of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
as that thereby he hath rendred himſelf guilty of the ſentence of death, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſt upon him by the High Court of Juſtice. He doth alſo herewith humbly offer
to your Honours a free and full Narrative under his hand of the whole deſigne to
the beſt of his remembrance, which he leaveth to your grave wiſdomes and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
interpretations. <hi>This would require a more large vindication than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Wherefore I ſhall deſire the Reader to take notice of theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I doe in the ſame ſence call them a Parliament in this Petition as I did in the
former; I know that the giving them the name Parliament (without engaging to
them) is but a titular, not a reall acknowledgement, yea in the titles of my Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I call them the Parliament of the Commonwealth, I do not call them (nor doe
I beleeve them to be) the Kingdomes Parliament. I have obſerved the name
Parliament hath bin three different wayes applied: The Juncto of <hi>Oxford</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Parliament, but that was only the Kings Parliament: The Members now
ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> are called a Parliament alſo, but they are the Parliament of
that Faction, who ſtand for the Government of a Commonwealth, in oppoſition
to the Kingdomes Government: The Lords and Commons aſſembled at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115114:7"/>
were called a Parliament, and they only were and are the Kingdomes
Parliament, to preſerve whoſe Privileges the people of this Nation are under ſo
many Oaths and Covenants. I call them the Parliament of the Commonwealth,
to diſtinguiſh them from the Kingdomes Parliament.</p>
            <p>2. In ſaying <hi>I am an offending Suppliant,</hi> my meaning is only that I have offended
them whoſe new Laws I confeſſe I have broken.</p>
            <p>3. In ſaying, <hi>the Conſideration whereof</hi> (that is, that my life is given me for a
moneth longer, which is as a Reſurrection from the dead) <hi>melteth my heart</hi> I doe
confeſſe, ſence of their kindneſſe doth more gaine upon me than the feare of death;
what I writ to Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> I ſtill affirm, <hi>Their diſpleaſure might have broken my bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,
but their mercy hath broken my heart.</hi> I confeſſe it hath done ſo: This favour hath
much won my heart towards them in love and thankfulneſs, as they are Gentlemen
(who had my life in their hands) but not ſo as to comply with them in a State-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
to promote and maintain their preſent Government.</p>
            <p>4. In ſaying <hi>I am more deeply ſenſible, than ever, of my ſin againſt God,</hi> I bleſſe God
I am ſo, my Impriſonment, and the ſentence of Death paſt upon me, hath made me
to ſearch more narrowly into my heart and wayes, and cauſed me to ſee my ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
unſerviceableneſſe, and unprofitableneſſe in the Lords vineyard, for which
he may juſtly cut me off as a withered branch, and lay me aſide as a uſeleſſe veſſell,
wherein he will take no pleaſure. It would be a ſottiſh ſtupidity in me, ſhould not
all theſe ſharp and bitter afflictions make me more ſenſible of my ſin againſt God;
nor dare I excuſe my ſelf to be withont ſin in my late actings, that is, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of management thereof, being too open and indiſcreet, and too credulous of
men; theſe, and other infirmities did cleave to theſe actings, as there doth failings
cleave to the works of my calling, and to all my duties, yet I have never thought
the facts I have done in their own nature to be ſinfull, but lawfull. I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it to be a ſin againſt God, to deſire in my prayers to God as a private man,
that there might be an Agreement between the King and the Scots, upon the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Religion, and terms of the Covenant, or to be preſent when Letters were
read, which were either ſent from or to the honeſt Covenanting party in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
nor can I believe it to be a ſin to move for money for the relief of Major Generall
<hi>Maſſey,</hi> (who had been ſo uſefull for, and inſtrumentall in the good of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and that not for a military uſe (that was diſclaimed by me) but namely for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of his perſonall neceſſities. I know no ſin in this, yet this is all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againſt me, for which I am condemned to dye.</p>
            <p>5. When I ſay <hi>I am ſorrowfull for my high crimes and offences againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in my late and great miſcarriages.</hi> I deſire three things may be taken notice
of, 1. The reaſon why I call my late actings high Crimes and offences againſt
the Parliament, becauſe they were the very words of my Charge. I was charged
with High Treaſon, and other high Crimes and offences. To the firſt I ſtill plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Not Guilty,</hi> the ſecond I confeſt before the High-Court, that I was guilty of
thoſe things which their Laws counted high Crimes and offences, in concealing
what my accuſers had done. Secondly, I doe in theſe words mention the object of
theſe high Crimes and offences, not againſt God, but againſt the Parliament (ſo
called for diſtinctions ſake) Thirdly, I call my late actings great miſcarriages
(not ſins) becauſe I did miſcarry as to the manner of managemement, and as to the
deſired iſſue and event, that there might be a healing of breaches, and compoſing
of differences among the godly in both the Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115114:7"/>
6. In ſaying <hi>I have highly violated the Lawes of this Common-wealth,</hi> I call them
thus to diſtinguiſh them from the old and fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
which I have not broken in any thing that I have done.</p>
            <p>7. In ſaying I have <hi>by the high violation of their Lawes rendred my ſelfe guilty
of the ſentence of Death juſtly paſt upon me by the high Court of Iuſtice,</hi> I would be
rightly underſtood in theſe words, that they might not be wreſted beyond, or
contrary, to my intendment; that you may fully apprehend what I ayme at in
this expreſſion, I deſire you would take notice of a few particulars. 1. I do not
ſay I am proved to be guilty of the ſentence of death, but I have rendred my ſelfe
guilty, &amp;c. that is, though they have not proved, yet I confeſſe it, I have done
thoſe things (contrary to their late Acts) which are puniſhable with death by their
cruell Lawes; ſo that if the Reader marke my words, I do not place my guiltineſſe
of the ſentence of death upon the things proved againſt me, but upon the things
done by me. And when I ſay <hi>The ſentence of death is juſtly paſt upon me by the High
Court of Iuſtice,</hi> I do not place the juſtice of the ſentence on the clearneſſe or
ſufficiency of the proof, (for there was no treaſonable fact (as they call it)
proved againſt me by two Witneſſes) but upon my violation of their Lawes;
that is, I had done thoſe things which are puniſhable (by their bloody Lawes)
with death; I did violate their Lawes, and upon my violation of their Lawes,
not upon the clearneſſe of the evidence, do I acknowledge the ſentence of death to
be juſtly paſt upon, by their bloody and tyrannicall Lawe;: for although eight
Witneſſes came in againſt me, yet they were very deficient in their evidence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they contradicted one another, they did not agree among themſelves;
ſometimes a Witneſſe contradicted himſelfe; none of the Witneſſes proved, that
ever I received Letter, that ever I writ Letter, that ever I collected, gave or
lent one peny of money, yet I am condemned to dye; I confeſſe I did write two
Letters, and did give a ſmall ſumme of money, (not upon any Military accompt)
both which facts are adjudged Treaſon by their new Acts, in which regard I
do acknowledge the ſentence of death is juſtly paſt upon me, that this was the ſence
that I intended, many friends who were with me in the Tower can beare Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In a ſence (though a rigid and forced ſence) I muſt confeſſe,
the ſentence may be ſaid to be juſt, for although there was no ſingle perſonall
fact proved againſt me which made me guilty of Treaſon; yet my facts being
(they ſay) of a continued time, and complicated nature, I cannot deny, but upon
the whole matter, they have by rigid collections, and ſtrained conſequences,
hookt me within the generall clauſe of the Act of Auguſt the ſecond 1650. <hi>To
abett, countenance, or incourage the Scotiſh Nation, or the Forces adhering to
them,</hi> which is declared to be Treaſon. There was no Act but this could reach
me, and no particular clauſe in this Act but theſe generall words of abetting,
countenancing, or incouraging the Scotiſh Nation, or the Forces adhering to
them, for which I was condemned. I do not deny but I might in a ſort be
brought under ſome of theſe generall words, if the Members of the High Court
would put a harſh and rigid interpretation (as they have done) upon what was
proved againſt me; they might have put a more candid and faire interpretation
upon what was proved againſt me; if they had not been led more by Intereſt than
by Conſcience, they might have ſaved their Oathes and my life too; I believe
ſome of them ſaid in their Conſciences at leaſt, we find no cauſe of death in this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115114:8"/>
man, but others mighty ſay, as the Iewes to <hi>Pilate,</hi> you are no friends to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
you are no friends to the State, if you condemne not this man to dye. Others of
them haply may through blindneſſe and partiality be ſo bound up in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
as <hi>Herod</hi> was, that he muſt cut off <hi>Iohn Baptist's</hi> head for his Oath ſake;
ſo, forſooth, becauſe they had ſworne to execute juſtice upon all that came before
them, according to thoſe Acts, they by forced inferences, and tortured collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
bringing me under one clauſe of the Act of Auguſt 2. 1650. thought they
were bound by their Oathes to condemn me, ſo to avoid the appearance of perjury
they commit murther, as <hi>Herod</hi> did in cutting off <hi>Iohn Baptiſt's</hi> head, pretending
that he ſhould break his Oath if <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did not loſe his head.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Though I ſhould grant the ſentence to be juſt according to their
rigid inferences, and ſtrained and forced collections, yet I do not by ſuch (no
nor yet by any) acknowledgment of mine, abſolutely juſtifie the ſentence. To
clear this in a few words, take notice, a ſentence may be ſaid to be juſt in a
two-fold ſence, or conſideration. Firſt, In an abſolute ſence. Secondly, In a
reſpective or relative ſence and Conſideration. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſt, A ſentence is then ſaid to
be juſt in an abſolute ſence in the generall, when for the ſubſtance of it, it is ſuch
that no injuſtice can be charged upon, that is, when it hath all thoſe requiſites, and
ingredients, that are required to, and are neceſſary for, the making up ſuch
a ſentence, and they are chiefly theſe three. Firſt, That the Law or Lawes
which are proceeded by, be for the matter and ſubſtance of them conſonant and
agreeable, at leaſt unto generall rules of Scripture. Secondly, That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of thoſe Lawes be ſuch who are Lawfully deſigned and deputed to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<hi>and exerciſe of</hi> them. And thirdly, That in their ſentence they walke by,
and proceed according to the ſubſtantiall rules and directions given them in thoſe
lawes; and where theſe three things concurre to a ſentence, it may be ſaid to
be juſt in an abſolute conſideration, and when it miſſeth it in any of theſe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
truly and rightly bear the domination of ſuch a ſentence; now that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
paſt upon me, was a juſt ſentence in this abſolute conſideration, I have not,
and I hope never ſhall, acknowledge.</p>
            <p>But then ſecondly, A Sentence may be ſaid to be juſt in a reſpective or relative
conſideration; that is, as it hath reference to, and reſpects thoſe Lawes which are
the riſe and foundation of it: Now, though a Sentence ſhould miſſe it in the two
firſt reſpects of a Sentence abſolutely juſt, that is, though the Lawes proceeded by
ſhould be vitious for the matter of them, and the Miniſters of them Vſurpers, that
have no right nor title to the exerciſe, either of thoſe, or any other Laws, yet if their
proceedings be ſuch, as that the Sentence being laid to the line, and weighed in the
ballance of thoſe Lawes, ſhall be found in any ſence (yea, though a ſtrained and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſence) to be a ſentence according to, and that holds proportion with thoſe
Laws, or any other Clauſe or Clauſes of them, in this ſence, and ſo far, the Sentence
may be ſaid to be juſt, juſt not ſimply and abſolutely, but only in reference and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to thoſe Lawes.</p>
            <p>And when I acknowledge the Sentence to be juſt, I underſtand it in this ſence,
<hi>viz.</hi> according to their rigid and forced inferences from their unjuſt and cruell
Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If it be demanded, what was the reaſon that I refuſed formerly to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a word about the juſtice of the Sentence in any ſence, yet afterwards do
it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115114:8"/>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſhall give you a brief and (I hope) ſatisfactory account to both parts of
this Queſtion; I ſhall firſt give you the reaſons why I formerly refuſed to ſpeake
a word about the juſtice of the ſentence, then give you reaſons why I did ſpeak
ſomething to it in my laſt Petition.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why I formerly refuſed to mention a word (in my three firſt Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
about the juſtice of the Sentence, are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Leſt I ſhould harden the hearts of my unjuſt Judges; they themſelves confeſt
mine was as intricate and dubitable, a Caſe as ever came before them, to finde by
what Act, and by what Clauſe in that Act I was found guilty, therefore they ſpent
more time about my tryall, than about any Mans ſince their High-Court was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed.
I refuſed therefore to ſay that was Juſtice, which God will ſay is Murder
in the great day of their account, and which themſelves could hardly ſay was juſt,
untill by the ſubtill inſinuations, and rigid inferences and Collections of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
(of that Court) they hook't me within the compaſſe of thoſe generall words,
To abett, countenance, or encourage.</p>
            <p>2. Leſt I ſhould injure my Godly Brethren who ſhould be afterwards tryed.
The moſt they proved againſt me by two Witneſſes, was prefence at the hearing of
Letters read: Now I thought with my ſelfe, ſhould I confeſſe the Sentence juſt, I
ſhould pre-judge my Brethren, and in effect, ſay the Sentence would be juſt againſt
them, as well as againſt me; upon this ground I refuſed to ſay the Sentence was
juſt; but this reaſon is of no force now, for all my Brethren in the Tower, who were
engaged in the ſame buſineſſe, they have either confeſt, or intend to confeſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
themſelves.</p>
            <p>3. I could not be informed (upon diſcourſe with divers of the Members of the
High-Court) what perſonall fact of mine (proved againſt me) made me guilty of
Treaſon by any publique Act of theirs, nor could I underſtand by any of them, if
they did proceed <hi>Secundum allegata, &amp; probata,</hi> how they found me guilty of
Treaſon; all the refuge they had to run to, was this, That I was an abetter, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancer
or encourager of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, and forces adhering to them; and
upon that Clauſe they ſentenced me. Now, when I ſaw ſome of my Judges could
give me no more ſatisfactory reaſons of their Sentence, it made me the more to
doubt of the juſtice of the Sentence, even according to their own Lawes; upon
theſe grounds I forbore to ſpeak of the juſtice of the Sentence: in mentioning the
juſtice of the Sentence, I did not uſe lightneſſe, or ſhew fickleneſſe, but what I did
it was upon ſolemn and ſerious advice and conſideration.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why I did ſay the Sentence of Death was juſtly paſt upon me, are
theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe I knew I had done thoſe things which their cruell Lawes puniſh with
Death, as I did write a Letter to <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and gave a ſmall ſum of money to him,
both which are puniſhed with death; yet they proved neither of theſe; ſo that I
place the juſtice of the Sentence, not upon the ſufficiency of the proof, but upon
my violation of their bloody Lawes.</p>
            <p>2. I had not ſo much hopes, that ſaying in any ſence the Sentence was juſt would
formerly ſo much advantage me as now I have, therefore would not give ſo likely
an offence for ſo unlikely and uncertain an advantage.</p>
            <p>3. I conſidered with my ſelf, that the Sentence of the Court (whether juſt or
unjuſt as to my acknowledgment) was but a nice controverſie in Law, not a clear
Caſe of Conſcience in Divinity. I did not refuſe to ſay the Sentence was in any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115114:9"/>
ſence juſt, as if I thought it were a ſin in its own Nature to ſay that by their Laws
the Sentence was juſt, I never loaded my Conſcience with that, but I forbore
it out of Chriſtian prudence; I would not harden my Judges, nor inſnare my
Brethren.</p>
            <p>4. The laſt reaſon why I did ſay the Sentence was juſt, is this, becauſe my Judges
did upon the evidence bring me under theſe generall and comprehenſive words, <hi>To
abett, countenance, and encourage the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Nation.</hi> Theſe words are of ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that they might bring me under them by forced inferences, ſtrained conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and rigid interpretations; ſo that in this ſence (<hi>this rigid ſence</hi>) the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
may be ſaid to be juſt. Yet for all this that hath been ſaid, my Judges have
great cauſe to be troubled, as</p>
            <p>1. For ſitting in ſo arbitrary, illegall, and tyrannicall a Court. 2. That they
judged me upon ſuch incompetent, inſufficient, and uncertain evidence. 3. That
they judged me to dye by ſuch an Act, they indeed are to be judged as Traytors
who made the Act, not I who broke it. 4. For being ſuch vaſſalls to thoſe who
Commiſſionate them, moſt of them having offices, or places of profit from the
State, are in fee with the State, and for that very reaſon are not competent
perſons to be judges of matters of Fact againſt any mans life; indeed the Iudges of
the Land are onely Judges of matters of Law, and may be in fee with the State, may
receive a yearly revenue, but the Jury who judge of matters of Fact, ought not to
be in fee with the State; therefore by Law the Priſoner at the Bar, may lawfully
except againſt 35 if he ſee juſt cauſe, either in that, or any other regard. 5. They
have great cauſe to be troubled, that when they could not prove one Treaſonable
fact againſt me by their new Laws, either that I ever writ Letter, or received or
ſent Letter, or gave one penny of money, when, I ſay, they could prove neither
of theſe againſt me, that they judge me to dye upon ſuch a <hi>quirk</hi> in the Act, and
by ſuch harſh interpretations force my actings to come under thoſe generall words,
<hi>abetting, countenancing and encouraging,</hi> I am bold to ſay, that Treaſon was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made by ſuch generall words, as <hi>abetting, countenancing and encouraging,</hi> in any
State or Kingdom in the world, but in ours by our Commonwealth-men; and ſome
of my Iudges have confeſt, there was never ſuch generall words found in any Law to
make a man guilty of Treaſon: Ignorant men talk of the <hi>Norman</hi> ſlavery, but there
is no ſuch ſlavery in the world as this is, for a man to dye upon ſuch words as theſe;
for ought I know ſpeaking well of a <hi>Scotch</hi> man may be judged abetting, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lovingly on a <hi>Scotch</hi> man may be judged conntenancing, and ſpeaking comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to a Scotch man may be judged encouraging; ſo that if a man ſpeak well of, or
look lovingly on, or ſpeak comfortably to any of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, he may, for
ought I know, be brought under this unmercifull and cruell Act as well as I.
Though I am not the firſt ſentenced to death by the flew Acts, yet I am the firſt
Man in <hi>England</hi> ſentenced to dye by thoſe generall words of <hi>abetting, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and encouraging,</hi> which are not found in any ancient Laws or Statutes, and
which no Iury in <hi>England</hi> would have Condemned me upon, as Lawyers have
informed me. What will after-ages ſay of theſe proceedings, but that this kind
of juſtice is extremity of rigor, and that there is a talent of unrighteouſneſſe to one
dram of juſtice found in this ſentence? I am very confident, that after my
head is off my ſhoulders, ſome of my Iudges will have terrif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed &amp; troubled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
as <hi>Herod</hi> had after he had cut off <hi>John Baptist's</hi> head, he thought he had ſeen
<hi>Johns</hi> Ghoſt, which was nothing elſe but meerly the reflections of his naturall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115114:9"/>
for his cruell murder of that innocent man: And I hope and beleeve I
ſhall have more peace of Conſcience in undergoing the ſentence on a Block, than
they will have for inflicting the ſentence when they come to lye upon their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds.
I pray God lay not my blood to their charge.</p>
            <p>This is all I have to ſay touching the Narratory part of my 4 Petitions. I proceed
now to juſtifie the ſecond part of my Petitions, which is the Promiſſory part; as I
have declared nothing that is ſinfull in the former, ſo I have not promiſed any
thing that is ſinfull in the latter. Before I ſhall undretake to juſtifie what I have
promiſed, I ſhall premiſe a few particulars. 1. Had I been free, I ſhould have
promiſed them nothing, becauſe I owe them nothing. 2. I promiſe them onely
Negatives, which I may lawfully make to a company of High-way robbers, if they
will ſpare me life, when ſome of their ſociety would ſpill my blood. Now, that I
might ſatisfie the world in what promiſes I have made, I ſhall lay them down in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as they are in my Petitions.</p>
            <p>In my firſt Petition I did onely promiſe, That <hi>for the remainder of my dayes I
would lead a peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able and quiet life in all godlineſſe and honesty, and that in my place
and calling I would endeavour the peace and welfare of this Common-wealth.</hi> The firſt
part of this promiſe is my duty, as I am a Chriſtian, it was the Apoſtles prayer in 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 2. therefore ought to be my practice. The ſecond part of this promiſe is my
duty as I am an Engliſhman, <hi>to endeavour the peace and welfare of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
where by Common-wealth I underſtand not this form of Government in
oppoſition to a Kingdome, but by Common-wealth, I underſtand the whole
Body or Community of the people of this Nation, I ſhall endeavour their peace
and welfare as I am a native of this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my ſecond Petition I promiſed only this,</hi> To endeavour in my place and Calling
the compoſing of differences among the godly, and preſerving ſpirituall peace and love
throughout the Churches of the Saints, as well as the civill peace and welfare of this
Common-wealth. <hi>And I further promiſed,</hi> neither to plot, contrive, or deſigne any
thing to the hurt of the preſent Government, and, if it be required, to put in further
ſecurity for performance thereof. <hi>In which words I promiſe four things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>In my place and calling to compoſe differences among the Godly.</hi> It would be
my ſin to widen differences, it is my duty to compoſe them. I would have Chriſt's
Coat without rent, as well as without ſpot. I can truly ſay for the breaches among
the Godly I have had ſad thoughts of heart, the grief of my heart hath been for
the Diviſion, and the deſire of my ſoule, for an Vnion, and cloſure of the differences
that are amongſt us. Oh that my body could make up that breach, I would caſt it in,
or my blood ſoder the differences, I would let it out with gladneſſe, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſo deſired an end.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To preſerve ſpirituall peace and love throughout the Churches of the Saints.</hi>
It is my duty not only to endeavour to reſtore peace and love where it is not, but to
preſerve it where it is.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>To preſerve the civill peace and welfare of this Common-wealth,</hi> which is the
ſame with that promiſe in the firſt Petition; by Common-wealth I underſtand,
not a form of Government, but the whole body, or Community of the people of
this Nation. I promiſe to ſeek their civill peace and Vnion. I am bound to the
two firſt as I am a Chriſtian, and to the latter as I am an Engliſhman.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Neither to plot, contrive, or deſigne any thing to the hurt of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and if it be required, to put in further ſecurity for the performance of the ſame.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115114:10"/>
In which promiſe I doe not abſolutely binde my ſelf to doe nothing againſt this
preſent Government, ſo as not to pray, or not to preach againſt their Vſurpations
and Oppreſſions, but I doe confine my promiſe to <hi>Not plotting, contriving or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
the hurt of the preſent Government,</hi> that is, that I ſhall not engage in any
plot, contrivement or deſigne againſt them who are in preſent power, and this
promiſe I had reſolved to keep, had they given me my life, though I might have
opportunity and ſecrecy to carry on ſuch plot, contrivement, or deſigne againſt
them. Such a Negative promiſe as this, in ſuch a caſe of extremity as I am now in,
I might lawfully make to a company of Theeves, when they have their knife at my
throat, or their ſwords at my heart, I may lawfully promiſe to them, that I will
neither plot, contrive, nor deſign to hurt them, to way-lay them, and take them; I
promiſe no more to the preſent power, and this I ſhould make good, and if I might
not be believed, I did offer ſecurity for the performance hereof; Yet were I at
liberty, at my free choice, I ſhould not promiſe ſo much unto them, nor would I
adviſe others to engage themſelves in the leaſt unto them, yet it would not offend
me, if any man in the condition I am in did promiſe ſo much, if he would promiſe
no more.</p>
            <p>In my third Petition <hi>I promiſed and offered further ſecurity, neither to plot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
or deſigne the ſubverſion of this preſent Government, accounting it as a brand of
the higheſt ingratitude to imploy my life againſt you, if I ſhall by an act of grace and
favour receive a new life from you.</hi> In which words, I beſeech the Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
my promiſe is only Negative, I make no poſitive promiſe to them of a
concurrence with, or acting for this preſent Government; this is the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<hi>in terminis</hi> with that in the ſecond Petition, only there is an additionall clauſe
here, <hi>viz. That I account it as a brand of the higheſt ingratitude, to imploy my
life againſt them, if I ſhould by an Act of grace and favour receive a new life from
them.</hi> I do not ſay I ſhall imploy my life for them if I ſhould receive my life from
them, that I dare not do, yet I will ſay I will not imploy my life againſt them,
and this promiſe I would have kept, had they given me my life, as long as I had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under their preſent Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my fourth petition I promiſed that I would</hi> neither plot, contrive or deſigne,
any thing prejudiciall to the preſent Government, but in my place and calling oppoſe
any Malignant deſigns whatſoever, (whether in this or the neighbour Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
that may tend to the ruine of this Common-wealth. <hi>And a while after I promiſed,</hi>
never to imploy that life againſt you, I ſhall receive from you, but bold it my duty
to lay out my life for the glory of God, the good of his people, the peace and ſafety
of this Commonwealth. <hi>I have promiſed four things in this Petition, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe
whereof (as the caſe ſtands) I ſhall ſufficiently evince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>I promiſed neither to plot, contrive, or deſigne any thing prejudjciall to the
preſent Government.</hi> This is the ſame, <hi>in terminis,</hi> with what is promiſed in my
ſecond and third Petitions. To vindicate which, I refer my Reader to what I ſaid
there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I promiſed <hi>In my place and calling to oppoſe any Malignant deſignes
whatſoever (whether in this or the neighbour Nations) that may tend to the ruine
of this Common-wealth.</hi> In which words I deſire the Reader to take notice. Firſt,
That I hold my ſelf ſtill bound to oppoſe malignant deſigns as much as ever I did,
I ſtill retaine as great a diſlike of a Malignant intereſt as ever. Secondly, When I
mention Malignant deſigns, I do not underſtand the honeſt <hi>Scots</hi> undertakings, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115114:10"/>
preſerving their King, Country, Religion and all againſt the invaders, to be a
Malignant deſigne; farre be it from me I ſhould once imagine it; but by Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
deſigns, I mean ſuch which the Covenant expreſſeth, the Covenant brandeth
them for Malignants, Incendiaries, and evill inſtruments, who divide the
King from his people, or one of the Kingdoms from another; they are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
which I did oppoſe, and ſhould oppoſe, who did labour by Arms to force
the two Houſes of Parliament, this the Cavaleers would have done but could
not, but this the Army hath done. Thirdly, I do not ſay I ſhall oppoſe all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
that may tend to the ruine of the Government of the Common-wealth, but
that may tend to the ruine of the Common-wealth, that is, to the ruine of the body
of the people of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I promiſed <hi>Never to implo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that life againſt you I ſhould receive from
you.</hi> This is the ſame, <hi>in termin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> with that in my third Petition; could they
give me a thouſand lives, I would not imploy one for them, yet if they had given
me my life, I would not imploy that life againſt them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I promiſed <hi>To lay out my ſelfe for the glory of God, the good of his
people, the peace and ſafety of this Common-wealth.</hi> That is not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Common-wealth, but of the Community or whole Body of the
people; I thinke there is none that will queſtion the lawfullneſſe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeen to a tittle both the Narratory and Promiſſory part of all my
Petitions, wherein I have declared, and promiſed, nothing that will ſtrengthen this
Government, that doth contradict my Principles, wound my Conſcience, or
juſtly offend my Godly Brethren. I promiſe nothing in a way of active concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or complyance with their State Government, neither to preach or pray for
them, fight or act for them in the leaſt. Thus I have juſtified the lawfullneſſe of
the titles of my Petitions, &amp;c. Alſo of the matter of them, both of the Narratory,
Promiſſory, and Petitionary part of them. I now begin to juſtifie my practice, in
giving in a Narrative of the whole tranſaction. This I did not out of conſtraint,
but voluntarily. In my Narrative offence is taken at two things. Firſt, That I
accuſe my ſelfe. Secondly, That I accuſe others, yet at firſt I did refuſe to doe
either. To this I ſhall give a clear and ſatisfactory anſwer, to juſtifie what I have
done. It is true, before I was condemned to dye I deemed it againſt the Law of
Nature to accuſe my ſelfe, and againſt the law of love to accuſe my Brother,
therefore then would do neither. And I am ſtill of this judgment, before a man
ſees his accuſers face to face, and is convicted, I would not have a man confeſſe
a word in a caſe of that nature as mine is; but as the caſe ſtands with me, being a
condemned man, I conceive it is not againſt the Law of Nature to confeſſe againſt
my ſelfe, nor againſt the Law of Love to confeſſe againſt my Brethren, who are
partakers with me in this buſineſſe; I ſhall begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove the
lawfulneſſe of my practice in giving in a Narrative of what I had done; This is not
forced from me, I offered this from the begining (I mean ſince I was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I would not do it before) to let them know what I had done in this
whole buſineſſe, but it would not be accepted unleſſe I would name other men,
which I was then loath to do, but, upon further conſideration, I afterwards incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons which induced me to give in a Narrative of what I my ſelf had done
(I being now a condemned man) are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115114:11"/>
Firſt, As ſelf juſtification can do me no good, ſo ſelf accuſation can do me no
hurt; before I was <hi>convicted</hi> I would not confeſſe a word, that were to make me
guilty of mine owne blood, if out of my owne mouth they ſhould condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
me; then confeſſion might have been a prejudice to me, but now it can be
none.</p>
            <p>Secondly, My acknowledgment may ſoften, and ſweeten, the ſpirits of thoſe
toward me, in whoſe hands my life is, remove many prejudices out of their
minds, that I am not obſtinate or perverſe, when they ſhall ſee me deale
with them with an ingenuous freedom, and openneſſe of heart to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I do it to take off jealouſies. out of the minds of them who are in
power, who ſurmiſe plots and deſignes carrying on againſt them, who
ſuſpect there is not a full diſcovery of this buſineſſe; upon this ground
therefore I ſhall diſcover what I well remember, and diſtinctly know in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I am willing the world ſhould know the worſt I have done, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall acknowledge, not only what is proved againſt me, but thoſe things
none in the World could accuſe me of, they are ſuch things as I need not, I
ought not be aſhamed of, <hi>viz.</hi> That I deſired, as a private man, there might be
an agreement between the King and the Scots, upon the intereſt of Religion,
and tearms of the Covenant; or that I relieved <hi>Maſſey</hi> with money, not upon
any Military accompt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but meerly as a ſupply for his perſonall neceſſities, &amp;c. theſe
are things I am not, I need not, be aſhamed of.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If I ſhould now conceale what I had do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, the World would thinke
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſe of it than it is, <hi>and worſe of me than I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, I intend upon the Scaffold to make an acknowledgment of what I have
done, and why may I not do it before? I need not, ought not, be aſhamed to
juſtifie what I have done, upon the Scaffold, I have done nothing either by the
Lawes of God or of this Nation for which I ought to dve, although by their
bloody Lawes, they have condemned me to dye. Theſe are the reaſons why I
have confeſt againſt my ſelfe. I am now to give reaſons why I have in my Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
confeſt againſt other men, when before I did refuſe to doe it.</p>
            <p>To this alſo I ſhall give a brief yet ſatisfactory account; it is true, before I was
condemned I would not accuſe any man, becauſe then my teſtimony haply would
be looked upon as valid in Law againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that in that caſe, I had rather
lay downe my owne life than be inſtrumentall in taking away the life of another
man. I might have had my owne life given me for a prey, would I have but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
againſt other men, and ſo devoted their lives for a ſacrifice to the bloody
rage of men, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtill withſtood it. I then was, and ſtill am of this principle, to
judge it better to be a ſufferer with the Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than an accuſer of the
Brethren, <hi>eſpecially</hi> when my accuſation may turne in the leaſt to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>The reaſons which ſwayed with me to name other men in my Narrative, are
theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe my Teſtimony (being a condemned man) is not valid in Law, and ſo can
do them no harm, as to Eſtate or Life.</p>
            <p>2. I do name thoſe perſons only, who are already diſcovered, and certainly known
to thoſe in power; ſhould <hi>I goe about to vindicate</hi> them, I ſhould do them no good,
and now I do nominate them. I can do them no hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115114:11"/>
3. Moſt of the perſons I have named, have given me their Conſent that I ſhould
name them; ſo that themſelves being Judges, they thought I could do them no
injury.</p>
            <p>4. Moſt of the perſons I have named in my narrative, have of their own accords
confeſſed as much (if not more) than I have ſpoken concerning them; yea before
I have ſent in my narrative (for I am one of the laſt, though my danger is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt)
they have ſent in theirs, and confeſſed againſt themſelves more than I have
mentioned in my narrative.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſpoken as briefly as the matter would permit, to juſtifie the Title
and Matter of my Petitions, and the giving in of my Narrative; This I doe, becauſe
I would give no offence either to Jew, or Gentile, or the Church of God.</p>
            <p>There are other ſcandalous aſperſions and ſlanderous reports caſt upon me, which
I muſt endeavour to ſatisfie the world about. I have publikely made 3. ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
and true Proteſtations, both on the firſt and laſt day of my appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the High Court of Juſtice, the truth wherof I ſtill ſtand to maintaine; it is
bruited abroad, that both by the Teſtimony of the Witneſſes, and by my owne
Confeſſion I have contradicted my own Proteſtations, which is moſt notoriouſly
falſe, I did therefore in the end of my Tryall declare, that it was my rejoycing, that
though 8. Witneſſes came in againſt me, yet none of them did contradict or falſifie
my 3. Proteſtations; I had rather dye, than any ſhould make my glorying voyd,
yea, I had much rather be made a Sufferer than a Lyar. <hi>In going</hi> about to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my ſelf in theſe particulars, I ſhall give you the reaſon why I made theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
becauſe the Charge was ſo black and foule againſt me, of correſponding
with the <hi>King, Queen, Iermin,</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi> of raiſing great ſums of Money for the
<hi>Scots</hi> to maintaine a War againſt this Nation, &amp;c. To remove prejudices from the
minds of my Judges, and of the hearers then preſent, I did make theſe three Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations,
the truth whereof I ſtand now to juſtifie and ſeal with my blood.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The firſt Proteſtation I made before the High-Court was this; viz.</hi> That I
never writ any Letters either to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> or the Queen his Mother, or to the
Church or State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or to any particular perſon of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, ſince
the beginning of the Warres between ENGLAND <hi>and</hi> SCOTLAND,
to this day.</p>
            <p>This firſt Petition hath not been falſified, either by the Teſtimony of my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
or my own Confeſſion. None of the 8. Witneſſes did prove that I ever writ
a Letter, yet, I confeſſe, I did write one to <hi>Maſſey</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another to
<hi>Bamfield</hi> in <hi>Holland, yet</hi> my Proteſtation is not falſified, for they are both of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> not of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation; though I did write to <hi>Maſſey</hi> who was in the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, yet is he not of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation; ſo my Proteſtation
holds true.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>My ſecond Proteſtation was this,</hi> That I never received any Letters writ to
me, either from the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the Queen his Mother, or the Church or
State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the generall, or from any other particular perſon of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Nation, from the beginning of the Warres between the two Nations to this day.</p>
            <p>This Proteſtation is true alſo, and hath not been contradicted by my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
or any of the Witneſſes, only Capt. <hi>Potter</hi> did ſwear, That he received a
Letter from Colonell <hi>Bamfield</hi> with a great <hi>L.</hi> on it, and that there were encloſed
Letters from 4 <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Lords and from Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Miniſter. He ſaid in
his Examinations: before the Committee of the Councell of State, That he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115114:12"/>
the Letter from <hi>Bamfield</hi> was writ to me; but before the High-Court, being
on his Oath, he could not ſay ſo; nay, he ſaid he thought it was not writ to me;
nor can I imagine why Colonell <hi>Bamfield</hi> ſhould write to me, for I had never
heard from him, or writ to him before; nor did I ever ſee his face. But if <hi>Bomfields</hi>
Letter with a great <hi>L.</hi> written on it, had been writ to me, yet my Proteſtation is not
contradicted, for <hi>Bamfield</hi> is an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, not a <hi>Scotch</hi> man: Now my Proteftation was, That I received no Letters writ to me from any of the Scotiſh Nation,
ſince the Wars began. Moreover, the Letters from the 4 <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords, and Mr.
<hi>Bayly</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſter (which were encloſed in <hi>Bamfields</hi> Letter) had not a great
<hi>L.</hi> written on them, as <hi>Bamfields</hi> Letter had, and were not writ to me; and had
thoſe Letters from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſter been written to me
(which they were not) yet my Proteſtation is not falſified, for Captain <hi>Potter</hi>
received them, opened them, read them, before he ſhewed them to me, he kept
them and carried them away, as was confeſt in open Court, but I did neither,
nor did I write an Anſwer to thoſe Letters from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords, or the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Miniſter; indeed I did write to <hi>Bamfield</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> but he is of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not
of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation: ſo my Proteſtation not contradicted.</p>
            <p>My third Proteſtation was this, <hi>That I never collected, gave, or lent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne penny of
money to ſend into</hi> Scotland, <hi>or any foreign parts, either to the King, Queen, Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or State of</hi> Scotland, <hi>or to any particular perſons of the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Nation, ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Wars unto this day.</hi> As to theſe three particulars I have ſaid it, and
doe ſay it againe, I am as innocent as my harmleſſe Child that is not 3 years old.
This third Proteſtation is true alſo, though I did ſend 5 l. to one <hi>Bamfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and 10 l. to <hi>Maſſey</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for they are of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Nation; Yea, though I did give money to relieve poor <hi>Scotch</hi> men, priſoners,
and others here in <hi>London,</hi> yet this contradicts not my Proteſtation, for therein I
ſaid, I did not give money to ſend into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any other fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eign parts, to any
perſons of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation; but I did not ſay I did not give here in <hi>London</hi> to
any perſon of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, I did relieve many of the poor <hi>Scotch</hi> priſoners
who were taken at <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight, and brought to <hi>Black-wall:</hi> Yet this doth not
falſifie my Proteſtation; though I did give money to poor <hi>Scotch</hi> men in <hi>London,</hi>
yet I ſent none into <hi>Scotland</hi> to any <hi>Scotch</hi> perſon ſince the Wars began,
to this day.</p>
            <p>When I firſt put pen to paper, I did not intend to look fo far back as the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but becauſe the Tryall is ſo miſ-repreſented, and miſ-reported in ſome Bookes
in Print, eſpecially in that lying Book, called, <hi>The Plea for the Common-wealth,</hi>
and becauſe many black and hideous things are laid to my Charge, of which I am
not guilty. Wherefore I ſhall doe two things, 1. Lay down what none of the 8.
Witneſſes did prove againſt me. 2. Give a brief Extract of what they did prove
againſt me, that ſo the World may be ſatisfied upon what I was Condemned to
dye.</p>
            <p>None of the 8. Witneſſes did prove in Court.</p>
            <p>1. That I writ Letter to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> or Queen, or <hi>Jermin,</hi> or <hi>Piercy,</hi> or
to any other perſons in foreign parts, either in or of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, ſince the
Wars began, to this day.</p>
            <p>2. Or, that ever Letter was writ in my Houſe, or in any place elſe where I
was preſent.</p>
            <p>3. Or, that ever I directed, ordered or perſwaded any others to write.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:115114:12"/>
4. Or, that I did know of any perſon that did write Letters into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any
foreign parts.</p>
            <p>5. Or, that ever I ſent, or gave my conſent to the ſending away of any Letters
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any forein parts.</p>
            <p>6. Or, that ever I received any Letter from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any foreign parts.</p>
            <p>7. Or, that I ordered any other perſon to receive Letters for me.</p>
            <p>8. Or, that ever I did ſo much as read any Letter in my Houſe, or any where
elſe, that did come from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or from foreign parts.</p>
            <p>9. Or, that ever I collected, gave, or lent any money, either for the King of
<hi>Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts,</hi> the Queen his Mother, the Church and State of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the generall,
or for any particular perſons, either in, or of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, ſince the beginning
of the Wars to this day.</p>
            <p>10. Or, that ever I invited any foreign Forces to invade either <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Or, that I was, in the leaſt, privy to, or accquainted with any preparations or
endeavours tending to the raiſing of inteſtine inſurrections at home, or joyning
with any foreign Invaſions from abroad. None of theſe particulars were proved
againſt me, yet I was condemned to dye; which doth manifeſt to the world, that I
I am put to death rather upon an intereſt of State, than Principles of Conſcience;
rather to put a terror upon others, than for the merits of the Facts I have don
my ſelf, yet my Oppreſſors ſlay me, and hold themſelves not guilty.</p>
            <p>The moſt that was proved againſt me, was this, That I was preſent at mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in ſeverall Faſts, to begge a bleſſing on the Treaty between the King and
the <hi>Scots,</hi> that there might be an Agreement between them, upon the intereſt
of Religion, and termes of the Covenant; That I was ſeverall times preſent
at my Houſe when Letters were read, that either were ſent to, or received from
<hi>Scotland;</hi> That I moved for money for <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (yet one of the Witneſſes
ſwore that it was not upon a Military account) to maintain the War in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but meerly to relieve the perſonall neceſſities of <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> That two of
the Witneſſes brought Fifteen pound for <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to my Houſe, viz.
<hi>Potter</hi> brought Ten pound, and <hi>Far</hi> brought Five pound, but neither charged
me that I received it. Here I deſire the Reader to take notice, that though 8.
Witneſſes came in againſt me, yet no two of them did concurre in their
Teſtimony to prove any one thing againſt me, unleſſe that I was preſent
at the bearing of Letters read, which other men brought to my Houſe. As
for all other things, though two Witneſſes might ſometimes ſpeake <hi>ad idem,</hi>
yet not to the ſame thing, <hi>eodem tempore.</hi> 'Tis true, two ſwore that I moved
for money, yet one ſwore I did it in a meeting, the other ſwore I did it to
him alone at another time, But leſt it ſhould be thought I am too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in my own Cauſe, I have here made an Extract, out of the Depoſitions
of the Witneſſes, that ſo you may ſee the worſt that is proved againſt

for ten thouſand pound, but, ſaid he, we all diſliked that motion, diſſented
from it, and reſolved to ſend a Nagative Anſwer, yea he might have ſaid, that
I was the man that diſſwaded them from doing any thing in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Potter</hi> ſaid, An Anſwer to thoſe Letters was brought and left at his ſhop he ſaid
he thought it came from me and Dr. <hi>Drake,</hi> but, God is my Witneſſe, I neither ſent,
carried, nor left, Letter at his ſhop in all my life.</p>

                  <hi>William Drake</hi> held a Correſpondence with <hi>Scotland,</hi> but he knew
no Miniſters that knew this.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, That after he came from <hi>Callis</hi> he brought to <hi>William Drake</hi> a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
from Captaine <hi>Titus</hi> of all his proceedings at <hi>Ierſey,</hi> and how the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeers
abuſed him, and alſo brought a Copy of a Letter from the King, he ſaid,
this was read at my houſe.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, There was a Commiſſion and inſtructions read at my houſe, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Treaty at <hi>Bredah,</hi> to Authoriſe the Lord <hi>Willoughby, Bunce, Maſſey, Titus,
Graves,</hi> to uſe their intereſt in the King, and in the <hi>Scots,</hi> Commiſſioners to
agree in their Treaty upon the terms of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>I deſire you to take notice, that this was the only meeting I was at about an agree|
ment between the King and the <hi>Scots,</hi> and at this meeting I did declare againſt the
ſending this Commiſſion and inſtructions, as being an act of high preſumption, for
private men to Commiſſionate, and an act of notorious falſhood to ſay this was
in the names of the Presbyterian party, when none knew of it but thoſe preſent,
but it ſeems it was ſent away by <hi>Alford</hi> without my knowledge or conſent; indeed
<hi>Alford</hi> ſware, that I was preſent, but could not ſay that 4 directed in it, yea he
contradicted himſelf, in ſaying at one time the Commiſſion and Inſtructions were
agreed upon, and at another time, that they were read at my houſe but not agreed
upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alford</hi> ſaid, After <hi>Dunbar</hi> fight, that there was a Letter which was ſaid to

ſupplying thoſe Gentlemens neceſſities, without reference to armes, or any ſuch

or in Letters of ſending moderate Propoſitions to the King.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, that when <hi>Alford</hi> returned from <hi>Callis,</hi> he brought with him a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
from <hi>Titus,</hi> and a Copy of a Letter from the King, but he could not ſwear the
Letter was read at Mr. <hi>Love's</hi> houſe. The Narrative from <hi>Titus,</hi> was to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how he was ill uſed by the Cavalier party.</p>
               <p>He ſaid there was a motion about a Commiſſion and Inſtructions to be drawn
up, and ſent, but by whom he could not ſay, he could not ſay it was agreed to be
ſent, it was read in Mr. <hi>Love's</hi> ſtudy, and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was there ſome part of the
time.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, the ſubſtance of the Inſtructions, was to uſe all Arguments they could
to move the King to give the <hi>Scots</hi> ſatisfaction, to take the Covenant, but he could
not ſay, that he heard Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſay, <hi>Come, come, let it goe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adams</hi> being ask'd, whether was there not a Letter, ſent from <hi>Piercy</hi> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to be ſent to the King, read at Mr. <hi>Love's</hi> houſe? he ſaid, no certainly; he ſaid
he ſaw ſuch a Letter in <hi>Maſons</hi> hand.</p>
               <p>He being asked, whether about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1650. a Letter was not ſent from <hi>Maſſey</hi>
to ſome here, that he had back friends in <hi>Scotland;</hi> complaining, he could not be
promoted there, and whether was not this communicated at Mr <hi>Love's</hi> houſe? he
anſwered, no certainly.</p>
               <p>And being demanded, whether Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was not named to draw up a Letter to
be ſent to <hi>Scotland?</hi> he ſaid, I was not named, but himſelfe was, and ſome
others.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, one <hi>Sterkes,</hi> whom be took to be a <hi>Scots</hi> Agent, met ſometimes at
Mr. <hi>Love's</hi> houſe. I deſire you to take notice, that this <hi>Sterkes</hi> was no <hi>Scots</hi>
Agent, he was not in <hi>Scotland</hi> for 12 years before, and he told me himſelf, that he
was no Agent.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, there were eight or ten meetings in Maſter <hi>Love's</hi> houſe, within
two years.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, when <hi>Maſſey's</hi> Letter was read Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was there, it did declare
the poverty of his Condition.</p>
               <p>Being asked, whether Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did not write down the ſummes that each
would give to <hi>Maſſey,</hi> he ſaid, that I had a Pen in my hand, did write ſomething,
but he knew not what I did write, but particular men did write their ſummes,
but he could not ſay, that I writ either names or ſums.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, at a meeting at my houſe, I being ſometimes preſent, there was a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115114:14"/>
read penned by Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and Dr. <hi>Drake,</hi> but being askt why he thought Mr.
<hi>Love</hi> penned it, he ſaid, meerly becauſe of the language of it. This Letter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be ſent to the Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and this was after
<hi>Dunbar</hi> fight. This Letter was read in my houſe, it is true, but never written by
me.</p>
               <p>He mentions a Letter in the nature of a Declaration to be ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
either by Mr. <hi>Love</hi> or Dr. <hi>Drake,</hi> but I know nothing of this, I remember no
ſuch thing, but afterwards he ſaid he had no ground to ſay Maſter <hi>Love</hi> penned
it.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, he conceived me to be a correſpondent, but could not ſay that I was
ſo.</p>

ſent from <hi>Titus,</hi> to deſire ſombody to be ſent to <hi>Callis,</hi> to take an account of
his Negotiations; ſaid, this Letter was read in my Study, and that I was preſent;
and ſaid, it was agreed <hi>Alford</hi> ſhould go, being his Sonne was gone from him. I
deſire the Reader to obſerve how Captaine <hi>Far</hi> forſwears himſelfe, and contradicts
another mans teſtimony, for <hi>Alford</hi> ſware, he was never at my houſe till after he

was at my houſe, but he could not ſay that I was preſent, but, he ſaid, I was abſent
ſometimes.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, at a meeting at my houſe, <hi>William Drake</hi> read papers under the
name of Commiſſion and Inſtructions, they were read in the company, but they
were not agreed upon, becauſe private perſons could not do ſuch a thing as give
Commiſſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He conceived the Commiſſion was in the name of the Presbyterian party,
but could not ſay ſo; he ſaid <hi>William Drake</hi> undertook to draw up the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but he could not ſay they were drawn up, or ſent. He ſaid, that thoſe that
were named Commiſſioners, they were to adviſe but not to treat in the behalf of
the Presbyterian party.</p>
               <p>After the fight at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> a Letter from <hi>Maſſey,</hi> to aſſiſt both with money
and arms, was read, but he ſaid he came in late and did not hear it read; he could
not ſay poſitively ſuch a Letter was read, but that I told him ſo, and that I told him
we could not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115114:14"/>
He ſaid, that I told him we had agreed to raiſe a ſumme of money for <hi>Maſſey</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> either 250 li. or 300 li. He ſaid that I asked him what he would do, ſo
he brought five pound and laid it upon my Table when ſeverall perſons were in
the room; and being askt whether I was in the room, he ſaid, yes, my Lord, but
he could not ſay any els was, ſo he contradicted himſelf; before he ſaid ſeverall
perſons were preſent, now, he ſaid, he could not tell that any els but my ſelf was in
the room; yea, he could not ſay that I received it, or ſee him lay it downe, or
bid him lay it downe; and further he ſaith, he doth but conceive that the money
was for <hi>Maſſey</hi> or <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He could not ſay that I was privy to the Negotiation with <hi>Titus,</hi> nor that I
was preſent at the reading of the Copy of the Kings Letter, which <hi>Alford</hi>
brought from <hi>Callis,</hi> nor that I was preſent whil'ſt that the Narrative was
read.</p>
               <p>He being askt, whether I did ſend <hi>Alford</hi> to <hi>Callis,</hi> or agree to the ſending of
him? he anſwered that he thinks I did not.</p>
               <p>He being askt, whether I gave my conſent to the ſending away of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
he anſwered, that he could not ſay that I was there when it was ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>And being askt, whether I did not proteſt againſt it? he anſwered, that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
by all that the Commiſſion ſhould not be ſent.</p>
               <p>He being askt, whether he thought that I received the five pound he laid on
my table? he anſwered no, but he thought another did receive it, and named
who.</p>
               <p>Thus you have an extract of all the eight Witneſſes have depoſed without exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or omiſſion of any materiall paſſage in any mans Teſtimony. I wiſh from my
heart that all the Depoſitions, together with my Defence made in Court, were
truly publiſhed by an impartiall hand, then I ſhould be confident the Reader would
juſtifie me, though the High Court have condemned me. Being now upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the Witneſſes I crave leave to inſiſt a little larger upon it than I at firſt
intended, that I may manifeſt the more clearly, the inſufficiency, falſneſſe, and
contradictorineſſe thereof; what the Evangeliſt obſerves touching the accuſers of
Chriſt, I may without vanity ſay of mine, that they did not agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
one Witneſſe ſware one thing, and another ſware the quite contrary,
yea they did not only contradict <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne another, but ſometimes contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as I have made appear more fully in my defence before the high Court. I
did never ſee Witneſſes more confounded than they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that though their
Teſtimony did condemne my perſon, yet I (nay themſelves) have condemned
their owne Teſtimony; So that may I ſay, without vanity, that promiſe is made
good, <hi>Iſa. 54. 17. Every tongue that ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt thee thou ſhalt
condemn, this is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord.</hi> To evidence this to the world,
I ſhall give you a brief, and true relation, of ſundry remarkable paſſages concerning
the Witneſſes, either before, or in, or after, the Tryall, which will, If not nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie,
yet invalidate and diſparage their, Teſtimony, in the thoughts of judicious
and impartiall men. I ſhall begin with the firſt Witneſſe, which was Captaine <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
I beſeech you take notice, concerning him, of theſe particulars. Firſt, If ever
his teſtimony be publiſhed,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Potter</hi> the firſt Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> he doth rather juſtifie than accuſe me, he faſtens no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
capitall upon me; yea, ſecondly he ſwears, he met at my houſe ſometimes
on a friendly, ſometimes on a Chriſtian account, or to hear news, that was the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115114:15"/>
worſt he did ſwear about the meeting at my houſe. Thirdly, He ſwore in Court,
that till Maſter <hi>Prideaux</hi> remembered him of ſome things out of the examinations of
other men he could not remember them, or ſpeak to them, yet things done ſo
long agoe, and forgotten by a man are counted to be ſufficient proof againſt me.
Fourthly, he was threatned with death if he would not, and promiſed his life by
Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> if he would confeſſe what he knew, and Witneſſe againſt
me. And becauſe he did not ſwear to every addition and agravation againſt me, put
into his examination (by Capt. <hi>Biſhop</hi> Clerke of the Committee) which he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in Court, and ſaid, all was not his, therefore he is condemned to dye, and
in great danger to loſe his life.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Witneſſe was Major <hi>Alford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Major <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> the 2d. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> he was in much trouble before he came
in againſt me, he told his Siſter, and other Friends, they would put him to death,
if he did not teſtifie againſt me; but now he ſees me condemned, he is filled with
ſhame, that he cannot walk the ſtreets, and with ſorrow, that he can neither ſleep,
nor eat his bread with comfort. Yea, Mr. <hi>Cranford</hi> coming once to viſit him, did
finde him lying on his bed in a dark room, in much diſquiet of minde; he told Mr.
<hi>Cranford,</hi> that nothing did trouble him ſo much in all his life, as his witneſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, and were it to do again, he would never doe it, if he had ten lives to
loſe. Mr. <hi>Cranford</hi> told me this, that he heard it from <hi>Alfords</hi> own mouth. I hear
that he is not well, but I believe I may ſay <hi>agrotat animo magis quam corpore,</hi> and
that he hath great cauſe to be.</p>
               <p>The third Witneſſe was Major <hi>Huntington,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Major <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> he 3d. Witneſs,</note> a man whoſe face I never ſaw but
once at my houſe, nor ſince, but at my Tryall: He is not only a diſſembling fellow,
but a moſt perjured wretch; he did hardly ſwear one true word, as relating to
things done at my houſe, yea, as to me, he ſware moſt falſly that I ſaid of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<hi>Come, come, let it goe,</hi> which is a moſt notorious lye; yea, Captain <hi>Far,</hi>
another of the Witneſſes who was then preſent, ſware the quite contrary, that all
the Company was againſt the ſending the Commiſſion, and did allege the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that I gave againſt it, That private men had not power to Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth Witneſſe was Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Baines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leiutenant Colonell <hi>Baines</hi> the 4th. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> that Arch-Apoſtate from
his firſt Principles, he told the Court a long ſtory, but did not, could not ſay
one word concerning me, ſo he went as wiſe as he came.</p>
               <p>The fifth Witneſſe was Major <hi>Adams,</hi> who is a Monſter among men,<note place="margin">Major <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> the 5th. VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</note> and will
be, I am perſwaded, a monument of Miſery to all that know him; I have many
things to ſay concerning him. Firſt, He was a hired Witneſſe againſt me; one
Major <hi>Cobbet</hi> (a pragmaticall fellow) was imployed by Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> to ſubborne this
Major <hi>Adams,</hi> and did ſo, and to that end did give him 10 l. to that purpoſe, I
ſeeing him ſtand by me in the Court, did charge this <hi>Cobbet</hi> with it; all the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion
he had was this, that he lent the 10. l. to Major <hi>Adams</hi> his Wife, becauſe he
thought he was poor, yet I could have produced Witneſſes in Court (but the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Court
would not permit it) to prove, that <hi>Adams</hi> had received a vaſt ſumme of
money from Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> and from others by Mr. <hi>Scots</hi> appointment, to betray me,
and the reſt of the Miniſters and Citizens now in the Tower; ſo that we may ſay
of this <hi>Adams,</hi> as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did of <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> that ſuborned Prophet, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 12,
13. <hi>And ſo I perceived God had not ſent him, for</hi> Tobiah <hi>and</hi> Sanballat <hi>had hired
him. And therefore was he hired, that they might have matter for an evill report, that
they might repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ach me</hi> Peradventure, God may fill him with ſuch horror of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115114:15"/>
Conſcience, and conſternation of minde before he dies, that he may bring back the
money, the price of my blood, to thoſe <hi>Tabiahs</hi> and <hi>Sanballets</hi> who hired him, as
<hi>Judas</hi> did in trouble of Conſcience bring back the 30 pieces of Silver to the Prieſts
and Phariſes, who did hire him to betray Jeſus Chriſt. Secondly, This <hi>Adams,</hi>
would ordinarily come once or twice a week to my houſe un-invited, on purpoſe, I
now perceive, to inſnare me; he would be very inquiſitive after Newes from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and would be very free to offer me money, and asking, whether I knew of no
publique uſe that required money? but, as the Lord ordered it, I never received a
penny from him. Thirdly, This wretched <hi>Adams</hi> hath been in pay with Mr. <hi>Scot</hi>
above theſe 12 moneths, yet he was not to diſcover himſelf, but to cary himſelfe
as formerly, that ſo he might inſnare honeſt men with the leſſe ſuſpicion. This,
this is the onely man who hath accuſed 13. Godly Miniſters, many worthy Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;
all who are now in trouble, were brought to Priſon upon his ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
I ſpeak this upon knowledge; for by a ſpeciall providence I have gotten
a copy of his Informations he hath given in to Mr. <hi>Scot:</hi> Yea, he hath informed of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
private Faſt that he himſelf was at, ſignified what perſons were preſent, who
preacht and prayd, and what they prayed about the State; he hath accuſed many
of the ſecluded Members alſo. There hath been ſuch a continuance in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of ſtudied wickedneſſe, and all under a high pretence of Profeſſion, that I
think there is not ſuch a Parallel in the whole world. Oh! I do wonder how this
wretch can ſleep by night, or eat his bread by day, with any comfort, who hath bin

                  </gap>, to cover all this wickedneſſe, they muſt accuſe him of
High-Treaſon, clap him cloſe Priſoner, yet underhand they did maintaine him
there; yea, he did ſhed tears, and pretend trouble, that he was forced to come in
againſt me. He told Miſtris <hi>Jackson</hi> in the Poultrey, that he did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had not better chuſe to be hanged, than to ſwear againſt me; yea, he took
a cup of Wine or Beer (in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> a Miniſter, and his Son, who
lives in the Poultrey) wiſhing it might be his poyſon, if either he had accuſed me, or
would accuſe me. This Mr. <hi>Cranford</hi> told me he had from Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> himſelfe.
All this was to cover his wickedneſſe, that he might not be ſuſpected to be a hired
or ſuborned witneſſe. And herein you may ſee the falſeneſſe and wretchedneſſe of
this man, he that pretended trouble and ſorrow before he did come in a Witneſſe
againſt me, now diſcovers impudency, impenitency, and hardneſſe of heart, after he
hath maliciouſly ſworn againſt me, to take away my life; the Lord open his eyes,

few particulars Firſt. He did fully reſolve, before he was taken into Cuſtody,
neither to accuſe himſelf, or any other; yet, through fear, did both. Secondly,
when he was brought in open Court to be a Witneſſe againſt me, he did, for at
leaſt half an hour, refuſe to ſwear, or to be a Witneſſe againſt me, yea, when
he came firſt in the Court, be ſaid he was a cloſe priſoner, accuſed of the ſame crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that I was accuſed of, that he was not a competent Witneſſe againſt me, yea, he
ſaid oftentimes that he could not in Conſcience be a Witneſſe againſt me; the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115114:16"/>
Counſell for the Common-wealth, and the Court did ſtill preſſe him to take his
Oath againſt me, yet he did ſtill refuſe; he was fined 500 l. and ſent out of the
Court; and immediately he was called into the Court again, and urged to take his
Oath, and threatned if he would not; they told him they had fined him 500 l. for
refuſing to ſwear againſt me; upon this he was more yielding to take his Oath, yet
he did not take his Oath as any of the reſt did, but did only put up his hand by his
buttons, and when I asked him, whether he was under an Oath? he anſwered, that
he was as good as under an Oath; at length he did mutter out that he was under
an Oath, but yet ſince I was condemned his owne wife came to me, told me
how much her husband was troubled for what he had done, and did aſſure me,
that her husband told her, that he did not looke upon himſelf as under an Oath.
Thirdly, when this poor man heard that I was condemned to dye, then in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of his Soule he did write me a Letter, wherein, among other things, he did
confeſſe he had done me wrong, and deſired me to forgive him the wrong he had

Captain <hi>Biſhop,</hi> to be read in Court, which is contrary to Law and Juſtice, and the
Cuſtomes of all Courts. They commanded the Scaffolds to be put up the firſt day,
when my black and bloody Charge was read, and the Witneſſes produced in Court,
but pulled down the Scaffolds when I made my Defence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Though they pulled down the Scaffolds when I made my defence, yet they
put them up again, when the Counſell for the Common-wealth were to make

               </p>
               <p>If they will ſay, The King had not agreed with the <hi>Scots,</hi> had it not been for me
and my Confederates, and ſo by conſequence I am guilty of all the blood ſhed in

               <p>1. If I, by any ſtrained conſequence, ſhould be found guilty of the blood of

ſheding of blood in <hi>Scotland;</hi> Can I be ſaid by Conſequence to be guilty of the
blood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> only for praying the King may agree with the <hi>Scots</hi> upon the

of our Brethren of SCOTLAND, I ſhall lay down a few conſiderations
whereby you may ſee the evill nature, and dangerous conſequence of this
War.</p>
               <p>Firſt; This Warre with <hi>Scotland</hi> is worſe than the former war intended againſt
<hi>Scotland</hi> in the year 1640.<note place="margin">Firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is with the firſt War.</note> it is worſe in many regards: 1. The Firſt war was called
<hi>Bellum Epiſcopale,</hi> this may be called <hi>Bellum Haereticale,</hi> (if I may ſo ſay) the firſt
War would have brought in Popiſh ceremonies, this War brings in damnable
Hereſies, and helliſh blaſphemies; by the firſt they would have ſcrued up Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
into Tyranny, by this they will pull down Monarchy, and turne all to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
2. This War in the year 1650. is worſe than that intended about the
yeare 1640., becauſe then we were not under ſo many Covenants, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
one towards another as now we are, <hi>Cromwell</hi> invaded them after a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Articles of Agreement for aſſiſtance made with them, after help and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
aſſiſtance received from them, yet he hath forgotten the Brotherly Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
with them, and all the kindneſſes we have had from them in the day of out
deep diſtreſſe. Thirdly, This war hath not ſuch an Authority as the former had,
the firſt was raiſed by the King and his Councell, this by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and a Faction.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115114:18"/>
Fourthly, the Souldiers, many of them, doe behave themſelves worſer than the
Souldiers the King and Biſhops did raiſe againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> at firſt; the Kings Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were but ignorant and prophane, theſe many of them Hereticks and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;
thoſe did pull down Croſſes and Pictures, theſe pull downe Ordinances;
thoſe drunk with Wine or Strong Drink, but theſe drunk with Error, having a
ſpirit of gyddineſſe and contradiction againſt the Truth, which is the worſt ſort
of drunkenneſſe. Fifthly, far worſe in the event alſo; in the Kings and Biſhops
war not above 14 ſlain one both ſides, but in this war <hi>Cromwell</hi> with a more cruel
and bloody minde hath moſt barbarouſly ſlaine at leaſt 10000 of the Scotiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſince he entered <hi>Scotland,</hi> oh the bloody cruelty of this man!</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond reaſon may be taken from the time when <hi>Cromwell</hi> invaded them;
it was not when <hi>Scotland</hi> was over-run with malignity, during the time of <hi>Hamble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
prevalency, but it was when the power of that Kingdome was in the hands of
the moſt Religious and Covenanting Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after <hi>Hamblitons</hi> Army was
deſtroyed, and <hi>Montroſſe</hi> defeated; and the godly party who managed the cauſe
of God for theſe 14 years faithfully, had all the power of that Kingdome in their
hands, then <hi>Cromwell</hi> invaded them, which to me is an evident Demonſtration,
that the invaſion of <hi>Scotland</hi> was by the inſtigation of Jeſuites, and the Papiſts
Party to root out the Proteſtant Party in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cotland,</hi> and to bring their perſons in
vaſſalage and thraldome as to their civill Liberties.</p>
               <p>3. A third Reaſon may be drawn from the ſlight grounds <hi>Cromwell</hi> had to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe they would not be a Common-wealth, therefore they ſhall
not be a People; becauſe they will not break their Covenants, therefore <hi>Cromwell</hi>
will break them; becauſe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> will not lay their Conſciences waſte, he will lay
their land waſte and make it deſolate; becauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> are for a Scripturall Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
and a well-regulated Monarchy, for found doctrine and the power of
godlyneſſe, therefore it is that <hi>Cromwell</hi> is ſo much their Enemy. Whatever els
may be pretended, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et theſe were the true grounds why <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the reſt of
the Ieſuited Spaniſh Faction did invade the neighbour Nation.</p>
               <p>4. A fourth reaſon may be taken from the wicked ends <hi>Cromwell</hi> aims at in
his invading <hi>Scotland, viz.</hi> merely to ſatisfie his ambitious and covetous deſires to
be abſolute Lord of the Eſtates, Liberties and Lives of all the people in theſe 3. Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it doth not content him to have one Kingdome, <hi>viz. Ireland</hi> for <hi>Ireton</hi> his
Son, nor another Kingdome, <hi>viz. England</hi> for himſelf, but he muſt have <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
alſo. His end is as was that of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> invading <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in
<hi>Amos 1. 13. That they might inlarge their borders;</hi> his end, and the end his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
aim is like that of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi>

Monarch in <hi>Hab. 2. 56. He is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth
his deſire as hell, and cannot be ſatisfied, but gathereth unto him all Nations,
and heapeth unto him all people, but ſhall not all theſe take up a taunting proverbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, Woe to him that encreaſeth that which is not his,</hi> &amp;c. We puniſh him
with death who breakes open a houſe and robs but one Family, but what a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
deaths doth he deſerve, who breaks into a Kingdome, and robbes many
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115114:19"/>
thouſand Families, even a whole Nation. The Prophet <hi>Hab akkuk</hi> pronounceth
<hi>A woe to him that builds a Town with blood, and eſtabliſheth a City by iniquity. Hab.</hi>
2. 12. What a woe then ſhall befall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that doth not build Townes with
blood, but deſtroys many Townes by blood, but builds up none? that doth not
ſtabliſh a City, but deſtroyes many Cities in <hi>ENGLAND</hi> and <hi>SCOTLAND</hi>
by Iniquity?</p>
               <p>5. A fifth reaſon may be drawn from the Covenant and Treaties between the two
Nations. I begin with the Covenant ſo far as it concerns <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
we promiſe <hi>to endeavour the preſervation of the reformed Religion in the Church
of</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worship, Diſcipline, and Government:</hi> But <hi>Cromwells</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Scotland</hi> tends directly to the deſtruction of the reformed Religion in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
both in Doctrine, by the many Hereſies the Army ſpreads amongſt them, and
in Worſhip, by thoſe who are above Ordinances, and in Diſcipline and Government
by thoſe that are inveterate enemies to the Presbyteriall Government, and are moſt
of them for Independency, or Anabaptiſme, Browniſme, or Scepticiſme, &amp;c. In
the third Article we promiſe <hi>to preſerve the liberties of the Kingdoms:</hi> But <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi>
invading <hi>Scotland,</hi> brings <hi>England</hi> under guilt, and <hi>Scotland</hi> under beggery
and ſlavery. In the fourth Article we promiſe, <hi>That we ſhall endeavour the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of all ſuch as have been or ſhall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by hindring the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or
one of the Kingdomes from another.</hi> If theſe things be the brands that the Covenant
puts upon <hi>Incendiaries, Malignants, or evill Inſtruments,</hi> then is not <hi>Cromwell</hi> and
his Faction the great Incendiaries, Malignauts, and evill Inſtruments, who have
hindred the Reformation of Religion, nay blemiſhed the very name, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
the very face of Religion? and have they not divided the King from his
people, not only by interrupting his agreement with the Parliament, and dividing
him from them, but by dividing his head from his body? and have not they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one of the Kingdoms from another, and by this unjuſt invaſion laid ſuch ſeeds
to diſſentions, and irreconcileable differences, as are likely never to be healed, yea
ſo divided as never likely to be united together any more? In the fifth Article it is
ſaid, <hi>Where as the happineſſe of a bleſſed peace between theſe Kingdomes, denyed in
former times to our pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce of God granted unto us, and
hath been lately concluded and ſetled by both Parliaments, we shal each one of us indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that they may remaine conjoyned in a firme Peace and Union to all poſterity.</hi> Let
the world judge whether <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his invaders have endeavoured that the
Kingdoms may remain in a firme peace and union to all poſterity; he was ſo far from
endeavouring to have this Union kept to all poſterity, that he diſſolved this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
within ſeven years after he promiſed to preſerve this Union, for he took the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in the yeare 1643. and entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a bloody Hoſtile manner, in the
yeare 1650. Thus you ſee <hi>Cromwells</hi> invaſion of <hi>Scotland</hi> is repugnant to the
whole ſcope and tenour of the Covenant; it is contrary to the Articles of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between both Kingdoms; for this is one among the reſt, That one Nation ſhall
not wage war with each other, but give three moneths warning before hand; but Cremwell did not not give three dayes warning to Scotland before he invaded their
Land.</p>
               <p>6. I may draw the ſixth reaſon from the judgement of the Parliament, when free
and full, they were ſtill averſe to any breach with, and war againſt, their Brethren
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as knowing it would endanger the Proteſtant Religion, and godly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115114:19"/>
in both the Nations. I well remember the King called a Parliament here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in <hi>April</hi> 1640. on purpoſe to raiſe money to carry on the Warre againſt
the <hi>Scots,</hi> but the Parliament utterly refuſed to grant any money to ſo
ill a purpoſe, and did all they could to diſſwade the King from the Warre with
<hi>Scotland,</hi> publiquely proteſting againſt the War as diſhonourable, and dangerous
to Religion, and both Kingdomes; whereupon, through the deſignes of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and Popiſh party that Parliament was diſſolved, within 10 dayes after it was
called. Although the diſſolving that Parliament was a great grief of heart to all
the godly in this Nation, yet it was a rejoycing, that the Parliament refuſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the War of <hi>Scotland.</hi> After this, there were publique Thankſgivings
throughout all <hi>England,</hi> enjoyned by King and Parliament, for the Pacification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the wiſdome of the Parliament in the year 1640. judged it unlawfull to wage
War againſt <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the ſollicitations of the King and Biſhops, becauſe
they would obtrude Popiſh Ceremonies upon that Nation, may not we judge it
much more unlawfull to wage War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bring Blaſphemies, Hereſies,
and Slavery upon them, and that after we have had a Brotherly aſſiſtance from
them, and have entered into Covenant with them? There are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e pretences to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the War with <hi>Scotland</hi> in the year 1650, by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> than in the year 1640.
when the King intended to wage war with them.</p>
               <p>7. A ſeventh Reaſon may be drawn from the intollerable miſchiefs, ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and unexpreſſible calamities likely to befall the Proteſtant and Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
party in the 3. Kingdoms, the miſchiefs and ſad conſequences of <hi>Cromwells</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
<hi>Scotland,</hi> I ſhall reduce to 8. heads.</p>
               <p>1. The War with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels is by this means neglected, and lengthened
out; had <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſtaid in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had but one half of the Souldiers he hath
now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in all likelyhood the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wars had been ended long before
now, the Rebels deſtroyed, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had had a quiet and peaceable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that Land. But <hi>Cromwell</hi> (through the counſell of the Pope, King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Ieſuites) had rather fight with the Proteſtant covenanting party in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> than with the Rebels of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By this means moſt grievous and burdenſome Taxes are continued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
I ſhall mention one thing, which to the vulgar may ſeem incredible, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Iuncto at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have (by the Exciſe, Cuſtomes, Sequeſtrations and
Taxes) received more money in one year, than all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> put them
all together, ſince the Conqueſt, did raiſe upon their Subjects for ſuch a ſpace of
time, yet the Kings called Oppreſſors, and theſe called Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. A totall eradication of the Presbyteriall Government in both the Kingdoms.
Presbytery is the But, at which the Prelates of old, and the Sectaries of late, have
ſhot their invenomed Arrows.</p>
               <p>4. A great indangering of all the Proteſtant Churches and States in <hi>Europe.</hi>
The Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> make up the greateſt Body of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion in Chriſtendome, being beſt able to defend themſelves, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
other Reformed Churches, when indangered and deſigned to ruine by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Enemies, therefore the diſcountenancing of the Covenanting party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the ruining of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is the readieſt way to indanger, conquer,
ruine all other Reformed Churches in the World; and how will this imbolden
and encourage Popiſh Adveraries to invade and ruine the Proteſtants whiles
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115114:20"/>
they ſee <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (who make up the greateſt Body of the Proteſtant
Religion in Chriſtendome) engaged in an un-Brotherly and un-Chriſtian War
between themſelves, and weakning, impoveriſhing, and deſtroying each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Cromwells</hi> invaſion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is an extraordinary ground of joy to the
Pope, and all his Confederates. Had the Conclave of <hi>Rome</hi> plotted together,
they could not wiſh a more happy and hopefull deſigne to advance the intereſt
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Catholick Religion; that doth more glad and gratifie the Popiſh
party, than to ſee the Proteſtant party in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ruining one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I have read a very remarkeable ſtory of a great Politician in <hi>France,</hi> that
is, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu, That a little before his death be left Inſtructions and advice
with the late</hi> French <hi>King, that he would uſe his utmoſt endeavour to foment the late
differences between the King of</hi> England <hi>and the Parliament, and, if it were poſſible,
by the ſollicitations of his Inſtruments, to draw the Houſe of Commons in</hi> England
<hi>to change their Government, from a Kingdome into a Common-wealth; by which
means</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>would be imbroyled in warres one againſt another,
which is the onely and beſt policy of all to weaken and deſtroy the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and advance the intereſt of</hi> France, <hi>and Catholique Religion.</hi> The truth of
this ſtory is aſſerted by an <hi>Italian</hi> of good note and credit, and publiſhed by him,
and Printed in <hi>Italy, anno</hi> 1645.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more touching this particular, but only this; that I doe verily
beleeve <hi>Cromwels</hi> invading <hi>Scotland</hi> in the year 1650. makes it a year of Iubilee
in <hi>Rome;</hi> but a year of ſlavery to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a year of ſorrow
to all the Proteſtant Churches round about us; which puts me upon the next ſad
conſequence of this war, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. It will be, and is a great grief and ſadning to all Proteſtant States and
Churches round about us; when they conſider how we who have lived under
one King, united in one Covenant, ingaged in one and the ſame Quarrell, that
we ſhould ruine and deſtroy one another, and that with ſuch bloody rage, and
cruell hatred as we doe; what a grief is it to them to conſider, that we who might
have been their he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor defend our ſelves at home?</p>
               <p>7. It will lay laſting foundations of irreconcileable diſcord between the two
Nations, That we who were the deareſt Friends, will be to each other the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Enemies.</p>
               <p>8. There will be a toleration of all Hereſies and Blaſphemies in the Church,
and an increaſing of all oppreſſion and violence in the State. Theſe two uſually
goe together. <hi>Iudges</hi> 5. 8. They choſe new Gods, then was there War in their
Gates. Theſe, with manifold more inconceivable miſchiefes are likely to ariſe,
by reaſon of <hi>Cromwels</hi> groundleſſe and unwarrantable invaſion of our neighbour
Nation.</p>
               <p>The laſt work I have now to doe about this vindication of my ſelf, is to take off
ſome aſperſions and ſlanders unjuſtly laid upon me.</p>
               <p>1. Some report that I am under great fears of death, that much terror and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
laies hold upon me.</p>
               <p>To which I ſay, That through the ſence of the pardoning mercies of God,
through the blood of ſprinkling,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> the bitterneſſe, fear, and ſting of death is much
abated; that I am delivered from the fear of death, to which all the former part

part of my life I was ſubject unto bondage; I ſpeak it without vanity to the praiſe
of Gods glorious grace, I formerly have had more feare at the pulling out of a
Tooth, than now I have at the thoughts of the cutting off my head. I mention it
to the praiſe of God, who ſupported me, the hearing of the Sentence of Death
pronounced againſt me in the Court, did no whit diſmay me, I had as much calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and quietneſſe in my minde, at that very ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

yea ſince I have been condemned, I bleſſe God, I have not had one troubled
thought, nor broke one hours reſt, nor forborne one meals meat, yea the very
night before I was to ſuffer, I ſupt as heartily, and ſlept as ſweetly, as ever I did
in all my life; the hopes I have of an eternall life, doth ſwallow up the fears of a
temporall death.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Objection,</hi> But yon confeſſe you have ſinned, therefore you are put to death
for your ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I have indeed, and I ought to confeſſe my ſinns againſt God, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
my ſelf, and juſtifie God, acknowledging that I have ſinned, and he is
righteous in all that is come upon me, ſo that it is juſt with the moſt high to
cut me off in the midſt of my dayes, and in the midſt of my Miniſtry; but yet I
never ſaid that I had ſinned againſt God in the particular facts for which that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
ſentence was paſt upon me; I ſay ſtill as I did at the Bar, when I received the
ſentence of death, that God did not condemne me, when I was judged, that
neither God nor my own Conſcience did condemne me of ſin; I have tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their bloody Lawes, it is true, yet not broken any command of God in ſo doing,
they have ſinned in making ſuch Lawes, not I in breaking them. I am far
from thinking that I have ſinned in what I have done, to deſire the King might
agree with the <hi>Scots</hi> upon the intereſt of Religion, and the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to relieve that gallant Gentleman Major Generall <hi>Maſſey,</hi> to pray for and
endeavour after the good of the Godly in the neighbour nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
are Brethren in Covenant with us; I count all this my duty, not my ſinne; yet
I deny not, but as infirmities doe cleave to my duties, ſo in the way of mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this buſineſſe, inadvertency, indiſcretion, and too much openneſſe might
cleave to theſe actings of mine, but that the thing it ſelf was evill that I never have,
never ſhall confeſſe.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> Some are not aſhamed to ſay, that I am a debaucht perſon, that I have
been guilty of uncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This I declare in the ſight of God is moſt abominably falſe; as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid
of himſelf, That he was not tempted to covetouſneſſe: ſo through the grace of
God, I can ſay it without vanity or falſhood, I have not been tempted to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
I know no ground of this report but this, that on Eaſter-day night laſt was
ſix yeare, one of my name, Maſter <hi>Edward Love,</hi> a Chaplain in the Army, was
queſtioned before Juſtice <hi>Rich,</hi> dwelling about Chancery Lane, for being found
in bed whith a Whore, now becauſe he was one of my name, ſome Malignants
did charge it upon me, but that groſſe lye was ſoon quelled, but is now revived,
and ſuggeſted to ſome in preſent power, on purpoſe to exaſperate them againſt me:
But why ſhould I be troubled at theſe ſlanders? my betters have been falſly accuſed
as well as I; two Harlots accuſed <hi>Athanaſius</hi> that he was uncleane with them,
when he was the Chaſteſt man of that age; <hi>Beza</hi> was accuſed of drunkenneſſe and

to my parents hath abounded, as I had great cauſe, for their tenderneſſe and
care in my education, they have been dead above ſeven years ſince; it is true,
they had a competent livelyhood in the World, but fell to decay, and when they
were neceſſitated, I ſpeak it truly, when I was not worth 20 li. in all the world, my
parents had ten of it.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Object.</hi> It is reported that I neglected Mr. <hi>Erbury,</hi> who was the means of my
converſion and education, that when he was plundred in WALES, and
came to ENGLAND in a neceſſitous condition, that I would not relieve
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> As for Maſter <hi>Erbury,</hi> though he is fallen into dangerous opinions, yet,
he being my ſpirituall Father, I do naturally care for him, as <hi>Timothy</hi> did for
<hi>Paul,</hi> my heart cleaves to him in love, more than to any one man in the World;
I ſpeake to the praiſe of God, he was the inſtrument to my converſion, near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years agoe, and the means of my education alſo in the Vniverſity, for which
kindneſſe, the half I have in the World, I could readily part with for his reliefe.
It is true, about eight or nine years ſince, he was plundered in <hi>Wales,</hi> and did
come to ſee me at <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, but a Sonne could not make more of a Father,
than I made of him, according to my ability; when I had not twelve pounds in
all the World, I let Maſter <hi>Erbury</hi> have ſix of it, indeed he afterward gave me a
horſe, for which I received not much above forty ſhillings; yea I procured him a
place in the Army, to be Chaplaine to Major Generall <hi>Skippons</hi> Regiment, where
he had eight ſhillings a day.</p>

me, and then I did confeſſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a manifeſt untruth; thoſe Proteſtations I made the firſt day of my
Tryall, I made them alſo the laſt day, rejoycing that they were not falſified nor
contradicted by any of the 8 Witneſſes; but I have ſpoken to this more largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>If other ſlanders ſhall be caſt upon me, I hope you will have ſo much charity,
not to believe reports raiſed upon me, when I ſhall be ſilent in the Grave, not
able to ſpeake in my owne vindication. This I ſay without vanity of falſhood,
I have been kept for theſe twenty years, from the time I firſt knew God, from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into any ſcandalous evill, but only into thoſe infirmities of unavoydable and
dayly incurſion, unto which all the Godly are ſubject in the courſe of their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
I love not to ſpeak in my own praiſe, yet I judge it lawfull when other mens
mouthes falſly accuſe me, my owne mouth may modeſtly commend me.</p>
               <p>As an Appendix to what I have already written, I have but a few things to deſire
the Reader to take notice of.</p>
               <p>1. I am informed that there is ſomething blotted out of my laſt Petition, after it
went from me, without my knowledge or conſent. To aſſure all the World that I
was no Malignant, I did put this clauſe in my fourth Petition, <hi>That in my place
and calling, I ſhould oppoſe all Malignant deſigns, whether in this or the Neighbour
Nation, that may tend to the ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

word [Malignant] and would thereby hold the world in hand, as if I ſhould
engage to oppoſe the King and <hi>Scots</hi> which are now entred <hi>England,</hi> which was
far from my Heart; I judge it no Malignant deſigne for the <hi>Scots</hi> to defend
their Nation, and the Title of their King, upon the intereſt of Religion, and
terms of the Covenant, this is an honeſt and juſtifiable deſigne. Indeed Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Bond</hi> were with me in the Tower, and deſired me to put it out, but I told
them I could not doe it, becauſe I ſaid, though I would be lookt upon as one that
would oppoſe Malignant deſignes, yet I would not be lookt upon as one that
would oppoſe the honeſt <hi>Scots,</hi> or as if I thought their actings were Malignant
deſignes. I ſent the Petition to Sheriffe <hi>Titchburn,</hi> if he obſerved it, he will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie

out any thing more, or put any thing in, God knows; I am not aſhamed to
own the Petitions. I have given you the Subſtance of them in my vindication. I
deſire you to take notice alſo, that by [Common-wealth] I do not underſtand
the preſent Government, (I wiſh that were ruined) but by Common-wealth I
underſtand the Body or Community of the People of this Nation, I ſhall in my

ruine.</p>
               <p>2. I deſire you to take notice, that it is very likely they will not publiſh the
Depoſitions of the Witneſſes in Court, but the private Examinations taken from
them in private, and patcht together by Mr. <hi>Scet,</hi> and Captain <hi>Biſhop;</hi> they were
not aſhamed to produce them and read them in open Court, and ſome of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
had ſo much honeſty left, as to diſſavow them in open Court. Believe
nothing (beloved) but what was ſworn in open Court, nor all that neither, for
ſome of the Witneſſes ſwore falſly, as I made appear in my Defence.</p>
               <p>3 I deſire the Reader to take notice, that there is a lying Pamphlet put forth,
entituled, <hi>A ſhort Plea for the Common-wealth.</hi> In which there are many groſſe
lies, eſpecially in things which relate to me. It is not fit for me to enter the Liſts

I never wrote Letter to the King, Queen,</hi> Iermin, Piercy, Titus, Maſſey, <hi>&amp;c. That

gathered any for the King, &amp;c. or</hi> Maſſey <hi>and</hi> Titus, &amp;c. This is a loud Lye, it is
well there are many Witneſſes to contradict him; and ſurely, if the Author of
this Book had not eaſt off all fear of God, and regard to the good name of his
Brother, he could not be ſo impudent, as to affirm that theſe were my Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations.
I never named <hi>Maſſey</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> in my Proteſtations, for then I had
proteſted a falſhood, (which I durſt not doe) I did write a Letter to <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and
did contribute money to <hi>Maſſey</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> yet my Proteſtations are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted;
for I Proteſted, I writ no Letter to the King, Queen, Church, or State
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the generall, or to any particular perſon of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation.
The truth of this I ſhall ſtand to. For though I did write and give money to <hi>Maſſey,</hi>
yet my Proteſtation is not falſified, for he is of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

and generall profeſſion of my Innocency, though the proof, and his Confeſſion at the

with the King, Queen, &amp;c. writing a Letter to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Ierſey;</hi> as to theſe things I ſaid I was innocent, and ſo I ſay ſtill.
But as for the latter part of his words, That the proof, and my Confeſſion at the
Court contradicted my Anſwer at my Examination, that's abominably falſe;
though he was not aſhamed to ſay ſo in the generall, yet he durſt not inſtance
in any particular, nor will any other in my life time, whilſt I can anſwer for my
ſelfe. I do affirm this to all the World, That at my Examinations I did deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was true, nor would I confeſſe any thing that was Criminall. And
becauſe I am belyed, about my examination before the Committee, and may be
more abuſed after I am dead, therefore I am neceſſitated to diſcover that jugling
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115114:22"/>
and baſeneſſe of Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> and Captain <hi>Biſhop,</hi> about my Examination, which I
thought never to have made publique. Whiles I was examined before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
that pragmaticall fellow Captain <hi>Biſhop</hi> (who, I ſuppoſe wrote this lying
Book) did put in 6 or 8 lines into my Examinations, which I never ſaid; he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

with out any more adoe: But I did, to his ſhame make him blot out at
leaſt 6 lines in my Examination, which was but very ſhort; Some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
did ingenuouſly ſay ſometimes, that I did not ſpeak ſuch words as Captain
<hi>Biſhop</hi> did put in. By his abuſe of me, who would not be abuſed by him, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think how he injured other men. I did refuſe to put my hand to it, ſeeing
I was abuſed by Captain <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but told them, if they would give me a Copy of
it, I would ſubſcribe my hand; but they denyed me a Copy, which made me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
they did not intend to deale fairly with me; as I found true ſoone after.
About 3 weeks after I was examined, Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> came to examine
me in the Tower; I ſtill refuſed to accuſe my ſelfe; Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> ſhewed me a Paper,
told me it was the Examination taken from my mouth; he read it to me, when I
ſaw and heard it, I renounced it, told him plainly it was a forged paper, that it
was not mine. He replyed, it was that very individuall paper that was written and
taken from my mouth; and that he himſelf did endorſe it with his own hand.
To this I reply, whether he endorſed it, or no, I could not ſay, but I can ſay, and
do affirm, the paper was not mine, and I gave him two evident and undenyable
Demonſtrations that it was not the paper written at my Examinations.
For, 1. In that paper there were many lines blotted out, but in this there were
none. 2. In the paper ſhewed me at the Tower was written to this effect, That
I ſhould ſay, I was not preſent at the reading or hearing of any Letters read from
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which I never ſaid; and I did put him in minde, that I refuſed to Anſwer
that Queſtion, Whether I was preſent when Letters were read? Becauſe (ſaid I)
then your next Queſtion will be, Who elſe was preſent? So I muſt accuſe others,
which I ſhall not doe: And then, further, if I ſhould ſay I was not preſent, and
you could prove that I was preſent at the hearing of any Letters of News from
Foreign parts, you would taxe me of a falſhood, which none ſhall be able to
faſten upon. This did ſomewhat ſilence, and ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> that it was not the
paper that was taken at my Examination; wherefore, I beſeech the Reader not
to beleeve any thing that ſhall come forth, either pretended to be my Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or the Examinations of other men againſt me, they are but the Forgeries
and Contrivements of Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> and Capt. <hi>Biſhop.</hi>

That I ſhould ſay in my Petition, (the firſt he muſt mean, for the clauſe [your

and it is not for the honour of the preſent Government, to have a common lyer to
be a pleader for their Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Having thus finiſhed the third particular, which I deſired the Reader to take
notice of, I now come to a fourth.</p>
               <p>I deſire the Reader to take notice of the juſtice of the men in preſent power,
thoſe men who did ſend Letters to the King, Queen, <hi>Iermin, Piercy,</hi> who did
ſend <hi>Titus</hi> an Agent to <hi>Ierſey,</hi> theſe men muſt be acquitted, but I, who did not
thus, muſt be condemned and executed. I may aptly apply that latine Proverbe,
<hi>Dat veniam corvis, vexat cenſura columbas;</hi> or elſe that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverbe, Some
men may better ſteal a horſe, than another look over the Hedge.</p>
               <p>5. I deſire the Reader to take notice of the bloody policy of the men in preſent
power, as alſo of the ſimplicity and folly of the Members of the High Court, the
Politicians that ſate at ſterne, did make ſome of the ſilly Members of the High
Court believe, that to preſerve the honour of the State I muſt be condemned,
for two of the High Court told me, they muſt condemne me for the honour of
the Parlinment; and if they did condemne me, yet the Parliament would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, if I would but Petition them for mercy; by this means they inveagled the
High Court to paſſe the bloody ſentence of death upon me with the leſſe regret of
Conſcience.</p>
               <p>6. I deſire all men to take notice, that there hath not been ſuch an eager, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and unjuſt proſecution of a Miniſters blood, ſince the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
as there hath been of mine. For, firſt, Although no two Witneſſe did prove any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
fact that was treaſonable by their new acts, yet I muſt dye. Yea, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Though the Reverend Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Kent,</hi> and of
<hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> did Petition in my behalf, yet they will have my blood. Thirdly,
Though divers Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and many of them of their owne party, did Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
for me, and ſo did my owne Congregation, and divers other wayes and
means uſed for the preſervation of my life, yet ſo thirſty are they after my blood,
that nothing will ſatisfie them but my death. Fourthly, Yea, although divers of
thoſe who are Members of the High Court of Juſtice did uſe their utmoſt intereſt to
preſerve my life, yet all theſe applications, together with mine and my Wifes, are
ineffectuall, they rather hearken to the bloody ſolicitations of a Malignant, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
and Ieſuiticall party, who thirſt after my blood, than to the deſires of many
Godly and peaceable minded men.</p>
               <p>7. I deſire the Reader to take notice, that although the Independent Miniſters
did Petition for my reprieve (for which I thank them) yet they refuſed to joyn
with the Presbyterian Miniſters to Petition for my life, unleſſe they would do
thoſe things which they could not do to ſave their owne lives; I ſay they refuſed
to joyn with them to Petition for a Pardon, unleſſe they would owne the preſent
Power, declare againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſuch like hard tearms would the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

Brethren, tye the Presbyterian Miniſters too, els they would not joyn with
them to beg for my life, ſo that it ſeems their aime was more at the bringing over
the Miniſters to joyn with the State faction, than out of any ayme to ſave my
life.</p>
               <p>8. I deſire the Reader to obſerve, that ſince the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> there hath
been no Proteſtant Miniſter ſo unchriſtianly dealt withall, as I have been, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſuch hard meaſure, and that from thoſe, who profeſſe Religion, as I have
done, which I ſhall plainly evince by undenyable demonſtrations. Firſt, They
hired one Witneſſe with vaſt ſummes of money, promiſes of preferment, to betray
and inſnare me, and bring in evidence againſt me. Secondly, They threatned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Witneſſes with death, if they would not teſtifie againſt me. Thirdly,
They ſent ſeverall perſons to me to the Tower, to diſcoueſe and diſpute with me,
on purpoſe to intrap and inſnare me Fourthly, They put up large Scaffolds on
the firſt day of my Tryall, when the bloody charge was read againſt me, that the
greater number might hear it, and be prejudiced againſt me, but pulled them down
againe, when I was to make my defence in my own juſtification, that ſo my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
might be ſmothered; then put the Scaffolds up againe, when the Councell
for the Common-wealth pleaded againſt me. Yea, Thirdly, They took away
the writings and books which my Notary took in Court, that ſo nothing might
come to light, but what pleaſeth themſelves; ſo that they will put in and put
out paſſages about my tryall as ſhall make moſt for their advantage, and my
prejudice. Sixthly, they rejected two of the Councellors which themſelves had
aſſigned me, that they ſhould not plead for me, becauſe they had not taken the
Engagement. Seventhly, They would not alow Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> who was one of my
Councell to have an hours time to prepare himſelf to plead in my caſe, but he muſt
plead preſently or not at all; although, as I told the Court, I never ſaw Maſter
<hi>Hales</hi> till that morning, ſo could not acquaint him with my caſe, nor did Mr.
<hi>Hales</hi> ever ſee the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, yet for all this they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him one dayes time to ſtudy my caſe; yet it pleaſed God to aſſiſt Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi>
that he did plead <hi>ex tempore,</hi> to overthrow the Charge, proved it illegall, &amp;c.
They were ſo ſilenced at, and aſhamed of, their illegall proceedings, that after
my Notary had written a while, they forbade him to write any more, which they
never did before; they were afraid leſt Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> pleading in my behalfe ſhould
come to light. Eighthly, They have raiſed lying and ſlanderous reports of me, on
purpoſe to kill my name, as well as murder my Body. Ninthly, Whereas I ſent
Colonel <hi>Forteſcue</hi> with a Petition to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to deſire him to mediate to the
Houſe for my life, upon his returne to <hi>London</hi> with ſeverall Letters in my behalfe,
they have clapt him cloſe priſoner, would not ſuffer him to come near me ſo that
I know not what he did in my behalfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, they ſecured his Letters, would not
ſuffer them to be delivered to thoſe to whom they were directed, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſo there might
be no ſollicitations for the preſervation of my life; ſo that all the coſt I am at in
ſending is in effectuall by this means, although it hath already coſt me, for two Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
above one hundred and five pounds, yet the great kindneſſe and labour of
love the two Gentlemen expreſt, is never the leſſe acceptable to me, although it
be not ſucceſſefull for me. Tenthly, Although I do not envy the ſafety, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the ruine of others, yet I cannot but take notice of the rage of ſome men towards
me, that I muſt dye, yet others live, who have been correſpondents from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
who have ſent Letters to the King, Queen, <hi>Iermin, Riercy,</hi> who ſent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115114:25"/>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> over as an agent to <hi>Jerſy,</hi> (which I never did.) All this <hi>Alford, Adams,</hi> and
<hi>Far,</hi> who are my accuſers, have done, yet they muſt be acquitted, and I execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
I mention not this out of envy to them, I have none in my heart towards them;
I wiſh their Lives, not their deaths; but the reaſon why I mention this is, to let
the world ſee why their rage is thus againſt me, it is not for the merit of my
facts, for then they ſhould puniſh others, who are far more guilty, but it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their rage againſt my perſon, and calling, as I am a Miniſter, and becauſe I will
not proſtitute my Conſcience to their ambition and uſurpation. Eleventhly, The
High Court would not allow the common privilege, to have Witneſſes for me
heard, though I earneſtly deſired; I had many Witneſſes ready in Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
could have teſtified many things to invalidate and take off the Teſtimony of ſome
of the Witneſſes, but I could not have that ordinary favour granted me. Twelfthly,
Yea, they have done that to me which was never done to any, <hi>viz.</hi> They have
kept me cloſe priſoner from the 10th. of Auguſt, till the very day of my execution,
that none but my Wife had leave to come to me, others who got to me came but
