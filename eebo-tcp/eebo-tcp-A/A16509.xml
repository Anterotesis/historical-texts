            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as it may chance at ſometime any perſon may be driuen vnto an extremitie, and the thing ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnpoſsible to bee auoyded, yet by ſome ſmall and ſlender Deuiſe the danger thereof may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, whereas otherwiſe the perill thereof muſt needes haue happened: and yet that thing that hath preuented the cauſe, hath been thought to bee of no importance when that it hath beene knowne, and before it hath been known it hath ſeemed moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible: wherefore I haue thought it good for to drawe them together into this rude and barbarous volume, more for that to haue them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, if that there dooth happen any cauſe to vſe them, than the fineſſe of the writing or penning of them, for the writer thereof is moſt vnlearned and ſimple, deſiring you gentle Reader, to beare with my rudeneſſe, conſidering that it is the good will that I

doo beare vnto my natiue Countrey, for to profit the common wealth as much as lieth in me, which is the occaſion that hath made mee to write theſe rude and ſimple <hi>Inuentions</hi> or <hi>Deuiſes:</hi> Although there is no doubte, but that there be a great number of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Politique and wiſer or finer heades: that I being ſo rude and ſimple a perſon, to preſume to be a medler in thoſe cauſes, for that the firſt inuentions or Deuiſes is are concerning matters by Sea and ſhips, both in martial affayres and otherwiſe therevnto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining: And alſo there be Inuentions or Deuiſes of Ordinance, aſwell for ſeruice as otherwiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto appertaining: and alſo there be Inuentions or Deuiſes, as touching the walles of cities, townes or caſtels appertaining vnto Martiall affayres: &amp; in like manner there be Inuentions or Deuiſes, as touching matters in the field, as wel meet for Generalles as for Captaines or leaders of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with other neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes or Inuentions, as in the table following it doth appeare, the which Inuentions or Deuiſes are verie neceſſary to bee had in memory, although that it is poſsible that thoſe men that hath bin trayned of long time in Martial affaires, perhaps may or doo know a great number of better Deuiſes than theſe, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I haue written theſe, and although for their ſimpleneſſe they wil do them no good, yet I am aſſured that they wil or can do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no hurt, although that they bee but of a ſimple mans inuenting, for all Artes, Sciences, or faculties, had a beginning before they came vnto their perfection: and yet it is poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there hath bin diuers inuentions that haue come
<pb facs="tcp:6540:4"/>
vnto no perfection or purpoſe, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are rather to bee better commended than thoſe perſons that haue great reuenewes or liuings of their owne, yea and ſome haue great liuings of the Queenes highneſſe, &amp; yet they do practiſe no other thing, but how to liue eaſily, to ſatisfie their luſt and pleaſure, and ſome of them, if they doo practiſe any thing, that ſhal be but miſchief in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, &amp;c. For by practiſing, they may attaine vnto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in any affayres, though it be poſsible that ſome will ſay that in Martiall affaires that practiſe is to no purpoſe, if that hee haue not ſeene the ſeruice in the field. And alſo it may be ſaide againe, that there is a number that haue ſeene ſeruice in the fielde, and yet haue no iudgement at al in thoſe affaires, for that we may ſee by common experience, that ſome perſons haue been trained vp all the dayes of their life, to goe vnto the ſea 20. 30. and 40. yeares, and yet haue no knowledge to be the Maſter of a ſhip to take charge, for that they wil practiſe nothing: &amp; other ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by practiſe be able to take charge in the ſpace of 3. or 4. yeres, and be as ſufficient men as thoſe, to take charg, that haue bin maſters the ſpace of 20. yeres, &amp;c Wherfore we may ſee the practiſe doth much auaile, for by practiſe he that hath ſeen but a litle experience of ſeruice, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that ſeruice that he hath ſeen, may practiſe further: for it is not poſsible if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ſeen ſeruice a hundreth yeres, yet at a time in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the field there may happen ſuch a matter, that in al that time the like hath not bin ſeene nor happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: therefore in the reading of ſuch authors as haue
<pb facs="tcp:6540:5"/>
written in any affayres, although that hee hath had no great experience in the matter, yet practiſe ſhall much auaile him: ſo that you may conclude, that he that hath ſeene much and hath neuer practiſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, can haue no iudgement in any matter, then you muſt needes confeſſe, that hee that hath ſeene little and dooth practiſe, may haue ſome iudgement, &amp;c. But then it muſt needes bee ſaide, that hee that hath ſeene experience and dooth practiſe, muſt needes become cunning, according vnto the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his wit, and the valiantneſſe of his courage: And furthermore, if one ſhould aske this queſtion, and as it is many times ſaide, if that ſuch a noble man came in the field, that it is no fighting againſt him, but if that hee dooth come into the fielde hee ſhall haue the victorie, and the queſtion is true that it will come ſo to paſſe, then what ſhould be the cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Now it is poſsible ſome will alledge one cauſe, and ſome another cauſe, as I haue heard a number of mens opinions, and yet few or none of them the trueth: for admit that there may bee two men elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or choſen, ſo indifferently in all reſpectes as may bee poſsible, both in wiſdome, ſtature, age, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode or courage, and in all other matter alike, and that they doo not differ in no reſpect, and thoſe two men haue been trained vp in ſeruice in the fielde of long time, and haue ſeene great experiences in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the fielde, as in ſieges, and in being beſieged, and in the dooing of other great exploytes, and they haue beene both of them alwaies in thoſe ſeruices, that if the one hath been there, the other hath beene
<pb facs="tcp:6540:5"/>
heere in like manner: but the one in the beginning being a Noble mans ſonne, did alwaies ſerue neare the Generall, or as one in counſell with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and hath at more yeares of age ſerued as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, &amp; the other hath alwayes ſerued but as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier, or an inferour officer or Captaine: &amp; admitte the one of them ſhould come into the field, the one againſt the other of them, and their ſtrength or number of men to be in manner equall: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that he that hath the ſmaller power is the Noble man, there is, no doubt, except great fortune be, but that he that is the Noble man that hath ſerued as a Generall, ſhall preuaile and haue the victory, and the cauſe is this, hee that dooth ſerue as a General, or hath beene in counſell with the Generall of long time, he doth know how for to prouide and ſet forth an armie: and contrarywiſe he that hath ſerued but as an inferiour Captaine, hath no other care, but to traine his men: the Generall and his counſell, doth foreſee where for to lodge and prouide for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and all other neceſſary matters, and haue their ſpyalls abroad, and doe know what manner of men be meeteſt for al maner of purpoſes, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doe know what manner of ground is beſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the enemies, and alſo knowing howe the enemies are prepared, &amp; ſo accordingly doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and prepare his battell, to prepare for euery miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that may happen, for that hee hath ſeene and heard ſo oftentimes the experience of thoſe matters, wheras thoſe that haue ſerued as inferiour Captains or Souldiers, haue neuer had any occaſion to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:6540:6"/>
of thoſe matters, but onely to traine their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers &amp; to make them handſom, how to keepe their order, and to handle their weapon: but for any other order of inbattelling of themſelues, if that they came for to fight in the field, it was alwaies at the diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Generall and his Counſell. And furthermore, admit that in the fighting of a field that they are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, or haue giuen the ouerthrow, the Generall of the army &amp; his Counſel haue perfect intelligence by what meanes that hath happened, &amp; what thing ſtoode with them, &amp; what thing ſtood againſt them, that is to ſay, if that they that were ouerthrowne had foreſeene ſuch a cauſe, then they had not been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, &amp; alſo they that did giue the ouerthrow, if that theſe had not done ſuch a thing they had not preuailed: ſo that the General &amp; his Counſell dooth perfectly vnderſtand of the matter, what was with them, and what was againſt them, for that they doo heare what hath happened in euery place in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, if that it bee worthie of knowing, whereas hee that dooth ſerue but as an inferiour Captaine, dooth heare nor ſee no other matter, but thoſe matters that haue happened in his own band, or neare vnto him: and the Generall and his Counſell haue authority to ſend for, and to examine euery perſon, that can ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in any matter whatſoeuer that it bee, &amp;c. And furthermore, there is a greater matter than this, whereby that thoſe that are the Generals or in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell neare about the Generall, if that they bee giuen vnto practiſe and haue good wittes, whereby that they may haue a great deale further inſtructions and
<pb facs="tcp:6540:6"/>
knowledge in thoſe affaires, than any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Captaine or Souldier: which is this: for what is hee that is a Souldier or any other perſon, but if that he dooth knowe any further matter or skill and ſecret than any perſon dooth knowe, but that hee will make meanes to ſhewe it vnto the Generall, whereby that hee may haue the better rewarde or entertainement; ſo that you may conclude, that if fortie or fiftie thouſand men were in the fielde, that if that there bee any perſon that haue any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or cunning, but that it will bee vttered and ſhewed vnto the Generall, then if the Generall bee valiant, liberall and wiſe, as it is a place for a wiſe man, there is no doubtes but that if hee bee giuen to practiſe thoſe matters, hee muſt needes of force become moſt excellent, for that an infinite number of other mens practiſes are put into their heades, ſo that of force they muſt needes exceede all other men in Martiall affaires, whereas he that is but an inferiour Captaine, although that hee bee giuen vnto practiſe, can neuer attaine to that which the other hath, for that hee hath not the like inſtructions in thoſe affaires, not to bee a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall except great fortune bee. And thus (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I doo ceaſe to trouble you any longer, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you to beare with my rudeneſſe, that I ſhould take vpon mee to publiſh any new Inuentions, and eſpecially in theſe affayres, conſidering what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of wiſe and valiant Gentlemen and Souldiers, and other learned perſons there hee in Englande.

As for example this. The wheele that goeth on the outſide of the little Boate, when that it is turned round once, the Ship hath gone iuſt ſixe foote, that is, one Fadome, and now the note that goeth on the Axeltree, dooth turne a wheele by the teeth, in ſuch ſort, that when the outward wheele hath gone 100. times about, that it is turned once, and then you may conclude, that when the firſt wheele on the inſide of the Boate hath gone once about, that the Ship hath gone 600<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foote, or 100. Fadomes: and now this firſt wheele dooth turne another wheele in the like order, that is, for 100. turning, to turne the other but once, &amp; then you may conclude, that the Ship hath gone 100. times 100.

And then in the time of ſeruice either by ſea or by land, it is very good to throw in amongſt your enemies, where they doo ſtand thicke, as they bee very good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a breach, or ſuch other like cauſes, as this, to take it in his hand and to fire it, and then to throw it amongſt your enemies, and as ſoone as the fire-worke is burned vnto the powder, the ball will breake in a thouſand peeces, &amp; euery peece in a manner will doo as much hurt as a Harquebuze ſhot, ſo that there is no kind of fire-worke comparable to this kind of Ball, for ſeruice in the time of neede.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6540:40"/>
foote broad in the bottome, and ſo many foote deepe, that if you would haue a wall or rampire made of that ſtuffe, if you would haue it ſo many foote broade in the bottome, and ſo many foote broade on the top, then to know iuſtly how many foote high the wall will be of that ſtuffe, which is hewed out of the ditch, when the earth is ſettled: or els for to know if that you would haue the wall made ſo high, then to knowe what thickneſſe that would beare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of that ſtuffe which is hewed out of the ditch: and for to knowe that, doo this. Firſt, according vnto the wideneſſe of the ditch in the brimme and in the bottome, put both the numbers together, and that done, then take halfe that number, and then according vnto the deepneſſe that you meane to make the ditch, multiply the two num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers together, that is to ſay, the number offeet of the depth of the ditch, and the breadth thereof at the brim, and the bottome being added both together, and then looke what number it commeth vnto, then if you would knowe how high it would make the wall at ſuch a thickneſſe at the bottome, and the top, then adde theſe two numbers both together, and then take halfe that, and deuide that out of the number of the ditch ſo multiplied, and that number that ſtandeth in the quantitie line, ſhall bee the heigth of the wall. And furthermore, if you would haue the wall ſo many foote high, and would know how many foote thick it would bee of that ſtuffe, then deuide the heigth out of the number of the ditch ſo multiplied, and that which ſtandeth in the quantitie line, ſhall be the thickneſſe of the wall in the middle, and then you knowing that, you may vſe the thickneſſe of the bottome and the top at your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. And for the better vnderſtanding of the matter, you ſhall haue this example by a ditch that I would haue made of 20. foote broade in the bottome, and 10. foote deepe, and I would haue a wall made of that ſtuffe, to bee ſixteene foote at the bottome of the wall, and eight foote
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6540:40"/>
at the top of the wall; now my deſire is to knowe how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foote high it would be, of that ſtuffe that commeth out of the aforeſaid ditch when the wall is ſettled and dried; you ſhall knowe it thus: firſt adde the wideneſſe of the brim, and the bottome of the ditch both together, &amp; that is twentie foote for the brimme, and twelue foote for the bottome, and thoſe two numbers together, maketh 32. then take halfe that number, and that is ſixteene, and then the deepnes of the ditch being tenne foote, multiply them two numbers together, that is to ſay, ſixteene times tenne, and that maketh 160. and now I would haue the wall ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene foote broade at the bottome, and eight foote at the top, and thoſe two numbers added together, maketh 24. and halfe that is 12. foote: now my deſire is, to know how many foote the wall will bee high, which to knowe, doo this: deuide the 160. by 12. which is the thickneſſe of the wall in the middle, and that number that ſtandeth in the quantitie line, is the heigth of the wall, and that commeth vnto thirteene foote and foure inches iuſt, ſo that you may conclude, that a ditch being caſt, that is twentie foote at the brimme, and 12. foote in the bottome, and 10. foot deepe, will make a wall of ſixteene foote at the bottome, &amp; eight foote on the top, and 13. foot ½ in heigth. &amp;c. Furthermore, by the example of the ditch, I would haue the wall fifteen foote high, my deſire is to know how thick the wall would be of that ſtuffe, then deuide the aforeſaid number of 160. by 15. and then there will ſtand in the quantitie line 10. and 10. will remaine ouer, ſo that you may conclude, that the wall of 15. foote high, will be 10. foote thicke, &amp; eight inches, and then you may at your diſcretion, make it as broade in the bottome as you liſt, and looke what you do broade it in the bottome, it will lacke the ſame at the top. Therefore if you make it 15. foote at the bottome, it will be but ſixe foote, and eight inches at the top.</p>

And other ſome haue deuiſed to doo it, by trayning vp of a dog to goe betweene two places, and then he being beaten from the one place, will runne vnto the other place directly, and then when that they would haue any letters ſent ſpeedily, then they haue made prouiſion to hang them about the dogs necke, &amp;c. and a dogge will runne a great way in a little time, if hee had reaſon and did vnderſtand what he were willed for to doo, but the ſwifteſt way is to bee done by that meanes which the Romanes taught the Engliſh Britaines, when they cauſed them to make a wall to defend themſelues againſt the Picts, which was by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tronckes made of braſſe layd in the wall: and at the ende of euery two or three mile they had a gate, which was both watched and warded, and ſo by that meanes when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that they had any occaſion to giue any warning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that ſhould defend the ſayd Picts, then looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what place that the Picts did make any aſſault vnto them, they were certified through the ſayd trunckes of braſſe, where that they were, and what hurt they had done, and what number that there were of them, &amp;c. and by this meanes they would haue word what was done, and what

And the firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is the number of men, and the ſecond is the number of men in a rancke for the fronte, and the third numbers, is the numbers of ranckes for the ſide or flancke, and the fourth numbers, is the remaine that will neither come in to bee a whole rancke in the fronte, neither will they bee ſufficient to ſerue to make one more in a rancke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to bee imployed according vnto the will of the General or the Captaines of the leaders of thoſe men, &amp;c. and the fifth number is the number of the ſeate that thoſe men may ſtand vpon in their battell forme, to bee ſquare on the ground, that is to ſay, to be ſo many foote e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way, &amp;c.

any number of men, what ſpace ſoeuer that you woulde haue betweene man and man, both in length and breadth is according vnto the order of <hi>Nicholas Machiuel,</hi> which is in length for euery man 7. foote, and in breadth 3. foot, or elſe if that you would haue your armie of men to ſhew bigger and to be ſquare vpon the ground, then your ſpace betweene man and man muſt be wider, as to allowe nine foote in length for euery man, and foure foote in breadth, according vnto the minde or fancie of the Generall, &amp;c. Although the accuſtomable manner hath beene accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the opinions of diuers authors in Martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, to allow but 6. foote in length &amp; 3. foote in bredth, called of moſt authors the broad ſquare, according vnto the tables in the eightie Deuiſe.

As for an example thus; I hauing thirty thouſand men, and I would know howe many men that there will be in a rancke, and howe many ranckes of them to be ſquare vpon the ground, allowing for euery man 7 foote in length, and 3. foote in breadth, according vnto <hi>Nicholas Machiuels</hi> order, and to knowe that, doe this, firſt your number of men being 30000. and

allowing 7. foote in length for euery man, therefore mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie 30000. by 7. and that commeth vnto 210000. and then deuide that number againe, by that number in feete that you do allow in breadth for euery man, and that is by 3. wherefore deuide 21000. by 3. and then there wil ſtand in the quantitie line 70000. then extract the ſquare roote of 70000. and there will ſtand in the quantitie line 264. ſo that you may conclude that 264. men ſhall be in a ranck for the front of the battell. And now to know how many rancks of men that there ſhalbe for the ſide or flanck of the battell, then doo this: your number beeing 264. men in a rancke, and your number of men being 30000. wherefore deuide the 30000. by 264. and then there will ſtande in the quantitie line 113. and then remaineth ouer 168. ſo that you may conclude, that 30000. men to ſtand ſquare vppon the grounde, allowing ſeauen foote in length, and three foote in breadth, for euery man, will be 264. men in a rancke, and 113. ranckes, and 168. men will remaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which 168. men you may imploy at the diſcretion of the Generall: and alſo it will make one man more in a rancke, and then there ſhall bee 265. men in a rancke, and 113. ranckes, and 55. men will remaine ouer, &amp;c. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by this order, you may imbattell your ſelfe ſquare vpon the ground, what ſpace ſoeuer that you would be between man and man in length and breadth: wherfore I will giue a ſecond example, you hauing tenne thouſand men, and would haue nine foote in length for euery man, and foure foote in breadth, wherefore multiplie tenne thouſand by nine, and that maketh 90000. then deuide that 90000. by foure, and then there will ſtand in the quantitie line 22500. then extract the ſquare roote of 22500. and then there will ſtand in the quantitie line one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo that you may conclude, that 150. men ſhall bee in a rancke for the front of the battell, and then your number of men, beeing 10000. therefore deuide the number of
