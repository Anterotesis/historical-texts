            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dissigns of this nature ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the directions of so many noble Gentlemen, a number of valiant Captains and well experienced Nauigators, secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the courages of the other, do for the most part fill the itching eares of the world, with more then a common expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of strange things to bee done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the possibility of man. But if he that is so curious in his inquisition, had beene but a personall aduenturer in some of the dangers which wee ran through, I make no doubt but hee would confesse hee had
<pb facs="tcp:17909:3"/>
seene enough, and vndergone more then willingly hee could wish himselfe to bee acquainted with againe. How our ships were furnished for men or munition; what seuerall Captaines and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were in euery one of them are heere truly set downe: the burthen also of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ship, then the dayes and months are named in which any memorable act was performed, the townes likewise within in the Straights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> before which our men of Warre did any seruice.</p>
            <p>And to make this Discourse the more pleasing to thee, such Spanish ships and gallyes, besides Turkish Pirates, as we encountred with at Sea, shall appeare say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in all their gallantry before thee. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine (as thou readest) that thou hearest the Canon playing, and Turkes by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds tumbling into the Seas, our owne stretching out hands to saue a miserable number of poore Christians made slaues to the barbarous Turke &amp; crafty Moore, but deliuered from that seruitude by vs, God assisting our labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17909:3"/>Such men of quality as either dyed or miscarryed in this Voyage, haue here the names written downe.</p>
            <p>But least the citing of particulars in this place, should alter the property of an Epistle, which (like the first day of a Terme amongst Lawyers) should be spent onely in complement, and bidding thee welcome to this feast of newes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I will no longer detayne thine eye from longing for that, which my paines and obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haue diligently collected to giue thee content, which if here thou findest, it shall be to me some part of a recompence, for those stormy dayes and nights in which I haue beene in the voyage.

Next to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:17909:17"/>
on the North side came to an anchor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the Golden Phenix on the South, the Conuertine on the Southside, the Phenixe and Anthelope on the Northside the Reformation, the Vice-admirall innermost on the Southside, the Rere-admirall vttermost on the North side.</p>
               <p>The kings ships hauing berthed themselues, the rest of the fleete who this time plyed vp and downe vnder sayle, came to a Sterne to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals of their squadrons, giuing good berthes one to another, the winde being then Westerly: but if the winde had beene Easterly, then were they to haue beene anchored a head between the Kings ships and the Easterne shore, keeping the Kings ships and the Phenix betweene them and the towne, where the force of the Pyrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.</p>
               <p>The ships being come to an anchor in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, our Admirall caused sixe of the Marchants ships presently to weigh, with directions to ply off and on of the Westermost part, keeping as neere the shore as conueniently they might, to preuent the comming in of any Pyrates between the fleete and the shore. In the beginning of this night the Boats and Brigandines appointed for the assistance of two ships which our Admirall resolued should that night goe into the Mould, and there to set themselues on fire, being chained and linked to the Pyrates ships, repaired aboord our Admirall there to receiue their directions. The manner and preparations for firing of the
<pb facs="tcp:17909:17"/>
ships was thus.</p>
               <p>First, there were two small ships which we had taken from the Turkes, the one of the burden of an hundred tunnes, the other of sixtie, with great store of fire-workes in them. There was layde in them plenty of dry wood, wood of Ocham, Pitch Rozen, Tarre, Brimstone and other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials fit to take fire: they had likewise in them Chaines and Grapnels of iron to fasten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the ships which they were to fire: they had also boates to bring off their men when they had fired the ships: then were there three Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandines fitted with fire-bals, buckets of wilde-fire, and fire pikes to make their fire-workes fast vnto the ships: there was also a Gundlod fitted with fire-workes, Chaines and Grapnels of iron; shee was to goe into the middest of the ships in the Mould, where fastning her to some ship, was to be set on fire. She had likewise with her a boat to bring off her men. Likewise there were seuen boates which we called boates of rescue, well fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with armed men, who were to rescue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the boates of execution if they should chance to be pursued by other boates or gallyes at their comming off. These had also fire-workes in them to fire the ships which rode without the Mould: these boates being all aboord, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall sent for most of the Captains and Masters in the fleete to aduise whether it were fit to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it with boates and Brigandines, in regard it was little winde, and that Westerly, so that it
<pb facs="tcp:17909:18"/>
was impossible for the ships to get in. After some deliberation, it was concluded that it was not fit for that the surest and most certaine meanes of firing was by the ships which were to bee made fast to the ships in the Mould, and to burne with them. Whereupon it was deferred for that time till a fitter opportunity was offered.</p>
               <p>The 22. at night there were like preparations made, but deferred for like reasons.</p>
               <p>The 23. in the beginning of the night wee had a fresh gale of wind at South by South west con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the space of two houres or more, with thunder, lightning, and some drops of raine: the two ships weighed, and with the Brigandines and Boates set forwards towards the Mould, but the winde shifting before they came neere, they were forced also to giue ouer for that night.</p>
               <p>The 24. at night after a great showre of raine, we had the wind out of the Bay at Sourh, South West, the weather then cleering vp, both the ships and boates aduanced themselues toward Mould as before they had done: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming within lesse then Musket shot of the Moulds head it fell calme, so that the ships could by no meanes get in, the Boates and Brigandines finding that they were discouered by reason of the brightnesse of the Moone which was then at full, and hearing it repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Christian captiue which did swimme from the towne the night before to the ships, that the Turkes had left their shippes without
<pb facs="tcp:17909:18"/>
guard sauing one or two in a ship, as fearing no such attempt from vs. And moreouer hearing the Alarum giuen to the towne by those which ktpt watch on the walles, with good resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went on, but wanting winde to nourish and disperse the fire, the fire-workes tooke no effect at all. In this seruice were onely sixe men slaine out right, foure or fiue dangerously hurt (which not long after dyed) and some thirteene sleightly hurt, yet notwithstanding the attempt was giuen vnder the walles of the towne, where both small shot and Ordnance played continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon them: the hurt done our men was their comming off, for that they were got into the Mould before the towne was risen, and being in, the ships in the Mould defended them both from small shot and ordnance of the towne, our boats still keeping the ships betweene them and the towne.</p>
               <p>The 25. there came in foure saile of Pyrates by the Wester most point of land notwithstanding 6. ships were appointed to lye off at that place, for the wind being Westward and a great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant setting to the Eastward, our ships were put so farre to leeward that they could not preuent the pyrates coming in betweene the shore and them, but yet the Bonauenture loosed so neere that there passed some shot betweene her and the Pyrates ships, but no hurt done: this night our Admirall and the whole fleete weighed Anchor and stood off to the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17909:19"/>The 26. the fore part of the day the wind was shifting to and fro, from the South-east to the South-west; in the afternoone at South, and South South-east hard gale and rainy weather; and at night hauing the winde shifting at South and South-west, we played off and on all night by a winde.</p>
               <p>The 27. we had a fresh gale at West, and west North-west, and this euening we saw two ships to wind-ward of vs, but what they were I know not.</p>
               <p>The 28. We had faire weather the wind We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly, this night the Bonauenture and the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules put a Pyrate a shore, hee hauing a hundred and thirty Turks in her, and twelue poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians captiues, they were al drowned but twelue Turkes who got the shore by swimming.</p>
               <p>The 30. we got into the Bay and Anchored three miles off the towne, and in turning in, the towne and castle made 15. great shot at the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, the Rainbow, and two other, Marchants ships, but did no hurt.</p>
               <p>The 31. in the morning our boates tooke vp two <hi>Genoways</hi> captiues, who aduentured to swim from the towne to the ships. They tould that the same night our ships stood off to Sea, there came into the Mould seuen of the best ships belonging to <hi>Algiere,</hi> and that if we had stayed they had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into our laps.
