         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE having been various<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Discourses about the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Iustice of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Invasion, the Prince's great

<hi>English Protestants,</hi> set forth in the most Charming manner,
and the Desperateness of the <hi>Protestant</hi> State and Condition painted in the

These Reports are with so much Art and Cunning spread, as to startle

For the Expectations of most Men are, That some Extraordinary

to Light; as generally those, who yet never saw the Prince's Declaration,
do still believe; But there not being one word of any such <hi>Treaty,</hi> we
cannot see why it is that the Prince comes Over; and if others impartially
Peruse the Declaration, we doubt not but 'twill Convince them, that they
give no Reason powerful enough to Iustifie so Bloody an Enterprise, as this,

            <head>THE
DECLARATION
OF HIS HIGHNES
William Henry,
By the Grace of GOD,
PRINCE of ORANGE, &amp;c.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the REASONS inducing Him,
To appear in Armes in the Kingdome of
England, for Preserving of the Protestant
Religion, and for Restoring the Lawes
and Liberties of England, Scotland and
Ireland.</head>
            <p>IT is both certain, and Evident to all men, that the Publike Peace and
Happines of any State or Kingdome, can not be preserved, where the
Lawes, Liberties, and Customs established, by the Lawfull authority in
it, are openly Transgressed and Annulled: More especially where the
alteration of <hi>Religion</hi> is endeavoured, and that a <hi>Religion</hi> which is contrary to
Law is endeavoured to be introduced: Upon which those who are most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64751:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Concerned in it, are Indispensably bound, to endeavour to Preserve
and maintain the established Lawes, Liberties and Customes: and above all
the <hi>Religion</hi> and Worship of God, that is Established among them: And to
take such an effectual care, that the Inhabitants of the said State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
may neither be deprived of their <hi>Religion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> nor of their Civill Rights.
Which is so much the more Necessary because the Greatnes and Security both
of Kings, Royall families, and of all such as are in Authority, as well as the
Happines of their Subjects and People, depend, in a most especiall manner,
upon the exact observation, and maintenance of these their Lawes, Liberties,
and Customes.</p>
            <p>Upon these grounds it is, that we cannot any longer forbear, to Declare
that to our great regret, we see that those Councellours, who have now the
chieffe credit with the King, have overturned the <hi>Religion,</hi> Lawes, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of those Realmes: and subjected them in all things relating to their
Consciences, Liberties, and Properties, to Arbitrary Government: and that
not only by secret and Indirect waies, but in an open and undisguised man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Those Evil Councellours for the advancing and colouring this, with some
plausible pretexts, did Invent and set on foot, the Kings <hi>Dispencing power,</hi> by
vertue of which, they pretend that according to <hi>Law,</hi> he can <hi>Suspend</hi> and
<hi>Dispence</hi> with the Execution of the <hi>Lawes,</hi> that have been enacted by the
Authority, of the King and Parliament, for the security and happines of the
Subject, and so have rendered those Laws of no effect: Tho there is nothing
more certain, then that as no Lawes can be made; but by the joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of King and Parliament, so likewise lawes so enacted, which secure
the Publike peace, and safety of the Nation, and the lives and liberties of
every subject in it, can not be repealed or suspended but by the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>For tho the King may pardon the punishment, that a Transgressour has
incurred, and to which he is condemned, as in the cases of <hi>Treason<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony;</hi>
yet it can not be with any colour of reason, Inferred from thence,
that the King can entirely suspend the execution of those Lawes, relating to
<hi>Treason</hi> or <hi>Felony:</hi> Unless it is pretended, that he is clothed with a Despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Arbitrary power, and that the Lives, Liberties, Honours and Estates
of the Subjects, depend wholly on his good will and Pleasure, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
subject to him; which must infallibly follow, on the Kings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a power to <hi>suspend</hi> the execution of the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and to dispence with
them.</p>
            <p>Those Evill Councellours, in order to the giving some credit to this
strange and execrable Maxime, have so conducted the matter, that they have
obtained a Sentence from the Judges, declaring that this <hi>Dispencing power,</hi> is
a Right belonging to the <hi>Crown;</hi> as if it were in the power of the twelve
Judges, to offer up the Lawes, Rights, and Liberties, of the whole Nation,
to the King, to be disposed of by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleasure, and
expressly contrary to Lawes enacted, for the security of the Subjects. In
order to the obtaining this Judgment, those Evill Councellours did before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64751:4"/>
hand, examine secretly, the Opinion of the Judges, and procured such of
them, as could not in Conscience concurre in so pernicious a Sentence, to
be turned out, and others to be substituted in their Rooms till by the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which were made, in the Courts of Judicature, they at last obtained
that Judgment. And they have raised some to those Trusts, who make open
Profession of the Popish Religion, though those are by Law Rendred Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of all such Employments.</p>
            <p>It is also Manifest and Notorious, that as his Majestie was, upon his
coming to the Crown, received and acknowledged by all the subjects of
<hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as their <hi>King</hi> without the least opposition,
tho he made then open profession, of the <hi>Popish Religion;</hi> so he did then
Promise, and Solemnly Swear, at his Coronation, that he would maintain his
subjects, in the free enjoyment of their Lawes, and Liberties, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that he would maintain the <hi>Church of England as it was established by
Law:</hi> It is likewise certain, that there have been at diverse and sundry
times, several Lawes enacted for the preservation of those Rights, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and of the Protestant Religion: and among other Securities, it has
been enacted that all Persons whatsoever, that are advanced to any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>astical
Dignity, or to bear Office in either University, as likewise all other,
that should be put in any Imployment, Civill or Military, should declare
that they were not Papists, but were of the Protestant Religion, and that, by
their taking of the Oaths of <hi>Allegance,</hi> and <hi>Suprermacy</hi> and the <hi>Test,</hi> yet these
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>vill Councellours have in effect annulled and abolished all those Lawes,
both with relation to Ecclesiasticall and Civill Employments.</p>
            <p>In order to Ecclesiasticall Dignities and Offices. they have not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any colour of Law, but against most expresse Lawes to the contrary,
set up a Commission, of a certain Number of persons, to whom they have
committed the cognisance and direction of all Ecclesiasticall matters: in the
which Commission there has been and still is, one of His Majesties Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State, who makes now publike profession of the Popish Religion, and
who at the time of his first professing it, declared that for a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he had believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
State to which the Protestant Religion is reduced is Apparent, since
the Affairs of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are now put into the hands of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who have accepted of a Commission that is manifestly Illegal; and
who have executed it contrary to all Law; and that now one of their
chieffe Members has abjured the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> and declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a <hi>Papist;</hi> by which he is become Incapable of holding any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Imployment: The said Commissioners have hitherto given such
proof, of their submission to the directions given them, that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt, but they will still continue to promote all such designs as will
be most aggreable to them. And those Evill Councellours take care, to raise
none to any Ecclesiasticall dignities; but persons that have no zeal for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion,</hi> and that now hide their unconcernedness for it, under the
specious pretence of <hi>Moderation.</hi> The said Commissioners have suspended
the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> only because he refused to obey an order, that was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64751:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sent him to suspend a Worthy Divine, without so much as citing him before
him, to make his own Defence, or observing the common formes of Processe.
They have turned out a President, chosen by the fellows of <hi>Magdalen Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and afterwards all the Fellows of that Colledge, without so much as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
them before any Court that could take legall cognissance of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
or obtaining any Sentence against them by a Competent Judge. And
the only reason, that was given, for turning them out, was their refusing
to choose for their President; a Person that was recommended to them, by
the Instigation of those Evill Councellours. Tho the right of a free Election
belonged undoubtedly to them. But they were turned out of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
contrary to Law, and to that expresse provision in the <hi>Magna Charta;
that no man shall l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>se life or Goods, but by the Law of the land.</hi> And now
these Evill Councellours have put the said Colledge wholly into the hands
of Popists, tho as is abovesaid, they are Incapable, of all such Employments,
both by the Law of the Land, and the statutes of the Colledge. These
Commissioners have also cited before them all the Chancellours and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons
of England, requiring them to certifie to them the names, of all such
Clergymen, as have read the Kings declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> and
of such as have not read it: without considering that the reading of it, was
not enjoined the Clergy, by the Bishops, who are their Ordinaries. The Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality
and Incompetency of the said Court of the Ecclesiasticall Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
was so notoriously known, and it did so Evidently appear, that it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Subversion of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> that the Most Revernd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in God, <hi>William</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan
of all <hi>England,</hi> seeing that it was raised for no other end, but to oppresse
such persons as were of Eminent Vertue, Learning, and Piety, refused to sit
or to concurre in it.</p>
            <p>And tho there are many expresse Lawes against all Churches or Chapells,
for the exercise of the Popish Religion, and also against all Monasteries and
Convents, and more particularly against the order of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> yet those
Evill Councellours have Procured orders for the building of severall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Chappels, for the Exercise of that Religion: They have also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
diverse Monasteries to be Erected, and in contempt of the Law they
have not only set up severall Colledges of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> in diverse places, for the
corrupting of the youth, but have raised up one of the <hi>Order,</hi> to be a Privy
Councellour and a Minister of State. By all which they do evidently shew,
that they are restrained by no rules of Law whatsoever; but that they have
subjected the Honours and Estates of the subjects, and the Establisht Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to a Despotick power and to Arbitrary Government: In all which
they are served and seconded by those Ecclesiasticall Commissioners.</p>
            <p>They have also followed the same methods with Relation to Civill affairs:
For they have procured Orders, to examine all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy
Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all others that were in any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Imployment, if they would concurre with The King in the Repeal of
the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> and all such, whose Consciences did not suffer
them, to comply with their designes, were turned out; and others were put
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64751:5"/>
in their places, who they believed would be more Compliant to them; in
their Designes of defeating the Intent and Execution of those Laws; which
had been made with so much care and caution, for the Security of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion.</hi> And in many of these places they have put professed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
though the Law has disabled them, and warranted the subjects not to
have any regard to their Orders.</p>
            <p>They have also invaded the Priviledges, and seised on the Charters of
most of those Towns that have a right to be represented by their Burgesses
in Parliament: and have procured surrenders to be made of them, by which
the Magistrates in them have delivered up all their Rights, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
to be disposed of, at the pleasure of those Evill Councellours: who
have thereupon, placed new Magistrates in those Towns, such as they can
most entirely confide in: and in many of them, they have put Popish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
notwithstanding the Incapacities under which the Law has put
them.</p>
            <p>And whereas no Nation whatsoever can subsist without the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of good and impartiall Justice, upon which mens Lives, Liberties, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and Estates, doe depend; those Evill Councellours have subjected
these to an Arbitrary and Despotick power: In the most important affairs,
they have studied to discover before hand, the Opinions of the Judges; and
have turned out such, as they found would not conform themselves to their
intentions: and have put others in their places, of whom they were more
assured, without having any regard to their abilities. And they have not
stuck to raise even professed Papists, to the Courts of Judicature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their Incapacity by Law, and that no Regard is due to any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
flowing from them. They have carried this so far, as to deprive such
Judges, who in the common administration of Justice, shewed that they were
governed by their Consciences, and not by the directions, which the others
gave them. By which it is apparent that they designe to render themselves
the absolute Masters of the Lives, Honours and Estates of the subjects, of
what rank or dignity soever they may be: and that without having any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
either to the equity of the cause, or to the Consciences of the Judges,
whom they will have to submit in all things, to their own will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
hoping by such waies, to Intimidate those who are yet in Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as also such others, as they shall think fit, to put in the Rooms of
those whom they have turned out; and to make them see, what they must
look for, if they should at any time act in the least contrary to their good
liking: and that no failings of that kind, are pardoned, in any persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
A great deal of blood has been shed in many places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by Judges governed by those Evill Councellours, against all the rules
and forms of Law; without so much as suffering the persons that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
to Plead in their own Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64751:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They have also, by putting the administration of Justice, in the hands of
Papists, brought all the matters of Civil Justice into great uncertainties: with
how much exactness and Justice soever that these Sentences may have been
given. For since the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papists from all
places of Judicature, but have put them under an Incapacity, none are
bound to acknowledge or to obey their Judgements, and all Sentences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by them, are null and void of themselves: so that all persons who have
been cast, in Trials before such Popish Judges, may justly look on their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Sentences, as having no more force, then the Sentences of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and unauthorised person whatsoever. So deplorable is the case of the
Subjects, who are obliged to answer to such Judges, that must in all things
sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap> to the Rules,, which are set them by those Evil Councellours, who as
they raised them up to those Imployments, so can turn them out of them at
pleasure; and who can never be esteemed Lawful Judges; so that all their
Sentences are in the Construction of the Law, of no Force and Efficacy. They
have likewise disposed of all Military Imployments, in the same manner: For
tho the Laws have not only Excluded Papists, from all such Imployments,
but have in particular, Provided that they should be Disarmed; yet they in
Contempt of these Laws, have not only armed the Papists, but have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
raised them up to the greatest Military Trusts, both by Sea and Land,
and that Strangers as well as Natives, and Irish as well as English, that so
by those means, having rendred themselves Masters both of the affairs of the
Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the course of Justice, and
subjected them all to a Despotick and Arbitrary power, they might be in a
Capacity to maintain and Execute their wicked designs, by the assistance of
the Army, and thereby to enslave the Nation.</p>
            <p>The dismal effects of this subversion of the established Religion, Laws and
Liberties in England appear more evidently to us, by what we see done in
Ireland: where the whole Government is put in the hands of Papists, and
where all the Protestant Inhabitants are under the daily fears of what may be
justly apprehended, from the Arbitrary Power which is set up there: which
has made great numbers of them, leave that Kingdom, and abandon their
Estates in it, remembring well that Cruel and Bloody Massacre, which fell
out in that Island in the year 1641.</p>
            <p>Those Evil Councellours have also prevailed with the King to declare in
Scotland that he is clothed with <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> and that all the Subjects are
bound <hi>to obey him without Reserve:</hi> upon which he has assumed an Arbitrary
Power both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom, from all which
it is apparent, what is to be looked for in England, as soon as matters are
du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ly prepared for it.</p>
            <p>Those great and insufferable Oppressions, and the open Contempt of all
Law, together with the apprehensions of the sad Consequences that must
certainly follow upon it, have put the subjects under great and just fears; and
have made them look after such lawful Remedies as are allowed of in all
Nations: yet all has been without effect. And those Evil Councellors have
endeavoured to make all Men apprehend, the losse of their Lives, Libertys,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64751:6"/>
Honours, and Estates, if they should go about to preserve themselves from
this Oppression, by Petitions, Representations, or other means authorised by
Law. Thus did they proceed with the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the
other Bishops, who having offered a most humble petition to the King, in termes
full of Respect, and not exceding the number limited by Law, in which they
set forth in short, the Reasons, for which they could not obey that order,
which by the Instigation of those Evil Councellors, was sent them, requiring
them to appoint their Clergy to read in their Churches the Declaration for
<hi>Liberty of Conscience;</hi> were sent to prison and afterwards brought to a Triall,
as if they had been guilty of some enormous Crime. They were not only
obliged, to defend themselves in that pursute, but to appear before Professed
Papists, who had not taken the Test and by Consequence were men whose
Interest led them to condemn them: and the Judges that gave their opinion in
their favours were thereupon turned out.</p>
            <p>And yet it can not be pretended, that any Kings; how great soever their
power has been, and how Arbitrary and Despotick soever, they have been in
the exercise of it, have ever reckoned it a crime for their Subjects to come,
in all Submission and Respect, and in a due number, not exceeding the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the Law, and represent to them the Reasons that made it impossible
for them to obey their orders. Those Evil Councellours have also treated a
Peer of the Realm as a Criminall, only because he said that the subjects were
not bound to obey the orders of a Popish Justice of Peace: tho it is Evident,
that they being by Law rendred incapable of all such trusts, no regard is
due to their orders. This being the security which the people have by the
Law for their Lives, Liberties, Honours and Estates, that they are not to be
subjected to the Arbitrary procedings of Papists, that are contrary to Law,
put into any employments Civil or Military.</p>
            <p>Both Wee our selves, and our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort,
the Princesse, have endeavoured to signify in terms full of respect, to the
King, the just and deep Regret which all these Proceedings have given us;
and in Compliance with his Majesties desires signified to us, Wee Declared
both by word of Mouth, to his Envoy, and in writing; what our Thoughts
were touching the Repealing of the <hi>Test and Penal Lawes;</hi> which we did in
such a manner, that we hoped we had proposed an Expedient, by which the
Peace of those Kingdoms, and a happy agreement among the Subjects of all
Persuasions, might have been setled: but those Evil Councellours, have put
such ill Constructions on these our good Intentions, that they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to alienate the King more and more from us: as if Wee had designed,
to disturb the quiet and Happiness of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The last and great Remedy for all those Evils, is <hi>the Calling of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
for securing the Nation, against the evil practises of those wicked
Councellours: but this could not be yet compassed, nor can it be easily brought
about. For those Men apprehending, that a lawful Parliament, being once
assembled, they would be brought to an account, for all their open violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Law, and for their Plots and Conspiracies against the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, they have endeavoured
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64751:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under the specious Pretence of <hi>Liberty of Conscience;</hi> first to Sow divisions
among Protestants, between those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
The design being laid to engage Protestants, that are all equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
to preserve themselves from Popish Oppression; into mutual quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings;
that so by these, some advantages might be given to them to bring
about their Designs; and that both in the Election of the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and afterwards in the Parliament it selfe. For they see well that if
all Protestants, could enter into a mutual good Understanding, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Concurre together, in the preserving of their Religion, it would
not be possible for them to compasse their wicked ends. They have also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
all Persons in the several Counties of <hi>England,</hi> that either were in any
Imployment, or were in any Considerable Esteem, to declare before hand,
that they would concur in the Repeal of the <hi>Test and Penal Laws;</hi> and that they
would give their voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for such as would
concurre in it: Such as would not thus Preingage themselves were turned out
of all Imployments: And others who entred into those engagements, were
put in their places, many of them being Papists: and contrary to the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Priviledges of those Burroughs, that have a Right to send Burgesses
to Parliament, they have ordered such Regulations to be made, as they
thought fit and necessary, for assuring themselves of all the Members, that are
to be chosen by those Corporations: and by this means they hope to avoid that
Punishment which they have Deserved: tho it is apparent, that all Acts made
by Popish Magistrates are null, and Void of themselves; So that no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be Lawful, for which the Elections and Returns are made by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Sheriffs and Majors of Touns; and Therefore as long as the Authority
and Magistracy is in such hands, it is not possible to have any Lawful Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
And tho according to the Constitution of the English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Immemorial Custome, all Elections of Parliament men ought to
be made with an Entire Liberty, without any sort of force, or the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Electors to choose such Persons as shall be named to them, and the
Persons thus freely Elected, ought to give their Opinions freely, upon all
Matters that are brought before them, having the good of the Nation ever
before their Eyes, and following in all things the dictates of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
yet now the People of England can not expect a Remedy from a free
Parliament, Legally Called and Chosen. But they may perhaps see one Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or Force, and which
will be composed of such Persons, of whom those Evil Councellours hold
themselves well assured, in which all things will be carried on according to
their Direction and Interest, without any regard to the Good or Happiness
the Nation. Which may appear Evidently from this, that the same Persons
tried the Members of the last Parliament, to gain them to Consent to the
Repeal of the <hi>Test and Penal Lawes,</hi> and procured that Parliament to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
when they found that they could not, neither by Promises nor Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
prevail with the Members to Comply with their wicked Designs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64751:7"/>
But to Crown all, there are Great and Violent Presumptions, inducing us
to Beleeve, that those Evil Councellours, in order to the carrying on of their
ill Designs, and to the Gaining to themselves the more time for the Effecting
of them, for the encouraging of their Complices, and for the discouraging
of all Good Subjects, have published that the <hi>Queen</hi> hath brought forth a
<hi>Son:</hi> tho there have appeared both during the <hi>Queens</hi> pretended Bigness, and
in the manner in which the Birth was managed, so many just and Visible
grounds of suspicion, that not only we our selves, but all the good Subjects
of those Kingdoms, do Vehemently suspect, that the pretended Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> was not born by the <hi>Queen.</hi> And it is notoriously known to all the
world, that many both doubted of the Queens Bigness, and of the Birth of
the Child, and yet there was not any one thing done to Satisfy them, or to
put an end to their Doubts.</p>
            <p>And since our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort, the Princesse,
and likewise we Our Selves, have so great an Interest in this Matter, and
such a Right, as all the world knows, to the Succession to the Crown, Since
also the English did in the year 1672. when the States General of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces</hi> were invaded, in a most unjust warre, use their utmost Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to put an end to that Warre, and that in opposition to those who were
then in the Government: and by their so doing, they run the hazard, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
both the favour of the Court, and their Imployments; And since the
English Nation has ever testified a most particular Affection and Esteem, both
to our Dearest Consort the Princesse, and to Our selves, Wee cannot excuse
our selves from espousing their Interests, in a matter of such high Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and from Contributing all that lies in us, for the Maintaining both
of the Protestant Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of those Kingdomes,
and for the Securing to them, the Continual Enjoyment of all their just
Rights. To the doing of which, wee are most Earnestly Solicited by a Great
many Lords, both Spirituall and Temporall, and by many Gentlemen and
other subjects of all Ranks.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE it is, that wee have thought fit, to goe over to England,
and to Carry over with us a force, sufficient by the blessing of God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us from the Violence of those Evill Councellours. AND, WEE being
desirous that our Intentions in this, may be Rightly Understood, have for
this end prepared this <hi>Declaration,</hi> in which as wee have hitherto given a True
Account of the Reasons Inducing us to it, So wee now think fit to DECLARE
that this our Expedition, is intended for no other Designe, but to have a free
and lawfull Parliament assembled, as soon as is possible: and that in order
to this, all the late Charters by which the Elections of Burgesses are limited
contrary to the Ancient custome, shall be considered as null and of no force:
and likewise all Magistrates who have been Injustly turned out, shall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
resume their former Imployments, as well as all the Borroughs of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
shall return again to their Antient Prescriptions and Charters: And
more particularly that the Antient Charter of the Great and Famous City of
London, shall again be in Force: and that the Writts for the Members of
Parliament shall be addressed to the Proper Officers, according to Law and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64751:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Custome. That also none be suffered to choose or to be chosen Members of
Parliament but such as are qualified by Law: And that the Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
being thus lawfully chosen they shall meet and sit in Full Freedome;
That so the Two Houses may concurre in the preparing of such Lawes, as
they upon full and free debate, shall Judge necessary and convenient, both
for the confirming and executing the Law concerning the <hi>Test</hi> and such other
<hi>Lawes</hi> as are necessary for the Security and Maintenance of the Protestant
Religion; as likewise for making such Lawes as may establish a good aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the Church of England, and all Protestant Dissenters, as also
for the covering and securing of all such, who will live Peaceably under the
Government as becomes g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od Subjects, from all Persecution upon the account
of their Religion, even <hi>Papists</hi> themselves not excepted, and for the doing of
all other things, which the Two Houses of Parliament shall find necessary for
the Peace, Honour, and Safety of the Nation, so that there may be no
more danger of the Nations salling at any time hereafter, under <hi>Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
To this Parliament wee will also referre the Enquiry into the
birth of the Pretended Prince of Wales, and of all things relating to it and to
the Right of Succession.</p>
            <p>And Wee for our part will concurre in every thing, that may procure the
Peace and Happines of the Nation, which a Free and Lawfull Parliament
shall determine; Since wee have nothing before our eyes in this our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
but the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, the Covering of all
men from Persecution for their Consciences, and the Securing to the whole
Nation the free enjoyment of all their Lawes, Rights and Liberties, under a
Just and Legall Government.</p>
            <p>This is the designe, that wee have Proposed to our selves, in appearing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion in Armes: In the Conduct of which, Wee will keep the
Forces under our Command, under all the Strictnes of Martiall Discipline:
and take a speciall Care, that the People of the Countries thro which wee
must march, shall not suffer by their means: and as soon as the State of the
Nation will admit of it, Wee promise that we will send back all those Forreigne
Forces, that wee have brought along with us.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore hope that all People will judge rightly of us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of these our Proceedings: But wee chiefly rely on the blessing of God,
for the successe of this our undertaking, in which Wee place our whole and
only Confidence.</p>
            <p>Wee do in the last place invite and require all Persons whatsoever, All the
Peers of the Realme, both Spirituall and Temporall, all Lords Lieutenants,
Deputy Lieutenants, and all Gentlemen, Citisens and other Commons of all
ranks, to come and assist us, in order to the Executing of this our Designe;
against all such as shall Endeavour to Oppose us; that so wee may prevent
all those Miseries, which must needs follow upon the Nations being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And Wee do likewise resolve that as soon as the Nations are brought to a
state of Quiet Wee will take care that a Parliament shall be called in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
for the restoring the Ancient Constitution of that Kingdom, and for bringing
the Matters of Religion to such a Settlement, that the People may live easy
and happy, and for putting an end to all the Injust Violences, that have been
in a course of so many years Committed there.</p>
            <p>We will also study to bring the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to such a State, that
the Settlement there may be Religiously observed: and that the Protestant
and British Interest there, may be secured. And we will endeavour by all
possible means, to procure such an establishment in all the Three Kingdoms
that they may all live in a happy Union and Correspondence together; and
that the Protestant Religion, and the Peace, Honour, and Happiness of those
Nations, may be established upon lasting Foundations.</p>

least reason for such a Talk, they who aggravate every little thing, would
let this Declaration pass without the least mentioning of what is so momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and important? And is there any thing more than a Violent Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
suggested about the Prince of <hi>Wales?</hi> And is the very Noise of such
a Presumption reason enough to justifie a real War? As for the other things
urg'd, are they not Redressable by a Parliament, and so far as it's possible
without one already Redressed? 'Tis a Parliament then that is the main
thing to be insisted on, which, though Chosen as the last was, would be too
feeble an Argument to clear the present Invasion from the charge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Injust and Unrighteous.</p>
            <p>The Great Men of this Kingdom ever thought a Parliament Irregularly
chosen more eligible than either a War, or a rash Enquiry into the manner of
the choise. Did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Parliament admit of a Words being
spoken to bring Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Parliament into doubt? Did they not look on
it as most dangerous to do so? And although by the Triennial Bill the long
Parliament in the late Kings Reign, was actually dissolved Nine Months
before it thought on the Repeal thereof, yet even after 'twas destroy'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64751:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by it, the <hi>Dissolved</hi> Parliament sate and repealed the <hi>Dissolving</hi> Bill, and
made the Conventicle-Act, the Test-Laws, repealed the Writ <hi>De Haeretico
Comburendo,</hi> and pass'd the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Bill into a Law. But
was the Assembly that Acted thus Irregularly, ever call'd to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for it, or any of their Laws declared Void and Null? Or was it ever
esteemed a Good Reason for a War? And yet this is much more than hath
been ever done by His Present Majesty. Besides, 'twas the late King that
took away the Charters, and those, who were entring on Violent Courses for
their Restauration, were proclaimed Traytors, and several executed for it,
whilst all the Pulpits throughout <hi>England</hi> sounded of the Horridness, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Vileness, Devilishness of that Conspiracy; And is what was Black
and Horrid then, become Noble, Great, Generous, and Glorious now?</p>
            <p>Thus much was also a part of the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet a Parliament chosen by the Garbled Corporations proclaim'd him
a Traitor, and Attainted him; But doth the Blood of <hi>Monmouth</hi> as well
as of the forementioned Conspirators, and of all those in the <hi>West</hi> lye on
the Iudges, Iuries, Nobility, and other Gentry of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that had a hand in condemning such as by violent Methods would have
restor'd the Charters. If these things could not vindicate the Presbyterian
Plotters in the late King's Reign, or <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the present Undertaking, for this doth infinitely exceed these, and the
late Civil War too, for neither of them brought in a Foreign Power upon
us as now is done.</p>
            <p>But it must be observed, that how great soever our Grievances have
been, yet now, all that Relief can reasonably be desired is granted us. The
Ecclesiastical Commission actually broken up, the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the
Master and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, and the Ancient Charters of
Cities and Burroughs actually restored, all things on the ancient Bottom,
for the Calling a Free Parliament, which His Majesty would have done
before this time, had not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hindred him, and as soon
as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> departs the King will call one, whereby all the
Prince's Pretensions are taken away, and nothing more remains for him to
do, but to return home, or contend for the Crown.</p>
            <p>Yet the Prince would have us believe, that though he is not satisfied with
this, yet he intends no such thing as the Crown, or a Conquest of us, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

and to vacate some of their Injust Judgments and Decrees. The sense
of their Guilt, and the distrust of their force, have induced them to offer to
the City of London some seeming releefe from their Great Oppressions: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from demanding a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of their Religion and Laws under the shelter of our Arms:
They do also give out, that we do intend to Conquer and Enslave the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
And therefore it is that we have thought fit to adde a few words to our
Declaration.</p>
            <p>We are Confident, that no persons can have such hard thoughts of us, as
to imagine that we have any other Designe in this Undertaking, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a settlement of the Religion and of the Liberties and Properties of the
subjects upon so sure a Foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
relapsing into the like miseries at any time hereafter. And as the forces
that we have brought along with us, are utterly disproportioned to that wicked
Design of Conquering the Nation, if wee were capable of Intending it, so
the Great Numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry, that are Men of
Eminent Quality and Estates, and persons of known Integrity and Zeal both
for the Religion and Government of England, many of them being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
distinguished by their Constant fidelity to the Crown, who do both accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
us in this Expedition, and have earnestly solicited us to it, will cover
us from all such Malicious Insinuations: For it is not to be imagined, that
either those who have Invited us, or those that are already come to assist us,
can joyn in a wicked attempt of Conquest, to make void their own lawful
Titles to their Honours, Estates and Interests: Wee are also Confident that
all men see how little weight there is to be laid, on all Promises and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that can be now made: since there has been so little regard had in time
past, to the most solemne Promises. And as that Imperfeit redresse that is
now offered, is a plain Confession of those Violations of the Government, that
we have set forth, so the Defectiveness of it is no lesse Apparent: for they
lay down nothing which they may not take up at Pleasure: and they reserve
entire and not so much as mentioned, their claimes and pretences to an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and Despotick power; which has been the root of all their Oppression,
and of the total subversion of the Government. And it is plain, that there can
be no redresse nor Remedy offered but in Parliament: by a Declaration of
the Rights of the Subjects that have been invaded: and not by any Pretended
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64751:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Acts of Grace, to which the extremity of their affairs has driven them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that we have thought fit to declare, that we will refer all to a Free
Assembly of the Nation, in a Lawful Parliament.</p>

            <p>THis Addition doth very fully unfold the Design, the Prince will abide

And why all these Insinuations, but to help us to Unravel the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague,
which, if it be not for the Crown, must be thus. The <hi>Dutch</hi>

is endeavoured, and that a <hi>Religion</hi> which is contrary to Law is
endeavoured to be introduced; it is not said, that the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion,
but a Religion contrary to the Law, and, it's well known, that the Laws
are against the Religion of the Dissenters, and the Prince's Endeavour
shall be to preserve and maintain above all the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship of
God, that is Established amongst us,</hi> which cannot be understood of the
Worship the Dissenters use, but of the Hierarchical way, that is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Prince's own Religion, as 'tis to that of the Dissenters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And to perswade the Church men to close with him, he Declares,
That he was most earnestly solicited to come over by the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi>
not doubting, but that, if the Belief thereof prevail amongst the Mobile,
they'll be all of an Opinion that the Prince's Grounds are most Iust and

Reasonable, so that though it cannot be made out by any thing particularly
known, yet this general carrying a thousand unheard-of Arguments in its
Bowels cannot fail of success.</p>
            <p>But what if this prove not True? May we afterwards venture to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Highness in any thing, which under a violent Temptation, he may
be, as now, moved to declare? The Prince insists on it, That many of the
<hi>Lords</hi> Spiritual did most earnestly sollicite him to Invade us, and yet the
<hi>Lords</hi> Spiritual do not only declare, That they look on this Invasion to be
sinful, but, that they never sollicited his coming; And, it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
That they could do no such thing without acting most contrary to
their Avowed Principles, and contrary to most solemn <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations;</hi>
and Men should take heed, how they receive this Report
against the <hi>Right Reverend Bishops;</hi> the Design in which they are said
to Embarque being founded on that very Principle, in pursuance of which
the Head of <hi>Charles</hi> the Blessed Martyr was brought to the Block; and
Embarque they cannot, but by joyning with a Foreign Army, the chief
part of which is made up of those who though they would willingly enough
ensnare our Bishops, cannot be reasonably supposed to be true in the promises
they make about supporting their Hierarchical Grandeur; the utmost they
must expect in the long-run can be no more than a turning their Lands into
Money, that, to the end their dependance on the Government may be the more
effectually secured, in stead of their present Lands, Leases, &amp;c. they may
have an Yearly Salary answerable to their worth and desert, which as 'twill
be uncertain, so it cannot be hop'd that its utmost heighth shall arise to the
State and Degree of a Baron, for Baronies go with their Lands. By
this you may see, how unlikely any sort of <hi>Englishmen</hi> should by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion

            <head>ANIMADVERSIONS
UPON THE
DECLARATION
OF HIS HIGHNESS
The PRINCE of ORANGE.</head>
            <p>THE Great Preparations for War in <hi>Holland,</hi> were long talk'd of
here as very unconcerning News. Besides the perpetual assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of their Embassador, that they were not designed this
way, every body knew the Influence which his Highness the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has upon that Country; and it could not sink
into their Heads, that He, who was Born of one Daughter of <hi>England,</hi> and
Married to another, would ever suffer the Peace of a Country to be distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
for which Nature Sollicited a Feeling Tenderness. Even they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected,
that Politicks sometimes sway more than Nature, as possible as they
thought it that he might be moved to suffer it to be done by some body, in
whom it would shew less Shocking, thought it absolutely impossible he should
ever be moved to bring Fire and Sword into <hi>England</hi> himself, and Personally
Fight against his Father-in-Law, and Uncle. When we found our incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had deceived us, we cast about to discover what unsufferable Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had receiv'd, what Injuries beyond Satisfaction, what Affronts to be
Reveng'd with no less than the Ruin of a Nation; in fine, what just cause
of War there could be. And we impatiently waited for the Declaration of
his Highness, in which we expected to find all this. Now it is come, we are
more at a loss than before. War must shed a great deal of Blood; make
numberless Widows and Orphans, whose Tears will go up to Heaven, and
Cries be heard; Desolate the Nation; change our Plenty into Beggary;
and bring a Thousand Calamities. This Blood, and these Miseries will one
Day be required from the Authors. And we perceive nothing in the World
to justifie all this, but the very Stories which we hear from those who make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64751:11"/>
it their business to Slander the Government, and Incense the People, of whom
there are too many in every Nation, and to whom we little thought his
Highness would have afforded the Countenance of his Name. Since he has
thought fit to do it, I shall, in respect, forbear to Contest it with his Highness,
as much as I perceive he is Misinformed, farther than is just necessary for our
own Resolutions and Actions. His Declaration Sollicits us to joyn with his
Arms, and I conceive we ought to be very well assured the Reasons offer'd will
justifie us to God and Man, before we break our Natural and Sworn Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and forfeit our Honour in this World, and Interest in the next, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting,
or Fighting against our King, and Gods Anointed, before we tear
out the Bowels of Our Mother Country with our own Hands, and do things
for which his Highness himself shall always think us, and if he prevail, one
day Treat us as Traytors and Rebels. For a Traytor is sure to be hated,
even by him who loves the Treason.</p>
            <p>The Declaration begins with telling us, That <hi>the Publick Peace cannot be
preserved, where the Laws are openly Transgressed, and a Religion contrary to Law
endeavoured to be intr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ed.</hi> And that <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>se who are most immediately concerned,
are indispensably bound to preserve them.</hi> This may be as true as it will for any
concern which <hi>England</hi> or his Highness has in it. <hi>England,</hi> whatever be, is not
the Country in which these things are done. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>xecution indeed of some
Laws is Suspended, Laws it seems not necessary to the Publick Peace, since
the Declaration inform us, his Highness intends they should be taken away<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>;
And this Suspension, by those who should know, is thought to be warranted,
not forbidden by Law, and his Highness, I fancy, would be of their Opinion
himself, if the case were his own. Happy we, if nothing would subvert our
Peace, and transgress our Laws more than this Suspension.</p>
            <p>But to make these things the Ground of an Invasion, which must intirely
subvert our Peace, and, if it prevail, our Laws, and leave us none, but at
the Mercy of an Arbitrary Sword; which cannot begin without notoriously
transgressing the Laws of God and Nations; nor be abetted without undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisable
transgressing the Laws of the Land; has palpably some other aim,
than the care of our Peace and Laws.</p>
            <p>What endeavours to introduce Popery his Highness means, I cannot tell.
The King, to my thinking, has bounded his Favour to that Religion, with the
single desire of seeing his Papist Subjects in the same condition with the rest,
and is pleas'd to bate even of that. Had he design'd to introduce their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
he would certainly never have made it impossible to be introduc't. For
an Universal Liberty unites the interest of every Religion, against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
of any one, and Excludes Popery from all hopes of ever Domineering
in <hi>England.</hi> But let the designs of Papists be never so Irreligious, booted
Missionaries, I take it, are no Ministers of the Gospel in the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
nor bare endeavours to do b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d Actions, a Warrant actually to do bad
Actions, and the worst of them.</p>
            <p>After all, were our Case as bad as the Declaration represents it, How
comes his Highness to be concern'd in it? <hi>It is</hi> in his own words, <hi>certain and
evident to all Men,</hi> that Sovereign States, whether Monarchies, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64751:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are independent, and have no Right to interpose, otherwise
than by friendly Offices, in one anothers Affairs, but violate the Laws of
Nations as often as they do. Every Government holds within itself, all those
who are concern'd in the Redress of Abuses, when they happen, and the
Laws inform us who they are. Nor is any thing more inconsistent with Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment,
than the interposition of Foreign Powers, nor more deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Laws of all Nations, than abetting of it. Turn the Tables, and
let all these dismal Stories, as som perhaps are, be told of <hi>Holland,</hi> and be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>o true; I refer it to all Mankind, to <hi>Holland,</hi> to his Highness himself, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King of <hi>England</hi> would not pass for a very bad Neighbour, and a
very bad Man, if he should take the cognizance from the States, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
compose their Disorders by War: The immediate Concern insinuated,
relates, I suppose, to the prospect of Succession, to which, if the calamities
of War, be the proofs of his tender Affection to our Nation, it will soon wish
the Right of his Highness were farther removed, than it is; thÃ´ it has now
pleased God, the Right should not be immediate, even in his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort.
But the most immediate Right to Succeed, is no Right to intermeddle
before the Succession falls. I am Successor to my Father, but cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dispose of his Estate, chuse his Tenants for him, and appoint what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
he shall make in his Leases, any more than a stranger to his Bloud.</p>
            <p>And yet it follows, that <hi>upon these Ground; his Highness can no longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to Declare, that Counsellors, in chief Credit with the King, have openly
overturned Religion and the Laws, and subjected them in all things relating to
Conscience, Liberty and Property, to Arbitrary Government,</hi> If these were the
true Grounds of his Highness, he could as little forbear to Declare against
many, perhaps all Nations, in which there are more rational, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
causes of complaint to be found, by one who would look after them. But
put it to Mankind, and all Mankind must Declare, that these Grounds are
no Grounds, and which no party will allow to justify another which disturbs
them. Put it to the Nation, and all the Nation must Declare, that every
Man enjoys his Conscience, his Liberty, and his Property, even to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of their less happy Neighbours, and that there has been no proceeding
against a single Man, but for his single Misdemeanor, and this not by Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but Legal, Power. And then to asperse His Majesty with overturning
all Laws, under the name of Evil Counsellors! Why? let His Counsellors
be never so bad, they are worse, whose Service his Highness has used in
Penning this Declaration. Men, whose Brains reach no farther, than to
Copy from their Rebellious Ancestors of 41, by whose example it is too sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, whom they meant by Evil Counsellors, and what they intended
to do with Him. And yet his Highness leads his Name to such Men, and
giving Credit to such Counsellors himself, talks of Evil Counsellors in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with the King.</p>
            <p>To these general Premises, the Declaration adds a List of particulars;
whereof the first is, <hi>the Dispensing Power.</hi> And this his Highness takes the
pains to moot, and tell us how far it goes, and where it must stop, and that
<hi>a Sentence has been obtained for it</hi> from the Judges. Those Judges should in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64751:12"/>
reason understand the Matter better, than those, on whose Information his
Highness has thought fit to relye. As I take it for a Parliamentary Business,
I leave it untoucht, to the Wisdom of a Parliament, believing, all I can say,
will be said and considered there, and resolving to acquiesce in their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
In the mean time, How does this justifie Foreign Arms? Here is
the Case. Kings are not bred at the Inns of Court, but must trust Lawyers
for Law, as well as Physicians for Physick. The oppression of Conscience-Laws,
deafens His Majesties Ears with perpetual Complaints, and His ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of His Subjects prompts Him to relieve them. He adviseth with
those of the Profession, and they inform Him, He may, by His Dispensing
Power, relieve them Legally, and he does it. Every body is not content,
and he refers the whole to a publick Legal Tryal. Pray what better, or
other Advice could his Highness have given? What could he do more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if it had been his own Case? And if I may be so bold, Does he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do so much? Unfortunate Majesty! and Unfortunate Mankind! If
every Nation must be justly liable to the calamities of War, in which a King
happens to have a Counsellor, who in point of a Law of his own Country,
differs in Opinion from a Prince of another.</p>
            <p>Upon this Point it is further Declared, that <hi>these Evil Counsellors se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
examined the Opinions of the Iudges, and procured such to be turn'd out,
as could not in Conscience concur in their pernicious Sentence.</hi> Why? then those bad
Counsellors were not bad enough to desire Men should Act against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and the pernicious Sentence was given according to Conscience. But
this again is His Highnesses Case. He has the nomination of Men to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
as well as the King: And I humbly refer it to his Conscience,
whether before he nominate, he do not satisfy himself that his NominÃª be a
Man on whom he may rely, for the Service which he expects from him. Is
it justice to fall out with the King for doing what he does Himself, and all
Princes in the World, and all private Men, who have Employments at their
disposal?</p>
            <p>After minding us that we have a Crowned King, and have had Laws
enacted in <hi>England</hi> for preservatiou of our Rights, Liberties and Religion:
The Declaration repeats again, that <hi>Evil Counsellors have in effect annulled all
those Laws,</hi> contrary to <hi>the Kings Promise and Oath.</hi> Strange descant upon
this short plain Song, <hi>The King has Dispenc'd with one Law,</hi> and that in the
interval of Parliament, from which he promises Himself, it will be taken
away, and which the Parliament design'd by his Highness, as free as it shall
<hi>be,</hi> we find by the Declaration, <hi>must</hi> take away, and this upon Information
which he had reason to trust, that he might, according to Law. Will the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
of his Highnesses Pen-men, make this pass for a breach of Promise and
Oath, for annulling and abolishing all Laws, when we see with our Eyes, the
establisht Religion actually maintained, and assist every day at the Divine
Service of it; when we see the Judges Sit, and Suitors obtain effectual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Sentences from them, and effectual execution elsewhere; when we
see no Dispensation, nor Inclination to it in any thing, save in relief of an
Oppression, which the whole Nation, as far as I perceive, consents should
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64751:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be continued? We Humbly pray his Highness, in stead of the Liberty
held forth by his Invasion, to afford us the liberty of believing our own Eyes,
before the repetitions of his Historical Pen-men, and to think we actually
enjoy our Religion, and our Laws as much as they would persuade us, there
is no such thing in <hi>England,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thÃ´ our Case were as deplorable, as their frightful <hi>Idea</hi> would
make it, what Remedy can we hope from the Declaration? All Human
Affairs are subject to the miscarriages inseparable from Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
When they happen among us, the Wisdom of our Nation has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought the best way of Redress is by Parliament. But we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think knocking out Mens Brains a proper remedy for miscariages about
Religion, nor plundring and burning apt to set right the sway'd Law. And
we again pray his Highness, rather to let us alone in our Misery, than make
us happy this way. For as we are made, the Happiness would be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
the more unsupportable Misery.</p>
            <p>After all, what would his Highness have done in the Case? and what can
be done more, than to leave none of those things in being, of which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd?
And so much his Highness owns was done before he set Sail from
<hi>Holland.</hi> The Ecclesiastical Commission was broken; the Suspension of the
Bishop of <hi>London</hi> taken off; <hi>Magdelene</hi> College restored; Chancellors and
Archdeacons discharged of their attendance; Lord-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants,
and the rest replaced; and Charters returned. As it is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
that his Highness comes not to redress things, which he knew were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd
already, it is palpable that we have Reasons of his coming alledged
which are not his Reasons, and too much ground to argue from one to all,
and, conclude, we have not one true Reason offered, but are amused with
pretences apt to work upon us, but which no way move his Highness.</p>
            <p>There is mention besides of Popish Chappels, and Schools, and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all three consequences of <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> People cannot exercise
their Religion, without places in which to exercise it, neither is there any
complaint of the Meeting places of their fellow Dissenters, nor can I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
why his Highness excepts against their Chappels, who Declares, he
will not except them from the <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> Again, Parents always
breed up their Children in their own way: And if Papists be not allow'd
Schools at home, they will be sent abroad, to spend there, what it were
more for the benefit of the Nation should be laid out here, and besides, be
train'd up to Foreign Customs, and perhaps, Foreign Principles, not so
grateful to the Nation, whereas here they might be watcht. But cannot the
King and Parliament compose this matter without Bloodshed? Is the Question,
whether a Boy shall go to School in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> so very material, and so
very intricate, that nothing but Arms can decide it? As for their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it stands not with Nature, that a King should not chuse some of his own
way to trust with Commissions, when he is persuaded he lawfully may. With
all my Heart I wish, that the greater readiness, and greater fidelity of
others in the defence of their Prince and Country, may convince him, and all
the World, that he has made an ill choice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64751:13"/>
But to see whither Exaggeration will go! <hi>All Matters of Civil Iustice,</hi>
according to the Declaration, <hi>are brought to great Vncertainties: Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ndered Masters of the Affairs of the Church, the Government of the
Nation, and the Course of Iustice,</hi> and all by these Commissions to Papists:
And yet all this signifies barely three or four Judges at most, some Justices
of Peace, and some Officers in the Army. Can a few, and those puny
Judges, (for there are no other) master the Courts of Justice<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Can a few Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
most Subalterns, with Soldiers, not one to fifty of their Religion,
master the Affairs of the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and enslave a Nation? In which, if all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
were armed, and the rest naked<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> their Pikes and Muskets could not defend
them against a Volley of Stones. Can Matters of Civil Justice be brought
to great Uncertainties by the incapacity of Papists, who have no incapacity
upon them? The Law indeed forbids them to be employed, but if they be,
there is no invalidity laid upon their Acts. And for Military Incapacity, if
the Law had put it, his Highness has dispens'd with it; for an Invasion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates
every body to save his Country, as Fire breaking out, to save his
House. But 'tis incomprehensible, that the <hi>Irish</hi> should be mentioned, and the
danger in which the Nation is of Slavery from them, who, if his Highness
had not brought them in, had never been here to fright us. At worst, the
King's Subjects sure may be as safely here, as absolute Foreigners; and if
Strangers, tho' Subjects, be inconsistent with our Freedom, 'tis certain, that
whatever be the business of his Highnesses Army, our Freedom is not.</p>
            <p>And this appears the more, the farther we go. All His Majesties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are taken presently after into the care of his Highness, and 'tis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as a dismal Matter, that Papists are employed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the
King's Power is in <hi>Scotland</hi> declared <hi>Absolute,</hi> and Subjects to obey <hi>without
Reserve.</hi> Now these are the very words of a Law enacted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a
very free Parliament, held under a Commissioner, upon whom, there never
sell any imputation of Popery. His Highness is sparing in this Point. It is
said farther by the Parliament, That the Blessings of <hi>Scotland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> are, next to
God, owing to the uninterrupted Line of the Kings, and to that solid abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority, and that their Kings are invested with it by<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the first and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Laws of their Monarchy. But Parliaments, it seems, must
exercise no freedom, but according to the pleasure of a supervising Foreign
Sword, though I should think it somthing early to declare it. In <hi>Ireland,</hi>
the Laws exclude not Papists from Employments; and 'tis again referr'd to
the Conscience of his Highness, Whether he would think it reasonable, his
Neighbours should exclaim and inflame the People against him, for disposing
Employments as the Law allows, and themselves resolve the Matter to be so
heinously unjust, that any of them has right to revenge it upon his Country
with the Miseries of War? Who shall hope to please his Highness, when he
thinks fit, at once, to dislike breaking Laws in <hi>England,</hi> making them in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and keeping them in <hi>Ireland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But these unsufferable Oppressions, have put the Subjects under just Fears, and
made them look after such lawful Remedies, as are allow'd of in all Nations.</hi> I
hope, his Highness does not mean, rising in Arms against their King, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64751:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calling in Foreign Enemies, by lawful Remedies. Whatever other Nations
do, ours allows this for nothing but Treason, and Rebellion, nor, I much
suspect, any Nation in the World besides: And yet those lawful Remedies
must sure be Remedies not authorized by Law; for the Declaration makes
such means barr'd by evil Counsellors: The Instance is in the Bishops Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now as unquestionably legal as a Petition is, there may be an illegal
Petition; whether this were so, or no, the King desired should be legally
tryed: And a Tryal there was, in which, the direct Point (as I am informed)
came not to Issue, but <hi>Not guilty</hi> found upon no proof of matter of Fact<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
A Peer too is mentioned to be treated as a Criminal, for saying the Orders of
a Popish Justice were not to be obeyed. And all his Criminal treatment was
to refer him to the ordinary course of Law, where he likewise waved the
direct Point by collateral Exceptions; Where may the Oppression be, and
where the frightful Apprehensions of loss of Life, Liberty, Honor, and
Estate, in all this? Are Judicicial Proceedings already threatned, and barr'd?
And must we have an Army to revenge the wrongs of the Bishops, and a
Peer, who, I believe, themselves complain of none done them? Nor can,
without complaining that the Law has wrong'd them, even when it acquitted
them.</p>
            <p>What significations have been made, and what Expedients proposed by
their Highnesses to his Majesty, is not come to my knowledge. But if the
same Advisers were used in their suggestions, which have been in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
it is very likely the King might be sensible, they were too ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> to take their Advice. If Evil Counsellors
have endeavoured to perswade the King, that his Highness design'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the Quiet and Happiness of the Kingdom, I am infinitely sorry he
would be at all this pains to justifie them. For 'tis impossible to believe he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
came hither, without design to come, or that the War he brings with
him will not disturb our Peace, and the Miseries of it our Happiness.</p>
            <p>What follows is past my understanding. <hi>The last and great Remedy for all
our Evils is the Calling of a Parliament.</hi> So indeed all Englishmen think, and
so His Majesty thought, who call'd One. Happy we, if his Highness had
been of the same Opinion! but to our Misery, he is not, who when One
was call'd would not let it sit, but instead of it brought in Evils past the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
even of a Parliament. For Votes are not Cannon proof. <hi>But a Parliament
could not yet compassed, nor can it be easily brought about.</hi> Too sadly true: For
it is neither easy, nor possible, to bring about a Parliament, when defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
People must break through a Foreign Army to meet and elect. Before,
it was so possible to compass, that it was compast; Writs were actually gone
out, and Elections begun, which were not stopt by Evil Counsellors. But
<hi>these Evil Counsellors apprehended, they should be brought to an account, for their
Plots and Conspiracies against the Protestant Religion, and have endeavoured, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the specious pretence of Liberty of Conscience, to sow Divisions among them,
between the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and Dissenters, that, by their natural Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
They might bring about their Designs, both in the Election of Members, and
in the Parliament it self.</hi> Why then they design'd a Parliament should sit, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64751:14"/>
evil as they were, and as much as they feared to be called to account. But
if Liberty of Conscience be a Plot against Protestants, his Highness must needs
be of it himself, who declared for it. Must we believe the same thing, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by His Majesty, will divide Protestants, and by his Highness establish
a good Agreement? Then the asking People their Opinion beforehand, the
Charters, Popish Sheriffs and Mayors, are brought in again, only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
at last, that <hi>no Parliament can be lawful, for which the Elections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
are made by Papists; and therefore, as long as the Authority and Magistracy
are in such hands, it is not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ssible to have any lawful Parliament.</hi> How ill do
they understand the Law of <hi>England,</hi> who penn'd this Declaration? Every
body knows, that Elections are made by Freeholders and Freemen, not by
Sheriffs and Mayors, and that a Papist may elect as legally as any body, and
make a Return, if he be in Office, as valid. Had his Highness suffered the
Elections to go on, we should have thought the Parliament very lawful; but
shall not think so of a Parliament made by the Law of Arms, where we are
chosen, and sit with the Sword at our Throats, we think, there is neither
legality nor freedom; and that, when for a Remedy of the impossibility of
a lawful Parliament, there is prescribed an impossibility that it should be
lawful, very ill State-Doctors have been called to Council.</p>
            <p>The Declaration crowns all with the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> of which,
it says, That <hi>great and violent Presumptions induce his Highness to believe, that
these evil Councellors have published, the Queen hath brought forth a Son, in order
to their ill Designs;</hi> and that <hi>not only his Highness himself, but all the good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of these Kingdoms, do vehemently suspect, that the pretended Prince of</hi> Wales
<hi>was not born by the Queen.</hi> Such things to come abroad, with the Name of
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to them! And yet it is but too true, that there is a
great deal of violence and vehemence in these Presumptions and Suspicions;
so true, that there is in reality nothing else, neither Presumption, nor Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
indeed. And this violence, and this vehemence, must needs be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
great; which can pretend Suspicions, not only utterly void of all Reason,
but so palpably against it, that, quite contrary to what the Declaration avers,
there is neither a good Subject, nor a sensible Man, who harbours any Doubt
in the case. And this Consideration, I suppose, has so long delayed doing any
thing for publick Satisfaction. As it was not indeed very proper for the
King to regard idle Fictions, invented and spread by purely obstinate Malice:
But now he has caused the business to be scanned, if we should take toy, and
suspect without Reason. I believe, it would trouble his Highness, to clear
his own or the Princesses Birth, as the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>
is cleared: And guess, they would entertain the slightest suspicion with
an impatient Scorn, and not allow the greatest vehemence in the World
to suspect them into the Children of other Mothers, than the Princess of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and Duchess of <hi>York.</hi> But, as much to seek as we were, for a
Reason in all alledg'd before, this questioning the Birth of the immediate
Successor, speaks plain. We know now, what brought his Highness hither<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and can give a shrewd guess at what will follow on his success: For if they
be the only good Subjects, who believe not we have a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64751:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are like to be in a bad condition, who have either sense enough to perceive
plain Truths, or Conscience enough to boggle at Perjury, or Memory enough
to remember, they have sworn Fidelity to the King, and his lawful Successors.</p>
            <p>Beginning now to wind up, his Highness minds us of <hi>the great interest which
the Princess Royal and himself have in this matter,</hi> and <hi>of their Right to the
Succession, such as all the World knows:</hi> Of <hi>the Endeavours we used for the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces, when they were invaded, in a most unjust War in</hi> 1672: Of <hi>the
particular Esteem and Affection, which the</hi> English <hi>Nation has ever testified to both
their Highnesses:</hi> And <hi>therefore cannot excuse himself from espousing our Interests;
to the doing of which, he is earnestly solicited by a great many Lords, both Spiritual
and Temporal, by many Gentlemen, and Subjects of all Ranks.</hi> In all which, the
only thing we can understand, is, the Succession, to which, their Highnesses
do severally stand i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> that degree, which all the World knows. But there
is not a Man in the World, who can understand, how those, who espouse
the interest of another, because they have an interest of their own, espouse
any interest but their own; nor could his Highness have told us more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he comes for himself, not us; that all alledged besides, is only for
fashion-sake; and that we might sink or swim, for any care of his, if he had
not been concerned himself. Again, because we did what we could for the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> when they were unjustly invaded, no body can understand, how Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
obliges them to invade us unjustly themselves; nor how the particular
Affection and Esteem, which we have ever testified to their Highnesses, should
deserve, that he should become our Enemy, and ruine us for our pains. As
much Esteem and Affection, as the great Qualities of his Highness are like
to meet every where, he will please to be informed, that the strongest Band
of ours, is his Alliance to the Royal Bloud; and must pardon the <hi>English,</hi> if
they love not a Man who hates our King, the very King, whose Sister and
Daughter tyed our Affections to him: Then, who can understand, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
War upon us is espousing our Interest, our Religion, our Laws, our
Liberties and Properties; our Interest, and we, beseech his Highness to have
a little Mercy on us, and not oblige us to believe, he espouses our Interest,
by subjecting all we have to the mercy of a lawless Sword. He must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
pardon us, if we believe not on his Word, that many Lords, many of
the Gentry, and of all Ranks, are Traytors, which, if it were true, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them betimes, and by exposing them to be punished by others, till it
be seasonable to do it himself, informs them what they must expect at last.
But the Spiritual Lords and their Principles are well known, and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
has experience what they are, in the first Bishop near whom he approached.
He is like to meet the Temporal Lords, whom Age keeps not at home, or the
King's Service employs not elsewhere, with the Gentry, and all Ranks, in
the Field, and be better informed from themselves, that the <hi>English</hi> are no
Traytors, and will take care to wipe off this Aspersion from the Nation.
Alas! how little does his Highness know us! Many an unwary, and many
a heated Man, speaks Treason here, who is, for all that, honest at Heart, and
will make it well appear he is, when there is occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64751:15"/>
But, <hi>Therefore it is that his Highness hath thought fit to go over to</hi> England,
<hi>and carry with him a Force sufficient by the Blessing of God to defend him from
the Violence of Evil Counsellors.</hi> Unintelligible Language of Declarations of
War! To Invade us is called Defending Himself, and this where there is
no fear of an Assault, or any danger, save from that very Force which he
must needs bring to defend him. For without it, his single Name, not
guarded so much as by a Footman, had found security, and veneration all
<hi>England</hi> over.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>true account <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>f inducing Reasons,</hi> (Reasons, if it please his Penmen,
For nothing looks like a Reason but one. <hi>viz. Interest</hi>) his Highness thinks
sit to declare his Intentions. As if there needed a Declaration to inform us
what Pikes and Muskets intend. An Army intends nothing but to Master
where it comes, the very same which the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders
from the beginning of the World to this day, intended. But his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
is <hi>a free and lawful Parliament:</hi> And for a Preparative, <hi>the annulling of
new, and returning of old Charters, particularly that of the City of</hi> London:
<hi>Restoring of former Magistrates; addressing Writs a proper Officers;</hi> And <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
note to chuse, or be chosen, but such as are qualified by Law.</hi> A Man no
wiser than I, would think, that if his Highness<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> designed nothing but this, he
might very well have staid at home. For all these Preparatives were, and
he knew were, made, before he went aboard. And a free and lawful Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had now been sitting, or ready of sit, if he would have let it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado, it is palpably impossible his Highness should come only to do
over again, what he knew was done to his hand; only to get us a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he will not suffer us to have, and this pretence must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
cover some Design thought less taking with <hi>Englishmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Parliament his Highness declares shall <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>sit</hi> in full freedom,
but perhaps not <hi>act</hi> so. For <hi>the two Houses</hi> must, it seems, <hi>prepare Laws to
confirm and execute the Test;</hi> for <hi>the security and maintenance of the Protestant
Religion;</hi> and <hi>for a good Agreement between the Church of</hi> England <hi>and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Dissenters;</hi> and <hi>covering such from Persecution as will live peaceably, not
excepting Papists.</hi> But how will his Highness keep his Word, if a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should happen to think the Test needs no Confirmation, nor Religion
more Laws than are already, nor that any Laws can make the Church of
<hi>England</hi> and Dissenters agree? However it be, they love to have it in their
power to confirm, or alter, or abrogate, or let the Laws alone as they are,
according as the good of the Nation shall require, without having their Task
prescribed. They take themselves for Master-Workmen, and who can cut
out their Work themselves<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> not for bare Journeymen, to make up Work
cut out by others. But I would gladly know, what Protestant Religion
means in the Mouth of his Highness. In the Language of the Country
where he was Born and Bred, right Protestancy signifies Presbytery, and
he is said to be surrounded by Men who so understand it, whereof some
perhaps might have a hand in this Declaration. As the Religion, or <hi>Church
Established by Law,</hi> had been easily said, if it had been meant; to my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the suspicion is vehement, that this free Parliament, with a <hi>Holland</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64751:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Trumpet in the Speakers Chair, is to set up Presbytery; at least, I am very sure
it must, if that Trumpet sound it; and there is but too much reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it will sound here as it does at home, especially when there is not the
least intimation to the contrary. The pretended Invitation of the Spiritual
Lords will be well rewarded with a good agreement with their Dissenting
Masters, and being covered from Persecution, provided they hold themselves
content, and live peaceably. But the comfort is, nothing can better shew
their Invitation is but pretended.</p>
            <p>To this fully free Parliament <hi>his Highness will refer the inquiry into the
Birth of the pretended Prince of Wales,</hi> to Vote him, I suppose, a Prince
Prettyman, the Son of Nobody. For we know what the References of
Conquerors signifie, and what the freedom of their Arbitrators. But it is
time to leave talking, when such things are said, and think of other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
than Pens. Would his Highness be content to refer his own Birth?
For though there be nothing of suspicion in it, yet the nothing on his side is
nearer to something than on the side of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> For one may
suspect that he who talks at this rate, was not born of an <hi>English</hi> Mother.</p>
            <p>But after all, there wants something still. His Highness designs new Laws;
but Acts, barely prepared, have not the perfection of Laws, Suppose the King
should prove resty somewhere, and advise upon it? Why, his Highness has
found an Expedient. <hi>He will</hi> himself <hi>concur in every thing that may procure
the Peace</hi> (witness his War) <hi>and Happiness of the Nation,</hi> that is, just what
he pleases. <hi>He will take care that a Parliament shall be called in</hi> Scotland.
<hi>He will study to bring</hi> Ireland <hi>into a state that the settlement be observed,
and the Protestant and</hi> British <hi>Interest secured.</hi> And <hi>as soon as the state of the
Nation will admit,</hi> he <hi>promises to send back his Foreign Forces;</hi> and, in the
mean time <hi>invites and requires all Peers, and all Persons whatsoever to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ppose him.</hi> That is in short,
He will be King of <hi>England.</hi> For none pass Bills into Acts by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
but Kings. To take care for calling Parliaments; and for the
settlement and security of the Kings Dominions, belongs to none but the
King; And he who means to send his Forces away, certainly means to stay
himself. And that we may not be ignorant in what condition he means to
stay, he takes the King upon him by way of Anticipation. For no body can
require the assistance of all his Subjects of all sorts, but the King. So many
Stories in the Declaration of a Prince, which are the Entertainment of our

whomsoever we are required, but true Loyalty and Fidelity to him and his

         <div type="remarks">
            <head>Animadversions upon the Additional Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Highness.</head>
            <p>THE Premises are so very plain, that his Highness thought it necessary to
take notice of them himself. Against the Apprehensions of a Conquest,
he alledges the <hi>disproportion of his Forces,</hi> and <hi>the joyning of English with him.</hi>
That disproportion is not his Fault, and would have been, tho he had brought
<hi>Holland</hi> it self in his Fleet, and all the Men in it. But can he not design a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
for all that? We were Conquered by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and bare Twelve
Thousand <hi>Suedes</hi> bid fair for the Conquest of <hi>Germany,</hi> as little proportion as
<hi>Normandy</hi> had to <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Sweden</hi> to <hi>Germany.</hi> We can Conquer our
selves, tho <hi>Holland</hi> cannot; which if we do, we Conquer for him under whom
we Fight. For the General wins the Battel, who ever Fight it. And this of
necessity his Highness must design, unless he design to be beaten. For Victory
and Conquest are but two Names for one thing. Neither is he a Man to be
at all this ado to make a Conquest, and not make the most of it when he was
done; neither can he do otherwise tho he would. For as he has no Right
to Act here by Law, he must of necessity Act by Right of Conquest. And
we humbly beseech him not to declare us out of common Sense, and into a
belief that he is not <hi>capable of intending</hi> what we see he is actually doing.</p>
            <p>But Enemies to their Country, of all Men in the World, one would least
expect should be magnified for <hi>Integrity,</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>constant Fidelity,</hi> and
who <hi>cannot joyn in a wicked attempt of Conquest, to make void their own lawful
Titles to their Honours, Estates, and Interests.</hi> Must we believe again they
cannot joyn in an Attempt in which his Highness himself tells us they do joyn?
Nor void their Titles, when they actually did void them the very moment
of the first Overt Act, which made it known they thought of that wicked At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64751:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And then the Fidelity, the Integrity, and Zeal of Treason, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
Language in <hi>England.</hi> But I have already observed, that his
Highness speaks in the Language of a Protestant Religion which is not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
here, and in likelihood never will by a Parliament truly free.</p>
            <p>The Kings Concessions are treated as a <hi>seeming Relief; pretended Acts of
Grace; an imperfect Redress, upon which no weight is to be laid, because Solemn
Promises have been broken; a plain Confession of the Violation set forth in the
Declaration, and defective because they may again be taken up.</hi> His Highness
takes care that nothing shall be replyed upon breach of Promise, by giving
no instance where it was broken. But to my grief here is greater Work in
hand. It had been shorter, and not much plainer said, I am resolved at any
rate to come, and be King. For as the pretence of the Declaration was,
that the King had taken up some things, and the pretence of the Addition,
that he has laid them down, 'tis palpable that the Expedition was unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
resolved, without any care, or thought of the good of <hi>England,</hi> or its
Concerns, save only to borrow a pretence which might contribute to the
success of the Expedition, and to which <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>undo</hi> was all a case; and that
nothing shall satisfie him but laying down the Crown, nor that neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may happen to be taken up again.</p>
            <p>And yet his Highness declares again, that <hi>he will refer all to a free lawful
Parliament.</hi> Happy we, if he would. If an <hi>English</hi> Parliament were to
judge, whether Foreign Force be lawful? Whether it be Integrity, Zeal,
and Fidelity to abet it? Whether it can be without a design of Conquest,
and Conquest without enslaving this Nation to the Arbitrary Pleasure of
the Conqueror? And twenty such things, which must needs enter into the
number of the referred <hi>All.</hi> But to talk of referring all to a Parliament,
and at the same time refer all to the Sword; To talk of the freedom of a
Parliament, which cannot Vote nor Debate, nor so much as make a Motion,
but in danger of their Lives, is purely Talk, and not like to ingratiate his
Quarrel to a Nation not altogether senseless, as much as his Highness seems
to think it is, when we see the King did call a free Parliament, that is,
actually did refer all to it, (for calling one is referring all to it, which it thinks
fit to take into Consideration) and that his Highness would not let it sit, we
need no Declarations to inform us which of the two is truly willing to refer
all to a Parliament.</p>
            <p>Two Letters, said to be annexed to the Declaration in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
to the Seamen and Land Soldiers carry likewise the Name of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
In which they are first Cajolled with the Title of <hi>Friend;</hi> as if they
were Men to be Cajolled into a Friendship, with the Enemies of their Prince
and Country, and then endeavoured to be debaucht into his Service, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
the most unsuitable to English Natures that were ever found out, <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from Papists, Duty to God,</hi> and <hi>Fear of falling into his Hands.</hi> I perceiv'd
we were taken for Fools before, must we be taken for Cowards too, Men to
be frighted even with the Sound of Danger<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> His Highness is like to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
one day, that the English Fear not his Arms, much less the Papists, who
tho they were all embodied, are not near so many Soldiers; no tho it were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64751:17"/>
less by as many Papists as are in it. And yet there are more <hi>Holland</hi> than
<hi>English</hi> Papists in the Field. Moreover, that they know their Duty to God
obliges them to be true to their Prince, and that there is no Honour in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Lastly, that his Men may fear to fall into their Hands, they fear not to
fall into his.</p>
            <p>It is said besides, that <hi>Papists have Sworn the Ruin of the Protestant Religion,</hi> a
piece of News which his Highness would much oblige the whole Nation to
Verifie. Let the wicked Men be but Named, and Convicted, and the next
Gallows or Tree would save the trouble of Parliaments and References<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Soldiers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that they may not be Instruments to defend their Prince,
and save their Country and themselves from Slavery, are desired to believe
they are the Instruments to introduce Popery. When they are, They will
pray His Majesty to Dispense with their Service. But they find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> Popery
in Fighting for the King, their Country, and the Laws, against a Man who
Usurps the Crown first, and then would cajole them to fix it. For besides,
what has been observed already, he writes in the Style of a King, <hi>Trusty and
Well Beloved,</hi> and joyns the Supporters of <hi>England</hi> to his Arms, in a manner
not allowable in Heraldry, even tho the Princess Royal were Queen. But
where we cannot find good Reasons, we must take up with bad Pretences.</p>
