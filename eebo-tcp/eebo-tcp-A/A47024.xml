            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>PErſecution, Tribulation,</hi> and <hi>Scandal,</hi> are ſo proper Marks on a <hi>true Chriſtian,</hi> that a real good Man thinks himſelf Happy in that his Reputation ſuffers amongſt his <hi>Perſecutors</hi>: And yet, that is the moſt ſenſible Part that an honeſt Man can receive a Wound in. However, it doth not in the leaſt grieve the Author, that he has lately done unjuſt Pennance in <hi>other Mens Sheets,</hi> for a Crime never committed in his <hi>own.</hi> 'Tis well for them, they did not, nor cou'd deprive him of a Being, (tho' I cannot doubt their Rigour of their Intentions and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) ſince he ſtill lives an Apoſtle, and cou'd willing dye a Martyr of that Truth, which has ſo much offended Heaven's Adverſaries and his. He is bleſſed to think that he can innocently hear what they injuriouſly charge upon him, and that there is yet one true Chriſtian alive, whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32663:2"/>
               <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot, Dragoons,</hi> nor any <hi>Evil,</hi> can deter from living accordingly. No, nor whom <hi>Avarice, Vain-Glory,</hi> nor hope of <hi>Advancement,</hi> can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt to their own likeneſs. And I doubt not, but there are many Thouſands, but the Honour is now ſo particular to the Author, that were he not arm'd by the Grace of God, he would certainly be in great Danger of Falling under the Temptation of a Spiritual Pride. How little did the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters</hi> on his <hi>Farewel Sermon,</hi> deſign him ſo great a Satisfaction and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage! yet how induſtriouſly does he labour for their's! And is reſolved ſtill to ſpeak and write what may be of Service to them in a double Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; For they may make the beſt Uſe of it for their Souls, or a worſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Temporal Neceſſities, by emptying their Brains in their nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> ſcoffing at my Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But well, go on my Friends; you may thus chance to fix a <hi>Glory</hi> on his Head, where you intended a <hi>Bramble,</hi> or a <hi>Pot-ſheard.</hi> The wicked At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Unrighteous, do generally deviate from their firſt Intentions; and the Curſe they utter and wou'd faſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n upon another, very often ſeizes and deſtroys them: And yet, why ſhou'd it afflict you if he endeavour'd the Life of a Saint? Nay, or if he ſhou'd after Death, become ſuch a Bleſſed Creature! Have you loſt e're a Friend by that, do you imagine! or rather, ſhall you not get a better, whilſt he is yet endeavouring.</p>
            <p>'Tis odd (methinks) to obſerve, how generally ill Nature prevails, and how rarely the World applauds a Vice in another, which they adore in themſelves, unleſs it be what they call a Sociable Vice; a <hi>Whoring, Drinking, Gaiming,</hi> or <hi>gainful Vice:</hi> with which none of our Moraliſts have yet had the hardineſs to charge the Author; tho' they were pleaſed to urge, that he <hi>would not own his own Father at Oxford,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Hind</hi> or <hi>Peſant</hi>; ſuch as he was, he never wanted their Aſſiſtance to ſhew an honeſt Man; and the Author, as he often has done, does ſtill make it a Challenge to all Mankind, that ever he deny'd that he was the Parent of him, who now forgives the Calumny.</p>
            <p>I am not altogether unacquainted with the Characters, Practiſes, and Neceſſities, (poſſibly) of thoſe who have pretended to ridicule what I laſt deliver'd in <hi>Lombard-Street.</hi> It is an eaſie Matter to <hi>ſome People</hi> to deſpiſe what they can never attain to, without the Bleſſing of God. To talk to ſuch of <hi>Peace, Obedience, Continence,</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi> were to preach <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> or <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> to our <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who only believe, That
<q>Ludit in Humanis Divina Potentia rebus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe (to his Sorrow) he has found but too too many; when either he has publickly or privately Inſtructed otherwiſe. And yet his Inſtructions did never tend to Infallibility, what ever may have been objected to <hi>him</hi> in that Caſe, unleſs directed by happy Writ, and the undeniable Authority of the beſt Church of <hi>England-Men,</hi> and they very nicely too: Tho' (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) an unkind and perverſe Curioſity brought many to hear and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Doctrine, more than the Goſpel, that the Author thanks God, he truly Preach'd and Admiſter'd, which he is ſaid to know little or nothing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32663:2"/>
off; becauſe (happily) to ſome he has made it ſo obvious and open, that they cannot miſtake their Way to Eternal Happineſs, when it ſhall pleaſe God to let them ſee, that he dealt it fairly to them, notwithſtanding they have <hi>nil</hi> in Contempt for his <hi>Miniſtry</hi>; which is his Province, which is his Talent, which is his Fund and Hope of Salvation; and of which no Man can ſpoil him, ſo long as he ſpeaks according to the Word of God, and his own Conſcience; Alas! what imports a Mans Tranſitory Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! ſhall God's Miniſter for this, hazard his Eternal Happineſs? How weak you would think that Man, who ſhould ſell his Paternal, Unengag'd Inheritance, for one Year's purchaſe?</p>
            <p>Did I tell my Lord, that he Loſt more at a Horſe-Race in one Day, than would Relieve and Preſerve all the Poor in his Pariſh for a Month? That he threw away at Play (in one Night) more than would Feed 'em Seven: That he followed the Chaſe of a <hi>Deer,</hi> or a <hi>Fox,</hi> cloſer than he purchas'd the Means of his Salvation: And muſt I become his Enemy for telling him thoſe Truths? Muſt I be diſmiſt his Favour, and his Houſe, for this? In the Name of God, <hi>Amen. I had rather be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God, than dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar. But this comes of his Prating, perhaps you'l ſay; Yet, why ſhould he hold his Tongue or Pen? when the Poet tells you, who, (give me leave to ſay) had not altogether ſo particular a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if any, to remind you of your Vices,
<q>—Difficile eſt Satyram non Scribere.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore he, only to gratifie his own Humour, unknown to your Vices, might have the Liberty to Rail at you; may not the Author beg the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to Adviſe you? In good Truth, I think 'tis hard. But you have all the World before you, and might have Heaven too, if you would hear with his Ears, and ſee with his Eyes.</p>
            <p>Now, for the Authors circumſtances, and the Cauſe of his <hi>Farewel Sermon,</hi> Truly, for the firſt, I muſt needs ſay, that they are not altogether yet ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as to deſcend to the Entertainment of an unthinking Rabble, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear with their Eyes. For to ſuch, I hear, it's the Province of one of the Calumniators to Appeal to.</p>
            <p>Could the Author prevaricate, like him, he might hope a Preferment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe Sectaries, of whom the Calumniator already eſteems him a Miniſter, tho' himſelf in few years of one Monarchs Reign, obliged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged, canted and recanted: But every Man to his Trade, 'tis as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a Poet, as to a Stateſman or Mariner, to Tack as the Wind and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſhall ſerve him. But we are fix'd to our Centre, and have no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference but that of Heaven, of which only we diſcourſe, or at leaſt ought; to which we invite our ſometimes, nay, too often unwilling Gueſts. If the Author, out of his Zeal, has endeavoured to frighten any of his Friends, to that Bleſſed Place, to his own ſuppoſed preſent Loſs, by gaining their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, I hope, they will Pardon the Sufferer, as they think him: At what Rate would he not purchaſe Eternal Salvation to them! yet, to what Injuries or Neceſſities would they not expoſe him. Is this the Return of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32663:3"/>
a Chriſtian, of a Moral Man, of a Jew? No! certainly their <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> wou'd have allow'd him better Meaſure, and fairer Play. But no matter, ſince the great Author of all Bliſs, has not taken from him the Power or Will to aſſiſt theſe, or the very worſt of his Enemies. I ſay, <hi>theſe,</hi> becauſe the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loguiſt has as much pretence to the Authors Charity on any occaſion, which Heaven defend them both from: Thus far for the Authors Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>And, now the Cauſe is evident, the Author is become an Enemy to many who were counted his greateſt Friends, becauſe he <hi>Told them the Truth.</hi> And in this Cauſe he is reſolved to venture farther than he has hitherto done, when ever occaſion ſhall preſent: For, he will not omit his plain and friendly Exhortations, for the advantage of a Prelacy. No, not for an Arch-Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick: Therefore, if Friendſhip here on Earth be only to be made by obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious Adulation, he will endeavour to contract a better, and a more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſewhere: And, Heaven be Prais'd, he is not quite Deſerted; for he Preaches now to thoſe who will hear him with Devotion, and who will thankfully receive his friendly Admonition, and kind Reproof of their Faults.</p>
            <p>Here his Talent will not be loſt, but will return to himſelf and Auditors hereafter, an Hundred-Fold encreaſe; tho' he is forſaken by his Friends in <hi>Lombard-Street,</hi> his God has not forſaken him. His Heavenly Father has rais'd up Bretheren to him, true Sons of the Church of Chriſt, Modeſt, Humble, and Lowly of Spirit, who comes unfeignedly to hear of their Sins. A moſt certain Mark of a living Saint, which diſtinguiſhes him from the Froward and Ungodly, whoſe feſtring and putrifying Wounds of the Soul, cannot endure the Pool of good, ſound, ſearching Sermon. What? tho' it makes 'em ſmart a little, 'tis for their good; the more likelyhood there is of their being cur'd: He wou'd have 'em ſmart: He wou'd touch 'em to the Quick: It may prevent an Eternal Mortification of their Souls: But he cou'd wiſh a Mortification of their Sins were already began: He wou'd not plaſter up their Sores, before he had throughly cleans'd 'em: Nor beſmear or daub 'em over with the Oyl of ſmooth Words: No; He muſt apply Corroſives to eat up the Proud Fleſh, and Rancarous Venome that lurks at the very Bottom.</p>
            <p>I think, it is enough to convince any reaſonable Man of the Neceſſity that obliges every faithful Miniſter and Diſſenter of God's Word; to tell his Congregation of their ſecret and moſt beloved Sins; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Heaven's Vengeance on the impenitent, hardned, and perſevering Sinner: That, on the contrary, 'tis not their Buſineſs to ſooth and flatter Men into Eternal Damnation. But to ſpeak the Truth fearleſs, and to to ſtrip every Man's darling Sin ſtark naked, and laſh it before his Face: And this the Author, I thank God, has not omitted upon any Conſideration whatſoever: And this, this alone has gain'd him ſo many Enemies; whom that the Lord will pardon, and turn their Hearts, is the dayly Prayer of</p>
