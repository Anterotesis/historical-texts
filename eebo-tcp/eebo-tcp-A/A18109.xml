            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But whether <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>Contemplation,</hi> bee the thing, wherein mans chiefeſt happineſſe in this world doth conſiſt, hath beene a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8111:4"/>
queſtion of old, and is yet diſputed of on both ſides. To omit the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe our purpoſe is not to inſiſt long upon this point, (whoſe opinion nevertheleſſe if any deſire to know, let him read them upon the words of Chriſt unto <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> x.41, 42.) <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Philoſophers, that are for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,</hi> goe upon this ground: That the neerer every man comes unto God, by way of imitation, (as farre as by nature he is capable of it:) the more happy he is: that God doth enjoy himſelfe in the fruition and contemplation of his owne goodneſſe, infinitneſſe, eternitie, and the like; and not in, or by any thing exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that he doth cauſe, or produce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelfe. On the other ſide it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That man, naturally, is <hi>animal politicum</hi>; that is, borne and brought forth into the World, not every man for himſelfe only, but for the good of others alſo; and that it is one of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall principles of all publike-weales and ſocieties of men, that the publicke is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <pb n="3" facs="tcp:8111:4"/>
by every man, to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his owne private, whether profit, or happineſſe. Both which opinions may eaſily bee reconciled, if both be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged (as I thinke they muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:) in their ſeverall reſpects to be true. For certainely, if man bee abſolutely and barely by himſelfe conſidered, as a <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> creature, then <hi>Contemplation</hi>; if, as naturally <hi>ſociable,</hi> having relation to the World as a Citie, then <hi>Action</hi> is his end. <hi>Action</hi> then his end; yet, even then, not <hi>action,</hi> without all manner of <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For as we commonly ſay of the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> that ſome are <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> and ſome <hi>practicall</hi>; ſo is it of contemplation too: Some contemplation is meerely <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; and ſo it is oppoſed to <hi>Action</hi>: ſome may be termed (though there may ſeeme to bee ſome contradiction in the termes:) <hi>active,</hi> or <hi>practicall,</hi> becauſe it is the ground and foundation of all actions, that tend to happineſſe. For they are not all actions in generall, that make men happy; but ſuch onely, as are good and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8111:5"/>
vertuous. Which are ſuch, and which are contrarie, cannot bee knowne without the knowledge of good and evill. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this knowledge (in this ſtate of corruption:) to bee attained unto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſtudie and contemplation. And this, all Divines and Philoſophers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto, that it is not enough, that what wee doe bee laudible of it ſelfe, and as the Schoole men ſpeake, <hi>materially</hi> good; except wee know it to bee ſo, and doe it upon that ground. Then, and not till then, is our action, as it is ours, truely good and commendable. Hence it is, that in the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> (the great wonder of Nature:) a learned and well grounded Phyſician, though miſsing of his end, is more praiſe worthy, then an ignorant Empiricke that hath good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; becauſe, ſaith hee, in his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſickes, The one underſtands what hee doth, and goeth upon warrantable grounds, though the ignorance of ſome particular outward circumſtance may hinder the good event: The other doth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8111:5"/>
hee knoweth not what, nor upon what grounds, but altogether ventureth upon former experiments. Now experience, we know, is the miſtris, as of men, ſo of brutes too: which, though they be irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, yet are capable of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that comes by bare experience; and cannot therefore be the proper commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of thoſe creatures, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally rationall. So that what once a grave Senator (Plin. Sec. in <hi>Panegyr, ad Traja</hi>:) ſpake of one particular vertue, <hi>ambitio &amp; jactantia, &amp; effuſio, &amp; quidvis potiùs quàm liberalitas eſt dicenda, cui ratio non conſtat</hi>; that that liberalitie, that is not grounded upon reaſon, is rather am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, vaine glory, profuſeneſſe, or any thing elſe, what you will, then true libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie: is as true of any other particular vertue, and appliable to vertue, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; to wit, That Vertue is not Vertue properly, but as it is the frute and effect, of true knowledge and ſound reaſon. Which alſo made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to maintaine in his Ethicks (<hi>Lib.</hi> v. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.) that <hi>juſta facere</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:8111:6"/>
was no very hard thing, and incidentall unto all men; but <hi>juſtum eſſe,</hi> that is, to doe juſt actions, upon grounds of reaſon and no otherwiſe; to bee a matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great difficultie. For which reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Socrates</hi> before him maintained, that Truth and Vertue, were but one thing. And truely in the Scriptures, they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taken for one thing. Hence thoſe phraſes, <hi>To doe the Truth, To commit a lye,</hi> and the like. To which if it bee oppoſed, that <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> muſt needs differ as much as the will and the underſtanding, <hi>truth</hi> being the proper object of the one, and <hi>vertue</hi> of the other; it might eaſily, according to the authoritie of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and other great Philoſophers and Schoole men, be replied, That although the will and the underſtanding be not all one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, yet in matter of action, they come all to one; ſince that, as they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>voluntas neceſſariò determinatur ab intellectu,</hi> the will of man is wholly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and governed, by the motions and preſcripts of the underſtanding. Whence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8111:6"/>
is that of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſame <hi>Ethicks, lib.</hi> vi. that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that it is <hi>not poſsible, that he that is truely wiſe and prudent, ſhould bee naught</hi> or <hi>vicious:</hi> And that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>no man is evill, but through ignorance of that which is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> which is there and elſewhere at large diſcuſſed by him and prooved; as it is to this day maintained by many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute writers.</p>
            <p>But not to engage my ſelfe into theſe deepe myſteries of profoundeſt Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which may be thought perchance more abſtruſe then uſefull, and admit of variety of opinions; all that I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon theſe premiſes, which no man, I thinke, will deny, is but this; That <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> are of ſuch affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that without ſome more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie inſight (by vertue of knowledge and contemplation:) into the one, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot bee practiſed as it ſhould; either to afford that inward content and ſatisfaction to the conſcience, which is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8111:7"/>
the beſt reward of a vertuous life in this World; or to deſerve that commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from others, (though this bee leaſt of all to bee ſtood upon:) that otherwiſe would be due unto it.</p>
            <p>Now the knowledge of <hi>Truth</hi> being a matter of ſuch moment to happineſſe, as wee have ſaid; it is much to bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that the ſearch of it ſhould bee ſo difficult, as it is: ſo beſet with ſundry rubbes and impediments; ſo ſhadowed with many falſe colours and lineaments, as it is to bee feared, that many men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no ſmall paines and ſtudie to find out what Truth is; in ſtead of finding what might ſatisfie them concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Truth, begin to doubt whether there be any ſuch thing, <hi>in rerum natura</hi>; and by conſequent, whether any ſuch thing truely and really, as <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice:</hi> according to that miſerable complaint (though uttered by him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another occaſion:) of dying <hi>Brutus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8111:7"/>
carefully exerciſed thee as a thing true and reall; but now I ſee, that thou art meere words and wind.</hi> And in very truth if a man ſhall as it were from ſome higher place, raiſed with the wings of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall contemplation, as an indifferent judge, or but ſpectator, take a generall view of the ſurface of the earth; diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve and looke into the actions and endeavours of mortall men, hee ſhall cleerely ſee, that that which all ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men aime at, and moſt (even wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worldlings:) doe pretend unto, is truth: but that truth ſo generally profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both by the one and by the other, for truth, in ſome, (whoſe groſſe and earthly temperature is moſt uncapable of heavenly both thoughts and hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) to bee nothing elſe, but meere policie, and private ſecular intereſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (of a purer mould or metall, whoſe meaning is good and ſincere:) nothing elſe, in effect, but meere partialitie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, preſumption, reſolute obſtinacie, and the like; being all the fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8111:8"/>
of either blind ignorance (the more blind, the more confident, alwaies:) in too much heate, and eagerneſſe; (the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſtemper of moſt men:) or laſtly, (if not of all theſe together, yet of ſome one of them eſpecially:) of long uſe and cuſtome. Shewes, and colours, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and pretences of truth in great ſtore every where; reall and ſolid truth, hee ſhall ſee but little any where: and that too, in many places, either ſilenced, or forced by unjuſt violence into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>Vpon one of theſe impediments, that I have mentioned, I purpoſe at this time to fixe my contemplation; being one of the chiefeſt, (if I bee not much miſtaken my ſelfe:) of thoſe many things, that cauſe truth to bee miſtaken by men; and that is, <hi>Cuſtome.</hi>

               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">

or wrong, but by <hi>cuſtome</hi> and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men onely: or with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Beſides theſe and the like arguments, taken from the things themſelves, ſome thing may bee inferred even from the words, whereby thoſe things are uſually expreſſed. For words have uſually ſome foundation in the nature of things, and therefore (as wiſeſt men, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others, have thought:) in all diſputes of the true nature and uſe of things, much obſervable.

But this is not all that is to bee wondred at in this matter; but this alſo, that whileſt theſe boyes were ſo uſed, their parents and deareſt friends would looke upon them with joy and pleaſure, yea exhort them themſelves unto patience: <hi>adſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus parentibus &amp; propinquis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, &amp; uti perſeverent adhortantibus.</hi> The

               <p>In all theſe ſeverall generall inſtances, it is out of all queſtion, and all Authors that write of them are of that opinion, that <hi>Cuſtome</hi> and long practiſe, is to bee looked upon, as the onely cauſe. The uſe (which I mentioned before, and therefore will briefly ſet downe heere, though it be not the thing that I aime at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially:) that divers antient Fathers, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers &amp; others make of theſe and the like inſtances, is this: That thoſe great inſuperable difficulties, that men uſually pretend to meete with in the way that leades unto Vertue and godlineſſe, are rather vaine pretences and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in a thouſand places:) that is, <hi>meere want of courage and reſolution,</hi> then difficulties really hard and inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:

               </p>
               <p>Now in all theſe it is apparant, that <hi>cuſtome</hi> is rather <hi>ſupra naturam,</hi> then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra naturam,</hi> directly. We ſhall therefore in the next place conſider the power of it, even in thoſe things, wherein it is directly oppoſit unto Nature.

Wee read of one <hi>Iul.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8111:28"/>
ſo lived to be an old man without drinke. And <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſcimus,</hi> as of a thing commonly knowne and not doubted of by any. And <hi>Seneca</hi> as peremptorily, that <hi>aſsidua meditatione</hi> (that is, by <hi>cuſtome) quidam omni humore interdixere corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> And <hi>Lipſius</hi> there averreth, that even in our age, there have beene examples of ſuch abſolute forbearance, from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of drinke. Then for the <hi>ſenſes</hi>; what ſhall wee ſay to <hi>Appianus,</hi> who tels us of one <hi>Geta,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in the time of the Civill warres, being one of them that was marked and ſought after to death, to the end that hee might the better diſguiſe himſelfe, among other things counterfeited himſelfe to be blind of one eye, and wore I know not what over his concealed eye ſome yeares. And then his danger being over, when hee thought to have reſtored his long captive eye to his former libertie, hee found the eye there indeed, but the ſight was gone; and ſo continued blind of that eye to his dying day. And <hi>Appianus</hi> ſaith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8111:28"/>
that it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for want of uſe of his eye (that is, becauſe he did uſe himſelfe not to ſee with it) that he loſt it.</p>
               <p>But to leave particular inſtances; how much the ancients did attribute to the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi> upon the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> may appeare by that opinion which wee find in many of them, of the Muſicke of the Sphaeres, cauſed as they conceived, by their circumvolution; audible as they affirmed, but not heard, or rather not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, becauſe wee heard it alwayes. What good grounds they had for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, is not to my purpoſe to enquire at this time. I dare not ſay that Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> was of that opinion; but that he did not thinke there was any impietie in it, may appeare by his Preface upon the <hi>Pſalmes.</hi> But Saint <hi>Anſelme</hi> plainely, <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem coeleſtes orbes cum dulciſona Harmonia volvuntur, ac ſuaviſsimi concentus eorum circuitione efficiuntur, &amp;c. de Imagin. mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</hi> But that which from that opinion is here pertinent to my diſcourſe, is, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8111:29"/>
they that maintained it, were alſo, moſt of them, of opinion, that the reaſon why wee did not heare it, was meerely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe our eares were <hi>accuſtomed</hi> unto it, as you ſhall find expreſly in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racledus Ponticus,</hi> in his <hi>Homericall Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.</hi> In <hi>Ariſtotle de Coelo.</hi> ii.9. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Tullie</hi> alſo aimed at the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his <hi>Somn. Scipion.</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Hoc ſonitu oppletae aures obſurduerunt</hi>: though his next words adſcribe it rather to <hi>magnitudini ſonitus,</hi> then <hi>conſuetudini</hi>; which would import a totall deſtruction of the ſenſe; and not a deficiencie of it to one particular object onely. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is another conſideration, but appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly falſe; ſince that upon that ground, all hearing would be quite taken away; as <hi>Plinie</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory, Seneca</hi> in his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Queſtions</hi> expreſly affirme of thoſe inhabitants about <hi>Nilus,</hi> that hee ſpeakes of there; to wit that they are quite deafe. I know there are others yet, that have maintained this coeleſtiall Harmonie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other grounds. <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> ſaith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8111:29"/>
that it is not audible (to us men, that is:) that it doth not reach unto the eares; and the reaſon why God would not have it audible hee ſaith, is, leſt men raviſhed with the ſweetneſſe of it, ſhould give over all care and thought of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires. Yet for the moſt, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, that they grounded, if not their opinions, yet their anſwers to uſuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it, upon the power of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> let Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> tell them that ſhall make any queſtion of it; Whoſe words are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>But when they that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this opinion are required to make it good by ſome ſenſible evidence, what ſay they? Why, this they ſay; that our eares being uſed to this noiſe from our firſt entrance into the world, through this long uſe and cuſtome from the beginning they have loſt the ſenſe of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8111:30"/>
it.

               <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice at this time concerning the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi> in things naturall; hiſtorically. Now, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically, and ſpeculatively, wee thus proceede.</p>

For what is Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but the Order of God? If that bee mutable and violable; then is no more this World <hi>a</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; or orderly peece, but a maſſe of confuſion; and that is it, that the Atheiſts, and the oppoſers of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would have. Neither can there be any truth properly in thoſe things, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereof is altogether uncertaine; therefore uncertain, becauſe unconſtant. And where there is no Truth, there can bee no knowledge. As to the World therefore, confuſion; ſo to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ignorance, from this uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and inconſtancie muſt neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. As for Miracles, though above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet are they not properly againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince they are his proper worke, who is the Author of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore originally, and ſutably to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did reſerve unto himſelfe a power to diſpenſe with his owne lawes when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8111:32"/>
hee thought fit. All Gods workes of themſelves, and in regard of God, are equally naturall, though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of us.</p>
               <p>Wee ſay therefore that <hi>cuſtome</hi> is not alwayes to be conſidered as oppoſit unto Nature, ſince it is the nature of ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things, to bee altered by <hi>cuſtome.</hi> And when <hi>cuſtome</hi> hath once through continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance naturalized her ſelfe into any of them, then <hi>cuſtome</hi> (to ſpeake properly:) is no more <hi>cuſtome,</hi> but Nature: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of old <hi>Evenus</hi> in <hi>Ariſt. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>cuſtome is a kind of adventitious,</hi> or, <hi>adſcititious nature.</hi> Neither is <hi>cuſtome,</hi> when it is once become naturall, though adventitious, leſſe naturall in regard of the common Nature of the Vniverſe, from which at firſt it received the power <pb n="62" facs="tcp:8111:33"/>
and proprietie, to turne, in time, into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then that originall nature: though in regard of the particular ſubject, that it hath wrought upon, it bee but adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. When therefore it is commonly ſaid, that ſuch or ſuch a thing <hi>hath loſt its nature</hi>; it muſt bee underſtood of that particular nature and proprietie which it had at the firſt; not abſolutely, as though it had departed from the law of Nature in generall; ſince that Nature it ſelfe hath made it ſo alterable. As of death wee ſay vulgarly, that it is <hi>againſt nature</hi>; though it bee as properly, and truely the worke of Nature, as birth or generation is; and as naturall to the nature of the Vniverſe. And ſo is that true of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (which wee have ſpoken before:) that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Nature cannot bee driven away,</hi> being underſtood of Vniverſall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gallen,</hi> a great admirer of Nature, and much to bee admired himſelfe, for his painefull travels in the ſearch of it, hath another way to reduce <hi>cuſtome</hi> unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8111:33"/>
His opinion is, that any mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may bee known, or at leſt, probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſt at, by thoſe things that he is uſed unto. And therefore prefers thoſe Phycſii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that allow unto their patients what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they have been uſed to, though co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to art; before them who keepe them ſtrictly to the generall preſcripts without reſpect to their proper conſtitution: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſaith hee, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, <hi>Moſt men that uſe themſelves to any thing, whatſoever it bee, they muſt be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pitch upon ſuch things, as are moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their owne Nature; for that finding hurt by thoſe things that are contrary unto it, they are forced to forbeare them ſpeedily.</hi> Yea plainely, that none can <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, long continue in an evill <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> contrary to their proper conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who are not extremely madde and ſenſeleſſe. By this, <hi>cuſtome</hi> and Nature ſhould bee all one: or at leaſt <hi>cuſtome</hi> for the moſt part, nothing elſe but the fruits
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8111:34"/>
and effects of originall Nature. For my part I ſhould eaſily grant that any mans preſent conſtitution (which you may call his Nature, for the time, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly:) may not unlikely bee judged of, by thoſe things that are <hi>cuſtomarie</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. But that a mans originall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conſtitution (which is it that <hi>Gallen</hi> there ſpeakes of:) may ſo bee knowne, except we ſhall extend <hi>madneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſenſleſneſſe</hi> very far, common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will diſproove. For what general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more naturall unto all men, then tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and ſobrietie? And what more generally practiſed in the World, among all ſorts of men, then exceſſe, and ryot, and intemperance, in ſome one kind or other, if not in all? But by the way; If in the judgement of <hi>Gallen</hi> a heathen, all ſuch are to be reputed as <hi>mad men,</hi> becauſe they reſpect their health and corporall welfare no more; what would hee have ſaid of them, had hee beene a Chriſtian, for their wilfull caſting away of their ſoules (ſo much more precious then the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8111:34"/>
body, by how much Heaven doth excell the earth:) by the ſaid courſes? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>madneſſe</hi> is a far more generall evill, then moſt men thinke. But this, by the way onely. When Phyloſophers diſpute (as many doe:) whether Nature or edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that is, <hi>cuſtome,</hi> be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to frame and faſhion a mans life; it would be but an abſurd queſtion, ſcarce fit to be propoſed by any ſober man, much more unfit to bee ſo ſeriouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of by learned Philoſophers, if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and <hi>cuſtome</hi> in this ſenſe come all to one.

So through <hi>cuſtome</hi> a man may bring himſelfe to an habite of intemperance, that it ſhall not bee in his power, nor ſafe for his body, perchance to returne unto ſobrietie. Yet neither is it at firſt without danger (it is death unto many to attempt it:) and (if <hi>Gallen</hi> may be credited:) it is a great chance, if at the laſt (though the inconvenience of it bee not preſently perceived:) it doe not proove ſome way or other pernicious. What, if ſome intemperate men attaine to 60. or 80? They may thank the ſtrength

of their nature for it, which bad <hi>cuſtome</hi> could no ſooner overthrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had they beene ſober men, it is more then likely, their life how long ſoever, might have beene longer by 20. yeares at leſt. So, a man through continuall labour and induſtrie may doe much in the purſuite of ſome art or ſcience; yet if hee have not a <hi>genius</hi> to it, a naturall aptitude and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he ſhall never attaine (be his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour never ſo great:) to any great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: whereas leſſe labour in a way more ſutable to his nature, might have made him excellent.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8111:39"/>
and without it they thinke all labour is loſt. So ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi> too: <hi>Inclinandum quò te vis ingenii defert.

Nevertheleſſe, their admonitions, I acknowledge, are to good purpoſe, that Parents and Maſters ſhould carefully obſerve the naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of youths, before they deſigne them to any particular profeſsion. This for the moſt part is the ſafeſt way. That's enough, though we ſay no more.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, beſides, in many things, when a man hath done all that art can, and induſtrie; yet cannot he bee ſecure, but that nature Originall may returne and ſhew her ſelfe upon the ſuddaine; and that to his coſt, as it may proove. As for example, wee read of divers, that have taken great paines to tame wild beaſts, that they might uſe them as familiarly, as

wee doe commonly thoſe, which are tame by nature. And we read withall of divers who have found by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that forced nature is of thoſe things, which by a wiſe man may not be truſted. Witneſſe hee of whom <hi>Martiall</hi> ſpeakes, ii.75.

Let this long ſleepe goe, as well it may, for a fabulous thing: the effects of it, I am ſure; (his amazement, I meane) might have beene credible enough, though the ſleepe had beene ſhorter by many yeares. In ſome Countries (for all Countries are not equally light and phantaſticke; and they are happy Countries, that are leſt:) if men ſhould but put on thoſe clothes that they left of but foure or five yeares agoe, and uſe thoſe faſhions that then were in uſe, they would ſeeme, even unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ridiculous; and unto many, little leſſe then monſtrous.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this <hi>varietie</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, as unto the Naturaliſts, matter of ſpeculation, how even herein nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in <hi>varietie;</hi> ſo unto the Divine, matter of indignation, to ſee the vanitie of mortall men, who for the moſt part ſpend themſelves wholly, their wits and their lives, upon things ſo tranſitorie;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8111:43"/>
and ſpend little or no time at all, upon the onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, (as both Philoſophers and the Scriptures are wont to ſpeake:) <hi>God,</hi> that is, and his ſervice, and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his <hi>Truth</hi>; which are the onely things that are permanent, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of exiſtence in this World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commended unto us by Chriſt, as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of all our many cares and buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in this World; the <hi>one</hi> only thing that is profitable &amp; neceſſary. But to forbeare that which I find already done by divers Divines, Naturaliſts, and others fully and ſufficiently: I ſhall here onely obſerve the power and providence of Almightie God, who as hee can out of darkeneſſe bring forth light, ſo can turne theſe wretched effects (in themſelves:) of mans frailtie and corruption, to be the meanes, in part, of his happineſſe. I ſay therefore, that what in the Heavens, the Sunne and the Moone, divers Starres and Planets are, for the naturall diviſion of times, <hi>to divide the day from the night,</hi> to <hi>be for ſignes and for ſeaſons, and for dayes, and for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8111:43"/>
yeares, Gen.</hi> i.14. without which diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of times and ſeaſons, there would bee no living in this World: ſo <hi>varietie</hi> of faſhions and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> ſerve unto man for the Civill or politicke diſtinction of the ſeverall times and ages of the World, without which there would be little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, and little or no truth amongſt men. By <hi>varietie</hi> of <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> I here underſtand alſo <hi>varietie</hi> of langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and dialects, and words, (all which depend of <hi>cuſtome</hi> as much, if not more then any other thing of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; as elſewhere ſhall be ſhewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) as conducing to the knowledge of the Truth in this World, no leſſe then <hi>varietie</hi> of manners. Now to make this good that I have ſaid, I muſt firſt of all ſuppoſe, which I thinke no man will deny, that by bookes eſpecially wee come to the knowledge of Truth. Of truth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, by bookes eſpecially; in ſome peculiar objects of Truth, as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Hiſtorie wee have them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to truſt to. And in matter of bookes,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8111:44"/>
the Authors of the bookes, and the times when the Authors lived, is mainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. For accordingly doe wee give credite (eſpecially in point of Hiſtorie and truth of religion:) to the Bookes themſelves, more or leſſe, for the moſt part. In many things, this alone, to know the Author of the booke, is enough to decide many controverſies. But what if the Title deceive us, and ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of ſome idle braine of our age, repreſent it ſelfe unto us upon the ſtage under the gray haires of authenticke antiquitie? Have there not beene ſuch impoſtors at all times, who have attempted (would I could ſay, they have attempted it onely:) to abuſe the World with ſuppoſititious Titles and Names? What profeſsion ſo ſacred, or ſo vulgar, that hath not ſuffered in all ages, by this kind of men? Divines, Lawyers, Phiſicians, Philoſophers, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, have in all ages complained of them: and in thoſe ages, when by reaſon of the ignorance of the times, men have not beene able to diſcover them, what er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8111:44"/>
and abſurdities, both in matter of knowledge and practiſe, both in the Church and in the Commonwealth, have enſued thereupon, to thoſe that are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is not unknowne, I am ſure; and I may not ſo far digreſſe at this time, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the ignorant. Of all noble Impoſtors in this kind, I will inſtance but in one. <hi>Annius Viterbienſis,</hi> a Monke by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who lived ſome two hundred yeares agoe, having attained to more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary knowledge both of the tongues and Hiſtories, applyed himſelfe by his knowledge and proficiencie, not to helpe, but to cheat the World. To that end hee counterfeited divers ancient Hiſtorians of beſt note and greateſt antiquitie, as <hi>Beroſus, Manetho, Catonis Origines,</hi> and the like, which had not beene heard of in many ages; and wrote Comments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, himſelfe being both Text and Comment, that the World might have the leſſe occaſion to ſuſpect his fraud: and paſſed ſo current for a long time, that even to this day (though followed and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8111:45"/>
diſcryed by divers learned men of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and profeſsions:) many can ſcarce perſwade themſelves, that ſo many fine Titles and ſhewes, ſhould be but a piece of juggling. Now what ſhamefull errors and miſtakes in point of Hiſtory both Eccleſiaſticall and Civill, they that have truſted unto him have beene led into by this jugglor, any man may imagine, and many have written of it.</p>
               <p>Now the ordinary and ſureſt way ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to find out a counterfeit Author in this kind, is by his ſtyle, and by an accurate examination of thoſe particular faſhions, and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> that he doth either <hi>obiter,</hi> (which can hardly bee avoyded in any booke of what ſubject ſoever it be:) or purpoſely ſpeake of, how well they fit and ſute to the time and place that is pretended. Take away theſe two <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of words and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> and it will bee a hard taske for any man to diſcover and evict the ſuppoſititiouſnes of any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Hence it is, that in the Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſtament, by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8111:45"/>
Gods great providence all things (for the moſt part:) bee ſo punctually ſet downe with all kind of circumſtances at large; which though illiterate men perchance paſſe over by reaſon of their ignorance, yet men of learning, to whom the ſtate of the World from the beginning with the ſeverall periods, alterations, and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of it (as farre as it can be knowne by ancient bookes and Records:) is not unknowne, receive marveilous ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them, both for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their faith, and the greater contentment of their minds. For this cauſe men of judgement, that would gladly make uſe of their owne eyes to ſee the way that leades unto truth, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to depend from the abilitie both and fidelitie of others, have taken ſo much paines about words; as alſo to bee well verſt in the rites and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> of all ages and places. Neither can it be denyed by men of underſtanding, but that this way of ſtudie hath beene, next under
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8111:46"/>
God, the chiefeſt meanes of this bleſſed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or new birth of learning, which begun not much above a hundred yeares agoe. And I muſt confeſſe, I have wondred with my ſelfe ſometimes, that this kind of learning being come to that heighth or perfection as it is in our dayes, no man hath yet laboured for the eaſe of others, to reduce it to ſome certaine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and rules of art, as it were; as by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe the proper words and rites of every age and place, whereby they are diſcernable from another; by the help whereof, even men of ordinary learning might give a good gueſſe at the age of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Author that they have occaſion to uſe, nor be altogether ſo lyable to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures or falſaries, as they are. Which certainely is feaſable enough, if not to perfection, yet to a good degree of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke utilitie. But on the other ſide, when I call to mind, that Impoſtors would bee the firſt that would make uſe of this art, to make their forgeries the more paſſable
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8111:46"/>
(as certainely they would:) then I thinke it very happy, that it is not, neither of it ſelfe more eaſie to attaine unto, nor made more common by the labour of others, then it is.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid of the knowledge of old <hi>cuſtomes</hi> and the uſe thereof, in matter of bookes, is as true in matter of old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and evidences of what kind ſoever. True it is, that nothing ſhould bee more ſacred and inviolable amongſt men, then publicke inſtruments, and evidences, whoſe onely end and uſe, is, to be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto the truth, and to protect it from her many enemies, as malice, favour, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie, and the like. Yet how rightly <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nihil eſſe tam ſacrum quod ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegum non inveniat,</hi> may appeare even in this particular. For it is well knowne, that even of old, many evidences have beene forged to abuſe the World withall: and that ſometimes, not by one or two ſecretly combining, but even by many unanimouſly conſpiring together, againſt the Truth. For example, I find that about
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8111:47"/>
ſome foure hundred yeares agoe, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth being then Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Saint <hi>Edmond,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> the Monkes of <hi>Canterburie</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to have counterfeited, or adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a certaine Charter of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> by which they claimed certaine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. For which abominable fact and other enormities, that worthy pious Prelate intended great and ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the whole Convent. But they having made <hi>Otho</hi> the Popes Legate and <hi>Edmunds</hi> great enemy, their friend, prevailed with the Pope, that the cauſe might bee referred to the ſaid <hi>Otho:</hi> And in concluſion, but three of the whole Convent were found guiltie by <hi>Otho.</hi> And upon this favourable information, and friendly mediation withall of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, the Pope ſent a diſpenſation unto the Monaſterie, by which hee did acquit them both from preſent further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and from future deſerved infamie for ſuch an infamous Act. Even thoſe three that were found guilty, it was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8111:47"/>
judged they had done it <hi>in Spiritu ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatis</hi> (ſo runnes the Diſpenſation:) and for this their ſimplicitie, forſooth, they were, not exiled, but confined to certaine places to doe penance. No wonder if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have made bold in that kind ſince, if the imputation of <hi>ſimplicitie</hi> was the worſt that would come of it. <hi>Simplicitas digna favore fuit,</hi> ſaith one of the old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. If wee looke backe unto better and purer ages, wee ſhall not find I am ſure that <hi>Simplicitie,</hi> was ever objected unto any as a crime; but in Monckes eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that once it was thought their chiefeſt commendation, I find in many Fathers. But ſince it is as it is, wee may thanke God, that evidences and old writings as well as other things, have had their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>cuſtomes</hi> in almoſt all ages; by the knowledge and conſideration whereof the true for the moſt part, (if the Impoſtor hath not beene very cunning:) may bee eaſily knowne from the counterfeit. For not to ſpeake here either of the words themſelves or forme of writing, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8111:48"/>
of orthographie, as well conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in theſe, as in bookes; beſides theſe, there are divers other things, that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable. There have beene times, when Seales have beene in uſe, and times when they were not: when ſuch and ſuch ſeales, and ſuch and ſuch dates; when ſuch and ſuch ſubſcriptions, and ſuperſcriptions; and ſundry ſuch particulars; much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one from another all of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeverall times and places. Thoſe therefore take a very good courſe, who when they have occaſion to ſet out any ancient Records and evidences, keepe to their originals in all points, as neere as may be, to give the better ſatisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the learned: which is the courſe I ſee (and am heartily glad to ſee it:) that Sir <hi>Henrie Spilman</hi> Knight, that learned and painefull Antiquarie, does take in the publication of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Synods; which (for the good and honour of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church:) he is now about. For in very truth, a very ſmall alteration, is enough ſometimes to make a true Record
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8111:48"/>
ſuſpected. As for example; That thoſe ſmall Arithmeticall figures (which wee had from the <hi>Maures</hi> or <hi>Arabs,</hi> as they from the <hi>Indians</hi>:) have not beene knowne or in uſe amongſt us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſcarce yet foure hundred yeares, hath beeene obſerved by men perfectly well verſed in the knowledge, both of ancient times and writings. They were much to blame therefore, who ſetting out ſome writings of above ſeven hundred yeares antiquitie, and profeſsing to follow the Originalls very exactly and punctually in all circumſtances of writing; made no ſcrupule in lieu of thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> figures then in uſe, to put theſe ſmall ones ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, which certainely they found not in thoſe Originals.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Manuſcript, where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation that I have ſpoken of concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the falſarie Monkes, is regiſtred; I remember to have read a ſtrange Note, (ſo it ſeemed unto me:) concerning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charters and evidences, when they firſt began to bee in uſe in this Countrey:

which Note becauſe it is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (in caſe it ſhould proove true:) for the better conviction of many ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious Charters, pretended to be of great antiquitie, I will here ſet it downe as it is there to be ſeene.</p>

               <p>So much of the good that comes unto the World, from this <hi>varietie</hi> of faſhions and <hi>cuſtomes</hi>; the wretched effects, in themſelves, and the meanes withall, (in this age eſpecially:) of mans <hi>vanitie</hi> and miſerie.

But whatſoever the uſe of this kind of knowledge be, I thinke there is not (I ſpeake it for the further incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8111:50"/>
of them that will take paines in this kind:) any kind of knowledge that can afford more content and pleaſure to an ingenuous mind.

Hence it is, that Antiquaries are ſo taken with the ſight of old things; not as doting (as I take it:) upon the bare either forme or matter (though both oftentimes be very notable in old things:) but becauſe thoſe viſible
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8111:51"/>
ſuperviving evidences of antiquitie repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto their minds former times, with as ſtrong an impreſsion, as if they were actually preſent, and in ſight as it were: even as old men looke gladly upon thoſe things, that they were wont to ſee, or have beene otherwiſe uſed unto in their younger yeares, as injoying thoſe yeares againe in ſome ſort, in thoſe viſible and palpable remembrances. As for thoſe men that have not this knowledge, though they be told that ſuch things bee ancient, yet for want of that knowledge and judgement, which might ſatisfie them, that they are ſo in very deed; and becauſe happily, they know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of former ages, the preſent repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation whereof, occaſioned by thoſe ancient evidences might affect their minds; it is no wonder if the ſight of ſuch things, be unto them as either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing colours to the blind, or ſweete Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to the deafe.</p>

Sextus Empiricus, <hi>Pyrr. hypot.</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus <hi>de Mor. gentium,</hi> in Stobaeus; not to mention any more. Certainely ſhould wee take all nations of the World (ſuch as have beene accounted moralized and civilized nations, I meane; the wild and barbarous being laid aſide:) into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, wee may generally conclude, that there is ſcarce any vertue ſo much in requeſt in one place, but will be found to bee a vice in another; ſcarce any vice ſo much abhorred at one time in one place, but at another time hath beene thought in the ſame place if not a vertue, yet no unlawfull thing. Thoſe Authors that I have but now mentioned, ſhall bee my warrant for what I have ſaid, if any will not take it upon my credit. But in point of right and wrong, wee need not to goe ſo farre, to fetch our inſtances; neerer times and places unto our ſelves, and ſuch as wee in many reſpects are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

acquainted with, will afford us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inſtances. The Civill Law of the Romans, if any Law, might bee thought to be grounded upon reaſon, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Authors of it, men of great worth and fame for their learning; and of the credit that it hath found with moſt nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> even to this day. That law thought it good reaſon to give abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power unto fathers upon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, power even of life and death, as long as they lived, except by volutary <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipation,</hi> or otherwiſe they had made them free.

               <p>Firſt in that moſt of theſe differences and alterations have their beginning from <hi>cuſtome,</hi> which by continuance doth not onely get the ſtrength of Law, and goes for Law in all places; but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begets <hi>Lawes,</hi> properly ſo called.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8111:56"/>
For that is the originall of moſt <hi>Lawes</hi> in moſt places. And it was both a witty and a true ſpeech of him that firſt (as I find in <hi>Suidas</hi> and others:) defined <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> to bee nothing elſe, but <gap reason="foreign">

And thoſe Lawes that are thus grounded upon <hi>cuſtome,</hi> are thought by many as the moſt acceptable, ſo the moſt naturall and obligatorie Lawes that are: as being not the invention of any one ſingle man, but of long Time and experience. <hi>Dio Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomus</hi> is very rethoricall upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and more rethoricall then ſound ſometimes; as when hee ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

whether commanded unto us by Lawes, or recommended by <hi>cuſtome.</hi> But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is no new thing for any Kingdome to bee governed by <hi>cuſtome</hi>: and of the two it may generally be ſaid, that <hi>cuſtomes</hi> were, before written Lawes, if not in all, yet in moſt Kingdomes. Which I obſerve the rather, becauſe ſome learned men I ſee, are of opinion that <hi>jus conſuetudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> and <hi>conſuetudo</hi> in point of Law, are phraſes of latter ages onely; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>England,</hi> not knowne or uſed till after the conqueſt of the <hi>Normans.</hi> But certainely <hi>jus conſuetudinarium,</hi> whether wee looke upon the word or thing, is of greater antiquitie then ſo.

Now that men generally thinke beſt of their owne faſhions and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> be they never ſo contrary, <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth ſhew, by relating a triall that <hi>Darius</hi> made of it, to ſatisfie himſelfe, which was this: The Indians, thoſe that were properly called <hi>Calatians,</hi> had a <hi>cuſtome</hi> to eat their Parents and friends after their deaths; whereas the Graecians did uſe to burne them: both theſe being equally contrary to the <hi>Perſians</hi>; who of the two proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, would ſooneſt have beene perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to eate their dead, then to burne them, which could not bee without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning that which they accounted moſt holy, to wit, fire. <hi>Darius</hi> therefore, firſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8111:60"/>
ſends for ſome Graecians, and asked them by themſelves what they would take (and he was well able to give it, though they had asked many thouſands,) to eat their Parents when they ſhould bee dead. They anſwered, they would not doe it for the wealth of the World. Then hee ſent for thoſe Indians, and propoſed unto them likewiſe upon what terme they would bee content to burne theirs. The very mooving whereof offended them ſo much, and ſeemed ſo prodigious, that in ſtead of an anſwer, they humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought, he would forbeare ſuch horrible ſpeeches unto them: and ſo were diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

               <p>This of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> puts mee in mind of a ſtrange <hi>cuſtome</hi> once practized, and in great requeſt among the great ones of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> which was this: If a Prince dyed out of his Countrey, they would chop his body in ſeverall pieces, and boyle them in a kettle or ſome ſuch veſſell till
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8111:61"/>
all the fleſh came from the bones; and ſo ſend his bare bones to bee buried in his owne Countrey. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the eight, ſpeaking of it, cals it, <hi>deteſtandae feritatis abuſum, morem horribilem, Deo abominabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, hominibus abhorrendum, immanem, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium, crudelem, &amp;c.</hi> and if it were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a man might wonder how Princes and Great men of that age came to bee ſo farre in love with it, as to take order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand (as we read of divers; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of one of our <hi>Edwards,</hi> King of England, in Froiſſard:) in their life time, that they might bee ſo uſed after their death: but that the ſame <hi>Bonifacius</hi> tels us plainely, that it was, <hi>vitio conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> that they were bewitcht to that mind and opinion of theirs.

on the other ſide, that which reaſon and nature of themſelves are againſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come if not laudible, yet allowable, and juſtifiable ſometimes: that is in effect, whether right and wrong are by <hi>nature</hi> truely, and ſo abſolutely immutable and invariable; or otherwiſe.

               <p>Firſt, That as there is nothing truly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, that is not in ſome ſort <hi>rationall</hi> (if not as capable of reaſon, yet as the effect of <hi>reaſon, in ſummo gradu;</hi> that is, God; and ſo rationall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Soe there is nothing true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>rationall,</hi> that is not as truely naturall, both in regard of God, the eternall and infinite cauſe of all things; and in regard of men, whom God by nature hath made rationall. Whatſoever therefore is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon reaſon, is truely and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall. And ſo is the morall Law, which treates of humane vertues, and vices: and therefore altogether and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably naturall.</p>
               <p>Theſe words <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>naturall,</hi> are moſt ſhamefully miſtaken and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8111:62"/>
by ſome Chriſtians that have treated of this ſubject, to wit, concerning <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and vices naturall</hi>; which have made them to fall into deteſtable opinions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch as Civill Heathens themſelves would have abhorred in other heathens.

So that by him if a man cut his fathers throat, or rip his owne mother, as <hi>Nero</hi> did, and ſleepe not a whit the worſe, nor have the worſe ſtomacke to his meate for it, hee doth not <hi>crimen contra naturam committere.</hi> And this is that <hi>Natura,</hi> which in another place hee cals them <hi>prudentes</hi> that obey, notwithſtanding any lawes to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8111:63"/>
as it is common (though in this ſenſe the word <hi>Law,</hi> is not ſo proper neither:) to all naturall creatures; and another thing to diſpute of that Law, which is naturall unto man properly, who by nature is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall. Iuſt ſo ſome Heathen Nations of old, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates, thought they might lye together in their temples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw that birds, and other dumbe creatures, that were kept in them for ſacrifices, did it freely; whence they inferred that it was not unnaturall, and therefore not diſpleaſing to their Gods; and the reaſon of this their inference, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> gives, <gap reason="foreign">

is common to unreaſonable creatures as well as to reaſonable, they muſt needs leade a brutiſh life. I hope I may ſay without offence, that the ancient Stoicks were farre better Chriſtians then ſo, who maintaining that mans happineſſe did conſiſt, in a life <hi>according to Nature,</hi> have written ſo many accurat tracts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to proove that all vertues (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them <hi>pudor, verecundia, honeſtas</hi>; which this <hi>Hunterus</hi> doth moſt falſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unto Nature:) are naturall unto man.

               <p>Secondly, Whatſover commeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of reaſon, properly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing as properly to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it muſt needs follow, that the law

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8111:65"/>
us men, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Some part of that law which is by nature, is naturally mutable: and ſome part of it, is not.</hi> Where firſt it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> doth diſtinguiſh betweene <hi>Iura na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalia,</hi> as not being all (in regard of men:) of one nature. And ſo farre we follow <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For it is well obſerved by <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> that there are ſome <hi>Iura naturalia,</hi> which may be called <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalia,</hi> or <hi>principalia</hi>; becauſe evident of themſelves unto humane reaſon. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as it were <hi>ſecundaria,</hi> becauſe not ſo apparant unto man, but <hi>elicible,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable from thoſe fundamentals by humane ratiocination. The former I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are they that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have immutable, but the latter not ſo. Some interpret <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as though hee had meant no more then this, that <hi>de facto</hi> ſome <hi>Iura naturalia</hi> are changed or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated among men; though <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ ſuâ,</hi> immutable; becauſe of thoſe words of his, <hi>though happily in regard of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8111:65"/>
Gods themſelves immutable.</hi> But that this could not bee his meaning, may appeare, firſt, becauſe hee ſaith, ſome onely are mutable, not all. Whereas there bee no <hi>jura fundamentalia,</hi> but <hi>de facto</hi> are viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not onely by particular men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by whole nations, as may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to them, that ſhall peruſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whom wee have before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Secondly, by that inſtance that hee brings of things naturall, wherein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelfe, ſeemes to be unconſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ſelfe. The right hand, ſaith hee, is by nature the ſtrongeſt, and ſo it is in moſt men; yet in ſome it is not ſo. But more of his meaning, by and by.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Naturall reaſon being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the fall of man, much impaired and vitiated, it is no wonder if all men <hi>reaſonable</hi> by nature, doe not now agree upon the <hi>Iura naturalia;</hi> and it ought to bee ſufficient unto any <hi>reaſonable</hi> man, to ſatisfie him, that thoſe <hi>jura</hi> that are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are truely <hi>naturalia,</hi> that moſt men and nations (though not all:) that are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8111:66"/>
both by their practice, and their opinions, determine them to be ſo.</p>
               <p>As for example, Some nations (civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in other things it cannot be denyed:) allowed of theft, ſome of adultery, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; ſome made no ſcrupule of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt; what then? Moſt other nations have condemned them for it; and abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from theſe themſelves, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nature. That is enough to ſhew that they were things againſt nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and enough to make any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable in the eyes of God, that makes any queſtion of it. The extravagancie of ſome men, upon this ſubject, makes mee the more earneſt herein. For whereas in reaſon, what is allowed by the moſt, ſhould bee adſcribed unto nature; and that which by ſome is practiſed to the contrary, to the corruption of nature partly; (which <hi>Muſonius</hi> the Stoick, in <hi>Stobaeus</hi> cals, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:) and partly to the power of long <hi>cuſtome (tanta eſt corruptela malae conſuetudinis ut ab eâ tanquam igniculi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguantur

                     </expan> &amp; confirmentur contraria vitia,</hi> as <hi>Tullie</hi> very well in a place:) Some goe a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe. What they find practiſed by ſome, they take to bee naturall; and the contrary, though there be a <hi>major</hi> part for it, they adſcribe unto the power of <hi>cuſtome.</hi> Inceſt is a thing that true nature doth abhorre as much as any thing; and as many good reaſons, I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, may bee given to proove the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſſe of it, as for any thing that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acknowledged moſt unnaturall. And if we may beleeve ſome ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, men of no ſmall authoritie in the world, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the brutes, ſome of the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous abhorre it naturally. Yet an outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh writer of Eſſayes in his long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of cuſtome would perſwade us that all difference and ſcrupuluſnes in this kind proceeds rather from <hi>cuſtome,</hi> then nature; bringing this among many other particulars, as an argument of the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi> among men. Many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8111:67"/>
Heathen Philoſophers, I muſt needs ſay, ſhewed themſelves farre wiſer men, who though they had no certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (as they could not without revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) of the fall of man; yet from this very thing, becauſe they ſaw many men every where, yea ſome whole nations, make no conſcience at all of ſome things which they ſaw by the eye of reaſon were certainely againſt nature, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that of certainty, the naturall reaſon and underſtanding of man, had had a fall; though how or when, they could not tell. Many pregnant paſſages out of <hi>Plato, Plutarch, Hierocles, Plotinus, Proclus,</hi> and others might bee produced heere to that purpoſe, if need were, and had not already upon other occaſions beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and treated of, (all, or moſt of them:) by others: And all of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that in man himſelfe is the cauſe of this his fall, or blindneſſe of his underſtanding, not in him that made him. <hi>Even hee that erreth</hi> (in matter of life and practiſe:) <hi>againſt his will, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8111:67"/>
in that hee diſagreeth from the nature of the Vniverſe, <gap reason="foreign">

For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had furniſht him at firſt with certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, prenotions and opportunities, by the helpe whereof hee might have attained to the knowledge of truth: which having neglected, hence it is that hee is now not able to diſcerne that which is falſe from that which is true:</hi> ſaith another, (a Heathen too:) not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any of thoſe, whom I have named.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As in things naturall, ſome things to ſerve the nature of the vniverſe, forget and forgoe ſometimes their owne particular nature; and are never more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in a generall ſenſe, then when they are ſo unnaturall unto themſelves, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; (ſo the water to prevent a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> which nature abhorreth, aſcends; and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) So muſt wee conceive in things Civill, a ſubordination <hi>Iurium naturalium</hi>; and of reaſon unto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:8111:68"/>It is not againſt reaſon then, that ſome things which conſidered in themſelves are againſt reaſon, ſhould in a higher and more generall conſideration, proove warrantable by reaſon. Even by our lawes, ſome things, (ſay our Lawyers:) may bee done warrantably for a publike good, though contrary to the Lawes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.

Now <hi>cuſtome</hi> being a thing of great force in a body politick, as well as in a body naturall, and of much importance every way, either to the peace or diſturbance of any Commonwealth; if any thing may bee done at any time rationally, <hi>contra te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem rationis;</hi> it is in point of <hi>cuſtome</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially. Therefore <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> where hee undertakes to proove (which hee doth very learnedly and ſolidly,) that <hi>lex</hi> and <hi>ratio</hi> are all one; yet when hee comes to the point of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> hee is put to a <hi>fortè,</hi> not knowing well how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it; <hi>Si autem adhuc maneat ratio, eadem,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>propter quam prima lex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utilis

Diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le eſt enim conſuetudinem multitudinis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movere.</hi> Of many <hi>cuſtomes</hi> therefore wee may boldly ſay, that the unſeaſonable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of them is againſt reaſon; though conſidered in themſelves they be granted to bee not reaſonable. And herein is moſt true, and applyable that Greeke ſentence, or rather Oracle, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; not eaſily to attempt the ſtirring of thoſe things, which cannot bee ſtirred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſtirring; and as much hazzard, as ſtirring. The reaſon is given by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> in <hi>Dio, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8111:69"/>
above all things, it muſt needs bee more proper unto <hi>eſtates</hi> (ſo called from their ſtabilitie:) to bee happy in their ſetled conſiſtence and permanencie; as being liker unto ſtages and pageants, then <hi>ſtates</hi> truely, when alwayes mooving and changing. And beſides, not onely the happy being of an eſtate, but the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it doth depend of its ſtabilitie, in this kind. For <hi>rebus novis ſtudere,</hi> hath alwayes beene both the marke and the refuge of ill affected malecontents, who have no other hopes to raiſe their ruined fortunes, but by the ruines of the preſent eſtate that they live in. <hi>Alcybiades</hi> therfore in <hi>Thucydides</hi> vi. ſaid well, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; That their governement is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, to the Commonwealth, that apply themſelves as much as they can to the preſent Lawes and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> though they bee not altogether ſo good of themſelves. In this ſenſe muſt Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope his words bee underſtood, where hee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8111:70"/>
ſeemes to adſcribe unto <hi>cuſtome</hi> a power to make things that are bad in themſelves to become juſt and legall. His words are; <hi>Si pravae rei aditus antequam diu pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcat, non clauditur, uſu fit latior; &amp; erit conſuetudine licitum, quod ratione conſtat eſſe prohibitum.</hi> Greg. <hi>Reg. Epiſt. l.</hi> vii. <hi>Ind.</hi> ii. <hi>ep.</hi> 120.</p>
               <p>Another conſideration that ſhould make mee the more averſe from altering old <hi>cuſtomes</hi> is, becauſe the reaſon of ſome, though grounded at firſt upon ſome weightie conſideration, cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually appeare at all times, thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences happily, which in former ages gave occaſion to ſuch and ſuch <hi>cuſtomes</hi> being now remooved, and perchance forgotten. Therefore ſaith the Civill Law, <hi>Non omnium quae à majoribus conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta ſunt, ratio reddi poteſt; Et ideo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes eorum, &amp;c.</hi> I remember what anſwer ſome Turkes made, as it is reported by <hi>Busbequius</hi> in his Epiſtles, being asked the reaſon of a certaine <hi>cuſtome</hi> of theirs, which ſeemed very ſenſles; to wit, That
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8111:70"/>
their forefathers had done it of old; and as they beleeved, not without reaſon; though now not knowne unto them as they ingenuouſly confeſſed. I will not commend this for a good anſwer to all things; God forbid: In ſome things I thinke it may hold very well. If a Turke (to inſtance in ſome particular:) ſhould aske a Chriſtian, why when any doth ſnize in our preſences (as it is practized in moſt places of <hi>Europe</hi>:) wee pray to <hi>God to bleſſe them,</hi> or to that purpoſe; well might hee anſwer, that our Chriſtian forefathers have done it of old, and that long before them their Gentill forefathers had uſed it; but the reaſon, how, and why it firſt began, neither Chriſtians nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles can certainely tell us, though divers both Gentiles of old, (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> &amp;c.) and Chriſtians ſince have written of it, and have done their utmoſt to find it out. And now that it hath beene ſo long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized in the World, I ſhould, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, bee one of them that ſhould make conſcience to take it away, though I muſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8111:71"/>
acknowledge with the reſt, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or beginning, is unknowne unto mee. If therefore the reaſon of many Lawes and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> though very good and warrantable, and perchance neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, bee ſuch nevertheles that cannot bee found out but by time and experience; It cannot be ſafe to reſolve upon the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any long continued Law or <hi>cuſtome,</hi> though wee can give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, but after long and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
               <p>For theſe ſeverall reſpects, it cannot be thought amiſſe or unreaſonable, that all Lawes and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> ſhould by them, that are ſubject unto them, generally be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (in a civill reſpect, at leaſt:) to bee juſt and reaſonable. And truely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may bee alledged againſt them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves, yet in this reſpect they may be juſt and reaſonable, if they bee not partiall, but extend indifferently unto all, that is, juſt in the execution, or application; though not in their nature. But beſides, if it bee not fit to ſay unto a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8111:71"/>
King, (be he never ſo bad a King:) <hi>thou art wicked; and to Princes, yee are ungodly,</hi> Iob 34.18. Why ſhould not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be due to any Law or <hi>cuſtome</hi> from them, (as I ſaid before:) that are ſubject unto them, who owe their peace and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie (next unto God and the King:) to their protection, as that it ſhould not bee lawfull for them to vilifie them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to declaime againſt them? <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Vt ex medicinâ nihil oportet pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare proficiſci, niſi quod ad corporis utilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſpectat; ſic a Legibus nihil convenit ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrari, niſi quod Reipubl. conducat</hi> (and that is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>niſi quod juſtum eſt,</hi> and there is the ſame reaſon for both:) <hi>proficiſci.</hi> However it may not be doubted by any man that is wiſe, that there bee many Lawes and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> in all countries, which though they bee well tolerated and continued for the peace and ſafetie of the publicke, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee practized by particular men, (as farre forth as they may avoyd it:) with a good conſcience, and without great perill
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8111:72"/>
to their ſouls; as being of themſelves moſt unreaſonable. And therefore the ſame <hi>Tullie,</hi> who before did teach us, how we may judge and ſpeake of Lawes civilly; elſewhere inſtructing how to judge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, ſaith very ſolidly, <hi>Stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſsimum eſt, exiſtimare omnia juſta eſſe, quae ſita ſunt in populorum inſtitutis aut le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus:</hi> to beleeve that every <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> that is in force and rigidly ſtood upon in every countrey, is therefore juſt and good, is abſolutely to beleeve with the Epicureans and the like, (whom we have before ſpoken of:) that <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> is not a matter of truth and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but of meere opinion and conceit. And it muſt needs follow, <hi>quod ſi populo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum juſsis, ſi principum decretis, ſi ſententiis judicum jura conſtituerentur, jus eſſet latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinari, jus adulterare, jus teſtamenta falſa ſupponere, &amp;c.</hi> as the ſame Author very well in another place of the ſame booke. Theſe commendations therefore, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Lawyers of every countrie give uſually to their owne proper lawes and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8111:72"/>
                  <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> muſt cautelouſly be underſtood; or elſe they are very dangerous. Though ſome of them ſpeake plainely enough ſometime; as that incomparable Lawyer and Philologiſt <hi>Cujacius,</hi> of the <hi>cuſtomes</hi> of France, though refined and reformed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe; divers whereof he doth acknowledge to bee grounded upon the errors of former Lawyers, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be right and juſt of themſelves. To which purpoſe alſo I underſtand (with ſubmiſsion to himſelfe, and his interpretation:) the <hi>Cujacius</hi> of this Iland, in his <hi>Notes</hi> upon <hi>Forteſcu, that the divers opinions of Interpreters procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the weakeneſſe of mans reaſon and the ſeverall conveniences of divers States, have made thoſe limitations which the Law of nature hath ſuffered, very different. And hence it is, &amp;c.</hi> Sure I am, that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either of them, <hi>Tertullian</hi> taught us, that the ground of many <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>ſimplicitie.</hi> His words are; <hi>conſuetudo initium ab aliquâ ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ vel ſimplicitate ſortita, in uſum per ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsionem
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8111:73"/>
corroboratur, de virgin. vel. c. i.</hi> Hee might have added (which is added by others:) another ground of many Lawes and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> which is, wilfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and want of a good conſcience, the rareſt thing of the world, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bee more commonly pretended. It doth therefore much concerne every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, (them eſpecially that take upon them to bee men of judgement and underſtanding:) as not to controle the received Lawes and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> of their countries, the alteration whereof belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not unto them: So to underſtand as neere as they may, what Lawes and <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes</hi> are abſolutely good and warranta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble in themſelves; and which are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and maintained onely for the peace and concord of the Commonwealth. Here therefore is a maine difference to be made, betweene thoſe things that the Law doth command, and doth oblige us unto; and thoſe things, which if wee doe, the Law doth allow, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: betweene thoſe things that wee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8111:73"/>
doe as good ſubjects unto the King and his Lawes; and thoſe that wee doe of our owne inclination, taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Law. What Chriſt once ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>If your righteouſneſſe exceed not the righteouſnes of the Scribes and Phariſes,</hi> (the ſtricteſt men for their old lawes and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> that ever were:) <hi>you ſhall never enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> is in this ſenſe applyable unto all men; Such a Legall life, will never bring them unto Heaven. Therefore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts teach us that <hi>conſuetudo</hi> may <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare à paenis civilibus</hi> indeed; but cannot, <hi>à paenis gehennae;</hi> if in itſelfe it bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable and unreaſonable. And they are not the Canoniſts onely, that teach us this doctrine, but even our owne Lawyers, that have taken the greateſt paines to uphold the credit, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Iuſtice of our Lawes. <hi>Many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned perſons</hi> (ſaith one of them:) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that it is lawfull for them to doe with good conſcience all things, which if they doe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8111:74"/>
them, they ſhall not bee puniſhed therefore by the Law, though the Law doth not warrant them, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo goes on, ſetting downe for example ſome particular caſes, of thoſe things which a conſcionable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound unto, <hi>to ſave his ſoule though hee cannot be compelled unto it by the Law, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. and Stud.</hi> lib. 1. c. 19. <hi>And in ſuch caſes</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author in another place:) <hi>he is in conſcience as well bound if he will ſave his ſoule; as hee were, if hee were compelled thereto by the Law, &amp;c.</hi> If there bee not then beſides the Law of the Land, a law of reaſon and conſcience to regulat our actions by, we are certainely but in bad caſe, in point of eternall ſalvation.</p>

Yet the Stoicks were tolerable in compariſon of ſome both of old and of late too, who have proceeded further, laying this for their foundation, that vvords and ſyllables are of great power and efficacie, and have (ſome ſay:) I know not what affinitie

To this I ſay, that though generally vvords goe by <hi>cuſtome,</hi> yet ſometimes they may bee ſaid to bee <hi>from nature,</hi> or <hi>naturall</hi> in ſome ſenſe, that is, ſet of purpoſe to ſet out unto us the nature of ſuch and ſuch a thing. There be many vvords of that nature, it cannot be denyed; in ſome languages more then others; but in all, ſome; and in this caſe, to underſtand the right Etymologie of a vvord, conduces much to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8111:77"/>
of the thing itſelfe. Of the nature of it I meane; but not to foretell, or foreſee by it any thing future; not more then can bee knowne by the naturall knowledge of the thing itſelfe. Some vvords againe may bee called naturall, becauſe they doe when they are uttered and pronounced imitate the nature of the thing itſelfe, which they ſignifie. So for example when wee ſay in Latin, <hi>aeris tinnitum, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorum hinnitum, ovium balatum, tubarum clangorem, ſtridorem catenarum, Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, haec verba ita ſonare, ut res quae his verbis ſignificantur.</hi> So moſt of them that they call <hi>voces ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium propriae</hi>; for the moſt part, both in Greeke and Latin are naturall. Againe, <hi>cuſtome</hi> doth make ſome words naturall, in that it gives unto them the power and efficacie of things that are naturall, to produce ſome naturall effects. Such are thoſe words and ſounds, whereby dumme creatures are governed; which though of themſelves they be but invalid words and ſounds, yet <gap reason="foreign">

So a man may uſe himſelfe to tremble, or weepe, or laugh, and the like, at certaine words and ſounds, which in time ſhall have that power over his body, that it ſhall not be in the power of his will to forbeare. Even as the ſight of whips and ſcourges (as wee read in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtories:) hath beene more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full upon ſlaves in warres, then the ſight of more dreadfull and mortall weapons, becauſe the ſmart of thoſe which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten felt, as ſlaves, made them in time to abhorre naturally and irreſiſtibly the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſight of them; ſo words alſo; Long uſe and <hi>cuſtome</hi> may turne them into charmes, to make them operative upon nature, though of themſelves they have no naturall power at all. All theſe things granted (whereof to diſcourſe at large, is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8111:78"/>
not my preſent purpoſe:) it holds ſtill nevertheleſſe, as we affirmed at firſt, that generally and for the moſt part, words are words, that is, are ſignificant by <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, all difference of words and phraſes in point of elegancie, or barbariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, is altogether from <hi>cuſtome.</hi> Hence it is, that thoſe expreſsions which in ſome language are moſt proper and elegant, in another are moſt ridiculous and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, neither is there any reaſon at all for the moſt in nature, either for the one, or for the other, but that uſe and <hi>cuſtome</hi> hath ſo determined it, whoſe will and pleaſure ſtands for reaſon in theſe caſes. It is true, that Grammarians have taken great paines to reduce ordinarie words and ſpeeches to ſome certaintie of analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, without which Grammar is no Art, and ſomewhat it is that they have done in this kind for the eaſier teaching and learning of languages. Yet doth <hi>cuſtome</hi> herein maintaine the power of her ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie upon words and ſpeeches, in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8111:78"/>
that when ſhee pleaſes, ſhe breakes the rules, and ſtricteſt bonds of beſt approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Analogie, and ſuffers no rule of Grammar to paſſe without an exception. All matter of elegancie then or babariſme being but a matter of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> as it is no wonder to ſee ſilly people for want of knowledge, either to vvonder, or to ſcoffe at the expreſsions of other languages, vvhen they heare ſtrangers ſpeake the vvords of the Countrey perchance, but uſe their owne phraſes and expreſsions; So I cannot but wonder that in all ages men that have beene moſt ambitious to be thought learned, have ſtood ſo much upon elegancie, as I find they have done. The ancient Heathens, Philoſophers, and others, did object, many things, I know, againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt; but I doe not find that any thing generally did in very truth make them ſo averſe from it, as the language; moſt of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being vvritten in Greeke words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome few excepted; but for the moſt part, in phraſes and expreſsions that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8111:79"/>
are meerely Hebrew; and the Latin Tranſlation being a mixture of both, both of Hebrew and Greeke phraſes, rather then Latin, that was Latin truely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of thoſe times. So hard a thing it vvas for them, that had beene uſed to <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the like, to reliſh ſuch a ſtyle; much leſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence it. A ſtyle nevertheles, vvhich they would have thought elegant enough, had they beene uſed to it; as on the other ſide, that of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> but courſe and barbarous, had not the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi> interpoſed, and diſpoſed their eares and palates to it. A late writer of <hi>Eſſayes</hi> treating of the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi>; after many ſtrange inſtances, brings this, as I remember, among others, as one of the ſtrangeſt; That ſome certaine people of the World, ſhould bee governed by Lavves that are written in a ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue. Certainly if the uſe of a ſtrange tongue in one Countrey in point of Law (vvhich would not be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood, though it were in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8111:79"/>
tongue:) bee a thing ſo much to bee admired; I thinke he might have found ſomewhat that is done in a ſtrange tongue in many Countreys againſt all grounds of ſenſe or reaſon, much more to bee wondred at. But whereas ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to increaſe the wonder, deride and defame the ſaid tongue as barbarous, they rather make themſelves an inſtance of the power of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> that makes them thinke ſo ſtrange, and ſpeake ſo ſcornefully of a tongue once thought very ſweet and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, by them that were uſed unto it; then perſwade us to wonder at others, that make no wonder of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>cuſtome</hi> advanceth or abaſeth words at pleaſure, making them that once were vile to become honorable; and thoſe that were honorable to become vile; yea vvords of title, to become words of reproach; and words of reproach to become words of title. What once <hi>knave,</hi> and <hi>ballad</hi> were in old Engliſh, when <hi>David</hi> was termed the <hi>knave of the Lord</hi>; and <hi>the ſong of ſongs,</hi> called <hi>the ballad of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8111:80"/>
ballads</hi>; is yet too freſh, to be forgotten. <hi>Notarius</hi> was once a Title for a Secretarie of State, when Secretaries of State, were at the higheſt; and then <hi>Cancellarius</hi> was an obſcure name, and of little reſpect. Now it is quite contrary, and hee would bee thought (and reaſon he ſhould, ſince <hi>cuſtome</hi> hath otherwiſe commanded it:) to commit a monſtrous ſoloeciſme that ſhould now uſe thoſe Latine words, as they were uſed when Latin was in uſe. I doe not know any thing to the contrarie, but that men were as ſcrupulous to tell a lye in former ages as they are now; nay for ſome reaſons I ſhould thinke more. As firſt, becauſe the art of equivocation was not then knowne, much leſſe the praiſes of it; and againe, becauſe as <hi>Tullie</hi> hath taught mee, the ancient Romans were ſo cautelous in their ſolemne atteſtations, as that, were they never ſo certaine of a thing, yet they avoyded as much as they could, <hi>religionis &amp; pudoris cauſa,</hi> vvords of peremptorie and confident aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; rather uſing (which hee cals <hi>verbum
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8111:80"/>
conſideratiſsimum</hi>:) the vvord, <hi>arbitror.</hi> Yet a man might have told another <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiris,</hi> that hee did <hi>lye,</hi> (of the Latin word I find it obſerved by others; and of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, wee have examples of it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ii. <hi>Reg.</hi> iv.16.) without any great either offence, or breach of civilitie; which now to give, though but to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee he never ſo vile, in the preſence of a man of faſhion, is greateſt incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But of all things in this kind, I moſt vvonder at that ſome tell us of the vvord <hi>Baſtard,</hi> which they ſay was once rather a Title of Honor, among great ones; then a note of infamie.

But you ſhall heare himſelfe ſpeake, if you pleaſe,

and what hee thought of it: <hi>In Epiſtolae titulo, imitari praeſtantem in omnibus mihi fraternitatem tuam timui; quia tutius cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didi verè ſcribere. Cave ergo poſthac Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Chriſti in libertatem vocatus, hominis, &amp; fratris, &amp; conſervi inferioris ſervum te ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribere: quia peccatum adulationis eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, quàm humilitatis juſtificatio, honorem uni Domino, uni magiſtro ſuper terram, uni Deo debitum, homini cuilibet, ne dicam miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimo peccatori, deferre.</hi> His words are ſomewhat ambiguous, whether hee meanes <hi>uni Domino, uni Magiſtro,</hi> and <hi>uni Deo,</hi> all of one; or rather (as I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:) partitively, allowing us the uſe of this word, to thoſe that are truely our Lords and maſters upon earth.

Now in this and the like caſes, it were happy if in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (if all places afford ſuch:) ſome of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8111:82"/>
the wiſer and graver ſort of men, would agree by their joynt conſtancie and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſiſt both in matter of faſhions that belong unto cloaths, and in thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto vvords, the vanitie, fickleneſſe, fooliſhneſſe of ordinarie worldly men, vvho have nothing to buſie their idle braines with, but to invent and follow new faſhions.

It is true, that faction and violent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are taken for zeale in moſt places; and thoſe men thought vulgarly very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, that hate them moſt fiercely, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8111:85"/>
are not of their opinions; of which kind of men there is ſtore enough in all places, and of all profeſsions. But religion, or faith well grounded (and if it be not well grounded, how we can be ready to give an account of it unto others, as Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> would have us, I know not:) is quite another thing. Wee ſpeake not here of illiterate men or women, whoſe capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (for no man is accountable for more then hee hath received, ſo hee make good uſe of it to his utmoſt:) doth not reach to ſuch either preparation or examination, as both the Scriptures and right reaſon doe require, to proceed rationally and with judgement in ſuch a buſineſſe. It is to bee feared that of them that want not judgement and capacitie in other things of the world which they take more to heart, there are but few to bee found in no place, that make that uſe of either (all prejudice and partialitie being layd aſide:) that were fitting in matter of religion. And ſo it comes to paſſe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where and generally, though few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8111:86"/>
it, or ſuſpect it, yet in very truth, the beleefe of moſt men if it bee well looked into, is rather <hi>cuſtome,</hi> then any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>But to the end that the power of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> in matter of Religion, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare unto them that are none of the moſt quickſighted of themſelves, nor diſpoſed to take any great paines by the helpe of long tedious philoſophicall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations to penetrate into the truth of things, wee will here take into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſome one of the many religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have beene in great uſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt among men in former dayes: and of all the reſt, wee will make choice of that purpoſely, which in the judgement of all men that were not bred and obliged unto it, hath ever beene accounted the moſt ridiculous, unnaturall and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.

elſe but the power of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> and the want of due conſideration, that leads them into it, and makes them inſenſible of their impietie. One thing I am ſure of, what ever wee thinke of the buſines, that Turkes and Pagans (what advantages ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee have over them in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:) may ſooner hope to bring us in time to their religion, by their outward apparant reverence and devotion in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion; then we hope ever by all our knowledge to doe good upon them, as long as wee continue ſo prophane. I preſſe it the more, that the power of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> which makes us ſo unſenſibly (though otherwiſe, I make no queſtion, many of us affectionately deſiring the converſion of Iewes and Gentiles:) to paſſe over all theſe conſiderations, and to doe ſtill what we have done, bee it right or wrong, may the better appeare.</p>
               <p>So much being ſpoken hitherto of the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi> in matters of religion, and having ſufficiently (as I conceive)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8111:91"/>
ſhewed it here alſo to bee great; wee are now (according to the method that wee have followed in the two former parts:) to proceed to the conſideration of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie of it, according to right and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that both in point of doctrine, and in point of practiſe; that is, in the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendis</hi> and the <hi>credendis</hi> (for there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but hath theſe two parts:) of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And herein as of my ſelfe I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to be but ſhort; ſo when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the things themſelves, I doe not ſee that I ſhall need to be very long. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though it goe beyond Nature and policie very farre, yet it is grounded in part upon the ſame foundations, as both Nature and policie are. As for example; particulars in things naturall, muſt yeeld and conforme to the generall if need bee, though it be againſt their owne particular nature. So water to prevent a <hi>vacuum</hi>; and the like. A maine ground of policie, <hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex eſto.</hi> So in matter of Chriſtianitie too: as it is, fully both
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8111:91"/>
and very elegantly, expreſſed by Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>This is the rule of perfect Chriſtianitie, this the utmoſt bounds,</hi> (or, <hi>exact definition:) this the higheſt top of it, to ſeeke thoſe things that are profitable to the publicke.</hi> Many things therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered, are here applyable. But yet to expreſſe my ſelfe ſomewhat more particularly herein alſo, we thus briefly;</p>
               <p>Firſt, In thoſe things that are of the very ſubſtance of religion, and trench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principall end of it, whether in matter of practiſe or doctrine, <hi>cuſtome</hi> is not conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The end, as all men know that are wiſe, is the principall thing in all things. And to this purpoſe is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> doctrine in the firſt of his Ethicks of difference of ends, ſome principall and abſolute (which in his phraſe wee may call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:) ſome ſecondarie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8111:92"/>
of very good uſe and moment. In the holy Scriptures, though a man meete with many changes, varieties, and alterations, according to varietie of times and places; yet hee that ſhall read and obſerve them with due care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, may obſerve <hi>the great things of the Law,</hi> as one of the Prophets cals them; or as it is in the New Teſtament, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the weightier matters of the Law,</hi> to be ſtill the ſame. Theſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand truely, and carefully to practiſe, is true Religion both and happines.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In things externall condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing more or leſſe (ſo they conduce, though but in a leſſe degree; and not croſſe directly:) to the maine end, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors may yeeld, ſometimes if they ſee occaſion; and inferiors if wiſe and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, muſt alwayes ſubmit unto <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>; though otherwiſe of it ſelfe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, not ſo fit and commendable.</p>
               <p>Superiors cannot propoſe unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a better example to imitate, then God himſelfe. God did indulge many
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8111:92"/>
things unto the Iewes, which otherwiſe hee would not have liked, becauſe they had beene long uſed to the ſuperſtitions of the Aegyptians. So ſay divers of the Fathers; and rightly, I thinke: and this in God, they call properly, his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>condeſcention.</hi> Of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſomething might bee ſaid, and hath beene ſaid by others to this purpoſe. But certaine it is, that the ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church, men Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and others (as it is acknowledged by all men that know any thing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:) in inſtituting rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Eccleſiaſticall, had great reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe rites and <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> whether ſacred or Civill, that the firſt Chriſtians had beene uſed unto, before their converſion unto Chriſtianiſme. Now if this courſe bee warrantable; where the change is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute from one Religion to another; it muſt needs bee more plauſible and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in point of reformation; wherein the more we yeeld unto <hi>cuſtome</hi> in things not ſo ſubſtantiall, the more likely wee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8111:93"/>
are to ſpeed in the redreſſe of more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall abuſes. As for inferiors, to them properly belong the words of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, In iis rebus de quibus nihil ſtatuit ſcriptura divina, mos populi Dei, vel inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta majorum pro lege tenenda ſunt.</hi> In thoſe things that are not apparantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God, for private men, though otherwiſe upon grounds never ſo plauſible to oppoſe their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to either <hi>cuſtome</hi> or authoritie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the peace of the Church may bee in danger; though it may goe for zeale in this World, yet certainely in the world to come, and before an higher Iudge, it will be found (and for ſuch puniſhed, I feare) either groſſe wilfull Ignorance, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme arrogancie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In matters of doctrine and truth, though every truth bee precious of itſelfe, and ever to be preferred before any privat ends, yet all truth is not alwayes ſeaſonable to be divulged, where the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is generall, and cannot bee oppoſed without much ſcandall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:8111:93"/>As there be <hi>cuſtomes</hi> in matter of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo in matter of opinion too; ſince (as hath beene ſhewed:) opinions goe by <hi>cuſtome,</hi> as much as any thing: Whence it is that in the <hi>Ius Orientale,</hi> you ſhall find <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>cuſtomes in point of diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>practice;</hi> that is, <hi>rites and ceremonies.</hi> In matter of opinion then the power of <hi>cuſtome</hi> is in ſome degree conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as well as in other things. Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tell us, that <hi>Error aliquando jus facit;</hi> and our common Lawyers alſo; that a <hi>Common error</hi> by their Law, <hi>for publicke quiets ſake goeth for a Law. Finch of Law, p.</hi> 40. I will not ſtand to examine upon what ground they ſpeake it; becauſe I doe not meane to ground upon them; though I could not but take notice of their words by the way. <hi>Nolite ſanctum canibus</hi>; and, <hi>keepe thy faith to thy ſelfe,</hi> (not generally to be underſtood, wee doe not meane, but in ſome caſes onely:) and ſome other ſuch paſſages, are more to our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8111:94"/>
purpoſe by farre, then any thing that the Law either common or Civill can tell us. But the argument is tickliſh. I leave the reſt to the Angelicall Doctor in his 22<hi rend="sup">ae</hi>. q. 43. a. 7. <hi>Vtrum bona ſpiritualia ſint propter ſcandalum dimittenda.</hi> So farre at leaſt, I could wiſh al men would take it to heart, as not eaſily for their owne onely privat ends and purpoſes (as many are ready to doe:) to vent abroad either old things juſtly and legally antiquated; or new things of their owne deviſing (the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fruits of extravagant braines:) that may any wiſe tend to innovation, and to the prejudice of publicke tranquility.</p>
               <p>My concluſion is this, That it is the part of a wiſe rationall man, as to conſider diligently how farre forth <hi>cuſtome</hi> both in matter of Religion and in other things is conſiderable, leſt hee trouble himſelfe and others without cauſe: So to conſider as diligently wherein it is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon, leſt conforming to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in thoſe things, hee himſelfe become one of them; that is, a man that is led by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8111:94"/>
                  <hi>cuſtome</hi> and not by reaſon; which is as much (if we may ſpeake freely:) as if we ſaid, a thing that hath the ſhape of a man, but may more truly &amp; properly be called abrute. And becauſe this cannot be done without much labour and ſearch, I muſt exhort all men that thinke truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much worth, to ſpare no paines, no ſtudie, if they meane to ſpeed. It is true, we live in an age, when Idleneſſe is ſo much in faſhion among all ſorts of men, that it is a hard thing for any man of what profeſsion ſoever, to bee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious more then ordinary, and not to ſuffer, even in his reputation, for it. Which cannot but bee a great diſcouragement unto many, who otherwiſe as rationall men, have a good mind to improove themſelves in their better part. But let them propoſe unto themſelves the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of men famous in former ages for their indefatigablenes in this kind; and let them conſider withall, that the reward is great. Though they adſpire not to bee famous in the World, nor ever live to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

others by their paines (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles all good men muſt propoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, if it may be:) yet they ſhall not looſe the fruit of their labours.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Title indeed, and the ſpecious dreſſe, and furniture of the Booke, promiſe great Treaſures; but thoſe Treaſures, well looked into, proove but meere traſh, and childrens bables: if I may ſo call ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, ſhameles, unconſcionable trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries and forgeries, ſuch as might have better proceeded from profeſt Heathens (though I doe not thinke there have ever beene many heathens in the world ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely godleſſe and voyd of conſcience, but would have beene aſhamed to have beene the authors of them:) then men
<pb facs="tcp:8111:96"/>
that profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians. Me thinkes if theſe impudent jugglors, did ſo farre preſume upon the ignorance and ſimplicitie of us <hi>Tranſalpins,</hi> (as once they were wont to ſpeake in ſcorne of all that were not Italians;) as to beleeve that wee would ſwallow all downe readily without any ſuſpition at all; yet they ſhould have conſidered, that Italy affords many learned men, (the preſent Pope himſelfe, a man of excellent humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: who as they cannot but preſently find, ſo certainely will heartily deteſt ſuch abominable practiſes. But ſince the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was ſo great and dangerous, (no leſſe then the confounding of almoſt all Hiſtories and Hiſtorians of the world; and in a manner of all truth:) it is Gods great mercy, that the undertakers were ſuch, as had more will then skill to cheat, and ſo might eaſily be diſcovered. For of all thoſe 284. pages, I dare ſay there is not any one page (ſcarce any one line of any page:) but upon due examination, will afford, not to a profeſt Antiquarie onely,
<pb facs="tcp:8111:97"/>
but even to an ordinarie Schollar, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient arguments and evidences, whereby to evince the ſpuriouſnes and falſeneſſe of the Title. If any man would be ſo idle as to gather together all that can, out of the booke it ſelfe, bee ſaid againſt it, hee might eaſily make a booke <hi>in folio</hi> tenne times as big as it. For my part, all that I have to ſay here upon it, is but to let you know, (which perchance every body will not preſently take notice of:) that <hi>Annius Viterbienſis,</hi> that infamous Impoſtor that wee have ſpoken of, though dead him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe long agoe, is the very firſt originall ground and fountaine of all this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. Read him, (if you can have ſo much patience:) his <hi>Catonis Origines</hi> and his <hi>Comments</hi> upon them, and it will clearely appeare unto you, to bee as I ſay. So apt are pleaſing fables, to propagate; and ſo hard (be the Truth never ſo cleare and apparant:) to bee rooted out of the mind and ſoules of vulgar men; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when their vanitie and fooliſh ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either for themſelves or for their
<pb facs="tcp:8111:97"/>
Countrey, hath ſome intereſt in the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of thoſe fables. Grounding upon the ſame <hi>Annius Viterbienſis,</hi> did one <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardinus Baldus Vrbinas</hi> long agoe (for I find, it hath beene printed though I never ſaw it yet my ſelfe, but as I have it, that is, <hi>Manuſcript</hi>:) adventure to ſet out an Interpretation (with Notes upon it:) of that <hi>Aenea Tabula Eugubina,</hi> or ancient <hi>Inſcription,</hi> found in <hi>Eugubium</hi> in Italy, and conceived by ſome to bee written in the <hi>Ethruſcan</hi> tongue and character: though <hi>Gruterus</hi> in his <hi>Theſaurus</hi> ſeeme to bee of another opinion. It was a bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that too; yet more bold then dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or of any great conſequence; and the Author himſelfe, (to doe him no wrong:) was ſo modeſt yet, as to call it all, but his <hi>Divinatio.</hi> But theſe late <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thruſcan</hi> Impoſtors, have gone beyond all that ever were heard of in the World, in boldneſſe, and licentiouſneſſe of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting; even beyond <hi>Annius Viterbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> himſelfe, I would ſay; but that in very Truth, as I have already ſaid, they are
<pb facs="tcp:8111:98"/>
but his of-ſpring, and the unhappily continued fruits of his firſt Chimaericall conceptions. Well, if theſe men (worſe then any <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>publici odii victi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae:</hi>) doe not deſerve with all poſsible rigor and ſeveritie to bee proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, <hi>tanquam generis humani hoſtes,</hi> as ſworne and profeſt enemies to that which is the chiefeſt good, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of rationall men upon earth, that is, <hi>Truth.</hi> I know not who ever did. And ſo I leave them to the judgement of others, in whoſe power it is to deale with them according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
