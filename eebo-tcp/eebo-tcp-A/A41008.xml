            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor can I here forget that debt the Church of <hi>England</hi> owes to the sound and learned labours of that Reverend Champion of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, D. <hi>Featley,</hi> which shall remaine in our Church as lasting Monuments of his able Piety, whilst Learning, and Orthodox devotion find a Friend; whom, at this time (suffering Imprisonment, for his loyalty to his Conscience and his Prince) your impious, saucy, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious quills (as full of venome as the pen out of which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> suckt his death) have vilified and traduced with such calumnious false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and malicious injuries, my hasty and impartiall Pen, shall take the boldnesse here to vindicate. To which end, you shall first understand what the person is; secondly, what his charge.</p>
            <p>He is a man, whose life and doctrine need no Advocate; whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction it selfe could not mention, without addition of some Epithets of respect; nay, concerning whom the very <hi>Diurnalls</hi> (whose nature and property is to Lye) could not for their owne credits but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an honourable truth: some styling him a <hi>grave,</hi> some a <hi>good,</hi> and others a famous Doctor: And indeed, to conclude him in a word, no object for any evill passion but Envy, and a Subject for no discourse but what ends with Admiration. He is a man, whose profoundnesse in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning encouraged the Houses of Parliament to commit the translation of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to his <hi>Review,</hi> Marginall Annotation, and <hi>Exposition:</hi> whose soundnesse of Doctrine invited the same Authority to make choice of him, for the answering of a Popish and scandalous Pamphlet, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A safeguard from Ship-wrack;</hi> both performed with solid judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and singular fidelity; that extant, this ready for the <hi>Presse.</hi> By which Authority, he was likewise chosen a Member of the Synod, or <hi>Assembly</hi> of Divines, for the composing of some differences, and settl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the peace of the distempered Church, in these His Majesties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>As touching his charge, it was unhappily occasioned by a Message sent him from His Majesty, (whose Chaplaine in ordinary he is) which commanded him, no more to joyne in that <hi>Assembly,</hi> being convented without His Majesties consent, and therefore without full Authority; whereto returning his answer in a Letter unseal'd, to the most reverend Father in God, the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> a chosen Member likewise of the same Assembly, now at the University of <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Letter was intercepted, opened, and falsly transcrib'd, whereunto the malicions <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> adding what would most, by wronging him, advantage the <hi>Cause,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103517:3"/>
delivered the <hi>Originall</hi> to the Messenger (with hopes to intercept the Answer) and dispatcht the false Transcript, to the <hi>Committee</hi> for Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: whereupon a <hi>Serjeant</hi> at <hi>Armes</hi> was sent for the <hi>Doctor,</hi> who having, in his examinations, refused to consent to every <hi>Clause</hi> in the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Covenant,</hi> was forthwith committed prisoner to the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> house in Aldersgate street, where now he remaines as chearefull as a good Conscience, and as poore as the severest censure of <hi>Authority,</hi> can make him.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Lyon</hi> is downe, how every Curre will barke! Him, whom of late these <hi>Sycophanticall Diurnall-mongers</hi> had in so good esteeme, whilst he concurr'd in some things with them whom they have in Admiration, him now they worry with their temporizing <hi>pens:</hi> who render him to the world no better then (to use their owne words) a <hi>Prevaricator,</hi> a <hi>Court-spye,</hi> and a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the Assembly, tryumphing in the <hi>Sentence</hi> of his downefall, and mingling the bitter <hi>Cup</hi> of Justice, with the Exuberance of their own <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Vineger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor (say they) hath his <hi>Livings</hi> sequestred, his Estate secur'd, his bookes seiz'd upon, and himselfe Imprisoned: <hi>Spolia ampla refertis.</hi> The onely <hi>Truth,</hi> that Pamphlet is guilty of: <hi>sed quo cecidit sub crimine?</hi> What was his <hi>charge?</hi> What was the heynous <hi>crime</hi> that moved to such a <hi>Ruine?</hi> A Letter sent to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> an elected Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Assembly; whom all the world admires and honours, unlesse some within the Line of <hi>Communication,</hi> who are more worthy to unty his shooe, then to judge of his <hi>Abilities.</hi> But what evill hath he done? He acquainted this worthy <hi>Member,</hi> by that Letter, with some <hi>passages</hi> in the Assembly, requiring his judgement in some things there controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, concerning matters of <hi>Faith. Proh nefandum!</hi> Indeed, his very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the Assembly (as farre as I see yet) was his greatest fault. Yea, but he sued covertly for a Deanry: Yea, that was a fault indeed, to sue for something, which they are now endeavouring to make nothing, to purchase a house that's pulling downe. Put case, he did so. Is it a Crime to provide a <hi>plaister</hi> for a <hi>Sore</hi> that is now a breeding? <hi>Clypeum post vulnera,</hi> is folly: but <hi>ante vulnus,</hi> is Providence: They that aime at the Ruine of the whole body, will be impatient at the Preservation of a Member. Is it a great fault for a Servant to begge of his Master, and none at all for <hi>Subjects</hi> to begger their <hi>Prince?</hi>

                  <hi>The Doctor at the Assembly past his vote with the rest upon debate of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Covenant, for the quite extirpation of Popery and Prelacy.</hi> To see, how two aiming at one end, may proceed in two contrary courses; The <hi>Divell</hi> uses to take from the <hi>Truth,</hi> this tri-obular <hi>newes-Merchant</hi> adds to it: Two travelling contrary wayes, may meet at the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> He that takes from the <hi>Truth,</hi> and adds to the <hi>Truth,</hi> may meet in <hi>Hell</hi> as well as in their hellish <hi>intentions.</hi>

                  <hi>The Extirpation of Popery and Prelacy.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For the second, I call the whole <hi>Assembly</hi> of Divines, some of the <hi>Peeres,</hi> and divers of the House of <hi>Commons</hi> to witnesse your stupendious <hi>Lye.</hi> But the Divell hath taught you this curious point of Sophistry to argue, <hi>a male conjunctis ad bene divisa.</hi> As for the extirpation of <hi>Popery,</hi> he hath acted what others have but voted; But for the clause of prelacy, your <hi>Idols</hi> shall be <hi>judges</hi> upon what reasons he dissented. First, at his <hi>Ordination</hi> he tooke an <hi>Oath</hi> to obey his ordinary. Secondly, at his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> and <hi>Induction</hi> he swore Canonical obedience to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the dioces. Thirdly, his <hi>Benefice</hi> being of my Lords grace of <hi>Canterburies</hi> peculiar, he tooke an Oath to maintaine the priviledges of the <hi>See</hi> of Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Now how this <hi>Covenant</hi> in that particular can be consistent with the three former <hi>oathes,</hi> or how any in the Assembly that takes it, can be guiltlesse of <hi>perjury,</hi> let every good <hi>conscience</hi> judge.

               <p>It is true; that there is some question among learned Divines, concerning the meaning of the Text, whether it be literall or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, whether by bowing we ought to understand corporall and externall bowing of the knee, or inward bowing of the heart.

sequence at all, or whether he and the Committee rested satisfied with the answers formerly given, it is not certainly knowne, but on this day he pretermitted diverse of them, instanced only in a branch of the first, and of the fourth, and two of the fift, and one of the sixt, and two of the seuenth; and because the D. denied them all, he called in witnesses to prove them, and required the D. to take legall exceptions against them, if he had any. To prove that the D. should say it was ignorance and blasphemy to speake against the bowing at the Name of Jesus; <hi>Iohn Goad (and Ambrose Andrewes,</hi> were produced: to prove that he said in a sermon the 25 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1641, that all that pul downe Railes and oppose the ceremonies of the Church, are the seed of the Serpent, <hi>Edward Searles, and Edmond Rayner,</hi> a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, <note n="*" place="margin">Because he said, he was as much the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed as the King.</note> commonly called the ancient King, were produced: to prove that he called <hi>Cartwright</hi> an arch Hereticke, and that the state had sate long and done nothing, and that the keyes were taken from the Church, and laid in such hands as laid them by till they became rusty, &amp; that he inveighed against the <hi>London</hi> Preachers, who do nothing but cry arm, arm, fight, fight, &amp;c. <hi>Thomas Sharpe</hi> and <hi>Iohn Clerke</hi> were produced, who also both testified to the first article concerning bowing at the Name of Jesus. Lastly, to the sixt article only <hi>M. Neariah Mormay</hi> was produced.</p>
               <p>When the witnesses appeared, the D. first proposed some interrogatories to them, and after tooke exceptions against them, both in generall, and particular. The interrogatories he propounded to them, by <hi>M. White,</hi> were these; First, at what time the Sermon was preached, which is mentioned in the first Article, and likewise when the Sermon was preached that is mentioned in the fift Article. <hi>Item,</hi> upon what text such sermons were preached, and what they remembred else in those sermons, to which they all could answer nothing. Whereupon the D. desired that the Committee would give no credit to such loose and indefinite testimonies, especially
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103517:18"/>
against the originall sermons written in his booke, from which, it is well knowne, he never used to vary. This authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call originall wherein there was no blot, scratch, or rasure in the places, to which the Articles had reference, the D. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; but <hi>M. White</hi> would not looke upon it, though in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts, and namely the high Commission and Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Councell table, where 'Sermons have beene que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, the undisproved originall hath beene alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before broken notes taken by ignorant and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate men. The exceptions hee tooke against the witnesses in generall, were, that competent witnesses, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an ecclesiastial person &amp; D. of Divinity ought to be men of good ranke &amp; quality, at least without any taint or brand on them, such as are free from all malevolent affections to their pastors: for the rules of the law concerning witnesses to be admitted are these: <q>
                     <hi>In teste attendenda, status, dignitas, fidei puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, et morum gravitas; item cujus conditionis, cujus opinionis fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, et ne forte aliquis contra praefatum pastorem inimicitias habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit: Item testes absque ulla infamia aut suspitione aut manifesta macula esse debent.</hi>
                  </q> That the witnesses here produced are not so qualified, I desire the certificate of the vestry, under their hands (which I have here to shew, and there are divers of the said Vestry here present to make it good) may be read; but <hi>M. White</hi> said, he would take no papers (yet he tooke both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and other notes, and informations against the D. from his adversaries) nor would permit the D. to read it, The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate was as followeth: <q>we the parishioners of the parish of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> doe certifie that <hi>Iohn Goad, Ambrose Andrewes,</hi> alias <hi>Glover, Edward Searles,</hi> and <hi>Westmall Burrell,</hi> of the said parish of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> are disaffected persons to the discipline and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> established by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, have openly depraved the booke of Common Prayer, some of them doe not come to the Church at all and stand indicted as delinquents at Sessions and Assises, and that they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103517:19"/>
are accounted turbulent persons, and sowers of strise and contention.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This certificate being refused, the D. required that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he had from the Sessions might be read and considered of; this, after <hi>M. Harper</hi> the Church warden had testified before the Committee, that it was subscribed by the hand of the Clerk of the Peace, and that he himselfe saw him write it, was admitted for an evidence: the record followeth.</p>

            <p>Whereas a false and scandalous report is <hi>bruited</hi> by the Semi-separatists and Anabaptists, and readily entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by divers <hi>Zelots</hi> of the <hi>new Reformation;</hi> that I, who have preached and printed so much against Popery heretofore, now in my old dayes being ready to leave this world, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away from my holy profession, and am in heart a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, there being found very many popish bookes in my study.

I have thought fit to make knowne to all whom it may concerne, that being chosen Provost of <hi>Chelsey</hi> Colledge, I have under the broad Seale of <hi>England,</hi> a Warrant to buy, have, and keepe, all manner of popish bookes, and that I never bought or kept any of them, but to this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the better to informe my selfe to refute them; and for my judgement and resolution in poynt of Religion. I professe before God and his holy Angels, and the whole world, that what I have heretofore preached, written, and Printed, against the errors, heresies, Idolatry, and manifold superstitions of the Romish church, is the truth of God, and that I am most ready and willing, if I be called thereunto, to <hi>signe and seale</hi> it with my blood.</p>

            <p>First, that the Articles of Religion, agreed upon in the yeare <note place="margin">1.</note> of our Lord, 1562. by both houses of Convocation, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> need no alteration at all, but onely an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox explication in some ambiguous phrases, and a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against false aspersions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished <note place="margin">2.</note> by many lawes and Acts of Parliament; that is, the government by Bishops (removing all late innovations and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses in the execution thereof) is agreeable to Gods Word, and a truly, ancient, and <hi>Apostolicall Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that there ought to be a <hi>set forme</hi> of publike prayer, <note place="margin">
