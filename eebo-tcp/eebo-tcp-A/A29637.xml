            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have, long since, studied in these <hi>anti-ingenious</hi> Times, to finde out a Man, that might, at once, be both a <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Patron</hi> to this Issue of my <hi>Old age,</hi> which needs both. And my blessed <hi>Stars</hi> have flung me upon <hi>You:</hi> In whom both those Attributes <hi>concentre</hi> and <hi>flourish:</hi> Nor can I yet finde a reason, why I should present it to <hi>You</hi> (it being below your <hi>Acceptance</hi> or Censure) but onely my own <hi>Confidence;</hi> which had not grown to this <hi>forwardnesse,</hi> had it not been incouraged by your <hi>Goodnesse.</hi> Yet we all know, <hi>Beggars</hi> use to flock to great mens Gates. And, though my Fortune has cast me in that Mold, I am poor and proud; and preserve the humour of him, who could not beg for any thing, but <hi>great Boons,</hi> such, as are your kinde <hi>Acceptance</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi> I dare not say (as my Brethren use) that I present this, as a <hi>Testimoniall of my Gratitude or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for your Favours:</hi> For (I protest) I conceive it so far from <hi>quitting</hi> old Engagements, that it <hi>creates new.</hi> So that, all, that this <hi>Play</hi> can do, is but to make more <hi>Work;</hi> and involves me in <hi>Debts,</hi> beyond a possibility of Satisfaction. Sir, it were a folly in me, to tell you of your Worth, the World knows it enough; and are bold to say, <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> scarce ever <hi>club'd</hi> so well. You know, Sir, I am old, and cannot <hi>cringe,</hi> nor <hi>Court,</hi> with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

All the Arguments I can use to induce you to take notice of this <hi>thing of nothing,</hi> is, that it had the luck to tumble last of all in the <hi>Epidemicall</hi> ruine of the <hi>Scene;</hi> and now <hi>limps</hi> hither with a <hi>wooden Leg,</hi> to beg an Alms at your hands. I will winde up all, with a <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That since the Times conspire to make us all Beggars, let us make our selves merry;</hi> which (if I am not mistaken) this drives at. Be pleased therefore, Sir, to lodge these harmlesse <hi>Beggars</hi> in the <hi>Out-houses</hi> of your thoughts; and, among the rest, Him, that in this <hi>Cuckoe</hi> time, puts in for a Membership, and will fill the <hi>Choyre</hi> of those, that <hi>Duly and truly pray for you,</hi> and is,</p>

               <l>His Works were too elaborate, not fit</l>

               <l>Founder'd in's <hi>Pericles,</hi> and must not pass.</l>

               <l>In high esteem, by some, laid by in scorn;</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Indians,</hi> who their Native Wealth despise,</l>

            <l>THe Title of our <hi>Play,</hi> A Ioviall Crew,</l>
            <l>May seem to promise Mirth: Which were a new,</l>
            <l>And forc'd thing, in these sad and tragick daies,</l>
            <l>For you to finde, or we expresse in <hi>Playes.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>We wish you, then, would change that expectation,</l>
            <l>Since Ioviall Mirth is now grown out of fashion.</l>
            <l>Or much not to expect: For, now it chances,</l>
            <l>(Our Comick Writer finding that <hi>Romances</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of Lovers, through much travell and distresse,</l>
            <l>Till it be thought, no Power can redresse</l>
            <l>Th' afflicted Wanderers, though stout Chevalry</l>
            <l>Lend all his aid for their delivery;</l>
            <l>Till, lastly, some impossibility</l>
            <l>Concludes all strife, and makes a Comedie)</l>
            <l>Finding (he saies) such Stories bear the sway,</l>
            <l>Near as he could, he has compos'd a <hi>Play,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of <hi>Fortune-tellers, Damsels,</hi> and their <hi>Squires,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Expos'd to strange Adventures, through the Briers</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fate.</hi> But why need I forestall</l>
            <l>What shall so soon be obvious to you all:</l>
            <l>But wish the dulnesse may make no Man sleep,</l>
            <l>Nor sadnesse of it any Woman weep.</l>

<pb facs="tcp:47912:14"/>
For he was an Attorney, till he was pitch'd over the Bar. And, from that fall, he was taken up a Knight o' the Post; and so he continued, till he was degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the whipping-post; and from thence he ran resolutely into this course. His cunning in the Law, and the others labour with the <hi>Muses</hi> are dedicate to your service; and for my self, I'l fight for you.</p>

And so, begging being the last refuge, he enter'd into our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And now lives honestly, I must needs say, as the best of us.</p>

                  <p>Beggars! They are the only people, can boast the benefit of a free state, in the full enioyment of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Mirth and Ease; having all things in common and nothing wanting of <hi>Natures</hi> whole provision within the reach of their desires.

                  <p>Happier then we I'm sure, that are pent up and tied by the nose to the continual steam of hot Hospitality, here in our Father's house, when they have the Aire at pleasure in all variety.</p>

                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes in our Father's Rule and Government, or by his allowance. What's that to absolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; such as the very Beggars have; to feast and revel here to day, and yonder to morrow; next day where they please; and so on still, the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Kingdome over? ther's Liberty! the birds of the aire can take no more.</p>

                  <p>And then at home here, or wheresoever he comes, our Father is so pensive, (what muddy spirit soe're possesses him, would I could conjure't out)
<pb facs="tcp:47912:17"/>
that he makes us even sick of his sadness, that were wont <hi>to see my Ghossips cock to day; mould Cocklebread; daunce clutterdepouch; and Hannykin booby; binde bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels</hi>; or do any thing before him, and he would laugh at us.</p>

                  <p>Now he never looks upon us, but with a sigh, or teares in his eyes, tho' we simper never so sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. What tales have been told him of us, or what he suspects I know not; God forgive him, I do; but I am weary of his house.</p>

                  <p>I am beholden to you. But for my Father, I would I knew his grief and how to cure him, or that we were where we could not see it. It spoiles our mirth, and that has been better then his Meat to us.</p>

                  <p>Psew, you would marry us presently out of his way, because he has given you a foolish kinde of promise: But we will see him in a better humor first, and as apt to laugh as we to lie down, I warrant him.</p>

                  <p>Why, Sir, a counterfeit lame Rogue beg'd of me; but in such Language, the high Sheriffs Son o' the Shire could not have spoke better; nor to have borrowed a greater summe.

A <hi>Beggar?</hi> Why, <hi>Beggars</hi> are flesh and bloud; and Rags are no Diseases. Their Lice are no French Fleas. And there is much wholsommer flesh under Country Dirt, than City Painting: And less danger in Dirt and Rags, than in Ceruse and Sattin. I durst not take a touch at <hi>London,</hi> both for the present cost, and fear of an after-reckoning. But <hi>Oliver,</hi> dost thou speak like a Gentleman? fear Price or Pox, ha? Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do I Sir: Nor can <hi>Beggar-sport</hi> be inexcusable in a young Country Gentleman, short of means, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect, a principal one indeed; to avoid the
<pb facs="tcp:47912:33"/>
punishment or charge of <hi>Bastardy:</hi> There's no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting with them; or keeping of Children for them. The poor Whores, rather than part with their own, or want children at all, will steal other folks, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with, and move compassion. He feeds a Beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench well that fils her belly with young bones. And these reasons considered, good Master <hi>Oliver</hi>— s'lid yonder they are at peep. And now sitten downe as waiting for my purpose.

I have enough; and am Heire of a well-known Estate, and that she knows—And therefore that she should sleight me, and run away with a wages-fellow, that is but a petty Cleark and a Serving-man.

It has been my Masters, and his Ancestors in that Name, above these three hundred yeers, as our House Chronicle doth notifie; and not yet to be let.

                     <p>This is right my Master. When he had his Daughters he was sad; and now they are gone, he is the merriest man alive. Up at five a Clock in the morning, and out till Dinner-time. Out agen at af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and so till Supper-time. Skise out this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and skise out that away. (He's no <hi>Snayle</hi> I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you.)

Gentlemen kept no whirling Jacks then, to cozen poor People of Meat. And I have now, without boast, 40. <hi>l.</hi> in my Purse, and am the youngest of half a score in the House, none younger then my self but one; and he is the Steward over all; his name is Master <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> (blesse him where ere he is) he has a world of means: And we, the Underlings, get well the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by him; besides the Rewards many Gentlemen give us, that fare well, and lodge here sometimes.</p>

I ask you no question. And can you be so discourteous, as to tell me, or my Friend, any thing like businesse. If you come to be merry with Me, you are welcome. If you have any businesse, forget it: You forget where you are else. And so to Dinner.</p>

                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>I have forgiven you. Provided that my Neece be safely taken; and so to be brought home. Safely, I say, that is to say, unstain'd, unblemish'd, undishonour'd; that is to say, with no more faults, criminall, or accusative, than those she carried with her.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I believe—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, if we both speak together, how shall we hear one another? you believe her Vertue is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of proof, without your Councell or your Guard; and therefore you left her in the hands of Rogues and Vagabonds, to make your own Peace with me. You have it. Provided, I say (as I said before) that she be safe, that is to say, uncorrupted, undefiled; that is to say—as I said before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>Mine intent, Sir, and my onely way—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, if we both speak together, how shall we hear one another? as I said before. Your intent, and your onely way, you would ha' said, was to run away with her; and that by her onely Instigation, to avoid the tye of Marriage with Master <hi>Talboy</hi>; that is to say, to shun the Match, that I had made for her; that is to say, rather to disobey me, than to displease her self. Wherein (altho' she did not altogether transgresse the Law) she did both offend and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice me, an Instrument; nay, I may say, a Pillar thereof. And you, in assisting her, furthering, and conveying her away, did not onely infringe the
<pb facs="tcp:47912:50"/>
Law, in an unlawfull Departure from your Master, but in a higher point; that is to say, <hi>Top and top-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows high.</hi> I would ha found a Jury should ha' found it so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>But Sir, an't please you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>Must we then both speak together? Have I not born with thee, to speak all thou pleasest in thy defence? Have I not broke mine own Rule, which is, to punish before I examine; and so to have the Law the surer o' my side? And dost thou still persist? Hold your own peace; or, as I am a Justice of the Kings, I will unsay what I said before, and set a <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Lex</hi> at you, Sirrah, that shall course you up the heavy Hill. Oh, is your Tongue fallen into your Leg now? Do not you know I have acquitted you? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided— As I said before. Go your way in, and see that the Gentlemen, who, I think, were got in <hi>Sack,</hi> christned in <hi>Sack,</hi> nursed with <hi>Sack,</hi> and fed up to gray haires with onely <hi>Sack</hi>; see, I say, that they want no <hi>Sack.</hi> My Son <hi>Oliver</hi> (I thank him) has brought me a pair of such Guests.

                  <l>O Master <hi>Sentwell!</hi> Good News?</l>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>Of beggarly news, the best you have heard.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>That is to say, you have found my Neece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Beggars.</hi> That is to say—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>True, Sir <hi>Oliver,</hi> I found her—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>Now if we both speak together, who shall hear one another?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought your desire was to be inform'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>I can inform my self, Sir, by your looks. I have taken a hundred Examinations i' my daies of Fellons, and other Offendors, out of their very Countenances; and wrote 'em down <hi>verbatim,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:47912:50"/>
what they would have said. I am sure it has serv'd to hang some of 'em, and whip the rest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>Justice <hi>Clack</hi> still! He must talk all. His Clack must onely go.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>But to the point. You have found my Neece. You have left her at your own House; not onely to shift her out of her Disguise, but out of her shame, to come neerer me, untill I send her pardon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>Most true, Sir. But the Company she was in—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>Again! Do not I know the Company? <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, Rogues, Vagabonds,</hi> and <hi>Hedge-birds.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>But do you know whom, or how many we have taken? and how the rest escap'd?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>A needlesse knowledge. Why should we take more than her self? Or how could you take those that could escape?</p>

                  <p>Sir, the old Gentlemen within, sent me to wait upon you. Without you (they say) they need not my Service.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>But Sir, we have taken with her such <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,</hi> such <hi>Rogues,</hi> such <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> and such <hi>Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds</hi> (since you call 'em so) as you never knew, or heard of, though now the Countries swarm with 'em under every Hedge, as if an innumerable Army of 'em were lately disbanded without Pay. <hi>Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds</hi> said you? <hi>Hedge Lady-birds, Hedge Cavaliers, Hedge Souldier, Hedge Lawyer, Hedge Fidlers, Hedge Poet, Hedge Players,</hi> and a <hi>Hedge Priest</hi> among 'em. Such we have taken for the <hi>Principals.</hi> But to see how the
<pb facs="tcp:47912:51"/>
Multitude scap'd us; was more sport than pitty. How, upon a Watch-word given, they in the instant vanish'd by more severall waies than there were legs among 'em; how the Creeples leap'd over Pales and Hedges; how the Blinde found their way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Lakes and Ditches; how a <hi>Doxie</hi> flew with two Children at her back, and two more, perhaps, in her belly—</p>

                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, an old <hi>Patrico,</hi> an ancient Prophet, to tell Fortunes, and cozen our poor Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their single Money.</p>

                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir. And they were contriving to act a Play among themselves, just as we surpriz'd 'em, and spoil'd their Sport.</p>

                  <p>You shall do well in that; to put 'hem in stock to set up again.</p>

                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I'll put 'em in Stocks, and set 'em up to the Whipping-post. They can act <hi>Iustices,</hi> can they? I'll act a <hi>Iustice</hi> among 'em; that is to say, I will
<pb facs="tcp:47912:51"/>
do justice upon them; that is to say—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray Sir, be not severe, they act <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Emperours,</hi> as well as <hi>Iustices.</hi> And <hi>Iustice</hi> is blinde they say: you may therefore be pleas'd to wink a little. I finde that you have merry old Gentlemen in your House, that are come far to visit you. I'll undertake that these <hi>Players,</hi> with the help of their
<hi>Poet</hi>; in a device which they have already studied, and a pack of Cloaths which I shall supply 'em with, shall give your Guests much content, and move compassion in you towards the poor <hi>Strowles.</hi>

                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>But you know my way of <hi>Iustice</hi> (and that's a sure way) is to punish 'em first, and be compassion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate afterwards, as I finde 'em upon their Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sen.</speaker>
                  <p>But for your Guests sakes, who (I know) do favour and affect the Quality of Actors very much, permit 'em, Sir. It will inlarge your Entertainment exceedingly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>And perhaps save me the expence of a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of <hi>Sack</hi> the while. Well, Sir, for that Respect, and upon your undertaking that they shall please, I will prorogue my <hi>Iustice</hi> on the <hi>Rogues.</hi> And so to my merry Gentlemen, whom I will prepare to see their <hi>Enterlude</hi> against after Supper. But pray, Master
<hi>Sentwell,</hi> as you have found my Neece, look to her, and see her decently brought home.</p>

                  <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
                  <p>I will do so, untill my scarce welcome <hi>Guests</hi> be gone.</p>

that without your Company, your Entertainment stinks. He has commanded me saddle his Nags, and away to night. If you come not at once, twice, thrice, he's gone presently, before Supper; He'll finde an Host at an Inne worth a hundred o' you.</p>
