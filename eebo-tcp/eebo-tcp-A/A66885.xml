            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>A Paper-war, or a more scurvie Fate.</l>

            </l>
            <l>Is realliz'd, and turn'd the Poets Battle.</l>
            <l>T'avoid such fears, we shall present to day</l>
            <l>An innocent and unprovoking Play:</l>
            <l>And that's his comfort, th'Author bid me say.</l>
            <l>'Tis plain, well meant; hardly a Song or Dance,</l>

            <l>Persist—But Letchers thus, when they decline,</l>

                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Marry, that did the good Porter: he
shewed me the Stair-case; and when I mounted, the first I happened
to meet was your Boy. Gad, <hi>Iack,</hi> thou livest here a delicate life;
these are better Lodgings than thou hadst at the Colledge.</p>

                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>Aye, faith, and somewhat better Company. But what a
Devil makes thee tarry thus long at <hi>Cambridge?</hi> Sure thou art

who till I come to age (of which I lack not many weeks) is also
my Guardian. She is a good Soul (as <hi>Sancho</hi> said of his Wife)
but of a downright Country-principle. She hates your City here,
and all that belongs to't. Looke ye, <hi>Iack;</hi> when you left the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I would have follow'd you with all my heart, but my Mother
very gravely, and like a Mother, writ me her Commands, and I think,
sent one of her servants to acquaint me, that I must still continue
my Studies where I was: for to come into the Country, and enter
into Commission of the Peace, I was yet too young; and to go to
the Inns a Court she would never think on't, for that was the ready
way to be undone, <hi>London</hi> being the very sink of all Debauchery.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I humbly thank ye. May it please you, Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi>
my Master desires to speak with you some time this afternoon.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dash.</speaker>
                     <p>Very well, and in good practice, I thank God, Sir.</p>

                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>I'm glad on't. Tell your Master, Sir, I will not fail to wait
on him about three a clock.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dash.</speaker>
                     <p>By no means, Sir, for then he'll be very busie in examining
a special Plea in <hi>Trover,</hi> which will hold him at least half an
hour.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>

                     <p>That can't be, Sir, for then he'll be gone out to the Walks
to meet his Brother <hi>Nuper,</hi> and signe Judgment betwixt <hi>Wiseman</hi>

                     <p>'Tis worth your enquiry indeed, for they are two as nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creatures as e're were shew'd at <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair. The man
you've seen already, and should you see him a year together, you
would see neither more nor less in him; yet people of his Tribe
say he's a good Clerk (as they phrase it.) He's one that manages
his Masters Practice so assiduously, that he can do nothing else—
But a pox on him, what do I spend so many words of such an
Owl?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Then for the Master.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>Aye, the Master. There's a rare plece of flesh for ye—
never was Master and Man so proportion'd to one another. You
have heard part of the man's Character already; and, <hi>If the man
such dulness have</hi>—you know the old Rime in the <hi>Arcadia.</hi> To
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63958:5"/>
be brief, (for I hate to discourse of such unpleasant subjects) He
is a pure downright Attorney, with as little mixture of Gentleman
or Scholar as possible can be imagined to one who lives in <hi>London,</hi>
the Staple of refin'd converse. To this I must add, he is Old and
Rich.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>I'the name of Wonder, how came you acquainted with
such things as these? Is this the refin'd Converse, you talk of?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, <hi>Ned!</hi> thereby hangs a tale. You must know then, in
an evil hour, I owe him 6000 <hi>l.</hi> which my Father heretofore bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd,
partly to marry a Daughter, and partly on other occasions:
For this Debt he mortgaged five hundred a year, which Mortgage has
been now forfeited about four year, and he in the Devils name, has
enter'd. Since my Father's death, <hi>Ned,</hi> I have been very sensible of
this loss, it being (betwixt you and I) the best half of my Estate.
In fine, I have been several times with him to take in this Mortgage,
and get him to release the Estate. I have offer'd him, to that end,
to pay down 3000 <hi>l.</hi> with the Interest due, and a Judgment from
my self and two substantial Citizens, for the other three.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>And so he replies that you offer him to his loss, and that
he has eleven Points of the Law against ye; does he not?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>Much to that purpose; but in his Gibberish, he tells me,
<hi>Nul tort nul disseisin,</hi> I must not complain of wrong, he has but
what the Law gives him, and <hi>Executio Iuris non habet Injuriam:</hi>
And this is all I could ever get from him, till yesterday, and then
we were in somewhat more complaisant terms. He sends for me
now, I am confident, about this business.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, is this all you can tell me of him?</p>

                     <p>You mistake me, <hi>Ned Goodfeild;</hi> she is no ways a kin to
the dis-ingenuity of her Uncle. Believe me, Friend, she is both
Young, Pretty, of a good Humour, and besides a Fortune.</p>

                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>And with all these good Qualities, why do not you strike
her up, and by that means pay off your Mortgage?</p>

                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>Not so fast: The Affair is less feazable to me than any
man, for several reasons that I know. Her Father dying, left this
his onely Daughter, and 6000 <hi>l.</hi> to the management of his Wives
Brother, this <hi>Docket,</hi> who he appointed her Guardian, with this
Proviso in his Will, that if she married without her said Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's
consent, then to forfeit the said sum intended for her Portion,
and that her Uncle might dispose of it as he thought fit. Her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
a covetous Jew, has swallow'd all this Estate already in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
intending never to marry her with his consent: To that
end, confines her (while with him in <hi>London</hi>) constantly to her
Chamber, never suffering her to see the open air, unless once or
twice a fortnight in the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi>-Gardens; and
that too, with himself or some such trusty Governour.</p>

                     <speaker>Tru.</speaker>
                     <p>This is not all. The damn'd dull course of life her Uncle
has imposed upon her, has rendred both her discourse and behaviour
very reserved, or to say true, a little heavy; which suits not at all
with my fancie; for I must have my Mistriss, <hi>Ned,</hi> full of Air and
Gayety to the utmost extent.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I have read 'em all as they came out in Print.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Good: that will be a great help. For look ye, Sir, just
as some raw Poets borrow their Scenes from the Fop-company they
frequent, in the same manner, many raw Gallants square their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
to their Fop-scenes. What else makes these sort of Phrases
so common, <hi>Dear heart—You understand me—Let me die—And all
that—</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>For my own part, I don't know whether people in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
talk thus or no; but if you'd have me discourse out of Plays,
let me alone.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Besides this, you must be sure to be very confident, or if
you please, impudent in all your actions: That's the prime Rule
of Converse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Gad take me, I cannot promise very much in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
but I'll endeavour.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Gad take me! Oh, fie, fie, I'm ashamed to hear ye; why
that's an Oath for a Country-Schoolmaster: You must learn to swear
more like a Gentleman, or you'll spoil a Gallant.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Why prethee, how swears a Gentleman? does not a
Cobler swear as well?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63958:6"/>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir, a Cobler swears at the second hand. To swear
like a Gentleman, is to swear in a new Phrase, and with a full mouth.
I know a Lady neer the place where I was born, that never encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
her Children with Apples or Sugar-plums, but when they
had invented some handsome new Oath, as, <hi>By my Mothers Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
or, <hi>By my Fathers dapple Mare;</hi> or rather than none at all, a
Rapper would content her, so that it came in, in a right place, and
had a good Emphasis. I have seen her little Imps of four or five
years old swear as heartily for a Breakfast, as e're I heard our Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
pray.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>But may not a man hope for an indifferent good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
without such blunt downright Prophaneness?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>If you converse only with Ladies, indeed, why you
may do pretty well if you have often, <hi>Gad Madam,</hi> and, <hi>As I
hope to live Madam,</hi> and the like. But e'faith Sir, if you have to
do with a Coach-man or a Mechanick, you must be at it with, <hi>Damn
me ye Son of a Tinker,</hi> or you'll do no good.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Son of a Tinker?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh Sir, that's a new Phrase, and much more significant,
than Son of a Whore: Alas, that's grown so common, as 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a term of indearment, only to be used to Friends and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars;
as what's more usual, than <hi>Dear Son of a Whore, how I love
thee!</hi> No body's asham'd of Son of a Whore, but a Son of a Tinker
is not company for a Footboy.—Then young Gentleman, can
you Curse well?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, <hi>Franck,</hi> I doubt, not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Why there's it; yet you may perhaps when you're moved.
But above all, have a care when any one offends you, not to cry <hi>A
Pox take him,</hi> or <hi>The Devil take him,</hi> for these are (as I said before)
Terms of Friendship. Is there any thing more ready, than <hi>A Pox
take thee</hi> Jack, <hi>where hast thou been all this while?</hi> and for the
other business, it is so innocent, we use it of our selves; as, <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
take me, Sir, that's a good Iest.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis very true.</p>

                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Therefore I think a more terrible way of Execration would
be to say of your Enemy, <hi>May he never see his Mistriss's Eyes again;</hi>
or <hi>May his Taylor never trust him:</hi> But this, Sir, I leave to your
Discretion.</p>

                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>

                     <p>Not so good as your Mother, I confess;—but I say you
must spend the day in Drinking, Gaming, and Wenching: but in
this last affair, you must not enter too far, for a reason that I
know.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>If I do, the Devil's in me. But prethee <hi>Frank,</hi> how
must I spend the morning, which some call the sober part of the day?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>Why there's your mistake: The morning is part of the
night. A true Gallant should never wake 'till eleven, nor be drest
'till twelve at soonest.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Then what's to be done in the night?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>For the night, Sir, you must be sure never to go home 'till
towards one; then in your way as you go, you must take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to beat two or three Watchmen, and break all the Windows that
dare oppose ye.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>This is something harsh, methinks, for a Learner: then
to break windows shews too much like Confederacie with the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers:
and for a Gentleman to correspond with Mechanicks, is, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
very odious.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fran.</speaker>
                     <p>No matter what you fancie. There is, I confess, a milder
way of Night-adventures; and that is, to pass the Watch, give 'em
a shilling, abuse the Constable in clean Language, for which he'll
thank ye: and instead of breaking windows, to serenade your
Mistriss.—</p>

                     <p>This Niece of mine is much offended at her confinement;
but it's no matter: she's young and handsome, and I am old and
wary. If she be known broad, she'll quickly get a Husband, and
that will be no small Nusance to my Estate: For though her Father
devised her and 6000 <hi>l.</hi> to my tuition, with proviso, that if she
marries without my consent, then to forfeit the said sum; Yet if she
happens to be well marri'd, and without disparagement, what the
Chancery may decree in this Case, I know not.</p>

                     <p>Niece, I have considered of your grievances, which you
moved at Dinner; but I perceive you are young, and do not weigh
things with discretion. Should I suffer ye to go abroad, or let peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
come to ye, some vain idle fellow with a white Perriwig and a
long Sword, would marry ye, Niece, d'you mind me? would marry
ye; and then you're undone.—Look ye, Niece, <hi>Abundans cautela
non nocet,</hi> pray observe that.</p>

                     <p>In the mean time, Sir, the continual imprisonment of my
Chamber is insufferable: I'm sure it is very prejudicial to my health;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63958:8"/>
and I'm troubled with such a Head-ach, flesh and bloud is not able
to endure it.</p>

                     <p>Nay, good <hi>Lucy,</hi> never talk of that, but consider the
Maxime; <hi>A private damage is to be suffered, rather than a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
inconveniencie.</hi> Your distemper concerns only your self,
Niece: But should I see you marri'd to one of those Fops I told
you of but now, it would break my heart.—</p>

it were better if you cou'd onely sing Psalms.</p>

                     <p>It is not necessary: You have good Books at home, read
them: There's <hi>The whole duty of man;</hi> think of that, Niece, think

him, and you shall read that too: And for Education, you shall
have enough, <hi>Lucy.</hi> I scorn it should be said that any of my Bloud
should want Education. <hi>Dashwel</hi> shall teach ye French, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands

Now, Madam, if you please to sit by me, here in this Chair, I am

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>You must know then, good Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> that I come to
you with Commendations from my Lady <hi>Simple</hi> of <hi>Darbyshire.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dock.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Madam, I know her very well: her Husband, old Sir
<hi>Simon,</hi> late deceas'd, was the very first Client I ever had.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>God bless her good Ladyship, say I, for she's my good
Neighbour; but let that pass: I love few words, Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> and
those to the purpose.—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dock.</speaker>
                     <p>My own humour directly.—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>You must know then, Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> that I have a one and
only Daughter in the Country, her name is <hi>Elizabeth Goodfeild,</hi>
(you may set her down, if you please) a wild Wench she is, and
therefore 'tis high time to marry her, (but you need not set that
down.) Now, Sir, my good Lady <hi>Simple</hi> has but one Son, who
since his Fathers death, is Sir <hi>Alexander Simple,</hi> (pray set him
down;) and my Lady <hi>Simple</hi> and I considering that 'tis better to
wed over the <hi>Mixon,</hi> than over the <hi>Moor,</hi> as they say in our parts,
(but you need not set that down.) Therefore, Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> we two
Mothers, like loving Neighbours, have concluded to marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lady <hi>Simple,</hi> Sir, is very badly handled with the Gout,
that's the plain truth on't; and therefore she can't travel: And for
Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> he being the only Sprig of the Family of the <hi>Simples</hi>
remaining, we were not willing to venture him to such a naughty
Town; he might not only have been spoil'd himself, but done my
Daughter no good too. For you know, Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> Husband and
Wife are but one flesh.</p>

Town, which many a man gets, besides the Simples.</p>

                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>To conclude, Sir, I am intrusted of all hands, to come to
you, as my Lady <hi>Simples</hi> Lawyer, to take care with you that my
Daughter be well feofft in something: For the truth is, Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi>
her Father, honest Justice <hi>Goodfeild,</hi> before he died, set her a very
good Portion, namely 5000 <hi>l.</hi> which you know requires a good
Joynture.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dock.</speaker>
                     <p>For that, Madam, let me alone; but will you have it by
way of Uses, Feoffment, Bargain and Sale, Lease and Release, Fine
and Recovery, or how? The usual way, is by way of settlement to
certain Uses; but then I must know the names of your Feoffees in
trust: And here Madam, there needs no Livery nor Attornment.</p>

                     <p>For my part, I understand not a word you say: but here's
your Fee, Mr. <hi>Docket;</hi> and I'll send <hi>Steven Trupenny—</hi>

                     <p>No: Love was thus from the beginning; our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
know as much as this. In our Age the face of Love is very
much alter'd. Our Gallants have wisely considered Love has been
made so common, trite, and out of fashion, that, though there is
something belonging to the thing that is very useful and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
yet the damn'd Name is hateful; and both Sexes have agreed,
though their designes be never so sensual, to disown the scandal of
Love, and call it Gallantry, <hi>Mirth;</hi> and <hi>Raillery.</hi> Love, out upon't!
'tis got into all places, though never so improper and abusrd. Have

In the first place, you must know, Friend mine, Women are not
now so dull, and unapprehensive, as in former Ages: For just as
times and seasons change, so Behaviour grows more polite; of
which, the particular we discourse of, is one of the chief Examples.
Antiently Girls had such a gross Education, that most of them
knew neither to read, Bawdry; nor write, Assignations; their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63958:14"/>
not caring to improve their judgment to be more capable
than to distinguish betwixt their Husbands Doublet and Breeches;
which not only made them ashamed to demand what most they
wanted, but also when they had occasion to do so, or so,—Gad,
they durst not, though one and twenty years old, without their
Mothers leave.</p>

                     <p>Aye, <hi>Ned,</hi> in this Age they begin to refine their Behaviour,
and have found out the way of speaking, and yet not say a word.</p>

                     <p>No matter, <hi>Ned,</hi> you have us'd to such at the place
from whence you come. I say, they can speak their minde, and yet
not say a word. And besides this, when they speak, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
such a delicate Language, that they will talk with you an
hour together, and all the while discover a sence quite different
from their words. The advantages they have acquired from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
and Dress, to supply the defects of Nature in spite of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
I'll omit.</p>

'tis a frightful thing to see some women, that pass for Beauties
in due time and place, undress'd: I do not mean naked; but only
their face without the Toor, Shades, Locks, Hollows, Bullies, and
some transitory Patches.</p>

he makes nothing of thee; he has done thy business in imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                     <p>I have the value of all their Estate to a penny, in my books
at home. Besides this, their Tenants are able men, and special Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters;
and indeed, my Lady does oblige 'em to it: For every
<hi>Christmas</hi> she calls 'em all to dinner at the Hall: Then have we
the Bagpipes, and are so passing merry.—But look ye, Sir, here
comes my Lady her self: I knew she cou'd not tarry long out, after
Sun-set.</p>

                     <p>Aw Lord, Sir, there is such doings—Here <hi>Loveal,</hi> take my
Scarf—And then, Sir, there are such Cruel noises, all along the
streets as you go, I dare say, it would make ones heart ake to hear'em.
There was a woman, and she cri'd old Stockins, and ends a Gold
and Silver; and a little further I met a fellow crying old Shoos and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63958:16"/>
Brooms. For my part, I could not ha'thought that old thing had
been worth whistling for in this Town, where there is so much Pride
and Ranting.—Come, Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> pray take a feat by me here.—
But that which will never out of my head, no I shall carry it to my
grave wi'me, was some-body that stood just behinde my Coach, and
cri'd—what was it <hi>Loveal?</hi>

                     <p>Aye, Mackerel. Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> if you will believe me, it
made so hideous a Din, it frighted me out of my place full upon
<hi>Loveal</hi> that fate o're against me; and had it not been a great mercie,
I had broke her face.</p>

                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir, once; but I was very young then. It was when
I was new marri'd to Squire <hi>Goodfeild:</hi> he brought me up to see
the Fashion, and have a new Gown made, and so we went down
again. But to proceed, Sir, beside the noises, here are such ugly
smells in every corner—O, <hi>Loveal,</hi> did you observe the fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
that light out of the Coach with the Gentleman at the
end of the long street, as we turn'd down the narrow lane by the
new Church?</p>

                     <p>Aye, aye, she: I warrant she's nought—But as I was say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Mr. <hi>Docket,</hi> your smells, here in <hi>London,</hi> are most wickedly
bad: I have been told, the occasion is your Sea-coal; but I rather
think 'tis the sins of your naughty City, that makes it stink above
ground. Had not you <hi>Londoners</hi> better come down to <hi>Darbyshire</hi>
and fetch of our Coal from the Pits, which is (though I say it) a
delicate Fewel, and almost as sweet as green Ash?</p>

                     <p>Indeed, Madam, the Town is offensive to most strangers,
in these cases; but if you were to be demorant here a while, that
is, to live among us, you would quickly be familiar with these things,
which otherwise are troublesome to one that Discontinues the

<hi>Loveal,</hi> and I am my Lady's Woman. I vow, it's the finest Musick
I e're heard in my life, and much better than our Country Harp

                     <p>My Tale is quickly told. I grew weary of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and came hither to give my self the Divertisements of the Town.
I have been here but three days, and yesterday my very good friend
helpt me to a Mistriss, with whom I am desperately in Love. You
saw both the parties last night in the <hi>Temple</hi>-garden.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis briefly this: My Mother (like a very dutiful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
i'the mean time) has lately concluded, without my consent or
knowledge, to marry me to Sir <hi>Alexander Simple.</hi> (you know the
fool.) And now she's come up to perfect the Match here, as to the
Law-part—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>All this I know already.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>That breeds my wonder.—But to proceed: You may
well suppose I abhor'd to marry such a Coxcomb: 'twas therefore
by my Maid's advice, here, I resolved to follow the old woman, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito;</hi>
I performed it, and by good fortune have got Lodgings
neer hers: Here I have means to observe her progress in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
and take all opportunities to interrupt it. And before I left
the Country, I resolved, if I found the business desperate on my
part, I would never see her again, nor leave <hi>London.</hi> Then in few
days I had acquainted you at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I was, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and submitted my self to your conduct.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Well said, my Girl! thou shall loose nothing by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
unless it be thy Maidenhead, to a good Husband.—Have
not you appointed another Duel this morning?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B. Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Something of that nature. Your friend that I saw
with you last night, appeared so much a Gentleman, and I liked his
presence so well, I cou'd not forbear quarrelling with him; or if
you had rather have it <hi>Stilo recitativo—E're since his bright Eyes,
my heart did surprize, I cou'd not extinguish the flame.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, nay, your Champion expects you yonder at the
place appointed; and let me tell ye, you cannot be more taken
with his person, than he is with your Wit and Raillery. But when
he knows you are my Sister, he'll be o're head and ears in Love, for
he has often heard me speak of ye, and received your Character
with much pleasure.—Well; you and I have met this morning
to fight, and parted without breathing a vein, or so; but in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
your second Duel will have a more bloudy conclusion than
the first.</p>

                     <p>Away, away; are you a man, and stand upon such Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate

fought <hi>Ned Goodfeild</hi> in earnest, and so the Constables have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
them in the Fact, and thereupon conveyed'em both to a
certain place.—Yet it cannot be so, I'm confident; that little fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
cannot be a Fighter—and yet what a Devil makes him so
tedious? they might have dispatcht it one way or other before this
time. I long to see my young opposite; 'tis a very witty Rogue;
and I know the Duel will prove but a Wit combat at most—But
these delays are naught for Wit, as well as Love and Fighting—
Pox on't, the humour's gone over before we draw our Weapons.—

our Country; I have often heard of him, but never saw him till
now: When he challenged me yesterday, 'twas only to procure a
more private opportunity of discourse; and now he tells me, he is
much a Servant to my Sister, and loves her to the last point: my
Mother knows nothing, but he has made several addresses to her, and
finds she is wholly at my disposal, and will never fancie any one, but
who I commend: And now he comes to open himself to me, and
get my good will, as they say.—</p>

her to ye, for once; but I must tell ye, you'll have no such Prize of
her. She's damnably Crooked, and all that: then she paints like
the Devil: she has a Mouth like a Monster: and is blinde of one
Eye: her Nose, I confess, is a rich one; but (to be brief) she has
the poorest Presence that e're ye saw in a woman. Then for her

                     <p>No more of that: 'Tis a very happy accident, and will
conduce much to our advantage, for a Reason that I know.—In
the mean time, <hi>Ned,</hi> we must be active: 'Tis a shame that young
people shou'd be outstrip'd in their Amours, by two such old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that have not known what Love is, and the true ends of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
these twenty years. Let's see who shall be married first of all
us, and the Devil take the hindmost.—I am for this morning.</p>

                     <p>Nay, nay, though the old folks doat, and are hasty, it
wou'd not become us to do so. Marriage is a serious thing, and
should be thought of. Pray let's look a little before we leap into

to your Ladyship. Well; I vow, Madam, I dreamt of him to

things so well.—Oh, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that I had but such a Husband, I

though his hair looks now a little grisled, yet one may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
'twas black; and that's a hardy colour, and holds out well.—
But did you observe his Nose, Madam?</p>

me best, was to see how loving he appeared in his drink last night:
He must needs be good condition'd.—Well, <hi>Loveal,</hi> how sayst thou,

thy advice?</p>

if your own flesh and bloud can't advise ye, you are in a sad
condition. For my part, Madam, I'll tell ye true, if I were under

Look ye, <hi>Steven,</hi> minde me; Tell him thus; First of all knock at

                     <p>That's not all, <hi>Spruce,</hi> that's not all: He's one that loves
the Law, nay, doats upon the Law; I mean, the Practick part: and
o'my conscience he was cut out for a Practiser in his Mothers belly.
He's one that has found out the amorous Beauties, and the ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Graces of Practice; things that none can perceive, but such a
one as he is. In comparison to these, he hates your Plays, your
Masquerades, your Serenades, your Revellings (except only at
<hi>Christmas,</hi> and then the good Soul is ravisht in the <hi>Temple</hi>-hall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63958:26"/>
where he drinks small Beer, and sees'em dance till his belly akes agen)
but above all things, he abhors, like a childe of the Law, your
damn'd Poetry; with which, <hi>Spruce,</hi> I fear you are a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

                     <speaker>Spr.</speaker>
                     <p>Who I, Sir? God forbid. I vow, I have so great an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Meeter, and all that, that if you'll believe me, I dare not
sing Psalms for fear o'the worst.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dock.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, <hi>Spruce,</hi> there you are again a t'other side: I wou'd
not have ye think there's any harm in <hi>Robert Wiseman's</hi> Psalms, nor
in the old Song of <hi>Chevie Chace,</hi> but that they may be both used,
and very innocently. And more than so, I believe there are some
Volumes of Meeter that are very convenient, and of great use in a
Lawyer's Study, as <hi>The Garland of Good will, The furious fight of
Floddon-field,</hi> and all Mr. <hi>Wither's</hi> his Works; all these I believe
<hi>Dashwel</hi> has, and need not be ashamed of 'em. Nay, I can very
well remember, when I first learnt Court-hand I had all the Ballat of
the <hi>Two little Children</hi> by heart, and me thought it was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.
But that which ought to be odious to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all true Clerks, is your modern Poetry, your new fashion or
modish Poetry, your Play-Poetry, or Dramatick Meeter, your
ranting and tearing Poetry, your Poetry that breaks windows, or,
as they themselves call it, your Heroick Poetry.— <stage>(Knocking without.</stage>

heart; but if you did but know what occasion I have to stay at
home at this time, you wou'd not blame me—Hark ye, Sir, a word
in private. You must know, Mr. <hi>Trupenny,</hi> I have here in the house
a very pretty young Niece, a great fortune she is: her Father and
Mother are both dead, but that's all one, for I am her Guardian.</p>

                     <speaker>Trup.</speaker>
                     <p>How's this? a pretty woman i'the house, and I ne're set
eye on her as oft as I have been here? Time has been, that I have
smelt out a pretty Wench at a streets length: it's a signe I grow
old.</p>

                     <p>Nay, never wonder, Mr. <hi>Trupenny:</hi> She always keeps her
Chamber, or to say true, I keep her there. For I protest, here are so
many idle fellows about the Town, that I dare not let her be seen,
as little as possibly. And besides that, I have a constant eye upon
her my self; but in my absence, I commit that trust generally to
<hi>Dashwel.</hi> As for this <hi>Spruce,</hi> he's a slie fellow, and I dare not leave her to him.</p>

some young fellow in to her? Therefore I dare not trust him; and

a fig for your women, and all that belongs to 'em: Let us behave

know Mr. <hi>Clark:</hi> why he's the only Put-man in Town. I hold ye
six to four, an ye play with him till midnight, ye shall never win
two pence of him. He knows ye all the Cards as well as he that

he is the Devil of a Gamster.</p>

then, look ye, I had rather loose Thirty shillings at Cards, than give
a Surgeon Forty shillings for a cure, and Three pound for seeresie.
I must confess, look ye, Mr. <hi>Spruce,</hi> I love the sport well enough;
but pox on't, there's no doing in this noughty Town of <hi>London,</hi>
(as my Lady calls it.) Besides, Sir, shou'd I get it, you understand

the Lawyer <hi>Docket:</hi> First, I am younger, and consequently fitter
for a Widow's service: In the next place, I am richer, to please her
A varice: and lastly, not to flatter my self, I think I am handsomer
to beget Christian-like Children; for, Agad, if this fellow get any,
it must be with his Inkhorn, and what they will prove, judge you—</p>

                     <p>No buts, good Widow, but along, for I am all-over in Love;

                     <p>Hold, hold, Sir, I will swear or do any thing—but is
this the <hi>London</hi>-way of Courtship?—It is somewhat boisterous,
methinks, to force a woman to have a man whether she will or no—

nature, to comply with so ungentile a thing as Matrimony: my
Request is only this, that you'll be pleas'd to accept of my service,
while I am serviceable; but when I grow old and past my labour,
as they say, a small allowance for Pap, Butter-milk, and roasted
Chesnuts is all I desire.</p>

            <l>From Authors steals, yet swears those lines he writ:</l>
            <l>But he (suspecting you the cheat shou'd finde)</l>
            <l>Both to himself, and world, will prove so kinde</l>
