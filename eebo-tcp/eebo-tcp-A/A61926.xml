            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Diſcourſe is not deſigned to exclude any of their Majeſties Subjects from a ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that are really Friends to it, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
            <p>Or to interfere with that <hi>Indulgence</hi> which the Law allows to honeſt and mell meaning Perſons, who deſire no more than <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> (as a Chriſtian's Birthright) to live quietly and peaceably under the Government.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, to unmask and give a Check to the <hi>boundleſs Ambition</hi> of thoſe Seducers, who willingly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves, do by <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Principles, labour to raiſe <hi>Scruples</hi> and <hi>Niceties</hi> in the Minds of others, that are honeſt and well-meaning, ſo as to incline and diſpoſe them (in aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our Eſtabliſh'd Religion and Government) wilfully to exclude themſelves, by not qualifying themſelves as the Law directs; which the moſt tender Conſcience (rightly informed) according to the ſincere Principle of the Goſpel, may freely and chearfully do.</p>
            <p>And I am confident, there are few <hi>Diſſenters</hi> that are Men of Reaſon and Parts, and of long ſtanding, but are of the late <hi>Duke of Norfolk</hi>'s Opinion; who, when the <hi>Teſt</hi> was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Houſe of Lords; declared he had been born, and bred a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and it would be of great <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> to many Thouſands, if he renounced his <hi>Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> at that Age. And therefore (as a Perſon of Honour) he declared to this Effect:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſo bigotted to my own</hi> Perſuaſion, <hi>but I believe my Son may go to Heaven in the</hi> Communion
<pb facs="tcp:43745:3"/>
               <hi>of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>wherein he may enjoy his</hi> Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>And thereupon he chearfully laid down his Robe on the Table; ſaying, He <hi>that ſhall take that</hi> Teſt, <hi>and ſit in this Houſe (continuing a</hi> Roman Catholick) <hi>is a Villain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I am fully perſuaded, theſe Perſons, if they were rightly informed, and did well conſider, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might ſcruple for the ſame Reaſon; yet, in order to ſettle, and ſecure our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and preſerve a Poſterity in this Kingdom, (for it is morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any thing elſe ſhould do it,) they would not hinder, but rather encourage their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> to join in our <hi>Communion,</hi> that ſo they might be capable to ſhare in our <hi>Government;</hi> and by their own good Example and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, promote a Reformation of Manners among us, as the only Means to heal our Diviſions, and unite us all among our ſelves againſt our Foreign Enemies.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially when they all agree, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> (which is the <hi>vital Subſtance</hi> in Religion) of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to be one and the ſame with what is taught in every private <hi>Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may well then wonder why they, who pretend ſo much to greater Purity in Religion, ſhould lay ſo much ſtreſs in the <hi>Shadow</hi> or outward Perſuaſion, (which is but the <hi>Cruſt and Shell</hi> of Religion,) as to ſacrifice the Peace and Harmony of a Kingdom, by ſetting up ſo many <hi>different Ways of Worſhip</hi> in the Bowels of it, in oppoſition to that <hi>Publick uniform Way,</hi> which the prudent and holy Reformers in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (who bore their Teſtimony to the Stake) thought fit to eſtabliſh, (as well at <hi>Geneva</hi> and in <hi>Holland,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> &amp;c.) and annex'd it inſeparably to their Government; not no be changed or altered by any <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> but only by the ſame ſupreme Authority that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as the alone Prop and Support of the Government.</p>
            <p>Which every ſincere Chriſtian of a peaceable Temper, and well guided Conſcience muſt needs approve of: And when by Provdence they ſhall tranſplant themſelves into another Government of the reformed Religion, (as we are are all
<pb facs="tcp:43745:3"/>
Members of one myſtical Body the Catholick Church,) will as chearfully join in Communion of the Worſhip there eſtabliſhed, as if it had been the ſame wherein they themſelves were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. After the moſt excellent Pattern and Example of his <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> now on the Throne, and his <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and many other <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Perſons, (now Subjects of this Kingdom,) who had their Education in foreign Parts, from a Diſcipline of different Perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>As the only Means (under Heaven) to ſupport and ſecure every Government againſt the ſecret, ſubtil, and Helliſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the worſt of Enemies, <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Sectaries;</hi> who, under pretence of a <hi>Private Spirit, Revelation,</hi> and an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Call,</hi> do place Religion chiefly in the outward Way or <hi>Perſuaſiou,</hi> as moſt taking with their ignorant, and ſhort-ſighted Followers, which they pretend to form from the very Letter of the Goſpel; ſetting up as many <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Faſhions,</hi> as may beſt ſuit the ſeveral Humours and Fancies of the Leaders and People; herding and ſeparating them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many peculiar <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Folds,</hi> under Conduct of their ſeveral <hi>Guides,</hi> as ſo many Holy Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the old and uſual Jeſuitical Methods to divide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, and deſtroy Kingdoms and States, Religion and Government together.</p>
            <p>And that I may ſpeak plain, (for to mince the <hi>Truth</hi> in this Caſe, would be to betray the Juſtice of the Cauſe for which we contend,) we have in the following Diſcourſe an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>Teſt,</hi> to try and diſtinguiſh what Perſons their Sacred Majeſties now on the Throne <hi>(as juſt and rightful Parents of their Countrey, by their publick profeſſing, owning and defending our Laws and Government, and our Eſtabliſhed Religion)</hi> may with greateſt Confidence relie upon for their Security.</p>
            <p>Whether on ſuch as do conſcientiouſly joyn themſelves, and draw all others (they can) into the ſame <hi>Communion</hi> with their Majeſties, and under that Diſcipline do imbibe thoſe Principles, which naturally diſpoſe them as Chriſtians and good Subjects, to ſacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:43745:4"/>
and Safety, as well of their Religion and Government, as alſo of their Majeſties, (under God, their Head and Guardian) to which they are obliged (for their own Safety) by Religion and Nature, as they are Members of one and the ſame Body, and of one and the ſame Communion with their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>Or whether their Majeſties can reaſonably expect the ſame Loyalty and Security, from ſuch, as are ſeduced by Jeſuits and Sectaries; who <hi>(founding Dominion in Grace)</hi> do (by contrary Principles infuſed) as naturally, and with as keen a Zeal diſpoſe their Followers to Separation from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and (when oppoſed in their Deſigns) alſo to <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> in order to ſtrip their lawful Princes (though of the ſame eſtabliſhed Religion annexed to the Government) of their Dominion, to promote their own Worldly Deſign. Which is no ſtrange Doctrine; for what hath been done, may be again by the ſame Agents and Means, as naturally as Effects hold of Cauſes.</p>
            <p>For whatever may be pretended by our Enemies to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is manifeſt that all <hi>Treaſons, Conſpiracies,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> (whether hatch'd and promoted by <hi>Jacobites, Jeſuits,</hi> or <hi>Sectaries)</hi> do take their Beginning, Progreſs, and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from one and the ſame Fountain and Original, as they are all managed under the Conduct of one and the ſame Sovereign Pilate, <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf; and acted by one and the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Principles of <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Worldly Deſign,</hi> which is quite contrary to the Doctrine and Principles of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as well as that of our Bleſſed <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who renounced all Dominion in this World.</p>
            <p>So that it is moſt manifeſt, that neither the Doctrine nor Diſcipline of our Eſtabliſhed Religion can (without weakning, wounding, and betraying it ſelf) either countenance, or patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize any Enemies to our Government, though they all (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jeſuits, Sectaries</hi> or <hi>Jacobites)</hi> as Enemies to it, do abuſe, wreſt, and miſapply both our Doctrine and Diſcipline, as well as they do the Goſpel it ſelf, to juſtifie their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and carry on their own Deſigns.</p>

And we may appeal to the ſurviving Spectators of our late inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, unhappy Broils, how our Religion, and Government (as inſeparable Supporters of each other,) were by the ſame Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Methods, both overturn'd together; though the firſt <hi>Miners</hi> (thoſe of the <hi>Presbytery)</hi> were blown up themſelves by thoſe of the Congregational Way; who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſagreeing amongſt themſelves, who ſhould be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, brought all into <hi>Confuſion;</hi> leaving us for a while, without any ſetled Order, or Government in the Kingdom; till by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Revolution, our Religion and Government were both reſtored on their old Foundation.</p>
               <p>Wanting nothing but Reformation of Manners in its Members, and Harmony in Divine Worſhip, as the beſt Means to ſtem the Tide of Debauchery, and Profaneſs, in order to ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and to check and countermine the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Sectary</hi> on the other; ſo as to ſecure our ſetled Religion, and Government againſt the Subtilty and Malice of both.</p>
               <p>That inſtead of <hi>Emulation, Strife,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>contending</hi> who ſhall be uppermoſt, we might all, <hi>as Subjects of one Government, and Members of one National Communion,</hi> humble our ſelves under the mighty Hand of God, and provoke one another (in Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,) <hi>to Love, and to good Works;</hi> thereby to propagate the <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now as it cannot be denied, but the <hi>Presbyterians (laying the Blood of the Royal Martyr, at the door of thoſe of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Way)</hi> were the chief Inſtruments in that mighty Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo it is as plain, that what they did in order to it, was to eſtabliſh <hi>Presbytery</hi> here in this Kingdom.</p>

               <p>But though I ſhall not here queſtion from what Principle they acted therein; yet I may boldly ſay, that if they were real Friends and Well-wiſhers to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> they would as readily demonſtrate their impartial Affection and Loyalty to their Majeſties, to ſecure and ſupport them now in the Throne, as they are <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of our <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> by diſpoſing their Subjects to <hi>Harmony</hi> in Worſhip, the alone Seminary and Nurſery of true Loyalty and Union among our ſelves; and live in Charity with their conforming Brethren; peaceable, and content with the <hi>Indulgence</hi> allowed them, till a proper <hi>Medium</hi> may be found out for all to join in the ſame <hi>Communion,</hi> as Subjects and Children of one and the ſame Civil, and Politick <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>

And in the mean time, forbear to rail againſt, and cry down the innocent <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our Eſtabliſhed Religion, to create Offence in the Ignorant and the Weak, with Deſigns thereby to draw our Members into their Separation, as if the external way of Worſhip were the vital Subſtance in Religion.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially when the Church of <hi>England</hi> lays no more ſtreſs in any Rite or Ceremony, than Decency, and Order, (according to the Tenor of the Goſpel,) do require: And it is plain from the the 34th <hi>Article,</hi> that (as things indifferent) they may from time to time, be changed, altered, or abrogated, to promote Peace and Harmony in the Church; but not to be done by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit: And it is moſt manifeſt, our Holy and Reverend Governors are inclinable, nay, moſt deſirous, to comply with any reaſonable Demands in order thereto, if the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would agree among themſelves, and make their application, (as becomes Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,) to thoſe who are intruſted by the Government, in ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and weighty an Affair. We may juſtly (therefore) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a Woe againſt them that do hinder, nay, that do not (as much as in them lies) promote ſo great a Bleſſing to their Majeſties, and the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But what hopes can we now entertain, that <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhould ever unite with us; when they are ſo far from any ſuch Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Application in order to it, that (by Colour of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, but contrary to the Deſign of the Law-makers) they have ſet up their Standard in open defiance againſt it; Printing and publiſhing the <hi>Heads</hi> of their <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> and Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and the <hi>Congregational,</hi> (as irreconcileable as Fire and Water,) to encreaſe and multiply their <note n="*" place="margin">It is no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Cauſe by the Agreement, or Number of their Leaders: For had the Jeſuits but the ſame Scope, and Liberty, they would ſoon outſtrip them in their Union and Number, both of Leaders and Followers, having one and the ſame End and Deſign at the bottom, to undermine, and blow up our ſettled Religion and Government together; though theſe are the moſt dangerous, as owning the Doctrine of our Church, for a Blind to the ſhort-ſighted, the better to carry on their ſubtle Deſign againſt the Foundation.</note>

And yet at the ſame time (notwithſtanding the legal Teſt, and Qualification, by the Government enjoin'd) peremptorily challenging by Nature and Education (to uſe their own Words) an equal Right with their Fellow-Subjects, (complying with the Law,) to bear Offices, both Civil and Military, in the Government: Nay, ſo bigotted are many of their Followers now become under their Diſcipline, as to impoſe upon their Children, (as alſo upon our Members, if they will match into their Families,) tying them up in their Conjugal Contracts, to adhere to their ſeparate Way of worſhip, a good Expedient to advance Hypocriſie, but not to promote Chriſtianity or Sincerity.</p>
               <p>Certainly ſo long as we ſee them thus reſtleſs to ſeduce our Members, and bold in their Attempts, and Endeavours to ſhare in the Government, on Terms contrary to Law, which is, in effect, to pull down the Fences and Bulwarks of our Religion, and Government together, we may well conclude, (without breach of Charity,) that the Lamp of their Loyalty to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties will burn no longer than it is fed with the Oil of Inteteſt; and that, when their Deſigns are ripe, they will again make uſe of the carnal Weapon to overturn both our Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together.</p>

               <p>Religion <hi>then in General, is the Obligation we are under to</hi> God, <hi>the ſupreme Original of Being; and therefore implies all the Services we pay him, and all that Obedience we give to any Law for his ſake, and with reſpect to any Divine Attribute, (that is) to the Perfection of his Nature.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>This (in the general Notion of it) is natural to Man, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſpecifick Difference of humane Nature, rather than</hi> Reaſon; <hi>becauſe thoſe inferiour Creatures, who (governed by a divine Inſtinct) do in many things ſeem to vindicate, or ſhew ſome kind and degrees of Reaſoning, yet they make no colour of Religion; and therefore for defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in nothing ſo much as this, is Man, when he neglects</hi> Piety <hi>and</hi> Devotion, <hi>become like, or rather degenerated below the Beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Religion, <hi>I ſay then, is natural to Man as Man; for that there is (which none dare deny) a ſupremely excellent, and perfect Being, the Author of all things beſides, to whom their Government doth belong; and to whom therefore</hi> Worſhip <hi>is due; is a Truth, not only demonſtratively argued from the Works of</hi> Creation, <hi>and</hi> Providence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20 <hi>but a Truth impreſs'd on the Nature of</hi> Reaſonable Creatures, <hi>inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble totally from them, and conſequently, to be reckoned amongſt theſe</hi> Connate Notions <hi>which the Soul of Man both of things; which the Scripture ſtiles,</hi> The Law written in the Heart.</p>

               <p>The Senſe of a Deity <hi>therefore, and the</hi> venerable Regards <hi>ariſing from it, which we call</hi> Religion; <hi>I conclude to be natural to Man, a Notion, by our Maker wrought into the very Fabrick of our Mind, an eſſential Beam of that Coeval Light the Soul is indued with to diſcern things.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>The Root of Superſtition is</hi> Fear <hi>without</hi> Love; <hi>that is a Dread of Harm, if the Divine Power (or what is ſo apprehended to be, as the Object of our Worſhip,) be not appeaſed by ſuch and ſuch Services: This brought ſo many dreadful Sacrifices to the Altar at</hi> Tophet, <hi>and all the Heathen World over, and is the ſliviſh Principle obliging ſo many</hi> Corporal Severities, <hi>affected and uncommanded</hi> Auſterities, <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Repetition, and muttering Fopperies, as telling over Beads, at ſet times enjoin'd by the Prieſt, (Sacrifices to bribe a Deity,) and quiet the Murmurs of Conſcience, ſo much practiſed in the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now theſe three natural Seeds, or active Principles,</hi> Love, Fear, <hi>and</hi> Worldly Deſign, <hi>that thus nurſe up</hi> Religion <hi>into</hi> Beauty <hi>or</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, <hi>do ariſe from the various Apprehenſions we have of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Worſhip, which ought to be the true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if that be apprehended (as he really is)</hi> tranſcendently good, and amiable, willing and ready to be reconciled to Offenders; <hi>then the great Impreſſion it makes on the Mind, is</hi> LOVE, <hi>which cheriſhes</hi> Religion <hi>into</hi> Beauty, Perfection, and chearful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if it be apprehended as</hi> dreadful <hi>only, and able to do hurt, under the Attributes of</hi> Sovereign, <hi>but independent:</hi> Will and Power; <hi>then</hi> Fear <hi>is all the Temper it gives to the Mind; and this ferments the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of Religion into</hi> Superſtition, <hi>or a ſlaviſh Devotion, ſo (as I ſaid before) to worſhip God as the Heathen did their</hi> Daemons, <hi>for fear of harm, and to pacifie the Murmurs of Conſcience: For ſuch Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, though they believe the being of a God, yet in their Hearts wiſh there were none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:43745:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>But if there be few, or no Apprehenſions of Divine Attributes in the Mind to beget a</hi> real Love <hi>or</hi> Fear; <hi>then the Soul of Man is at liberty to make uſe of Religion, ſo far as ſerves</hi> Worldly Deſign, <hi>and this principles it with</hi> Hypocriſie, <hi>the Monster of the Age we live in, to be of one, two, or all</hi> Perſuaſions to ſerve a Turn, or carry on a Deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that</hi> Hypocriſie <hi>is nothing but</hi> Atheiſm <hi>diſſembled, under a Veil of Religion; and</hi> Atheiſm <hi>is nothing but</hi> Hypocriſie <hi>unmask'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if there be a God, the real Object of our Worſhip; (as we all pretend to believe there is;) doubtleſs our Religion ought to be</hi> real, <hi>and not</hi> hypocritical: For all Things are naked and open to his Eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if our Religion be a perfect, and acceptable Service; doubtleſs it ought to be</hi> chearful, <hi>and not</hi> ſlaviſh, <hi>as</hi> Superſtition <hi>is, which proceeds only from</hi> Fear <hi>without</hi> Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Goodneſs <hi>then, and</hi> all Perfection, <hi>be eſſential Attributes of a Divine Nature; (that is,) if Sovereign</hi> Power <hi>and</hi> Will <hi>be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from</hi> Goodneſs <hi>in</hi> God, <hi>and not its overmatch, as ſome would think; then God's</hi> Power <hi>is comfortable, and not dreadful, till his</hi> Goodneſs <hi>be abuſed and offended; ſo that all our Fears, and hard Thoughts of God do ariſe from our own Diſobedience to his Will made known, which nothing can remove, but our Repentance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For as his</hi> Mercy <hi>is over all his Works, and he would not have any to periſh; ſo he is</hi> juſt, <hi>and cannot approve of Iniquity in his Creatures; and when in obeying his Will, we have an inward Senſe of his</hi> Goodneſs and Love <hi>towards us, it begets in us a</hi> Love <hi>towards him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that</hi> Love <hi>is the proper and genuine Principle of that Religion, which is in its own Nature perfect, and to God moſt be acceptable, as is evident from the firſt and great Command,</hi> Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, Soul, and Strength, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as this</hi> Love <hi>of God is always attended with an awful</hi> Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>towards him, as our Father; which is a</hi> Child-like Fear <hi>of offending him:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So this</hi> Love <hi>of</hi> our Neighbour <hi>ought to be perfect</hi> Charity, <hi>and univerſal to all Mankind; eſpecially to ſuch, as are Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and not limited, reſtrained, or confined to any</hi> Herd <hi>or</hi> Sect, <hi>nor Mercenary; but as the Sun ſhines, giving out his Rays without expecting any Return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true, the Mind that is conſcious of offending, by Diſobedience and Abuſe of God's Goodneſs, has its Eye always Bloodſhot with</hi> Guilt <hi>and</hi> Fear; <hi>and therefore can behold nothing in God (for the preſent) but Power, and the Severities of his Juſtice; nor arrive at any Opinion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43745:9"/>
of God, but as powerful in order to Puniſhment. And ſuch as continue thus in wilful Diſobedience to the Will of God made known, do gradually harden themſelves, till they degenerate into</hi> Deſpair <hi>of Mercy, from whence proceeds</hi> Hatred <hi>of God and Goodneſs, which is</hi> final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is the Caſe of the Devils themſelves, who can now frame no Apprehenſions of God, but what are</hi> terrible, <hi>as appears by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Faith, which is to make them tremble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before the Goſpel the</hi> Moſaical Occonomy <hi>(or Worſhip) was not</hi> Superſtition <hi>but</hi> Imperfection. For the Law made nothing perfect; <hi>but is as a School Maſter to bring us to</hi> Chriſt. <hi>And</hi> Fear <hi>was that natural Temper which was impreſſed on the Mind, under the</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical <hi>Diſcipline, as a main impulſive</hi> Principle <hi>to the religious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it. And for that Reaſon we find Religion generally in the old Teſtament expreſſed by the</hi> Fear of God. Jacob <hi>calls God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the</hi> Fear <hi>of his Father</hi> Iſaac. <hi>And we may-aſſert, that</hi> Fear <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the predominant and active Principle in our Devotion, even now under the Goſpel, until God in Mercy gives us new Grounds of Hope for Pardon on our Repentance, as he hath done to all Mankind by his Son, whom he firſt promiſed, and in due time ſent him into the World, for this very end, to principle Men afreſh with the</hi> Love <hi>of God, which their Sin and Guilt had extinguiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For which End, we find the Propoſals, and Delivery of the Goſpel, are made after the ſweeteſt way of Invitation, as if it were in a wooing way of Intreaty:</hi> We, as Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, <hi>(ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,)</hi> as if God by us did beſeech you, we pray you to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which Account, Religion, through the whole Book of the New Teſtament, is expreſſed by the</hi> Love of God. <hi>And St.</hi> John <hi>tells us,</hi> He that feareth, <hi>(that is,) he that is chiefly acted by this Principle of Fear to Religion,)</hi> is not made perfect in <hi>LOVE, (that is,) he hath not yet attained to that inward Frame, or Affection of Mind,</hi> (LOVE;) <hi>which, of all others, is the moſt generous, and acceptable Principle of ſerving God. And 'tis from this Principle alone that we are enabled to</hi> hold the Faith in the Unity of the Spirit, and the Bond of Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Truth of both which do plainly appear from the Words of the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 8. We <hi>(Chriſtians under the Goſpel,)</hi> have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Bondage again unto Fear, <hi>as the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>did at the giving of the Law in a tremendous manner on Mount</hi> Sinai; but we have received the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>(the filial Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Children, excited in us by the pleaſing Invitation, and pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal direction of the Goſpel,)</hi> whereby we cry Abba Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which</hi> Love of God, <hi>in this merciful Act of Redemption, appears more fully to Men than it did before in Creation and Providence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43745:10"/>
becauſe 'tis ſuper-added thereunto, like a ſecond Beam of Light conjoin'd to a former, ſhines to all Eyes with a greater Luſtere, and therefore draws all hearts with a warmer Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All which is ſumm'd up by the Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, c. 3. v. 17, 18. That we being rooted and grounded in Love, might be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and heighth and depth, and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth Knowledge; <hi>that is, to knew the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuy of that Love of God diſcovered in Chriſt Jeſus, ſuper added to all the other Inſtances of Divine Goodneſs in Creation and Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from what hath been ſaid, we may judge our ſelves in Matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> and all other Opinions in Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to promote Religion in the World; whether we be <hi>ſincere Chriſtians,</hi> to worſhip God from this Principle of <hi>Love;</hi> or <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,</hi> to be dragg'd to our Duty from a ſlaviſh <hi>Fears,</hi> or <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arites</hi> to ſerve him for <hi>Worldly Deſign only:</hi> That is, in plain Engliſh, we have here a <hi>Teſt</hi> to try our <hi>Sincerity,</hi> whether we be <hi>true Chriſtians, bigotted Idolaters,</hi> or downright <hi>Knaves;</hi> for I take in, theſe three comprehend all Profeſſors of Religion.</p>
               <p>But that which we are here principally to obſerve, is this; That there is (as hath been ſaid) a natural Principle in the Soul of Man, is a coeval Light born with it, which we may call an <hi>Holy Awe</hi> of a <hi>Divine Power,</hi> from which ſprings in the Minds of Subjects, as naturally an <hi>Awe and Veneration</hi> towards <hi>Government,</hi> as a Shadow thereof in a <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> impreſs'd on Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Rulers, as God's Vicegerents, appointed as well for the Defence and Security of their Religion and Government, as of their Lives, Liberty and Property.</p>
               <p>Which natural Seed receives its Culture, and is nouriſhed up to greater Perfection from that Religion, under whoſe Diſcipline we receive our Education; which if it be <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Sincere,</hi> diſpoſes the Minds of the Subjects of its Communion to ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Conformity,</hi> and chearful <hi>Obedience</hi> to their Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to be willing to ſacrifice their Lives, and all they have, for the Honour and Safety of their <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> and their <hi>Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I know to be true; as I had the Happineſs to be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> of Parents, who brought me up in the Diſcipline and Nurture of our National Church: And I remember very well, that when a Child, and in Company with other Children, I have had ſuch a venerable Senſe of my Duty towards my Prince, and ſuch an Awe upon my Mind at the very ſound of his Name, as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43745:10"/>
that Moment whiſper'd in my Ear, <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>thy Thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is as plain, and our own Experience puts it out of doubt, that this religious and loyal Principle, thus at firſt inſeminated in the Mind, and afterwards by a Sincere and Orthodox Religion, cultivated and nouriſhed up to greater Perfection, may be as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vitiated, corrupted, and changed by a <hi>Jeſuitical Diſcipline,</hi> founding <hi>Dominion in Grace,</hi> the old <hi>Holy Cheat,</hi> whoſe predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and active Principle, notwithſtanding all their Pretences, is <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Worldly Deſign;</hi> and their whole Diſcipline runs counter to that of our bleſſed Redeemer, who renounced all <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in this World,</hi> commanding his Diſciples to render <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Tribute</hi> to Temporal <hi>Rulers and Governors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with theſe their ſubtle Baits, the Jeſuit and Sectary (as our own woful Experiences make good) do as naturally poiſon Subjects, and diſpoſe them with as keen a Zeal to Separation and Rebellion, as our Orthodox ſettled Religion and Diſcipline, did before to a loyal Conformity and chearful Obedience.</p>
               <p>In order to which they firſt in ſecret moſt falſely and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repreſent our Publick ſettled Worſhip and Diſcipline, as <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and a Relict of Popery,</hi> though all know, and our worſt Enemies have allowed it to be the beſt try'd <hi>Bulwork</hi> againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> And further to gain Proſelites to themſelves, they moſt maliciouſly meaſuring its Purity by the Scandal and Offence given by ſome of our Clergy, and the Vice and Immorality of the worſt Members of our Communion: And the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Deſigns, they diſplay, and lay open, and aggravate the Miſcarriages and Infirmities of our Magiſtrates and Rulers, nay of our Princes themſelves, and all their Miniſters, and Counſellors, ſparing none, though they be the very Pillars and Support of our Religion and Government, to render them odious and low in the Minds of the People, who from thence, as from their Oracle, are eaſily diſpoſed to ſpeak Evil of Dignities, and to vilifie, and revile our Governors with the moſt contemptible Language, the very <hi>Harbingers and Fore-runners of down-right Rebellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 'tis but dubbing themſelves the People of God; which 'tis the Intereſt of their Preachers to tell them they are, and their own Intereſt to believe; though they come far ſhort in the whole Courſe of their Lives, of many whom they call the Men of the World, in true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Morality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after that, they cannot dip into the Bible, but one Text or another will turn up for their purpoſe. If they are denied a Share in the Government, (though on Terms contrary to Law) they judge themſelves ſtripp'd of their Right by Nature and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43745:11"/>
to uſe their own Words, and hold it lawful, by Force, to take it from them that oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>And if they are puniſhed for Rebellion, they look on it as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and themſelves as Martyrs, and their Sufferings as a Mark of their Election: But when they ſucceed, and flouriſh in their proſperous Villany; then God works Miracles for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and the Saints are to poſſeſs the Earth.</p>
               <p>We may perceive by their late railing Pamphlets, they begin to revive their old Methods, to ſtir up the Rabble, and to tickle the Ears of the Vulgar; for they find ſolid and ſerious Treatiſes are too weak Artillery to accompliſh their cloſe and ſecret Deſigns; and therefore what they cannot do by <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> they think to compaſs by <hi>Satyr,</hi> and <hi>Railing;</hi> that they may at leaſt hedge in a Stake amongſt the Rabble; to whoſe Ignorance, all things are Wit, which are abuſive. And though the moſt Saint-like among their Party, dare not openly excuſe ſuch Contempt of our ſettled Religion, and Government; yet they are pleaſed with it, and in ſecret grin at it, with a pious Smile.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the <hi>Sectary,</hi> as well as the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is born with Teeth, ſcurrilous, and foul-mouth'd, from their Infancy; ſo that if <hi>Spiritual Pride, Contempt of Superiours,</hi> and <hi>Slander</hi> be Marks of Orthodox Belief, we may conclude ſuch as theſe to be—the moſt viſible Church in the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>From all which, we may conclude, and for our ſatisfaction therein, appeal to every unbiaſſed Mind, That it is impoſſible for any Government in the World, to ſupport, or ſecure it ſelf long, againſt ſuch ſecret, and ſubtil Enemies, in its Boſome, without a ſettled, orthodox Religion eſtabliſhed, and inſeparably annexed unto it.</p>
               <p>Which is as eſſentially neceſſary to the Body Politick, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Food, Nurture, and Phyſick, is to the Natural, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and fortifie its Conſtitution, againſt the Contagion, and virulent Poiſon of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Sectaries:</hi> And to Train up, and Diſcipline its Members (as in a ſacred Nurſery,) for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Supply of ſound Pillars to bear up Poſterity.</p>
               <p>And that our Religion Eſtabliſhed in our National Church, is ſuch an orthodox, and ſincere Religion, let the worſt of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be Judges.</p>
               <p>As it <hi>commands, and commends all that is good; forbids, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all that is evil; moſt powerfully excites to a holy Life; hath Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for all that profeſs Chriſtianity,</hi> (though of different Perſuaſions,) if holy, and peaceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is founded in the pure Evangelical Principle of Love; the Center of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and Cement of Chriſtianity; and not in a ſolitary, ſlaviſh

Fear, the Principle of Popery, and Superſtition;</hi> nor in <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> that low, and baſe Principle, of worldly <hi>Deſign, Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> which is indeed <hi>down-right Knavery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, as we ought, and as our holy Religion doth both teach, and oblige us, to prefer our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Prince,</hi> and our <hi>Countrey,</hi> before our own <hi>Safety;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How careful ought we to be in the Choice of our Publick <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> as not only the Prop, and Pillars; but the very: Guardians of our Eſtabliſhed Religion, and Government, againſt the Malice, and ſubtil Deſigns of our implacable Enemies, the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and <hi>Sectary.</hi>
