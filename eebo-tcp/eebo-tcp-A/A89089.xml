            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Dr. Merrett <hi>Aged</hi> 81. <hi>and upwards, Dr. in Phyſick, of</hi> Oxford 53. <hi>Years, Practitioner in</hi> London <hi>from the Year</hi> 1638. <hi>Fellow of both the</hi> Royal Societies, <hi>Keeper of</hi> Dr. Harvey<hi>'s</hi> Muſaeum <hi>in the College of Phyſicians, Cenſor Eleven Years, which never but one ever was,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>makes to his Pariſh of</hi> St. Andrews Holbourn <hi>this Propoſition following,</hi> viz.</head>
            <p>THat he will give without Demand of any Reward, to 150 Perſons, Medicines of his own making, in all Fevers, Fluxes whatſoever; which are the two Heads of Diſeaſes moſt Mortal every where, eſpecially in this Seaſon of the Year? He excepts all Invaders, which the Law calls Empericks, <hi>viz.</hi> Apothecaries, Chirurgeons, and all inferior Interlopers, becauſe he well knows, they will play all the Tricks that Malice and Fancy can Invent; which with all care and diligence he will prevent.</p>
            <p>He will give Advice to no more than ten in a Day, till the aforeſaid number is Completed.</p>
            <p>He expects that all thoſe who are able ſhould come to his Houſe in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> near the Chappel, thoſe that are not, he will Viſit within the Circuit of the <hi>Garden,</hi> if further from him, he expects a Coach.</p>
            <p>Not that he excludes any other, that are not Pariſhioners, during the aforeſaid time, but to ſuch he will give his Medicines and his Advice together, at the ſame rate found in Apothecaries Bills, and with better ſucceſs than any of the Shop Medicines, and fewer of them in every Caſe; and promiſes to take but three ſhillings a Quart for a Cordial call'd Pearl, which the Apothecaries make them pay ten or twelve Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for the ſame quantity, and much the like rate in other Medicines.</p>
            <p>His Cures are performed in a ſhort time in acute or other ſhort Diſeaſes, without Dangerous and Mortal <hi>Opium,</hi> never us'd by him; rarely any Chymical Medicine, or any other of the Shops; or Jeſuits Bark, painful Bliſters, Cupping-Glaſſes, Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, violent Vomits, Purges, or Bleeding. His Medicines are ſimple, grateful, ſafe, and moſt agreeable.</p>
            <p>Whereas his Adverſaries give out, that he will not Conſult Phyſicians, he never refus'd, nor ſhall not; ſo that the Conſultation be according to the Statutes of the College, <hi>viz.</hi> in Latin; and therein inquiry to be made into the Diſeaſe, the Cauſe and Symptoms of it; and a right Application of Remedies to them all; <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>indicans</hi> and <hi>indicatum,</hi> the ſole Chariſtical mark of a Complete Phyſician, and the diſtinction of him from all other, whether Rational or Emperical; for both the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pretend alike to uncertain Experience, but to ſenſible and unqueſtionable trials, <hi>à priori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He deſires the Chriſtian and Ingenious Reader, not to take up falſe Reports, and credit them, without clear Evidence of the Truth, or falſe Concluſions from bare words or feigned Actions; which he will clear to any that ſhall declare them, and ſatisfy the ſcrupulous with thanks.</p>
            <p>He will ſhortly Republiſh his Character of a Complete Phyſician, and the Frauds of Apothecaries, a third Edition, and thereto his way in general of his attainment of the top of his Art; the Knowledge of ſimples <hi>à priori;</hi> long ſought for, but never attain'd by any; as the Learned, and true Phyſician, or Naturaliſt, Dr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, but by his Writings, affirms in his Excellent Preface to his Book of Diſeaſes, and all other Phyſicians I have read.</p>
            <p>Whereas in ſix Libels againſt my Book of the Frauds of Apothecaries, each Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler inſinuated tacitly a Scandal againſt me, I cannot but expect another from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges putting me out; both which ſhall be anſwer'd in my aforeſaid Book, to the Eternal ſhame of my Adverſaries. The Reader therefore is requeſted to ſuſpend his Belief till the Narration be Publiſht out of their own Records and other Courts of Law; and the Author declares, he will Anſwer no Nameleſs Libels.</p>
            <p>To Anſwer the Objections of many, I have, by this Propoſal, ſet my Candle on a Candleſtick, and ſuffer'd my light to ſhine before Men, that God might be glorified, and Men benefited by my continued ſtubborn labour, and great Expences I have been at to attain this great Light; eſpecially to incourage Men of my own Faculty to the like Undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His hours of Attendance ſhall be from Nine in the Morning to Twelve, and from Two to Five in the Afternoon.</hi>
