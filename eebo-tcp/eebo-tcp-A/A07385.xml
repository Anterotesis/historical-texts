            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God (wherein this <hi>Sanctity</hi> conſiſts) be

               <p>To erect and ſet apart ſuch places as
theſe for the exerciſe of the Rites of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is derived from the inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and approved of God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
It began not with that Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
or ambulatorie Temple which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
cauſed to be made by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at Mount Sinai; but was much more
ancient. <hi>Noah</hi> built an <hi>Altar,</hi> as ſoone as
he came out of the <hi>Ark: Abraham, Iſaak,</hi>
and <hi>Iacob,</hi> (whereſoever they came to pitch
their Tents) erected places for divine
worſhip, (that is, Altars with their ſepts
and encloſures) without any ſpeciall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
from God. <hi>Iaakob</hi> in particular
vowed a place for divine worſhip, by the
name of <hi>Gods Houſe,</hi> where he would pay
the tithes of all that God ſhould give him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. Loe here a Church endowed!
Yea <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 7. before the
Ark and that glorious Tabernacle were
yet made, pitched a Tabernacle, for the
ſame purpoſe, without the Campe, <q>

every one that ſought the Lord</hi>
                  </q> was to
go. And all this was done <hi>tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recepti mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
as a thing of cuſtome, and as mankinde
by tradition had learned to accommodate
the worſhip of their God, by appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſome place to that uſe; nature teaching
them, that the work was honoured and
dignified by the peculiarneſſe of the place
appointed for the ſame, and that if any
work were ſo to be honoured, there was
nothing it more beſeemed, than the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and ſervice of Almightie God, the
moſt peculiar and incommunicable act of
all other.</p>
               <p>Nay more than this: It was beleeved
in thoſe elder times, that that Country or
Territory, wherein no Place was ſet apart
for the worſhip of God, was unhallowed
and uncleane. Which I think, I rightly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from that Story in the Book of <hi>Joſua,</hi>
of the Altar built by <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi> and the
half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> upon the bank of

being by the River Jordan cut off
from the land of Canaan, where the Lords
Tabernacle was, and ſo having no place
therein conſecrated to the worſhip of their
God, might otherwiſe be an uncleane and
unhallowed habitation. Heare the words
of <hi>Phineas</hi> and the Princes ſent to diſſwade
them, <hi>Ioſua</hi> 22. 19 and judge whether they

what it is; whence can we learne
better, than from that which the Lord
ſpake unto <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 20. immediately
after he had pronounced the Decalogue
from Mount Sinai: where premiſing, that
they <q>
                     <hi>ſhould not make with Him gods of
gold and gods of ſilver; but that they ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22900:5"/>
make him an Altar of earth</hi> (as namely their
ambulatory ſtate then permitted, otherwiſe
of ſtone) <hi>and thereon ſacrifice their burnt
offerings and peace-offerings:</hi> he addes; <hi>In
all places where I record my Name, I will
come unto thee and bleſſe thee,</hi>

                     <hi>In every place where the

                  </q>
or, whereſoever that is, which I have, or
ſhall appoint to be the remembrance or
memoriall of my Name and preſence,
there I will come unto thee, and bleſſe
thee. Loe here a deſcription of the Place
ſet apart for divine worſhip: It is the Place
where God records his Name, and comes
unto men to bleſſe them. Two things are
here ſpecified; the monument, record or
memoriall of Gods Name: ſecondly, His
coming or meeting there with men. Of
both let us enquire diſtinctly, what they
meane.</p>
               <p>I know, it would not be untrue, to ſay
in generall, that Gods Name is recorded
or remembred in that place upon which
his Name is called, or which is called by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22900:6"/>
his Name (as the Scripture ſpeakes) that is,
which is dedicate to his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
but there is ſome more ſpeciall thing
intended here; namely, the Memoriall or
Monument of Gods Name, is that token
or Symbole whereby he teſtifieth his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and commerce with men. Now
although the Ark called the Ark of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or Teſtimonie (wherein lay the
two Tables <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i.<note place="margin">Heb. 9 4.</note> the Book or Articles of the
Covenant, and Manna, the Bread of the
Covenant) were afterwards made for this
purpoſe, to be the ſtanding Memoriall of
Gods Name and preſence with his people
yet cannot that be here, either onely, or
ſpecially aimed at; becauſe when theſe
words were ſpoken, it had no being, nor
was there yet any commandement given
concerning the making thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Record here mentioned, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

Memoriall, whereby Gods Covenant and
commerce with men was teſtified: Such

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22900:6"/>
which therefore may ſeeme to be in ſome

unto. For that theſe were Rites of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
whereby the Name of God was
commemorated or recorded, and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with men renewed and teſtified,
might be eaſily proved. Whence it is, that
that which was burned upon the Altar
is ſo often called the <hi>Memoriall;</hi> as in <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi>

tyed to one onely Place, as thoſe under the

is not alwaies actually preſent in our

thoſe in the Law were in the Temple. I
anſwer; It is enough, it is wont to be; as
the Chaire of eſtate loſes not its relation
and due reſpect, though the King be not
alwaies there. And remember, that the
Ark of the Covenant was not in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
when <hi>Daniel</hi> opened his windows
and prayed thitherward; yea that it was
wanting in the Holy Place (I meane that
ſacred Cabinet made by <hi>Moſes</hi>) all the time
of the ſecond (or <hi>Zorobabels</hi>) Temple,
and yet the place eſteemed notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as if it had been there.</p>
               <p>You will yet except and ſay; That in
the Old Teſtament thoſe things were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22900:8"/>
by divine Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but in the New we finde no ſuch
thing. I anſwer, in things for which we
finde no new Rule given in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
there we are referred and left to
the <hi>analogy</hi> of the Old. This the Apoſtles
proof taken from thence for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Miniſters of the Goſpell,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. [<hi>viz.</hi> Thus were they, <hi>Ergo</hi> ſo God
hath ordained that we] will give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand:
likewiſe the practice of the
Church in baptizing Infants, derived ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the <hi>analogie</hi> of Circumciſion: The
hallowing of every firſt day of the week,
as one in every <hi>ſeven,</hi> from the <hi>analogie</hi> of
the Jewiſh Sabbath, and other the like.

from the Old Teſtament: that which

                  </q> For we are
to conſider, that the end of Chriſts coming
into the world was not properly to give
new lawes unto men, but to accompliſh
the Law already given, and to publiſh the
Goſpell of reconciliation,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 17, 18</note> through his
Name, to thoſe who had tranſgreſſed it.
Whence it is that we finde not the ſtyle of
the New Teſtament to carry a forme of
enacting Lawes, almoſt any where: but
thoſe vvhich are there mentioned, to be
brought in occaſionally, onely by vvay of
proofe, of interpretation, exhortation,
application, or the like, and not as by vvay
of conſtitution or re-enacting. Meane
vvhile, leſt I ſhould be miſtaken, mark vvell
that I ſaid not, the Old Teſtament vvas to

but the Analogy thereof onely; that is, this
regulation is to be made according to that
proportion, vvhich the difference of the
two Covenants, and the things in them
admits, and no further; the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus WE have ſeene, what is
the condition and property of
that Place, which in my Text
is called <hi>Gods Houſe.</hi> But before
I proceed to ſpeak of the Duty of thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22900:10"/>
who come thither (which was the ſecond
thing I propounded) there is one thing yet
to be cleared, concerning that which I laſt
mentioned; namely, How God is ſaid <hi>to
come unto,</hi> to be preſent with men in one
place more than another; ſeeing his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
fils every place, heaven being his
throne, and the whole earth his footſtoole.
For although we read often in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſuch a SHECINAH or ſpeciali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the divine preſence, and have it often
in our mouthes; yet, what it is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Ratio</hi> thereof conſiſteth, is ſeldome,
if at all, enquired into. When we ſpeak of
Churches, we content our ſelves to ſay,
that Gods ſpeciall preſence there is in his
Word and Sacraments: But though it be
true, that the Divine Majeſty is there ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
preſent where his Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are; yet ſeemes not this ſpeciality of
preſence to be the ſame with his Word and
Sacraments, but a diverſe relation from
them. This may be gathered, in ſome ſort,
out of thoſe words of <hi>Exodus,</hi> whereupon
we have ſo long dwelt, as where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:22900:11"/>
of Gods Name, and his coming
thither, are ſpoken of as two: but is more
ſtrongly evinced by ſuch inſtances of
Scripture, where the Lord is ſaid to have
been ſpecially preſent in places where this
Record of his Word and Sacraments was
not; as for example, to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh,
to <hi>Iaacob</hi> at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the like. The true
<hi>Ratio</hi> therefore of this SHECINAH or
Speciality of divine preſence muſt bee
ſought, and defined by ſomething which
is common to al theſe, and not by that
which is proper to ſome onely.</p>
               <p>Well then, to hold you no longer in
ſuſpenſe: this Specification of the divine
preſence, whereby God is ſaid to be in one
place more than another; I ſuppoſe (under
correction) to conſiſt in his <hi>traine</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</hi>
A King is there where his Court is,
where his <hi>traine and retinue</hi> are: So God
the Lord of Hoſts is there ſpecially preſent,
where the heavenly <hi>Guard,</hi> the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
keep their ſacred ſtation and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
               <p>That this is conſonant to the revelation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:22900:11"/>
of holy Scripture, I ſhew firſt from the
collection of inference which the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
<hi>Iacob</hi> makes, upon that divine viſion
of his at Bethel:<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> where having ſeen a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
reaching from heaven to earth, and the
Angels of God aſcending and deſcending
upon it: <q>
                     <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord is in
this place, and I knew it not. How dreadfull
is this place! It is no other but the Houſe of
God, even the gate of heaven;</hi>
                  </q> that is, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
Guildnall,</hi> Heavens Court; namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Angels. For the Gate was
wont to be the Judgement Hall, and the
Place where Kings and Senators uſed to
ſit, attended by their guard and miniſters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I prove it from that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
expreſſion uſed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords deſcent upon Mount
Sinai, when the Law was given; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>Nor is it to be overpaſſed, that the Jews

they have no other memoriall of his

               <p>You will ſay; Such a preſence of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
perhaps there was in that Temple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>Becauſe of the Angels.</hi> If any ſhall ſay, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
were then, they will not beleeve
there is any ſuch kinde of preſence in our
Churches now: I muſt tell them; If it be
ſo, it is becauſe of our irreverent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
behaviour in them, which makes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:22900:18"/>
thoſe bleſſed ſpirits loath our companie.
For though they be inviſible and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
creatures, yet can they not look into
our hearts, (that is God their Maſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative)
but are witneſſes of our outward
behaviour and actions onely; and it was
a caſe of externall decorum, wherein the
Apoſtle mentions this preſence of theirs
for a motive or reaſon: <q>
                     <hi>For this cauſe ought
the woman to have a covering on her head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Angels.</hi>
                  </q> For they love not to
behold any thing that is uncomely and
unbeſeeming, but flye from it: and if we
loſe their company, the beſt members of
our congregation are wanting.</p>
               <p>Thus you have heard what is the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and prerogative of Gods Houſe. Who
now that conſiders and beleeves this, (and
there was a time when it was beleeved)
will not ſay with the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> when
he ſaw the Angels aſcending and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at Bethel, <hi>Quam reverenda ſunt haec lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca!
How reverend are theſe places!</hi> For every

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22900:19"/>
aſcending and deſcending, that is, God in

men. How ſeemly therefore, orderly and
awfully ſhould we compoſe our ſelves in
them? how reverent ſhould our manner
be at our coming into them? which is the
ſecond thing I propounded to ſpeake of.
Thus much therefore of Gods Houſe; I

were an admonition onely of the divine

               <p>Now the religious guiſe of the Jewes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:22900:24"/>
and other Nations of the Orient, having
anciently beene (and ſtill being) ſuch as
you have heard, when they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Temples, or remained in them;
the words of my text, <hi>Look to thy foot or feet,</hi>
being taken for an expreſſion borrowed
from, and alluding thereto, will have the
ſame ſenſe; as if we, inflecting them to
our manners, ſhould ſay; <hi>Look unto thy head</hi>
(.i. <hi>have a care thy head be fitted as it ought to
be) when thou comeſt into the Houſe of God;</hi>
meaning that he ſhould put off his hat, or
be uncovered, when he comes thither, and
uſe ſuch other reverence, as is wont to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it. For know, that the Holy
Ghoſt, mentioning or ſpecifying but one
rite, is yet ſo to be underſtood, as implying
therewith the reſt of the ſame order accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to goe with it; according to that
uſuall trope of Scripture, by a part, or that
which is more notable or obvious in any
kinde or rank of things to imply the reſt;
the rule whereby we interpret the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
and is the more fitly appliable here,
becauſe this guiſe of Diſcalceation was a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:22900:24"/>
leading ceremonie to the other geſtures of
ſacred veneration then uſed, as that of <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the hat</hi> (in civill uſe at leaſt) is wont
to be with us. Not as if <hi>Solomon</hi> or the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt in this Admonition intended the
outward ceremonie onely, and no more,
(that were ridiculous to imagine) but the
whole act of ſacred reverence commenced
in the heart and affection, whereof this
was the accuſtomed and leading geſture:
to wit, the very ſame, and all that which
the Lord commandeth in that originall
law, <hi>Levit. 19. 30. Sanctuarium meum reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remini,
Reverence my Sanctuary;</hi> which <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans
Targum</hi> explaineth; <hi>Ye ſhall goe to the
Houſe of my Sanctuary with reverence; Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
paralleleth here with, <hi>Look to thy foot
when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God.</hi> For ſo is
the maner of Scripture almoſt everywhere,
under the name of the geſture onely, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
and imply the whole dutie of
veneration, which ſuch geſture repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and importeth.</p>
               <p>But as this is moſt true, ſo is it on the other
ſide as falſe, if any ſhal from hence collect,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22900:25"/>
That therefore the outward worſhip may
ſecurely bee neglected (in time and place
where and when it may be done) ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be performed. Nay the contrary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
For if the inward worſhip be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended, when the outward or bodily
is onely named, as it is granted; is it not
then abſurd to imagine, that where that
which is not expreſly named is meant,
there that which is only mentioned ſhould
be excluded? Nay ſurely, where the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is mentioned (as here in my Text)
there no doubt, but the outward, in one
kinde or other, is a part of the dutie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
whatſoever beſides it bee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And becauſe it is a diſeaſe almoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to our time (for our forefathers were
moſtly ſick of the other extreme) ſo farre
to ſleight and diſeſteeme (that I may not
ſay, diſdaine) the worſhip of God by the
body, as to think it may be omitted and
neglected, even in time and place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
as in Gods Houſe and publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
without all guilt of ſinne: Give me
therefore leave to propound a few conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22900:25"/>
for the cure of ſuch as are ſick
of that maladie. For as that which ſeemes
but ſome lighter ſymptome at the firſt, if
the cure thereof be neglected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
often times proves fatal, and deſtroyes
life it ſelfe; ſo may this. I would have them
therefore conſider;</p>
               <p>1. That we all looke not onely for the
glorification of our ſoules, but of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the life to come: Now a reward
preſuppoſeth a work. It is meet and right
therefore we ſhould worſhip and glorifie
God here in this life with the bodie as wel
as the ſoule, if we looke that God ſhould
one day glorifie both.</p>
               <p>2. That as the outward worſhip without
the inward is dead, ſo the inward without
the outward is not complete; even as the
glorification of the ſoule ſeparate from the
bodie is not, nor ſhall not be conſummate,
till the bodie be againe united unto it.</p>
               <p>3. That thoſe who derogate ſo much
from bodily worſhip, in the ſervice of
the true GOD, as kneeling, bowing,
and the like, make by conſequent Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:22900:26"/>
a ſin farre leſſe hainous in degree than
it is. For is not Idolatrie to communicate
that honour with a creature, which is due
unto the Creator alone? By how much
therefore the worſhip of geſture and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is leſſe due unto God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do our
homage unto him; by ſo much is the ſin the
leſſe hainous and grievous, when the ſame
is given unto an Idol. For I beleeve, they
vvill not deny, but part of the ſin of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
conſiſts even in the outward worſhip
given unto an Idol, as kneeling, bowing,
and falling down before it, and the like.</p>
               <p>4. Laſtly, that although bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
being conſidered in it ſelf, be one of
the <hi>minor a legis,</hi> of the leſſer things of the
law, and the honour done unto God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
of no great value (though not of none)
in his fight: yet may a voluntary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
neglect, even of ſo ſmall a duty,
be a great and hainous ſin; becauſe ſuch a
neglect proceeds from a prophane diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and election of the heart. For a ſin is
not alwayes to be eſteemed according to
the value of the duty omitted, but from the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:22900:26"/>
hearts election in omitting it. <hi>Non eſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

               <p>Now therefore to returne to my hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.
By that which hath beene delivered
it appeares, That it is not onely lawfull to

come into Gods Houſe (which yet ſome
think, they are very liberall, if they grant)
but that it is a duty commanded by God
himſelfe, and ſo no will-worſhip: As

Whatſoever is dedicated unto God,
in generall, or (to ſpeake in the phraſe of
Scripture) whatſoever is called by his

ought to be uſed with a different reſpect
from things common: and Gods Houſe
(as you have heard) hath ſomething ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
from the reſt. Should wee then come
into it, as into a Barne or Stable? It was
not once good manners ſo to come into a

it a part of religious manners to doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:22900:27"/>
anſwerable, when we come into
the Houſe of God? that is, to <hi>bleſſe</hi> the
Maſter thereof (you know, how farre that
word extendeth) and if not to ſay, <hi>God be
here,</hi> (which hath beene the forme, and is
ſomewhere ſtill, when we enter into a

<hi>God is here,</hi> and to teſtifie in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or other, as the Saints of God were
wont to doe, that we acknowledge it; and
that both at our firſt coming thither, and
while we continue there; for the one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

me, what other geſture I implyed thereby,
as fitting to accompany this, in the caſe we
ſpeak of: I anſwer, That belongs to the
diſcretion of our Superiours, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church to appoint, not to

liberty to ordaine (having reſpect to the
analogy of the old Teſtament) what ſhe
ſhall judge moſt ſutable and agreeable to
the time, place, and manners of the people
where ſhe lives. But if I may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or preſumption, ſpeak what I think;
then I ſay, That adoration, or bowing of
the body, with ſome ſhort ejaculation,
(which the Church of Iſrael uſed in their
Temple, together with diſcalceation, and
which the Chriſtians of the Orient uſe at
this day, and time out of minde have done
at their ingreſſe into their Churches) is of
all other the moſt ſeemly, ready and fitting
to our maners: which yet I ſubmit: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

into the Church, before we joine with
the congregation. For we ſhould (ſay they)
rather heare and liſten to what the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

than what ſo looſe a notion importeth;
namely of ſuch as were then uſed in the

ſenſe of theirs directly thwarts the purport
and meaning of the words going before:
which is, that we ought to uſe ſome ſigne
of reverence when we come into the houſe
of God; ſuch, as according to the cuſtome
of the Weſt, is this. But though none of

The caſe is cleere.</p>
               <p>But was not the offering of Sacrifice,

due unto the divine Law? How come
they then to be thus oppoſed one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Give mee leave therefore, before I
give my full explication of this paſſage, to
enquire and conſider of ſome others, of
much more difficultie in this reſpect, yet
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22900:30"/>
their meaning conducing to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are divers places in Scripture diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging
and vilifying ſacrifices; yea ſo
farre, as if ſacrifice were a ſervice, which
God neither appointed nor approved. As
Pſal.</hi> 51. <q>Thou deſireſt not ſacrifice (<hi>ſaith</hi>
David,) elſe would I have given it thee; but
thou delighteſt not in burnt-offerings. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

and contrite heart, O God thou wilt not deſpiſe.
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 6. I will have mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
<hi>Michah 6. verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Wherewith
ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelfe

my tranſgreſsion, the fruit of my body for the
ſin of my ſoule? 8. He hath ſhewed thee, O
man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</q>
                  <hi>Nay</hi> Ier. 7. ver. 21, 22. <hi>he ſeemes to ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22900:30"/>
that he never commanded them:</hi>
                  <q>Put (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) your burnt-offerings unto your
ſacrifices, and eat fleſh. For I ſpake not unto
your Fathers, nor commanded them, in the day
that I brought them out of the land of Aegypt,
concerning burnt offerings and ſacrifices: But
this thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my
voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be
my people: and walke ye in the wayes that I
have commanded you, that it may bee well
with you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet nothing is more plaine, than that
God ordained Sacrifices at Mount Sinai.
How then ſhall this difficulty be reſolved?
Some, and thoſe of the ancients too, have
affirmed, that theſe ordinances of Sacrifice
were not given to Iſrael at firſt, nor <hi>prima
intentione Dei;</hi> but were (as they call them)
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſuperinducta,</hi> afterwards impoſed
upon them, when they had committed
idolatry in making and worſhipping the
golden Calfe. But the contrary to this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
apparant. For to paſſe by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi>
ſacrifices, and the ſacrifices of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi>
when the Lord pronounced the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:22900:31"/>
Decalogue from Mount Sinai, he added
this, as it were an appendix thereto: <q>
                     <hi>Ye
ſhall not make with me gods of ſilver, neither
ſhall ye make unto you gods of gold: Onely an
Altar thou ſhalt make unto me, and ſhalt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy
peace-offerings, thy ſheep, and thine oxen, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
and this before <hi>Moſes</hi> came downe from
the Mount, or the Calfe was yet made.
Nay, more than all this, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> were ſent unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the effect of
their Embaſſie was,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 18. &amp; 5. 1, 3, 8.</note>

ſaith, Let my people go, that they may</hi>
ſacrifice <hi>unto me, three dayes journey in the
wilderneſſe.</hi>
                  </q>; And when <hi>Pharaob</hi> would
have given them leave to have ſacrificed
to their God in the Land:<note place="margin">Exod. 8. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>No</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>)
<q>
                     <hi>we will go three dayes journey into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
and there</hi> ſacrifice <hi>to the Lord our
God, as he hath</hi> commanded <hi>us.</hi>
                  </q> What
ſhall we anſwer then to thoſe paſſages of
Scripture, where God diſclaimeth ſacrifice,
ſaying, hee required no ſuch ſervice at
his peoples hands; yea, that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them no ſuch thing, when hee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:22900:31"/>
brought them out of the Land of Aegypt?</p>
               <p>For the aſſoyling of this difficultie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the differing qualitie of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
which are, or may be produced to
this purpoſe, I lay downe theſe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
1. That, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
and genius of the Hebrew tongue,
a Comparative ſenſe is often expreſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the forme of an Antitheſis: As in that
of <hi>Ioel,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
                  </q>
that is, more, or rather than your
garments. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 10. <q>
                     <hi>Receive my inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and not ſilver:</hi>
                  </q> that is, rather than ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
as the words following teach us to
conſtrue it: <q>
                     <hi>And knowledge rather than
choice gold.</hi>
                  </q> Likewiſe in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<q>
                     <hi>Lay not up treaſures for your ſelves
on earth, but lay up for your ſelves treaſures in
heaven.</hi>
                  </q> i. Treaſures in heaven, rather than
treaſures on earth; have more care to lay up
the one, than the other.</p>
               <p>According to this conſtruction onely,
without more adoe, ſome of the aforeſaid
paſſages will be diſcharged of their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
as namely that of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>I deſired
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22900:32"/>
mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi>
                  </q> .i. more or rather
than ſacrifice; as the following words
give us to underſtand, which are: <q>
                     <hi>And
the knowledge of God more than burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
                  </q>
and according as the ſame ſenſe is
elſewhere expreſſed; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 3. <q>
                     <hi>To
do juſtice and judgement is more acceptable to
the Lord, than ſacrifice.</hi>
                  </q> But all will not be
thus ſalved.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I lay down this ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
That <hi>antecedenter</hi> it is true, that
God commanded not ſacrifice ſhould be
offered unto him, neither when the Law
was given, nor before; but <hi>conſequenter,</hi>
conſequently onely. For the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereof, we muſt know, That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was a rite whereby men renewed a
covenant with God, by making attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their ſinne. Therefore it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a breach and tranſgreſſion of the
Law. But the will of God was not, that
men ſhould tranſgreſſe his Law, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the covenant he had made with them,
but that they ſhould obſerve and keep it;
which if they did, ſacrifice would have no
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22900:32"/>
place. This is that I meane, when I ſay,
That God required not, nor commanded
ſacrifice antecedently, but that men
ſhould keep his Commandments. But in
caſe ſinne were committed, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of his covenant violated, then and in
ſuch a ſtate God ordained, and admitted of
Sacrifice for a rite of attonement and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>integration
of his covenant with men:
that is, he commanded Sacrifice onely <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequenter,</hi>
as a remedy if ſinne were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
And if thoſe Ancients could bee
thus underſtood, who ſay, that ſacrifice
was not ordained when the Law was
firſt given, but after it was tranſgreſſed;
namely, if their meaning were onely, that
the ordinance of ſacrifice preſuppoſed a
tranſgreſſion of the Law, then their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were true; but otherwiſe hiſtorically
taken, it cannot be defended. Now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this propoſition is that of <hi>Ieremy</hi>
chap. 7. to be underſtood, (or if there bee
any other like it:) <q>
                     <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
nor commanded them, in the day that
I brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22900:33"/>
burnt-offerings and ſacrifices: But
this thing commanded I them; Obey my voice,
and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and walke yee in all the wayes that I
have commanded you, that it may bee well
with you.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>My third propoſition is this: That
when ſacrifice was to be offered, in caſe of
ſinne; yet even then God accepted not
thereof <hi>primariò,</hi> primarily and for it ſelfe;
as though any refreſhment or emolument
accrued to him thereby, (as the Gentiles
fondly ſuppoſed of their gods) but ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily
onely, as a teſtimony of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the offerer, deſiring, with humble
repentance, to glorifie him with a preſent,
and by that rite to renew a covenant with
him. For Sacrifice (as I have ſaid) was
<hi>oblatio foederalis.</hi> Now Almighty God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
a covenant with, or receiveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into his favour, none but the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
ſinner, and therefore accepts of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in no other regard, but as a token and
effect of this. Otherwiſe it is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto him, as whereby men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22900:33"/>
a deſire of being reconciled unto
God, when they had offended him, and
yet had no ſuch meaning. Hence God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
all ſacrifices wherein there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
nor purpoſe to forſake ſinne, and
keep his commandments, which are the
parts of repentance. So is to bee taken
that in the firſt of <hi>Iſay:</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>To what purpoſe is
the multitude of your ſacrifices?—Bring
no more vaine oblations; incenſe is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto me—Waſh ye, make you
cleane, put away the evill of your doings from
before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evill—then</hi>
(if you offer ſacrifice unto me) <hi>though your
ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as
ſnow, &amp;c.—</hi> And that <hi>Iſay</hi> the laſt:
<hi>To this man I look, to him that is poore and of
a contrite ſpirit. Hee that killeth an oxe</hi>
(namely otherwiſe) <hi>is as if he ſlew a man:
be that ſacrificeth a lamb</hi> (unleſſe he comes
with this diſpoſition) <hi>as if he cut off a dogs
neck, he that offereth an oblation, as if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
bloud, he that burneth incenſe, as if he
bleſſed an Idoll.</hi>
                  </q> And ſurely, he that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
an Idoll, is ſo farre from renewing a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:22900:34"/>
covenant with the Lord his God, that he
breakes it. So did they, who without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of repentance preſumed to come
before him with a ſacrifice, not procure
attonement, but aggravate their breach.</p>
               <p>According to one of theſe three ſenſes
are all paſſages in the Old Teſtament, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging
and rejecting ſacrifices, literally
to be underſtood: Namely, when men
preferred them before the greater things of
the law; valued them out of their degree,
as an antecedent duty; or placed their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in the naked rite, as if ought accrued
to God thereby: God would no longer
owne them for any ordinance of his; nor
indeed in that diſguiſe put upon them
were they. I will except onely one paſſage
out of the number, which I ſuppoſe to
have a ſingular meaning; to wit, that of
<hi>David</hi> in the 51. Pſalme, which the ancient
tranſlations thus expreſſe: <q>
                     <hi>Quoniam ſi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiſſes
ſacrificium, dediſſem utique; ſed holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſtis
non oblectaberis (vel, holocauſtum non
acceptabis.) Sacrificium Deo ſpiritus contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatus,
&amp;c.—If thou wouldeſt have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22900:34"/>
had a ſacrifice, I would have offered it; but
thou wilt accept no burnt-offering, &amp;c.—</hi>
                  </q>
For this ſeemes to be meant of that ſpeciall
caſe of adulterie and murder, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
here deploreth: for which ſinnes the
Lord had provided no ſacrifice in his law.
Wherefore <hi>David</hi> in this his poenitentiall
confeſſion tells him, That if hee had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
any ſacrifice for expiation of this
kinde of ſinne, hee would have given it
him: but he had ordained none, ſave one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a broken ſpirit and a contrite heart:
which, thou O God (ſaith he) wilt not
deſpiſe, but accept that alone for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in this caſe, without which, ſacrifice
in no caſe, is accepted.</p>
               <p>Now out of this diſcourſe we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
furniſhed for the underſtanding of
this caution of <hi>Solomon</hi> in my Text: <hi>Bee
more readie to obey, than to offer the ſacrifice of
fooles;</hi> or as the words in the Originall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
Be more approaching God with a
purpoſe and reſolution of obedience to
his commandments, than with the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of fooles; that is, Have a care, rather to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:22900:35"/>
approach the Divine Majeſty with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of an obedientiall diſpoſition, than
with the bare and naked rite; but the ſenſe
is ſtill the ſame, namely, the Houſe of God
at Jeruſalem was an Houſe of ſacrifice,
which they who came thither to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
offered unto the Divine Majeſty, to
make way for their prayers and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unto him, or to finde favour in his
ſight. <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore gives them here a
caveat, not to place their religion, either
onely or chiefly in the externall rite, but in
their readineſſe to heare and keepe the
Commandements of GOD; without
which, that rite alone would availe them
nothing, but bee no better than the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of fooles, who when they doe evill,
thinke they doe well. For without this
readineſſe to obey, this purpoſe of heart
to live according to his Commandements,
God accepts of no ſacrifice from thoſe
who approach him, nor will pardon their
tranſgreſſions when they come before
him. Hee therefore that makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of ſinning againſt God, and yet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22900:35"/>
thinks to bee expiate by ſacrifice, is an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
foole; how wiſe and religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he may thinke himſelfe to be, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
unto men, by the multitude or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his ſacrifices. The reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lord requires obedience ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
and abſolutely, but ſacrifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
onely: and then too, not <hi>prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riò,</hi>
or chiefly and for it ſelfe, but ſecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
onely, as a teſtimony of contrition,
and a ready deſire and purpoſe in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer,
to continue in his favour by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>Solomons</hi> the Preachers meaning
Wherein behold, as in a glaſſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all externall ſervice of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
as that which he accepteth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than ſecundarily; namely, as iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
from a heart reſpectively affected
with that devotion it importeth. For God,
as hee is a living God, ſo he requires a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
worſhip. But as the body without
the ſoule is but a carcaſſe; ſo is all externall
and bodily worſhip, wherein the pulſe of
the hearts devotion beats not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:22900:36"/>
But if this bee ſo, you will ſay, it were
better to uſe no externall worſhip at all of
courſe, as we doe the worſhip of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in the geſtures of bowing, kneeling,
ſtanding, and the like, than to incurre this
danger of ſerving God with a dead and
hypocriticall ſervice; becauſe it is not like,
the heart will be alwayes duely affected,
when the outward worſhip ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
I anſwer; Where there is a true
and reall intent to honour God with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and bodily worſhip, there the act is
not hypocriſie, though accompanied with
many defects and imperfections. Here
therefore that rule of our Saviour touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greater and leſſer things of the law
muſt have place:<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 23. &amp; Luke 11. 42.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Theſe things</hi> (.i. the greater things
of the Law) <hi>we ought to doe, and not to leave
the other</hi> (though the leſſer) <hi>undone.</hi> For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
if this reaſoning were admitted,
a man might upon the ſame ground ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
himſelfe from comming to Church
upon the dayes and times appointed, or
come thither but now and then, alledging
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:22900:36"/>
the indiſpoſition of his heart to joyne
with the Church in her publicke worſhip
at other times: Or if he came thither, act
a mute, and when others ſing and praiſe
God, to be altogether ſilent, and not open
his mouth, nor to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> when others
doe. For all theſe are externall ſervices;
and the ſervice of the voice and geſture are
in this reſpect all one, there is no difference.
But who would not thinke this to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
abſurd? We ſhould rather upon every
ſuch occaſion rouze and ſtirre up our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with fit and ſeaſonable meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that what the order and decency of a
Church-aſſembly requires to be done of
every member outwardly, we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
doe devoutly and acceptably. <hi>Theſe
things we ought to doe, and not leave the other
undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, What if I cannot bring
my heart unto that religious feare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
which the outward worſhip I
ſhould performe requireth? I could ſay
that ſome of the outward worſhip which
a man performes in a Church-aſſembly, he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:22900:37"/>
does not as a ſingular man, but as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Congregation. But howſoever,
I anſwer: Let the worſhip of thy body,
in ſuch a caſe, be at leaſt a confeſſion and
acknowledgement before God, of that
love, feare, and eſteeme of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
thou oughteſt to have, but haſt not.
For though to come before God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that inward devotion requiſite, bee a
ſinne: yet to confeſſe and acknowledge,
by what our outward geſture importeth,
the duty we owe unto him, but are defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in, I hope is not; no more than the
confeſſion of any other ſinne. For our
worſhip, in ſuch a caſe, if we will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, is an act of repentance: and as the
moderne Greekes are wont to call their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorations</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Repentances;</hi> ſo may we
in this caſe make ours to be; namely, as if
wee ſaid, Lord, I ought to come before
thee with that religious feare, humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and lifting up of heart, which the
geſture, the poſture, I here preſent, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
<hi>but Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> If
any mans heart be ſo prophane and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22900:37"/>
as not to acknowledge thus much:
I yeeld, that ſuch a one might better ſpare
his labour, and not come into the preſence
of God at all. Otherwiſe I conclude ſtill
with our bleſſed Saviours determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the like caſe, <hi>Thoſe greater things
we ought to doe, and not to leave
the other undone.</hi>
