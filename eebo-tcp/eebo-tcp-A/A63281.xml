            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VEry strange are the delusions of <hi>Satan,</hi> to get the Souls
and Bodies of Men into his possession; he leaving no ways or means unattempted,
to accomplish his ends: How dreadful then is it for such who give up themselves
Voluntarily to do his druggery, and sell their Souls to Eternal punishment, for
a little Momentany pleasure, or to fulfil their own Lusts here, and such may
all those truly <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100182:3"/> be said to be, who are guilty of Witchcraft,
which detestable Sin, God himself abominates, and hath expressed in Holy Writ,
<hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch or Wizard to live in the Land.</hi> Of which
Number, these two Women Committed as aforesaid, are supposed to be; as the
ensuing Discourse will make out.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Iohn Tonken,</hi> of <hi>Pensans,</hi> near the
<hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> about 15 or 16 Years of Age, was in
<hi>April</hi> last strangely taken with sudden fits; And on the 4<hi>th.</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> 1686. as he lay in Bed, there appeared to him a Woman in a
blue Jerkin and Red Petticoat, with Yellow and Green patches, and told him,
that he would not be well before he had brought up <hi>Nutshels Pins,</hi> and
<hi>Nails</hi>; which the Boy afterwards related to several People that were at
his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, though none did see or hear the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but himself: soon
after the Lad was taken with fits of striving, or yoaking, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that two
Men could scarce hold him, and after several fits, he brought up three
<hi>Pins,</hi> and half a <hi>Walnut-shell,</hi> and in few days after, he
brought up three <hi>Walnut-shells,</hi> and several <hi>Pins,</hi> some of
which were Crooked. The <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100182:3"/> Woman very often appeared to him,
some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the shape as before; at other times like a <hi>Cat</hi>;
whereupon the Boy would shreik, and cry out that he would not see her, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his hands over his Eyes and Mouth, and would say with a loud voice, she is
putting things into my Mouth, she will Choak me, she will Poyson me. At other
times he would say, I will not be Tempted by thee, and in the Name of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> I defie, thee and all thy works: for a while he would ly as
Dead, and on a sudden he would spring from the Bed, three or four Foot high,
from between two Men that usually sat upon the Bed by him. At another time he
said the Woman told him he had Straws in his Belly, and in a short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he brought up four or five <hi>Straws,</hi> as also an ear of <hi>Rye,</hi>
with a <hi>Straw</hi> to it half a yard long; and for two or three days
<hi>Successively</hi> he brought up great quantity's of <hi>Straws</hi> and
<hi>Rushes,</hi> some of them being a yard long, with broad knots in them: The
Pins he brought up were in all 16 or 17 and as many <hi>Straws</hi> and
<hi>Rushes</hi> as would fill the Pole of a Mans Hat, if they were thrown in
somewhat lose, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100182:4"/> one without a Head and one turned like a
Fish-Hook, the Woman another time appeared to him and told him he should bring
up <hi>Nails,</hi> and that as they were insensibly put into him, so he should
in like manner bring them out, and in few Hours after, the Boy cryed out he was
prick'd in the Heel, the People that were then present, turned the Bedcloaths
off, and found a new threepeny Nail fast to his Heel, and another in the Bed;
he also brought up a piece of dry <hi>Bramble,</hi> and several pieces of flat
Sticks, which put together, made the form of a Breeting Needle, such as the
Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men make their Nets with. Some Persons to be satisfied of the truth of
this, came to him, and put their Fingers into his Mouth to search if he had any
<hi>Pins</hi> or <hi>Rushes,</hi> thinking he might put a trick on them, but
found none, though some came every day from him. On the 10<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>May,</hi> was his violent fit, when he hardly had any Cessation from his
pulls or throws for several Hours, he started very much, and being asked what
the Woman had said to him, replied, she told him she would kill him, if it were
in her Power; but he said he hoped God <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100182:4"/> would not permit her.
In one of his Staring fits, a person of Note observing his Eyes to be fixed in
the Thatch of the House, thrust his Sword into the Thatch twice, then the Boy
cryed she is gone into the Corner like a Mouse: at that time he brought up a
<hi>Pin</hi> very rusty, and a little bowed, which was took up and kept. The
last thing that he brought up, was a piece of a Beeting Needle, half an Inch
broad, and an Inch and a half long, with two sharp points like pins, one at
each end which things have caused great Admiration: He would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cry out she
had put Poyson into his Mouth, and call upon one <hi>Edward Plimrose,</hi> who
was his Uncle, to catch her, saying she was going out of the Window. Somtimes
he would say to her, when shall I be well? Make me well I will give thee five
Shillings, I'll give thee five Pound; and then turning his Eyes to the People,
would say, she will not tell me when I shall be well. Another time he said to
her tell me your Name, and where you do dwell? then turning to the People,
would say, the Old Witch will neither tell me her Name, nor where she dwells.
The last time, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100182:5"/> there appeared to him three Women, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
he cried out, what a Cofederancy? What you Old Witch more Confederates, and
then she bad him farewell, and said she would trouble him no more; two days
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Boy was pretty well again, and goes abroad with Crutches. Of this,
Affidavit hath been made before a Justice by several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and they are sent
to <hi>Lanceston</hi> Gaol, for Witchcraft, two Old Women, one <hi>Iane
Noal,</hi> alias <hi>Nickless,</hi> and the other <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or more
commonly <hi>Betty Seeze.</hi> We live in hopes they will be found out at the
next Assizes, and so receive a reward due to their Merits. To the truth hereof
we have hereunto set our Hands.</p>
