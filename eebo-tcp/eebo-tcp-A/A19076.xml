         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bookes of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Clercke and

Ambroſe, ſometime
Byſhop of Milleyn, entituled: Of the
vocation and callyng of all Nacions.
A worke ſurely of no leſſe diuine wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and learnyng, then of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and therefore a Iewell greatly to
be eſteemed and had in price of al thoſe
that be Godlye in Chriſtes Churche,
who earneſtly deſire a right ſpirite and
iudgement purely to diſcerne betwene
trueth and errour in theſe peryllous
dayes: Wherin as our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt affirmeth,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> that (yf it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
the very electe myght be diſcey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
But chiefly it is to be had in price<note place="margin">Mark. 13.</note>
of all thoſe, who not hauyng the Latin
tongue, are not able to reade the work
to theyr edifying in the tongue wherin
it was firſte wrytten and compyled.
To whom the ſayde auncient Father
and famous Clercke in this preſente
<pb facs="tcp:213:3"/>
treatiſe, ſpeaketh nowe more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
then before. The worke it ſelfe is
ſuch as needeth not my praiſe: But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
I can not ſufficiently expreſſe the
woorthyneſſe thereof, I thynke it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to omitt it with ſcilence, confeſſing
my barreyneſſe, then for lacke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
ſpeache to diminiſhe the glory
therof. Theſe and ſuche lyke workes
haue not aforetyme ben ſo freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the vnderſtanding of the ſimple,
nor ſo eaſely come by, as (God be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for it) they are in theſe our dayes.
Receiue them therefore louyngly and
thanckfullye (good Chriſten Reader)
and vſe them godly aud reuerently: for
they are the good inſtruments &amp; tooles
wherby the eternall God buyldeth the
ſpirituall Ieruſalem his Churche,<note place="margin">1. peter. 2.</note> and
by whom the lyuyng ſtones therof, his
elect children, are dayly wrought, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,

moſte heartye thanckes therfore: who
ſhewyng more mercye vnto thee, then
vnto manye generations paſte. As he
hath cauſed thee to be borne in theſe
peryllous dayes: ſo hath he prepared
armure and weapon for thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:213:3"/>
thou maiſt defend thy ſelf againſt
all thoſe enemies that ſhall aryſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
thee. The occaſion that moued
Saint Ambroſe to wryte this woorke
was this. There aroſe in Britayne in
thoſe dayes a Monke named Pelagius
Byſhop of Bangor, that became the
aucthour of a new ſect before that time
not heard of. This man with the helpe
of Celeſtine &amp; Iulian his fautors, drew
many into his errour: He attributed
ſo much vnto the free will of man, that
he affirmed that a man mought atteine
lyfe euerlaſtyng by merites only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the grace of Chriſt. Wherof he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
blamed, gaue place to thadmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in ſuche ſorte, that he dyd not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
altogether exclude grace: but
ſayd, that yf grace were geuen, it was
the eaſyer to attayne to ſaluacion, how
beit without it, it mought be obteyned
though with more difficultie. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
praying in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
aſwell for the faythfull as for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull,
as a thing vayne and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:
becauſe (as he ſaid) that which
they ſhould aſke, was already in their
power, which with their diligence eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them myght do &amp; perfourme.
<pb facs="tcp:213:4"/>
But when he feared leaſt he ſhould be
condempned for it by the councell of
Antioche, he recanted, althoughe he
ceaſſed not afterwardes to teach the
ſame in his wrytinges. He added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
that the ſinne of Adam hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no man but him that committed it.
Alſo that all Infantes were borne as
innocent &amp; cleane from ſinne, as Adam
was when God firſt created hym. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
he permitted them to bee
baptized, not to the puttyng awaye of
ſinne, whereof he affirmed them to be
voyde: but that they might be honored
with the Sacrament of their adoption.
And when he was publyſſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed
to be an hereticke: he wrote
in the defence of his errour. He was
condempned by Zoſimus, and twoo
C.xl. Byſhoppes moe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Carthage: and before that, he
was condempned bi <hi>Innocentius,</hi> whoſe
errour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Affricans with others
(eſpecially this aucthour S. Ambroſe,
S. Auguſtine, and S. Iherome) vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deteſted, they tooke in hand by their
ſeuerall wrytynges to put to ſcilence
the remnaunte of that ſecte. Sithens
the which time it hath ben reputed and
<pb facs="tcp:213:4"/>
taken of all the godly learned in Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
Churche, for a curſed prophane &amp;
Phyloſophycall errour.</p>
            <p>I haue ſhewed thee (gentle Reader)
the cauſe or reaſon of the firſt makyng
and compylyng of this worke. Nowe
it ſtandeth me in ſteede to ſhewe thee
the cauſe of this my trauell in reducing
it into the Englyſhe tongue. There a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
in Kent in theſe late dayes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſithens the preachyng of the Goſpel,
a priuate man altogether vnlearned,
named Henry Hart, that reuiued this
errour of Pelagius, and added thereto
certeyne other errours. This man
with the helpe of his adherentes, newe
furbed this olde cancred hereſye, and
put it to ſale a freſſhe in ſtede of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
veritie, who alſo vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence
of a ſober lyfe and conuerſation
vſyng long heare, long bearde, long
garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; often reading of pſalmes,
drewe manye into his errour both in
Eaſtkent, in Eſſex, Suſſex, Surrey, &amp;
in the Citie of London.</p>
            <p>This man, after that his errour was
eſpyed by the late Tharchbiſhoppe of
Caunterburye Thomas Cranmer,
was by hym committed to priſon, with
<pb facs="tcp:213:5"/>
certeyne of his ſecte (of whom ſome
remayne alyue, holdynge that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
ſome thanked be God are become
newe men, and other ſome are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this lyfe) and there they remayned
vntyll they reuoked theyr errour, and
colourably ſubſcrybed to the Artycles
agreed vpon in the Synode holden at
London, in the reigne of the late kyng
Edwarde the ſixte. Notwithſtanding
in hucker mucker he euer taught the
ſame vnto thoſe only which he knewe
to be truſtye, and vnto thoſe that were
brought in by them: who held the ſaid
Harte in ſuch reputacion, as yf he had
ben an holy Prophete. But after the
death of kyng Edwarde, when Quene
Mary began her dominion, &amp; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Clergie was ſcattered abrode,
this Hart and his companions began
to ſhewe them ſelues in theyr old lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of errour agayne, with much more
errour whiche they in the meane tyme
had practiſed, forged, and gathered,
with whom (when diuers of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
chaunced to meete in the time of
perſecution) we hadde more to do, then
we had with al the reſt of our enemies.</p>
            <p>And becauſe (deare Reader) thou
<pb facs="tcp:213:5"/>
ſhouldeſt not be ignoraunt of theyr er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
I haue noted ſome parte of it in
certeyne perticulers here folowyng.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt they holde and affirme, that
the doctrine of predeſtination and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it was taught of the Chriſten
Clergie of this Realm in the reigne of
kyng Edwarde the ſyxte, and agreed
vpon in the Synode of London. Anno.
domini. 1552. is not a doctrine meete
or neceſſary to be taught in the Church
of God.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, that they that hold the
ſayd doctrine, do erre dampnably.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, that God hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
or elected man none otherwyſe
then vpon the condicion of the kepyng
of the lawe: the whiche yf man on his
part do not obſerue, he loſeth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
and election.</p>
            <p>4. Fourth, that no man is ſo repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bated
but that he maye eſcape it, and
become an elect and be ſaued, nor any
man ſo elected but that he may loſe his
election, become a reprobate and be
dampned, by godly or vngodly lyuyng.</p>
            <p>5. Fyfth, that Eſau was no more
reproued then Iacob, nor Iacob anye
<pb facs="tcp:213:6"/>
more elected then Eſau, before the one
of them had lyued godly, and the other
vngodly.</p>
            <p>6. Sixth, that all men vniuerſallye
are called with one &amp; the ſame callyng,
the wicked aſwell as the godlye, and
Iudas aſwell as the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>7. Seuenth, that yf Gods predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
&amp; purpoſe in election were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
and abſolute, and God reſolued
and immutablye determined what to
do with mankynde his creature, then
ſhoulde the preachyng of repentaunce
be in vayne, becauſe the elect could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
myſſe heauen, nor the reprobates
eſcape hell: and ſo a great part of the
Scriptures of the holy Byble (namely
ſo much as concerned repentaunce and
godly lyuyng) ſhoulde ſerue to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but to fyll vppe the booke with
wordes and leaues.</p>
            <p>8. Eyghth, yf God ſhoulde prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
ſome and not other ſome, electe
one &amp; not another, geue greater grace
to one then to another: that it ſhoulde
folowe that God were not indifferent
but parciall.</p>
            <p>9. Nynthlie, that all and as many
aroſe agayne in Adams loynes when
<pb facs="tcp:213:6"/>
Adam beleued the promyſe, as fell in
Adams loynes by the tranſgreſſion,
and that aſſone as Adam beleued they
were all reſtored to the former inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
that Adam had before he ſinned,
and that they loſt nothyng there by but
the free acceſſe or commyng to the tree
of lyfe.</p>
            <p>10. Tenth, that the chyldren come
or borne of chriſten parentes, or of one
chryſten parent at the leaſt, are cleane
borne, that is to ſaye, voyde of ſynne,
both original and actuall, and therfore
a ſuperfluous worke to baptize them

ſinne by the outwarde ſences, as

            <p>11. Eleuenth, that there is but one

conferred and geuen to all
men in their creation: and that al men
haue naturally the election and choyſe
of a free wyll to come to GOD when

<pb facs="tcp:213:7"/>
the ſpirite of Godde in theyr mothers
wombes, as had Iacob, Ieremye, and

that foloweth the naturall birth, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

borne of their parentes, can neither go

            <p>13. Thirtenth, that it is to be thought
that the yonge chyldren of Turkes and

they die in theyr infancie, are ſaued.</p>
            <p>14. Fourtenth, that the luſte or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence

not ſinne: Becauſe that ſomtimes men
haue luſte to eate and drinke, and alſo
to do the nedefull offices of the bodye
whiche of themſelues cannot bee ſaide
to be ſynne.</p>
            <p>15. Fiftenth, that Ieſus Chriſt the
ſoone of god had alſo ſuch motions and
temptacions vnto euyll, as other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb facs="tcp:213:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men haue, though he conſented not,
nor gaue ouer himſelf vnto them. And
that the temptacions that he hadde in

inwarde motions and temptacions,
and not by any extreme or outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll

            <p>16. Sixtenth, that all Chriſtian men,
hauinge the talent, and feelinge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

and alſo ought to vtter the ſame
by the waye of publique teachinge or

though that the preachinge of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 1. Tim, 3.</note>

hymſelfe to bee moued thereto of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note>
and haue a mouth to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>17. Seuententh, that mens workes,

            <p>18. Eightenth, that men godly geuen
may and do lyue in this world without
ſinne, becauſe it is wrytten: He that
ſinneth is of the deuill.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.</note> &amp;c. but all men
are not of the deuill, for many there are
that are borne of GOD, ergo there are
many that ſinne not. And though they
haue ſinne in them, yet committe they
none: like as a man may haue weapon
about hym though he fighte not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>19. Nintenth, though the orthodoxe
faith according to the diuine ſcriptures
doth confeſſe God to be a ſpirite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ſay thei that God is verely angry, doth

becauſe that on the one part, we might
geue no place to erroure, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

their owne, rackinge the Scriptures to

that the ſincere trueth may hereby bee

God thereby may be glorified, and the

for thoſe men agaynſte whoſe folly and

deſyre of GOD the father of oure
Lorde Ieſus Chryſte, that it woulde
pleaſe hym of his infinite goodnes, to
haue mercy vppon them, and once to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the eyes of their vnderſtandynge,
ſo that they maye ſee theyr errour and
faute, and acknowledge the ſame: and
that they may nowe at the laſte be won
vnto the pure and ſincere trueth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they ſo longe time haue bene vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enemyes, that we altogether maye
be gathered into one ſhepefolde, vnder
one onely ſheepeheard Ieſus Chryſte,
whoſe holy ſpirite bee thy leader and
guyde (gentle reader) in the readynge
hereof. Amen.</p>
            <p>Marueyle not gentle reader I deſyre thee,
that I haue put dovvne their articles, and
haue not aunſvvered the ſame. For the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt now through the
helpe of Chriſt, I wil
enter into the matter
that I haue taken in
hande to entreate of.
There is in euery lyuyng man,
naturally a wyll (ſuch a one as
it is) in as much as it is geuen
hym to vnderſtand and to haue
experience. By the which wyll
he ether deſireth the thing that
pleaſeth hym, or refuſeth the
thing that diſpleaſeth him. Of
this wyll (as perteynyng to the
naturall motion, being weake
through the faulte of the firſte
tranſgreſſion) there are twoo
kindes: according to the which
twoo, the wyll of man is either
ſenſuall or els reaſonable. But
when the grace of god hath his
acceſſe, then, through the gifte
<pb facs="tcp:213:12"/>
of the ſpirite, there is added
therto the thirde kynde, that it
myght become ſpirituall. And
by this more excellent motion,
it might diſcerne by the lawe of
heauenly wiſdome, all affectes,
whereof ſoeuer they ſprynge.</p>
               <p>Therfore the ſenſual will (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
we may alſo call the carnal
wil) is not lifted vp aboue that
motion that ſpryngeth of the
ſences of the body: Like as ther
is in the myndes of yonge chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who though they haue no
iudgement of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet do they
ſhew plainly that thei wil ſome
thing, &amp; nyll ſome thing, when
by ſeeing, hearyng, ſmellyng,
taſtyng or touchyng, they both
loue the thynges wherein they
delyte, &amp; hate the thinges wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thei ar diſpleſed. For what
is it to loue. but to wyll? or
what is it to hate, but to nyll?
<pb facs="tcp:213:12"/>
Theſe therfore haue theyr wyl,
the which, though it be both vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able,

and to appeare more excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenter

had attayned to the knowledge

And that whiche they

pronounce theſe and many like
ſayinges: yet we beleue &amp; moſt
humbly confeſſe accordynge to
the ſame Scriptures, that the

fayled the vniuerſal nombre of
men: who though he directed

Wherfore alſo thei became with

in hauynge the thynges

               <p>Wherfore ſo long as thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
do pleaſe a man, whiche do
diſpleaſe God, his wyll is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For though he vſe good
maners, yet liueth he euyl, if he
liue not to the glory of god. For
this is a thing that is proper, &amp;
the chiefe thynge of them that
are godly, that they glorye &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in the Lorde, &amp; do not loue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues but in God. For they
loue them ſelues wel, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loue the
<pb facs="tcp:213:17"/>
workes of God in them ſelues.
For God alſo loueth the thyng
in vs that he hath made, and
hateth that which he hath not
made. Therfore yf we loue the
work of God in our ſelues, then
loue we rightly a good wyll in
vs: the which, if it were not the
worke of Godde, doubtleſſe it
ought not to be loued. And
what man is it (except he be of
an euyll wyll) that loueth not
a good wyll in him ſelfe, which
is the firſt planting of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
huſbandman? For the
veritie hym ſelfe ſaith.<note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> Euerye

thyng ſoeuer is not to be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vp by the roote, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that the ſame is planted of
the father. And a good wyll is
the fyrſte budde of all vertues:
<pb facs="tcp:213:17"/>
who leaninge vppon her origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

him that is lightened, the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier
and hym that is iuſtified,
the ruler and the ſubiect, al the
action is referred vnto one, and
that that is referred vnto one,
is of both. For that cannot beer

Lyke as alſo when he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

ſtyle ſo frameth the ſpeach, that
thoſe thinges which are ſpoken

to ſee if there were any that did
vnderſtande or ſeeke after God,
but they are all gone out of the

which may abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be brought forth and aleaged
yf a man wyll ſeeke for them, it
is moſt playnely declared, that

The diuiſion wherof, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng,

that the vnderſtandynge of the

But vnto thoſe Iewes and

power to them to whom he is a

<pb facs="tcp:213:27"/>
one kynd of beleuers and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers,

that are called, that thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſignified to be without faith
he might ſhew to be none of the
numbre of them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
though they had heard the
Goſpell. By this rule the word
of God doeth promiſe by Eſai,
ſaying.<note place="margin">Eſay. 42.</note> I wyll leade foorth the
blind men into a way that they
knowe not, &amp; they ſhall walke

I wyll make darkeneſſe to bee
lyght vnto them, and crooked

wyll I doe, and I wyll not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them. But that which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
(And they are tourned
backwarde) muſt be referred to
a certeyne part of them, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid: I wyl
not forſake them.<note place="margin">Eſay. 43.</note> The Lorde
ſaieth agayne to Iacob. Be not
<pb facs="tcp:213:28"/>
afrayde, for I am with thee:
From the Eaſt wyl I bring thy
ſeede, and gather thee from the
Weſte. I wyll ſay to the North,
bryng hyther: &amp; to the South,
forbydde thou not. Brynge my
ſonnes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a farre cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, and
my doughters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worldes
end. All thoſe in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my name
is called, I haue prepared them
vnto my glory, &amp; I haue faſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
&amp; made them. But that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth:
I haue brought forth a
blynde people, &amp; theyr eyes are
blynde, &amp; they haue deafe eares,
can not by any reaſon agree to
them, whom he ſayeth he hath
prepared vnto his glory. In all
theſe wordes which are ſpoken
of one kynde of men, the former
wordes do agree to ſome, &amp; the
latter wordes to other ſome.
And as the ſaying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle
is: that thyng that is done in
<pb facs="tcp:213:28"/>
parte of the people, is declared
vnder the name of all people, &amp;
in the remnaunt is the fulneſſe
counted. For when he diſputed
of the obſecation &amp; blinding of
the Iewes, &amp; ſhewed that ſome
of them were ſaued by grace: I
ſay therfore (ſaith he) hath God
repelled his people? God forbid.
For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſeede of Abraham, of the tribe
of Beniamin, GOD hath not
caſt a waye his people whom he<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note>
knew before. Therfore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that was foreknowen, the
people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not repelled, are thei
whiche are iuſtified in Chriſte.
And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ſemeth to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of al Iſraell, is ſhewed in them
only whom the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace
hath made a remnaunt to hym
ſelfe: Lyke as the conſequens
of the Apoſtles wordes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
for he doeth adde and ſay.
<pb facs="tcp:213:29"/>
Do ye not know what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
ſaith of Helyas, howe he
prayeth vnto God agaynſte Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell?
O Lord they haue ſlaine
thy Prophetes, they haue dyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
downe thine Altares, and
I am left alone, and they ſeeke
my lyfe. But what ſaith the
aunſwer of God to him? I haue
reſerued vnto my ſelfe ſeuen
thouſand men, which haue not
bowed the knee to Baall. So
therfore (ſaith he) in this tyme
alſo, is there a remnaunt ſaued
by the election of grace. And yf
it be of grace, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not now
of workes, for then were grace
no grace. Therfore, all Iſraell
is not reprobate, neyther is all
elected: But wyllyng blindnes
hath tourned away a part, and
free illuminacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath reſerued
a parte vnto him ſelfe. And yet
are the wordes ſpoken of them
<pb facs="tcp:213:29"/>
on ſuch ſorte, that no difference
ſeemeth to be made of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde,
neyther of them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe,
nor of them that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For when it is read, as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching
the Goſpell, they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
for your ſake: but as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng
theyr election, they are
beloued for the fathers ſake: the
wordes ſo ſounde, as though he
called them beloued, whom he
called enemies. But the Apoſtle
hym ſelfe wypeth awaye this
darkeneſſe, ſaying: For blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is happened vnto parte of
Iſraell, that we myght vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
one generacion to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into two kyndes: and all
men, all fulneſſe, all Iſraell,
not alway to be referred to the
vniuerſalitie, but many tymes
to a part. Among theſe maner
of ſpeaches, we ought alſo to
note this ſaying in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:213:30"/>
wherin that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth
to men of diuers times
is promiſed on ſuche wyſe, as
though it were ſpoken of one
generation of the ſame tyme.
Lyke as is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Peter, wrytyng to them of
his tyme &amp; of the tyme to come,
ſayeth:<note place="margin">1. pet. 2.</note> But ye are an elect ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracion,
a kingly prieſthod, an
holye nacion, a purchaſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that ye myght ſhewe the
vertues of him that hath called
you out of darkeneſſe, into his
marueylous lyght, which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
were not a people, but
now are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of god, which
hadde not obteyned mercy, but
nowe haue obteyned mercye.
When theſe thinges were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
whether did thoſe men yet
remaine, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God in time paſt
ſuffred to walke in theyr owne
waies? And thoſe ſame me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
<pb facs="tcp:213:30"/>
were deliuered vp to their own
willes: were they now called in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
that marueilous light? were
not they now dead? They were
not now in this world, neither
did their retourne from errour
to veritie helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al which
were dead before. And yet the
cuſtome of ſpeach hath declared
that after long time, grace was
in the poſteritie of the wicked:
that they may appeere nowe to
be elected, which afore were for
ſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe ſayinges do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame men, but to men
of the ſame nacion. And the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or calling that hath ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nyghe vnto the ende of the
world, hath not recourſe to the
tyme paſte. So nowe, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
maner, it are both they,
and not they, of whom and to
whom theſe thynges are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
whyle, when they are not
<pb facs="tcp:213:31"/>
deuided in any ſpecialitie from
a generalitie, yet are they deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in ſome thinges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie.</p>

in the ſight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
which wylleth all men
to be ſaued, and to come to the

there is one God, and one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
betwene God and men,
euen the man Ieſus Chryſte,
whiche hath geuen hym ſelfe a
raunſome for all men. Of this
rule therefore of the Apoſtles
doctrine, wherwith the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Churche is inſtructed, leaſt
we ſhuld wander into a ſtrange
vnderſtandyng after our owne
brayne, let vs ſearche what the

in it: for there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
doubtfull in the precept,
yf that the obedience in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre

The whiche lawe of

holde, that there is no parte of
the worlde wherein ſuche pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

and ennemies of the Croſſe of

becauſe thei are not able to

It is the wyll of the mercifull

<pb facs="tcp:213:33"/>
we ſee innumerable to be dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

but that GOD hath graunted
that, that he was deſyred to

ſhould hope alſo, that they
whiche are not yet illumined,
ſhalbe delyuered by the ſame
helpe of Goddes grace from the
power of darkeneſſe, that they
may be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of god, or euer thei depart
out of this life. But if any man
fayle of this grace of the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure
(as we ſee it doth happen)
and the prayer of the Churche
bee not receyued for them, we
muſte referre it to the ſecrete
iudgementes of Goddes righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,
and we muſte acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the depeneſſe of thys
miſterie cannot appeare to vs
<pb facs="tcp:213:34"/>
in thys life. For our knowledge
is vnperfect, and our propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
vnperfect. And we ſee now
as it were by a glaſſe in a darke
ryddell, neyther are we wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
or haue more knowledge
then the bleſſed Apoſtle, who
when he dyſputed of the grace
of GOD, and was entred into
the ſecrete of great miſteries,
he fell downe vnder thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that was vnpoſſible to bee
declared. For when he had ſaid,
brethren I would not haue you
ignoraunt of this miſterie, leſt
ye ſhould be wiſe in your owne
conceypt, that blindnes is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in part of Iſraell, tyl the
fulneſſe of the gentilles myght
enter in, and ſo al Iſrael might
bee ſaued, as it is wrytten. He
ſhall come out of Syon, which
ſhall tourne away vngodlynes
out of Iacob, and thys is the
<pb facs="tcp:213:34"/>
teſtamente that I wyll geue
them, that I wyll take awaye
their ſinnes. For as concerning
the Goſpell, they are enemyes
for your ſake: but concernynge
election, they are beloued for
the fathers ſake: for the giftes
and calling of god, are without
repentaunce. For lyke as ye
ſometyme alſo dyd not beleue
in God,<note place="margin">In your mercy, that is in the mercy that ye haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned.</note> and nowe haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

euen ſo they alſo haue

that they myght obtayne

myght haue mercy on all.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when in a certayne

but the vnſpeakable grace of

elect. The deuice lyeth hydde in
ſecrete, but the gyfte lyeth not
hyd. Godlyneſſe bryngeth forth
the woorke, but power hydeth
the cauſe. But, as little is that
to be doubted that is not ſene,
as that that is ſene: for neither
the confeſſion of the manifeſte
worke, nor yet of the vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

the ſight of thy mynde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe men, who lyuynge a

are renewed and borne agayne
by the Sacrament of Chriſtian
baptiſme, euen in the ende of
their lyfe: and without anye
helpe of good workes, are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
into the felowſhip of the
heauenly kingdome. By what
reaſon wylte thou knowe the
iudgement of God therein, but
only that thou muſt knowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlye
<pb facs="tcp:213:42"/>
that the gyftes of
God are free? And that, like as
there be no ſinnes ſo deteſtable
that they are able to withſtand
or kepe away the gyft of grace:
euen ſo can there be no workes
ſo excellent, to whom that that
is freely geuen, is due by the
iudgement of rewarde or retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucion:
for then ſhoulde the
bloudde of Chriſte be nothyng
woorth, neither ſhould the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of mens workes be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing inferiour to the grace
of God. If iuſtification which
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by grace, were due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
anye merites that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
then it were not a gyft of
a free geuer, but the wages of
a worker. And howe myght it
be proued, that there bee no
workes meete to put away ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
ſinne, onleſſe that both
vngodly men, and alſo miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb facs="tcp:213:42"/>
perſons, were by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of Chriſte receiued into his
kyngdome? And howe ſhoulde
they which glory in their owne
righteouſnes knowe how little
thei can do worthy of the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſonnes of God, yf
thei came not to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of regeneration, ſeing they are
faſt tied and holden in the ſame
ſtate and condicion that the
wickedſt ſinners be? Thei ſhuld
become like in ſanctification, if
they were regenerate, but ſhuld
peryſhe together yf they were
not baptized. Therfore, if grace
haue founde anye of the moſte
wicked menne, yea euen in the
verye departynge of the lyfe,
whom it doth adopte and choſe
(when, notwithſtandynge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
that haue leſſe offended are
ſeene to bee without this
gyfte) who can ſaye eyther
<pb facs="tcp:213:43"/>
that this is done without the
diſpenſation and appointment
of God, or els that they are ſo
diſcerned and ſeuered a ſunder
without profounde and ſecrete
equitie? The which alſo is not
therefore vniuſte, becauſe it is
vnknowen: but therefore is it
iuſte, becauſe there is no doubt
but that it is the iudgement of
God. For that that dependeth
vpon his pleaſure, it is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
with what ſentence it
ought to be iudged, afore it be
iudged. But when the thynge
ſhall come to his ende, no man
ought to complayne of the end:
for it is moſt certeyne, that god
ought not to do any other wiſe
then he hath done. The rule of
the Euangelicall parable hath
alſo confirmed the varietie and
diuerſitie of the manyfolde vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and callyng whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
<pb facs="tcp:213:43"/>

his vineyarde, vnder the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt
of a penye, whereby is
ſignified the equalitie of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

as muche as they that

the nombre of thoſe of

the gentleneſſe of GOD hath
eſteemed and accompted in the

of their lyfe, to commende and
prayſe the excellencie of his
grace: not paying them wages
for theyr labour, but powryng
foorth the richeſſe of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

<pb facs="tcp:213:44"/>
which had ſwette with muche
labour, &amp; yet receiued no more
then the laſt, might vnderſtand
that they had receiued the gyft
of his grace, not the wages of
theyr workes. Wherfore, yf we
alſo do murmure agaynſte the
good man of the houſe, becauſe
they that were laſte called are
made equal to the labourers of
the whole daye, or that they
haue deſerued no more with
theyr much labour, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that laboured almoſte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge

do thee no wronge,<note place="margin">Math. 20.</note> take that
that is thine, and go thy way,
for I wyl geue as much to this

to thee: Is it not lawefull for
me to do with mine own what
I lyſte? or els is thine eye euyll
<pb facs="tcp:213:44"/>
becauſe I am good? Surely
this liberalitie ſeemed to this

what was he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſer? or what
accomptes was there made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hym? The ryghteouſnes of
the diſpenſation of that buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was not opened vnto him,
neither was he admitted to be
of counſell of this hyd ſecrete.
But that he ſhoulde refrayne
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerching the iudgements of
god, ther was laide forth before
hym both the goodneſſe of hym
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is mercifull, &amp; alſo the power

of euery nacion, of euery ſtate
<pb facs="tcp:213:45"/>
or condicion and age, the wyll
of God is the cauſe of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

whiche wyll, the reaſon of the
election lyeth hyd: all merites
beginning at that grace, which
thei haue receiued without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
whiche merites yf they
coulde be good without grace,
it ſhould not be ſayde: Excepte

not enter into the kingdome of

Except a man be iuſt &amp; good, he
can not be bleſſed for euer. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were it nedefull to be born

ſinnes are forgeuen throughe

that grace were not geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

vnto good and righteous men.
Therfore the beginning of true
lyfe and ryghteouſnes, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in the Sacrament of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that where a man is

<pb facs="tcp:213:61"/>
other good thinges myght bee
obtayned by her aſkinges.<note place="margin">Grace is geuen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be aſked.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning
the which thing, I wil
gather certaine teſtimonies out
of many which ſhewe forth the
aboundaunce of grace, by the
diuerſitie of the giftes thereof.
That it is of god therfore, that
a man choſeth the way of god,
and riſeth vppe when he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
the pſalme of Dauid ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
ſaying:<note place="margin">pſalm. 36.</note> The Lorde orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a mans goynges, that he
may will his way, when he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
he ſhall take no hurt, for
the Lorde putteth vnder hys
hande. Alſo the ſame Dauid
teacheth that men come to god
by the leadinge of god,<note place="margin">pſalm. 42.</note> ſaying.
Sende forth thy lyght and thy
trueth, they haue led me and
brought me vnto thy holy hyll,
and vnto thy Tabernacle, or
place of thy dwelling.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:213:61"/>
               <p>Alſo that the ſtrength of man
is in the lorde, and that the wil
of God doth preuent the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
of man.<note place="margin">pſalm. 58.</note> My ſtrength
will I aſcribe vnto thee, (ſayth
he) for god euen my god is my
deliuerer, hys will ſhal preuent
me. In the prouerbes alſo, we
reade of wyſedome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge:
for the Lorde geueth
wyſedome,<note place="margin">prouer. 2.</note> and from hys face
commeth knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge.
Alſo in the ſame
boke, ſpeakinge of the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of the wiſedome of GOD,
without the which, nothing is
wel done.<note place="margin">prouer. 8.</note> It is thus ſaid: coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
is mine, defence is myne, I
am wiſdome it ſelfe, and power
is myne owne. By me kynges
raygne, and tyrauntes by me
obtaine the earth. Alſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, that no man can go
the right way, but by the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:213:62"/>
of god.<note place="margin">proue. 20.</note> The ſteppes of man
are ordered of the Lorde. For
how doth a mortal man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
his owne waies? Alſo in
another place.<note place="margin">proue. 21.</note> Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himſelfe to be iuſt, but the
lorde ordereth the heartes. And
afterward: the will is prepared
of the lord.<note place="margin">proue. 19.</note> Agayne in the ſame
booke, he ſpeaketh of thought
and deuiſe, on this wiſe. Many
thoughtes are in the heart of
man, but the deuiſe of the lorde
preuayleth. It is ſayde alſo in
Eccleſi. that both to haue thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
neceſſarye, and to vſe them
wel, is the gift of God. There is
nothyng good to man,<note place="margin">Eccleſi. 5.</note> but that
that he eateth &amp; drinketh, and
ſheweth hys ſoule good of hys
labour, and truely I haue ſene
theſe things. For it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand
of God: for who hath eaten or
ſhall eate without him? Alſo it
is red in the ſame bohe, that the
<pb facs="tcp:213:62"/>
hartes and workes of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
men, are in the hande of
God, and that thei ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
and goe forwarde in theyr
ſtudies and deſyres, as he ſhall
geue.<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.</note> What paine ſoeuer a man
take to gette hym, he ſhall not
fynde hym, and whatſoeuer a
wiſe man ſhal ſay to him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
hym that he myght haue
knowledge, he ſhall not finde it
out. For I haue laid vp al theſe
thinges in my hart, &amp; my harte
hath ſene al this, that both the
iuſt men &amp; the wyſe men &amp; alſo
their workes, are in the handes
of god. And it is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke
of wiſedome, of the ſame worke
of grace, on this wiſe. For he is
both the captayne of wiſdome,
and the amender of the wiſe. In
his hande are both we and our
wordes,<note place="margin">Sapi. 7.</note> &amp; the knowledge of all
wiſdom and works, &amp; diſcipline
<pb facs="tcp:213:63"/>
Of Continencie alſo, that it is
had of Gods gift, the ſame ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaketh on this wiſe:<note place="margin">Sapi. 8.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that I knewe that I coulde
none otherwyſe be chaſt except
God gaue it me: and this was
alſo a poynte of wyſedome, to
knowe whoſe gyft it is. Vnto
the which ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the doctrine
of the Apoſtle Saint Paule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth,
wrytyng on this wyſe
in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note>
I would all men were
as I am my ſelf, but euery one
hath his proper gyfte of God,
one after this ſorte, another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that. Alſo the Lorde in the
Goſpell of Mathewe declareth
the very ſame of chaſtitie. For
when his Diſciples ſayde: If
the cauſe of man and wyfe bee
ſuch, it is not expedient to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Ieſus ſaith vnto them:<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> All
men are not able to attayne vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:213:63"/>
that ye ſpeake of, but they to
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is geuen of my father.<note place="margin">Eccleſi. 1.</note>
It is read in Eccleſiaſticus on
the ſame wyſe, of the feare of
God and of wiſdom: The feare
of the Lorde is the crowne of
wyſdom, and both are the gift
of God. Alſo in the ſame. The
feare of the Lorde hath ſette it
ſelfe aboue all thynges: bleſſed
is the man to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
to haue the feare of the Lorde.<note place="margin">Eſay. 33.</note>
Eſay the prophet ſpeaketh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe
of the ſpirituall rycheſſe,
whereof God is the aucthour.
Our ſaluacion commeth with
treaſures, as for wiſdome and
godlyneſſe, and nourture, they
come from the Lorde, theſe are
the treaſures of ryghteouſnes.
Alſo he ſpeaketh theſe wordes
of the depth of the riches of the
wiſdome &amp; knowledge of God,
whoſe goodneſſe is preuented
<pb facs="tcp:213:64"/>
with the merite of no manne,
whiche hath meaſured the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with his hande,<note place="margin">Eſay. 4.</note> the heauen
with his ſpanne, and the whole
earth with thre fingers, which
hath wayed the mountaines in
the ſkaoles, and the rockes in
the balaunce: who hath kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
the minde of the Lorde, or
who hath bene hys counſeller?
who canne inſtruct hym, or of
whom hath he aſked counſayl,
and he hath taught hym? Or
who hath ſhewed hym iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
or who hath ſhewed hym
the waye of wiſedome? or who
hath fyrſt geuen to him, that he
may recompence him? whereof
alſo in the booke of Iob the
words of the lord are red in the<note place="margin">Iob. 4.</note>
ſame ſence, ſayinge: who hath
geuen to me fyrſt, that I ſhould
recompence him? All thynges
that are vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are mine.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:213:64"/>
               <p>Ieremias alſo ſayeth on thys
wiſe, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath right wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from god.<note place="margin">Ierem. 10.</note> O lord, I know
that it is not in mans power to
order his owne way, neyther is
it in man to rule his own iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Alſo the Lorde proteſteth
by the ſame Prophete, that the
conuerſion of the hart to God,
is of God,<note place="margin">Ierem. 24.</note> and he ſayeth. I will
reſtore them vnto thys lande,
and I will newe buylde them,
and will not deſtroye them, I
wyll plant them, and not pulle
them vp. I wyll geue them an
heart that thei may knowe me,
for I am the Lorde and they
ſhalbe my people, and I wyl be
theyr God, for they ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
vnto me with theyr hole
heart. Alſo the ſame Prophete
ſhe wynge that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of god
that we knowe god, ſayth. And
they ſhal knowe that I am the
<pb facs="tcp:213:65"/>
Lorde theyr God, and I wyll
geue them an hearte to knowe
me, and eares to heare me. The
Apoſtle in the firſte Epiſtle to
the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> teacheth that
euery good word and euery ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worke, is the ſecrete working
if the holy ſpirit, without who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
nothing is well done, ſaying:
Therfore I do you to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
that no man ſpeakynge in the
ſprite of god defieth Ieſus. And
no man can ſaye that Ieſus is
the Lord, but in the holy ghoſt.
For ther be diuerſities of giftes
or graces, and yet but one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and there be differences of
adminiſtracions, and yet but
one Lorde, and there be diuers
maner of operacions, and yet
but one God, which worketh al
in all. The gyftes of the ſpirite
are geuen to euery man to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
withall. For to one is geuen
<pb facs="tcp:213:65"/>
the vtteraunce of wyſdome by
the ſpirite. To another is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the vtterau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of knowlege
by the ſame ſpirite,<note place="margin">Fayth is the gift of God, and the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of the ſpirit.</note> to another
is geuen faith by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
to another the gyft of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
by the ſame ſpirite, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
propheſie, to another
iudgement to diſcerne ſpirites,
to another diuers tongues, to
another the interpretacion of
tongues: and al theſe worketh
one and the ſame ſpirite, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
vnto euery man,<note place="margin">Not as vve liſt.</note> euen as
he wyll.</p>
               <p>The ſame Apoſtle vnto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians
ſaith, that euery man
hath ſo much grace as the Lord
hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. One body &amp; one
ſpirite (ſaith he) as ye are called
in one hope of your callynge.
One Lorde,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
one God and father of
all, which is aboue al men, and
<pb facs="tcp:213:66"/>
ouer all thynges, and in vs all.
For to euery one of vs is geuen
grace, according to the meaſure
of the gifte of Chriſte. For the
which cauſe he ſaith: He aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vp on hyghe, and hath led
captiuitie captiue, and geuen
gyftes to men. Alſo the ſame
Apoſtle in the ſecond Corinthes
ſaith:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> that we are not able to
thynke that that is ſpirituall,
but by the grace of God. Such
truſte haue we towardes God,
throughe Chryſte, not that we
are ſufficiente of our ſelues to
thynke anye thynge as of our
ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is
of God, whiche hath made vs
meete miniſters of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
not in the letter, but
in the ſpirite: for the letter kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
but the ſpirite geueth
lyfe. Agayne in the ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
teachynge that the deſyre
<pb facs="tcp:213:66"/>
and the ſufficiencie or ableneſſe
vnto good woorkes are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
of God,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> he ſaith: God is
able to make all grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde
in you, that ye all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
ſufficient of all thynges,
maye be ryche in euerye good
woorke, as it is wrytten: He
hath diſpearſed abrode and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the poore, his ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
abydeth for euer. For
he that miniſtreth ſeede to the
ſower, ſhall geue you foode to
eate, and ſhall encreaſe the
fruites of your ryghteouſnes,
that ye beynge made ryche to
the vttermoſte, may haue plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vnto all ſingleneſſe.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle wryting to the
Epheſians, teacheth that all
good thynges where with God
is pleaſed are the gyftes of
GOD, and that it behoueth
<pb facs="tcp:213:67"/>
them to be aſked of God, that
he may geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thoſe which
haue them not. For this cauſe
(ſaith he) do I bowe my knees
vnto the father of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſte,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> of whom is named
all fatherhod both in heauen
and in earth, that he woulde
geue you power accordynge to
the richeſſe of his glory, that ye
might be ſtrengthed by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
in the inner manne, that
Chryſte myght dwell in your
hartes by faith: that ye beyng
rooted and grounded in loue,
myght be able to comprehende
with all Saintes, what is that
breadth and length, depth and
heyghte, and to knowe what
the loue of Chriſte is, whiche
loue paſſeth knowledge, that ye
might be fylled with all maner
of fulneſſe that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of God.
And vnto hym that is able to
<pb facs="tcp:213:67"/>
do &amp; to worke all thinges more
aboundauntlye in vs, then we
can either aſke or thinke, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to that power wherwith
he now worketh in vs. To him
he prayſe and glory in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
by Ieſus Chryſte
throughout al worldes Amen.
And Iames the Apoſtle telleth
in lyke maner, that God is the
aucthour of euery good thyng,
whoſe giftes are neither vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
nor mutable, but procea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
of the eternall wyll,<note place="margin">Iacob. 1,</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Do not ye erre my deare
brethren. Euery good gyft and
euery perfecte gyfte diſcendeth
from aboue from the father of
lyght, with whom there is no
variableneſſe, neyther is he
chaunged vnto darkeneſſe. Of
his owne good wyll begate he
vs with the woorde of trueth,
that we myght bee the firſte
<pb facs="tcp:213:68"/>
fruites of his creatures. Vnto
whom the Prophete zacharias
agreeth,<note place="margin">zach. 9.</note> ſaying: In that daye
the Lorde ſhall ſaue his people
as ſheepe, for holye ſtones ſhall
be rolled vppon his lande. For
yf any thyng be good it is his,
yf anye thynge be precious, it
commeth of hym. And in the
Goſpell of Saint Mathe we it
is tolde lykewyſe, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and vnderſtandynge are
the gyftes of God, whiche he
geueth to whom he wyll: Then
his Diſciples came vnto hym,<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note>
and ſayde: Why doeſte thou
ſpeake vnto them in parables?
But he aunſwered and ſayde
vnto them: becauſe that vnto
you it is geuen to knowe the
miſteries of the kyngedome of
heauen, but to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Iohn the Euangeliſt doth
alſo ſhewe, that no man hath
<pb facs="tcp:213:68"/>
any goodneſſe except he receiue
it from aboue,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> ſaying: A man
can receiue nothing except it be
geuen hym from heauen. The
veritie hym ſelfe alſo teacheth
in the ſame Goſpel, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
commeth to the ſonne, vnleſſe
he be drawen of the father. For
god maketh him that ſhal come
both to vnderſtande and to be
obedient.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> No man (ſaith he) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
come to me, excepte the father
which ſent me do drawe hym,
and I wyll reyſe hym vp in the
laſte daye. For it is wrytten in
the Prophetes: And they ſhalbe
all apt to be taught of GOD.
Euery one that hath heard and
learned of the father, commeth
vnto me. And afterwarde: For
this cauſe ſayde I vnto you
that no manne can come vnto
me, excepte it be geuen hym of
my father. The aucthoritie
<pb facs="tcp:213:69"/>
of the holye Scriptures doth
confirme, that to go forwarde
and to continue vnto the ende
in faith and good workes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of the gyfte and helpe of
GOD. For the Apoſtle Paule
wrytynge to the Philippians
ſaith.<note place="margin">Philip. 1.</note> I ſurely beleue this, that
he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath begon a good worke
in you, wyll alſo accomplyſſhe
and perfourme the ſame in you

Chriſte.<note place="margin">Pelagius.</note> A certayne man wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
to conuerte the vertue of
this texte to his owne wronge
vnderſtandyng, woulde haue it
to be vnderſtande as yf it hadde
ben ſayde: whiche hath begon
of you, that both the beginning
and ending of the worke ſhould
be referred vnto man, and not
vnto God, which wylled both
to begin and to ende. But the
moſt excellent preacher of grace
<pb facs="tcp:213:69"/>
hath confuted this moſt madde
pryde in the ſame Epiſtle,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Feare not ye your aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
for any thyng: for that
ſame that is to them the cauſe

cauſe of ſaluacion,<note place="margin">Fayth and pacience are the gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of god for Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſake. philip. 2.</note> and that of
God. For vnto you it is geuen
for Chriſtes ſake, that ye ſhould
not only beleue in him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that ye ſhould ſuffer for him.
And agayne: worke out your
ſaluacion with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng
(ſaith he) For it is God
that worketh in you the wyll &amp;
the perfourmau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and that of
his good wyll. Alſo in the firſt
Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians he
teacheth, that the begynnyng,
the goyng forwarde, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhyng
of vertues, do come of
God, ſaying. God hym ſelfe, &amp;
our father, &amp; our Lorde Ieſus,

<pb facs="tcp:213:70"/>
you,<note place="margin">1. Teſſa. 3.</note> and the Lorde multiplie

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
one towardes another, &amp;
towardes all men, lyke as we
do abounde in loue towardes
you, to confirme your heartes
without faulte in holyneſſe of
lyfe, before God &amp; our father, at
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lorde Ieſus

Alſo wrytyng to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note>
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

I thanke my God alwaye for

for ye are made ryche in all

Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, the which
ſhall alſo ſtrengthen you vnto

               <p>Alſo vnto the Romaines he
ſpeaketh of the loue of Chriſt,
whereby he maketh them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he loueth, inſeperable, that is
to ſay: he maketh them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer

Who (ſaith he) ſhall ſeperate

For thy ſake we are kylled all

But in all theſe thynges we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome

Alſo to the Theſſalonians of

Ye are of God lyttle babes, and
ye haue ouercome the worlde:
for he that is in you,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5.</note> is greater
then he that is in the worlde.
Alſo the ſame ſaith: All that
is borne of God ouercommeth
the worlde, and this is the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
that ouercommeth the

               <p>It is declared alſo in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> that it is Goddes
gyfte that menne perſeuer in

you lyke meale, but I haue
prayed for thee Peter that thy

               <p>We reade alſo in the Goſpell of

theſe woordes of the ſheepe of
Chriſt, which no man can take
out of his hand.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> But ye beleue
not, becauſe ye are not of my

Alſo in the ſame Goſpell are
theſe thynges ſayde by the

<pb facs="tcp:213:73"/>
whom the father geueth to the

whiche he hath geuen me, I
ſhulde loſe nothyng, but ſhulde
reiſe them vp againe in the laſt

in the diſcourſe and order
of the Canonicall Scriptures,
which I omit becauſe I wolde
be briefe. For the teſtimonies
that I haue reſited are not a

to the admiration of the

is not aunſwered by

               <p>For howe much ſo euer the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes

Euen ſuche were they

parte, the whiche
the bitter courage
of intemperate diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putacions
doth in
gender and brede. It is euident
that there are three thynges in
this queſtion, whereof I begin
this ſecond booke, of the which
it behoueth to entreate more
largely. One, whiche muſte of
neceſſitie be graunted, that god
willeth al men to be ſaued, and
to come to the knowledge of the
<pb facs="tcp:213:78"/>
trueth. Another whiche in no
wyſe may be doubted: that no
manne can come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the trueth by his owne
proper merites, but by the help
and worke of Gods grace. The
thyrde, which is to be confeſſed
is thys, namely that the depth
of goddes iudgementes cannot
be founde out nor attayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
of mans vnderſtanding, and
that it ought not to be ſearched
whye he ſaueth not all menne,
whiche willeth all men to bee
ſaued. For yf that bee not
ſought for, whiche cannot bee
knowen, there ſhal remayne no
cauſe of contencion betwene
the fyrſt and ſecond diffinition:
but eyther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may bee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and either of them may be
beleued with a ſure and a quiet
fayth. Surely god with whom
<pb facs="tcp:213:78"/>
there is no vnequitie, and all
whoſe wayes are mercye and
trueth, the good maker of all
men, is a iuſte ordinatour and
dyſpoſer, he dampneth no man
vndeſeruinge, he delyuereth no
man of dutie, puniſhinge that
that is ours when he puniſheth
offendours, and geuynge of his
owne, when he maketh iuſte
men, that the mouth of them
whiche ſpeake vnrighteous
thynges maye bee ſtopped, and
that god may be iuſtified in his
ſayinges, and ouercome when
he is iudged. Neyther may the
complaynt of him that is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
be iuſt, nor yet the arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of hym that is iuſtified bee
true.</p>
               <p>If eyther the one ſaye, he hath
not deſerued to be puniſhed or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:213:79"/>
other ſay that he hath deſerued
grace. And lyke as thoſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
the whiche I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of the holye ſcryptures
for the ſettynge forth of grace,
cannot be confuted nor ſtayned
by any reaſon or craft of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion,
ſo that ſo great a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſentences playnely agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
together in them ſelues,
myghte bee drawen or wreſted
into any vncertaintie of a falſe
expoſicion: Euen ſo alſo, that
that is founde in the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the ſcriptures touchynge
the ſaluation of all menne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be reproued by any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

the harder the ſame is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanden

with ſo muche the more lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
fayth it ought to bee bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Great is the force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb facs="tcp:213:79"/>
to whom thaucthoritie
is ſufficient to folow the truth,
yea although the reaſon of it
be vnknowen. Therefore let vs
diligently conſider, what the
Lorde commaundeth the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Goſpell. For in
Saint Mathewes Goſpell he
ſayeth thus:<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> All power is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to me both in heauen and
in earth: Go your wayes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and teache all nations,
baptizinge them in the name
of the father, and of the ſonne,
and of the holy ghoſt, teachyng
them to obſerue all thynges
that I haue commaunded you.
And beholde I am with you
alwayes vnto the ende of the
worlde.<note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> And in Saint Marke,
it is ſayde to the ſame Apoſtles
on this wyſe. Go ye into all the
worlde, preache ye the Goſpell
<pb facs="tcp:213:80"/>
to euery creature: and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſhall beleue and bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
the ſame ſhall be ſaued, but
whoſo wyll not beleue ſhalbe
dampned. Is there anye diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
made here of anye nation
or of anye menne in thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
He hath excepted
no man for merite, he hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
no man for hys ſtocke
or linage, he hath made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the ſtate of men. The
Goſpell of the Croſſe of Chryſte
was ſent euen to all men. And
leſte the miniſterie of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
ſhoulde ſeeme to bee done
by the onely woorke of manne:
beholde (ſayeth he) I am with
you alwayes euen vnto the
worldes ende: That is to ſaye,
when ye ſhall enter in as ſhepe
amonge wolues, be not afraide
of youre owne infyrmitie, but
<pb facs="tcp:213:80"/>
put youre truſte in my power,<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note>
whiche vnto the ende of the
worlde wyll not forſake you in
all this worke or buſineſſe. Not
to the ende that ye ſhoulde ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
nothynge: but that that
muche more is, I wyll brynge
it ſo to paſſe that ye ſhall not be
ouercome with the ragyng cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
of any tyrauntes. For in
my power ſhall ye preache, and
by me it ſhal come to paſſe, that
euen amonges the denyers and

I haue taught, and I wyl
perfourme that whiche I haue
promiſed. They ſhal betray you
in theyr counſayles, and ſhall
ſcourge you in their ſinagoges,
<pb facs="tcp:213:81"/>
and for my names ſake ſhall ye
ſtande before Kynges and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
in a witneſſe to them, and
to the gentiles. But when they
ſhall delyuer you vppe, take no
thought howe or what ye ſhall
ſpeake: for it is not ye that ſhall
ſpeake, but the ſpirite of your
father that ſpeaketh in you.</p>
               <p>For the brother ſhall betray
the brother vnto death, and the
father the ſonne, and the Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhall ariſe againſt their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and mothers, and ſhall
put them to death, and ye ſhall
be hated of al men for my name
ſake. But whoſoeuer ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
vnto the ende, he ſhall bee
ſaued. The grace of GOD
oure Sauyoure hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Titus. 2.</note>
appeared (ſayeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle)
vnto all menne: and
yet were the gyftes of grace
<pb facs="tcp:213:81"/>
hated of all men. And whyle
there were ſome that hated, &amp;
other ſome that were oppreſſed
with the hatred of them that
perſecuted: yet was there ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the rebelles hauynge the
loſſe of theyr ſaluacion, but the
dignitie of the faithfull obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
the nombre of al fulneſſe.
For the Apoſtle Saincte Iohn
ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> But yf any man ſinne,
we haue an aduocate with the

for our ſinnes only, but alſo frr
the ſinnes of the whole world.
And it is a miſterie of a great &amp;
vnſpekable Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
thoſe preachers to whom it
was ſaid:<note place="margin">Mark 16.</note> Go ye into al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
<pb facs="tcp:213:82"/>
&amp; preach the Goſpell to al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note>
vnto the ſame was it
ſayde afore, ye ſhall not go into
the waye of the Gentyles, and
into the Cities of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes
ſhall ye not enter, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
go ye to the loſte ſheepe of
the houſe of Iſrael. For though
the Goſpell ſhoulde be directed
vnto the vocation and callyng
of all men, and the Lord would
al men to be ſaued, and to come
to the knowledge of the trueth:
yet notwithſtanding, he hadde
not taken away from himſelfe
the power and aucthoritie of
his diſpenſation, ſo that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his councell ſhoulde run
otherwyſe then he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his ſecrete and iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment:
wherefore the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes
of obſtinate mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes
take no place. For it is
<pb facs="tcp:213:82"/>
ſure, that whatſoeuer GOD
would haue done, ought not to
be done otherwiſe the he wold.
And in tyme paſte, what tyme
the Lord Ieſus ſate in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
of God the father, and the
preachers of the worde dyd la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the buſineſſe that they
had taken vpon them,<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
wyllynge to preache the
worde in Aſia, were forbidden
of the holye ghoſte. And when
they purpoſed to goe into Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,
they were forbydden of
the ſpirite of Ieſus: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
not that the grace of God
was denyed to that people, but
as it ſhoulde appeere, it was
protracted &amp; delayed for a time.
For afterwardes the Chriſtian
fayth was of power among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of the deferring of their calling
<pb facs="tcp:213:83"/>

               <p>I beleue, for that intent that

               <p>For heauen and earth, the ſea,

ordeyned for this profyte and

               <p>And though that health be farr

<pb facs="tcp:213:88"/>

The which grace, though afore

and more priuie and ſecrete, yet
did it neuer denie it ſelfe at any

in manyfolde operation.
For euen in theſe dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ryuers of vnſpeakable

one maner is not geuen to all
men, nor yet one meaſure. For
thoughe all one and the ſame
veritie be preached to all men,
by the miniſters of the woorde
and of the grace of God, and al
one and the ſame exhortacion
geuen: yet is it the huſbandry
of God, and the buyldynge of
God (whoſe vertue woorketh
inuiſiblye) that, that whiche
<pb facs="tcp:213:88"/>
is buylt may go forwarde, and
that that which is tylled maye
growe and encreaſe, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
Paul witneſſeth, ſaying:
What is Apollo?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> and what is
Paule? his miniſters are they
whom ye haue beleued, euen
as the Lord hath geuen to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

hath watered, but GOD
gaue the encreaſe. So then,
neither is he that planteth any
thing, neither he that watreth,
but God that geueth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
He that planteth and he
that watreth are one, &amp; neither
of them better then other: yet
ſhall euery man receiue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
according to his labour.
We are gods labourers, ye are
gods huſbandry, ye are goddes
buyldynge. Therefore euerye
man is ſo farre forth an helper,
<pb facs="tcp:213:89"/>
a workeman, and a miniſter of
this huſbandry and buyldyng,
as the Lord ſhal geue vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

tylled through the laboure of
the miniſters, do encreaſe vnto
that meaſure whereunto the
aucthour of the encreaſe ſhall
aduaunce them. For in the field
of the Lorde there is not al like
and one maner of plantynge.
And though the buyldyng of al

one beautie, yet haue not al the

And wherof theſe ſayde
membres become apte, wence
<pb facs="tcp:213:89"/>
they become profitable, and
whence they become ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the ſame doctour declareth,
ſaying. Therefore I do you to

Ieſus: and no man canne
call Ieſus the Lord, but by the

of adminiſtrations, and yet but
one Lorde: and there be diuers
maner of operations, and yet

               <p>The gyft of the ſpirite is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">That is to ſai to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to vvhom they are geuen.</note>

theſe thinges worketh one and
the ſame ſpirit, deuiding them
to euery man, euen as he wyll.
Seynge that the teacher of the

thynges with ſo great a lyght,
and ſuche a playneſſe: by what
reaſon or for what cauſe ſhould

yf he woulde haue the cauſes

whereby euery man may

that a certayne man goinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

For it is one thynge to be able

               <p>Wherfore, euery thinge that

nor euery thinge that is cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
made hole. For it commeth
of nature to be repayrable and
curable, but to be repayred and
cured, is of grace.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, thoſe to
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an vnlyke number of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes
was geuen vnto, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
to the meaſure of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,

But the dul ydelnes and ſlouth

both is he dyſhonored with an

worthye was he to loſe his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable

               <p>Wherfore in the wordes folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
(wherin moſte euidently

nothing is els obiected to them

had not folowed loue. Neyther
ſhall they bee dampned becauſe
they haue not kept the gift, but
becauſe they haue not encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

the ſpirite of God was the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.</note>
of all the ſaintes that
were before the fludde, for the
whiche cauſe they were named
the ſonnes of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> For as tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayth: whoſoeuer are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or led by the ſpirite of God,
thei are the ſonnes of God. And
when they hadde neglected the
obſeruations of theyr fathers,
by mynglynge them ſelues in
the vnlawfull mariages of the
reprobates, and for that wicked
<pb facs="tcp:213:96"/>
ſocietie and mingling were iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
worthye of deſtruction: the
lorde ſayde. My ſpirite ſhal not
abide in theſe men, for they are
fleſh. Wherby it appeareth that
the ſame people, whoſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ſette in a diuerſe order
with the number of their yeres,
was afore that ſpirituall, euen
in the ſame wyl which the holy
ghoſt doth gouerne: beſtowinge
the temperauncye of hys regy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and gouernaunce in ſuch
ſort, that he toke not away the
power to declyne to ſynne: the
which power if this people had
not hadde, they coulde neyther
haue forſaken God nor yet bee
forſaken of God: It ſhoulde bee
that ſame of whom it is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Happye is he that was able to

Duryng the tyme therfore that<note place="margin">Eccle. 13.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:213:96"/>
thys people abode in God, they
remayned in that wyl that god
inſpyred and gouerned. For the
wyll (as it is wrytten) is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the Lord. But of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
there is not alwaye
one ſucceſſe nor yet one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
for the workes and gyftes
of grace are diſceuered in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
wiſe and by innumerable
differences, and in euerye kinde
of the ſaid gyftes, there are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
degrees and vneuen quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.
For lyke as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vp of earbes &amp; trees that
the earth bringeth forth, there
is not al one beauti or likenes,
nor one kynd of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth forth in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of his owne ſeede, &amp; in
the quantitie of his own kynd:
neither do thei receiue ful beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
incontinent, aſſone as they
come foorth, but come forward
<pb facs="tcp:213:97"/>
by certayne orderly encreaſing,
vntyll they come to the perfyte
quantitie of theyr ſtate that
happened vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſame
increaſinge or growinge. Euen
ſo, the ſedes of the gyftes of the
holy ghoſte, and the plantes of
vertues, do not growe in euery
fielde of mans heart hollye, the
ſame and attonce that thei ſhal
bee afterwardes. And it is an
harde thinge to fynde ripeneſſe
in the beginning, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Yet many tymes the mightie
and mercyfull God doth poure
forth theſe meruaylous effectes
of his workinge, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

And that there maye be none

<pb facs="tcp:213:98"/>
there wante not other
examples of the lyke doctrine,
the whiche I ouerpaſſe becauſe
I woulde be briefe: yet is that

the heauenlye liberalitie
particulerly geueth, doth grow
by lyttle and lyttle, to thintent
that the cauſes of the gyftes
which are to be geuen, maye be
brought forth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giftes which

helpe mine vnbeliefe. And the
which they perceiued not to be

ſaide:<note place="margin">Luke. 17.</note> Lord encreaſe our faith.
Some men do not vnderſtande
the thing that they do beleue, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:213:98"/>
many of thoſe are long holden
in the meaſure of their ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.
Many do ſone receiue the

all men one power and force, or
like aptneſſe. And manye men
there be, which when thei ſeme
to be decked and adorned with
faith &amp; vnderſtanding, yet faint
they for lacke of charitie, &amp; can
not abide in thoſe thinges that
they ſee by faith and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
for a man cannot alway
continue in that thing that he
loueth not with all his harte.
Alſo the gyft of charitie it ſelfe
is not alwayes ſuche, that the
receiuer thereof can take at
once whatſoeuer belongeth to
the fulneſſe therof. For there is
a loue which may be ouercome
with another loue, and many
times the loue of GOD fadeth
<pb facs="tcp:213:99"/>
and widdereth awaye through
the loue of the world: except it
encreaſe to ſuche an heate tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

whiche can be quenched with
no colde, nor waxe fainte tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
any heate.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpekable
gifte of God there is a
ſumme of all gyftes, or a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
whereto they are geuen, &amp;
alſo a certeyne lyfe of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
all other giftes are geuen
to this ende and purpoſe, that
the entent of the faythful ſoule
maye haue whereby it maye
preaſe and attayne to perfite
charitie. The which, becauſe it
is not only of god but alſo God
himſelfe, it maketh men ſtable
and durable, and alſo vnable
to be ouercome, whom it hath
fylled with the ryuer of his
<pb facs="tcp:213:99"/>
pleaſures. But they that know
not the ſweteneſſe of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

of this worlde: or elles yf
they haue taſted anye thyng of

by theyr owne free wyll. And
yf they continue in that ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardy,

that fell into nature throughe
an euyll wyll, is not ouercome

that firſt people was gouerned

that the temporarie wood<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe

For although there were

what is the matter
<pb facs="tcp:213:120"/>
that ſo greate a multitude of
Infantes are alienated from
euerlaſtynge ſaluation, and
ſo many thouſandes of menne
in theſe dayes are left without
eternall lyfe, as though he had

into the bandes of vnlooſeable

the act offendeth not, where the

ſuch as repulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refuſeth, euen

ſhal not be troubled about this
depth of gods ſeperation, if we
beleue with a firme and ſtedfaſt
fayth that all gods iudgement
is iuſt, &amp; do not deſyre to know
that thyng that he would haue

can not fynde out whye he ſo

Albeit this queſtion is not ſo

And as touching the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timelineſſe
of death, there is no
reaſon why to complaine of it,
ſeyng that death &amp; mortalitie
being once entred into our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

that it ſhuld not alway be

The begynnyng of this life

For there remayneth an heauy

But the weyght of this

Seyng then that the iuſte and

doeth without ceaſſyng iudge

that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can come into this

and departyng, which
the ruler of thynges accordyng
to his moſte hyghe knowledge

(as it is wrytten in the booke

that theſe men of few dayes or

that part of grace whiche is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
geuen vnto all Nacions.
The which grace doubtleſſe, yf
theyr parentes had vſed well,
they alſo hadde ben holpen by
them. For the ſpryngyng vp of
all Infantes, and all thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynges
of infancie beynge

neyther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they by any meanes
be holpen but by other menne.
<pb facs="tcp:213:125"/>
And ſo it foloweth, that they
perteyne to thoſe of whoſe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ryght or wronge affection
they are gouerned. For lyke as☞
they beleue of another mans
confeſſion and fayth, ſo of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans infidelitie or diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
they beleue not. And
foraſmuch as they neyther had
deſire of this preſent lyfe, nor
yet of the lyfe to come: lyke as
theyr parentes are the cauſe
that they were firſte borne, ſo
are they the cauſe why they are
not regenerate &amp; borne againe.
And lyke as touchynge the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
beſides the generall grace
that knocketh at the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

and ſecretely, a ſpeciall grace is

alſo the ſame election is playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

So that the diligence of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
hath oftentymes ſerued
many Infantes, whom the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlyneſſe

worke of grace, who (except he
be to arrogant &amp; moſt foolyſhe)
dare complaine of gods iuſtice,
that the lyke prouidence doeth
not helpe all Infantes: &amp; that
it doth not eyther by power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
<pb facs="tcp:213:126"/>
and put awaye, or els by
mercy preuent all perylles and

which ſhall dye? Whiche thyng
doubtleſſe ſhuld ſo come to paſſe
vpon al, if it ought ſo vtterly to
be done. But it is not vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
howe muche ſlouchfulneſſe
ſhould be engendred in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of the faythfull, yf in the
baptizing of infantes nothing
were to be feared touching any

that ſuch ſhuld be without bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme.
And in this felicitie of
Infantes, ſo vnable to be loſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
opinion of that errour ſhuld be

to be due by all equitie to faut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

Neyther hadde it ben vngodly

that grace hath that it

But all the diſciples of
the trueth, do knowe this to be
deteſtably ſpoken. And hereby
it is manifeſt, that they whiche
are ſaued, are ſaued not by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
but by grace. For it is no
doubt, but that they which dye
without baptiſm are peryſhed:
who doubtleſſe, except they had
ben partakers of moſt greuous
ſinne, ſhoulde not peryſhe. But
<pb facs="tcp:213:127"/>
not it is declared on this wiſe
by the ſecrete diſtribution or
difference makyng of God, yet
beyng iuſte, both what grace
can geue, and alſo what ſinfull
nature can deſerue: to the ende
that neyther pryde ſhoulde be
lyfted vp agaynſte the gyfte,
nor diligence ſhoulde ceaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt

we conſider the laſt times,
the firſt or the middel, it is both
reaſonable and godly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued,
that God wylleth al men
to be ſaued, &amp; euermore wolde:
and this is declared none other
wyſe then by thoſe benefites, &amp;
that ſame prouidence of God,
which he commonly and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
geueth vnto all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
For ſuche maner of

that by the teſtimonies of
<pb facs="tcp:213:128"/>
them, men myght be holpen to
ſeeke the true Godde: with the
whiche giftes proteſtyng theyr
auctoritie throughout al worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
the aboundaunce of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
grace was powred foorth.
Which grace, although it be ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
forth now more plentifully
then it hath ben aforetime: yet
hath god reſerued the cauſes of
his owne diſtributions thereof
within his owne knowledge, &amp;
hath hydde them within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
place of his moſt myghtie
wyll: which ſhoulde not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
yf they were geuen in
one vniforme maner vnto all
men. And foraſmuch as there
is no more ambiguitie or doubt
of the generall benignitie of
God, then there is of his ſpecial
mercy: there ſhould be nothing
that ſhould cauſe vs to wonder
<pb facs="tcp:213:128"/>
as though the one were grace
and the other no grace. But it
hath pleaſed God to geue the
one to manye men, and to pull
awaye the other from no man,
that it myght appeere on both
partes, that that thyng which
was geuen to the porcion of
menne, was not denyed to all:
but yet in ſome, grace to haue

For we ſo beleue this more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant

to me, excepte the father
whiche ſent me do drawe hym.
<pb facs="tcp:213:131"/>
Bnt that is ſpoken becauſe we
ſhoulde knowe, that that faith,
without the whiche no manne
commeth vnto Chryſte, is the
gift of the father, accordinge to
that whiche was ſayde to the
Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> Bleſſed art thou Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Bariona, for fleſhe and
bloud hath not reuealed thys
vnto thee, but my father which
is in heauen, whiche wrought
in the hartes of them that were
to be drawen, that they myght
beleue, and brought it to paſſe
that they myght wyl. For there
could be nothyng howe or why
they ſhoulde be drawen, yf they
were not folowers in faith and
in wyll: for they whiche beleue
not, are not drawen at all, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther☜
do they come: neyther doe
ſuch as diſſent, approch or draw
nere, but they goe backwarde
<pb facs="tcp:213:132"/>
and depart away.</p>
               <p>Therefore they whiche come,
are led by loue: for they beynge
loued fyrſt, haue loued agayne:
they haue bene ſought, &amp; haue
ſought: and they haue wylled
that which GOD willed them
to wyll: whiche ſo geueth that
wyll of obedience vnto them,
that he taketh not awaye from
them that perſeuer, that muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
whiche maye nyll. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe,
no faythfull manne
ſhould at any tyme haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the fayth. Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
&amp; vncleane deſyre ſhould
ouercome no manne, heuineſſe
ſhuld hurt no man, anger ſhuld
ouercome no man: No mannes
charitie ſhoulde waxe colde, no

and no man ſhoulde neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte
grace beynge geuen vnto
<pb facs="tcp:213:132"/>
him. But nowe, becauſe theſe
thynges may come to paſſe, and
becauſe there is an eaſie and a
ſteepe diſcendynge downe into
the conſent of ſuche temptaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
That ſayinge of the Lorde
ought alwaye to ſounde in the
eares of the faythfull, wherein
it is ſayd to the Apoſtles, watch
and pray, leaſt ye fal into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion.<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note>
Where if he had warned
the Diſciples to watche onely,
and not alſo to praye, he ſhould
haue ſeemed to haue exhorted
the onelye power of free wyll.
But when he added: And pray,
he ſufficientlye taught them
that it ſhoulde bee geuen them
from aboue, that the ſtorme of
temptacion ſhoulde not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them whyle they wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:213:133"/>
And the lyke is it that he ſayth:<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note>
Simon Simon, beholde Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
hath deſyred to ſift you as
it were wheate, but I haue
prayed for thee that thy fayth
fayle not, and thou at length
when thou art conuerted, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
thy brethen. And pray leſt
ye fal into temptacion. Yf then
the fayth of ſo great an Apoſtle
ſhould haue failed, except Chriſt
had prayed for him: doubtleſſe
then was ther mutabilitie and
chaungeablenes in him, which
in temptacion myght wauer.
And he was not nowe made ſo
ſtronge in vertue of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
that he ſhoulde bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to no perill at all: for after
theſe things, ſo great a pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
ſmote him, that beynge
in the houſe of Caiphas, he was
ſo afrayde at the queſtion of a
<pb facs="tcp:213:133"/>
wenche, that (hys conſtancye
quite fayled) he was brought to
the poynt, that he thriſe denyed
Chryſt, with whom he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed
to dye. Then he whiche
beheld the troubled heart of the
Apoſtle, not with humaine, but
with deuyne eyes, and ſtirred
hym by a myghtye looke vnto
aboundaunte teares of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
was able, and coulde
haue geuen vnto hys chiefe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that ſtedfaſtnes of minde.
That lyke as nothynge feared
the lord him ſelfe from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to perfourme hys paſſion:
So ſhould not any feare at that
tyme, haue ouercommed bleſſed
Peter. But thys ſtabilitie was
onely proper vnto him, whiche
onely truly and mightely ſayd:
I haue power to put away my
lyfe, and I haue power to take
<pb facs="tcp:213:134"/>
it agayne.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> But in other men, ſo
longe as the fleſhe luſteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the ſpirite, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
contrary to the fleſhe, and
ſo longe as the ſpirite is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge,
but the fleſhe weake, the
immutable feare of mynde can
not bee founde, for perfect and
ſecure felicitie is not hadde in
this life, but in the life to come.
And in the vncertaintie of thys
preſent conflicte and battayle,<note place="margin">If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gette any victorie, then is pride the daunger.</note>
neyther is victory it ſelf in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pryde lying in wayte,
nor without daunger of muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.
And though Goddes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
protection and fauoure do
geue vnto innumerable hys
ſainctes power to perſeuer and
continue to the ende, yet taketh
he from none of them, that that
repugneth againſt themſelues,
whiche alſo is of them ſelues:
<pb facs="tcp:213:134"/>
that in all theyr ſtudies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoures,
euermore wyll and
nyll do ſtryue amonge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
The whiche fyght and
battaile, the ſaide bleſſed Peter
ſuffred euen in the ende of all
hys victories: for the lorde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
proteſted the ſame, when
he ſayd. Verely verely I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, when thou waſt yonge,
thou girdedſt thy ſelfe and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedſt
whyther thou wouldeſt:
But when thou art olde,<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.</note> thou
ſhalt ſtretch forth thine hands,
and another ſhal girde thee, and
leade thee whyther thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
not. And thys he ſpake to
declare, by what death he ſhuld
glorifie GOD. Then who can
doubt, yea who can but knowe,
that thys moſte ſtronge rocke
which toke part both of vertue
&amp; name of that principal rocke,
<pb facs="tcp:213:135"/>
to haue had alwaye the deſyre,
that conſtancie might be geuen
hym to dye for Chryſtes ſake?
Notwithſtandyng the oblucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
and ſtrugling of feare was
ſo vnable to bee auoyded, that
the man moſt gredie of marter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
was tolde aforehande,
that he ſhould obtayne the vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
of paſſion and ſuffringe of
death, howebeit not without
the temptacion of feare. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not without good cauſe,
not onely the Sainctes whiche
are but beginners, but alſo thei
which are growen vp vnto the
moſte perfection do vniformely
beſeche the Lorde and ſaye.</p>
               <p>Leade vs not into temptacion,
but delyuer vs from euyll. For
vnto all them that abyde in
faith and in loue,<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> it is geuen of
him that they be not ouercome
<pb facs="tcp:213:135"/>
in temptacion, that he whiche
doth glory, ſhoulde glory in the
Lorde.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> And yet doth he aſcribe
that ſame glorye vnto them
whom he geueth it vnto: that
though thei ſtande thorowe the
helpe of God, yet foraſmuch as
it laye in theyr owne power to
fall, it ſhould be theyr own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
that they dyd ſtande. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
like as thei which haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued,
are holpen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they myght

whiche not yet beleued, are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

               <p>And lyke as the one ſorte haue
in their own power to go back,
ſo the other ſort haue in theyr
own power that thei come not.
And it is made manyfeſte, that
by dyuers and innumerable
meanes God wylleth al men to
bee ſaued, and to come to the
<pb facs="tcp:213:136"/>
knowledge of the trueth: But
they whiche come, are guyded
and dyrected by the helpe of
god: and they whiche come not,
do ſtryue the contrarye in theyr
own ſtubburnes. And although
that manye men louynge their
owne darkneſſe, do not receyue
the brightnes of the truth, and
many which were once lyghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
do fall agayne into darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
yet doth the worde of God
abyde for euer, and nothing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

which the father hath geuen to

neyther is anye manne able to

take oute of hys hande, that
whiche he hath receyued. The
foundation of GOD ſtandeth
ſtedfaſt and ſure, and the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge

endure for euer, wauereth not.
The truth and mercy of GOD
beynge ſtretched foorth vppon
all men, of whom that (whiche
is both denyed to no man, and
alſo is due to no manne) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
perfourmed and brought
to paſſe in them whom he hath
promyſed. For he worketh all
in all: but out of doubt it is all

For all the wayes of the

For of euery nation, of euerye

Children of the Church, beyng

haue learned in oure

coulde not know in their owne
countreys, and haue retourned
home to theyr owne abidinges
with the doctrine of the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
religion. So then, nothing
is able to reſiſt the diuine grace,
that the thynge that he hath
wylled, ſhoulde not be fulfilled,
when very diſcordes draw men

               <p>Therfore let vs looke vnto al

All repugnauncie of variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
al cauſes of vnlykely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
which we are not able to
ſearche and diſcerne, were in
that eternall knowledge, both
knowen and deuided at once:
and nothyng was there vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
or vndiſpoſed, yea euen
of the qualities of the actions
which yet haue no beyng. For
in God there is no chaunſyng
motion or newe wyll, no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
counſell or mutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce,
neyther is his thoughte
chaunged with the inequalitie

in an euerlaſtynge and

<pb facs="tcp:213:143"/>
And he geueth all vnto al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

whiche god hath prepared, that
we ſhould walke in them.</p>
               <p>GOD therfore geueth vnto
<pb facs="tcp:213:146"/>
them whom he hath choſen
without merites, whereof they
may be garniſhed with merits.
And it is vaynely ſpoken, that
the elect nede not to worke, as
it is alſo, to ſaye that they doe
worke to thintent they may be

               <p>For the giftes of vertues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ydle, for as the veritie

be taken away from him.</p>
               <p>Therefore chaſtitie is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to thende we ſhoulde not
fyght agaynſte concupiſcence,
neyther is wiſdome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge
geuen to any man, to
the entent that hys meditation
ſhould not be in the lawe of the
lorde both day and night. What
doth the gift of loue, if the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of beneuolence or well
<pb facs="tcp:213:147"/>
willing, be not vigilant? what
fruite hath pacience, if ſtrength
of minde haue nothinge to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?
Or howe ſhall a manne bee
knowen to liue godly in Chriſt,
when he ſuffreth no perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Or that peace whiche is of
God and with god: Is it wel in
quiet if it agree with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world?
Or can the loue of god be obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without enemitie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?
The grace of God maketh
no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al vnable to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Neyther is the battayle of
the Chriſtians fortified on the
right ſyde and on the left with
the helpe of heauenly armour,
to the entent we ſhoulde fyght
with no enemie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is more
laudable and better, to bee able
not to be ouercome in battayl,
then ſluggiſhly not to be able to
be proued or aſſaulted.</p>
               <p>And to bee briefe, and to lette
<pb facs="tcp:213:147"/>
other things paſſe. I wyl proue
playnly by one teſtimonie, that
the diligence of praier is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
by the purpoſe of Gods
election. For in the booke of
Thobie, Raphaell the Aungell
ſaith to Thobies ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the commaundement of thy
father,<note place="margin">Tobie. 6.</note> for he tolde thee that
thou oughteſt to take a wyfe of
thy fathers kyndred. And nowe
heare me my brother, paſſe not
vpon the deuill, but deſyre her,
and knowe thou that ſhe ſhalbe
geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto thee euen this ſame
nyght to be thy wife. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou ſhalt come into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
take of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyuer of the fiſſhe,
and lay it on the coales, and the
ſauour of it wil come forth, and
the deuill ſhall ſmell it and wil
flee away, and neuer will come
nygh her after. And when thou
ſhalt begin to be deſirous of her
<pb facs="tcp:213:148"/>
company, ariſe both of you firſt
and beſech ye the lord of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that he wyll graunt you mercy
&amp; health: And be ye not afraide,
for ſhe was appointed vnto the
before the world was made, and
thou ſhalt heale her.</p>
               <p>Therefore though that the
thinge which god hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
can by no meanes but come
to paſſe, yet is the deſyre and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of prayer not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye,
nor the deuotion of free
wyll releaſed through the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of election, foraſmuche as
the effect of gods wyl that muſt
be fulfilled, is in ſuch wyſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordeined,
that by the buſines of
woorkes, by the inſtaunce and
interceſſion of prayers, and by
the exercyſe of vertues, there
myght bee increaſe of merites.
And they that haue done good
woorkes, ſhalbe crowned, not
<pb facs="tcp:213:148"/>
onely accordyng to the purpoſe
of GOD, but alſo according to
theyr merites &amp; deſertes. For,
for thys cauſe is the foreap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of this election hyd
in the vttermoſt and fartheſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
from mans knowledge,
and a manne can pronounce of
none before hys ende that he
ſhal come into the glori of them
which are elected, euen to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
that a profitable feare
myght preſerue and kepe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueringe
humilitie, and that he
whiche ſtandeth myght take
hede that he fal not.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> And if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
a man beyng ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by ſome temptation, doe
fal, let him not be ſwalowed vp
with heauines, neyther let him
diſpayre of hys mercye whiche
raiſeth vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that fal, &amp; lifteth
vp thoſe that are downe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.</note> For as
long as we liue in this body, no

mans amendement ought to be

And therfore let the holi church
pray, &amp; geue thankes for them
that haue beleued, let it deſyre
