            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Juſt and Solemn PROTESTATION OF THE Free-born People of England, and Free Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> againſt a Clauſe in the late <hi>Ordinance</hi> to deprive them of their Free <hi>Elections,</hi> and enſlave them.</head>
            <p>VVEE the <hi>Free-born</hi> People of <hi>England</hi> and Free <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> do Proteſt and Declare, that it neither is, nor ought to be in the power of one or both Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi> to make or declare <hi>New Treaſons</hi> (of things not treaſonable in their own Nature) to carry on the <hi>private Deſigns</hi> of any prevayling Faction in the <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and by colour thereof to deprive us of our <hi>Lives, Liberties, Officers, Estates,</hi> and <hi>Franchiſes</hi> at their pleaſure, it being contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> the <hi>Fundamentall Laws</hi> of the Land, the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>couenant,</hi> and their own <hi>Declarations</hi> all this Parliament till of late, and the higheſt pitch of that Arbitrary and Tyrannical power they and we have ſo long proteſted and fought againſt, which we neither may nor can ſubmit to. That it is one of the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>City of London</hi> confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> c. 9. and ſundry other Acts of Parliament ſince, that they may freely Elect ſuch Citizens for the Maior, Aldermen, Common Councel men, and other publike Officers of the City, as they ſhal think meeteſt and ableſt to diſcharge thoſe places; and the Statute 3. <hi>E.</hi> 1. c. 5. directly En<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts; <hi>That all Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ought to be free, and that no great man nor other by force of Arms or Menacies ſhal diſturb any to make free elections:</hi> which Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his <hi>Comm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntary</hi> on this Statute (printed by order of this preſent Parliament) proves to be the common <hi>Law of England,</hi> and <hi>Subjects Birthright.</hi> And therefore we can no ways ſubmit to the late ſudden <hi>Ordinance</hi> (contrived by the practice of <hi>pre-ingaged Members</hi> and Officers in the Army) of 17. <hi>Decemb,</hi> 1647. in this particular clauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That no perſon whatſoever who hath entred into that late Engagement in or about the CITY OF LONDON, adjudged TREASO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NABLE by both Houſes if Parliament or ſhal for the ſpace of one whole</hi> (by the ſame reaſon they might have added 20 yearts) <hi>to be accounted from the</hi> 25. of December 1647. <hi>be elected, choſen, or put into the office or place of Lord Maior of the CITY OF LONDON, or of Alderman, Sheriff, Deputy of a Ward, or Councelmen of the ſame City, nor ſhal have voyce in election of any ſuch Officers. And all ſuch perſons ARE HEREBY MADE VNCAPABLE,</hi> and be declared ſo to be <hi>OF ANY OF THE SAID PLACES. And if any election ſhal be made of any ſuch perſon THE SAME IS HERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BY ORDAINED TO BE NVLL AND VOYD. And the Lord Maior of the City of London for the time being, is from time to time to give ſpecial order, that this Ordinance be publiſhed at all Elections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the ſame be ſtrictly and punctually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And therefore we do in all humility (in vindication of our own juſt Rights) proteſt againſt it, as an high <hi>violation</hi> of, and <hi>Encroachment</hi> upon our <hi>undoubted Liberties</hi> and <hi>Freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and a <hi>miſchievous-Plot,</hi> of the confederated <hi>Independent Party</hi> in the Houſes, Army and City, to raiſe up New Combuſtions and Diſcontents between the City and Houſes; to deprive us of our <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Freedom in the Elections of our City Officers</hi> now at hand, to bring in a new pack of <hi>Independent Aldermen, Common Councel men</hi> and other Officers to overtop and ruin the City, and put by thoſe faithful Aldermen and Citizens from bearing office, in whom we moſt confide; which they formerly endevored, and in part effected by impeaching and impriſoning our late Lord Maior, and faithful Aldermen and Citizens, upon falſe pretences and endevors to bring up the Army to quarter in the City at this time, and the late ridulous plot diſcovered to and by the Speaker. And we do further avow and proteſt, that this <hi>Engagement in the City,</hi> declared by theſe confederates power (whiles the Houſes were under the Armies Force and Wardſhip) to be Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by this, and a former repealed O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
