            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW that wee are about to brand
theſe Canons in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contained in them, it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time to open the fouleneſſe
thereof: and though much of this
hath beene anticipated in the generall debate,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96360:3"/>
yet if any thing hath beene omitted, or if any
thing may be farther cleered in that kind, it is
for the ſervice of the Houſe, that it ſhould now
be done.</p>
            <p>Sir, <hi>I</hi> conceive theſe Canons doe containe ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
matters, which are not onely contrary to the
Lawes of this Land, but alſo deſtructive of the
very principall and fundamentall Lawes of this
<hi>Kingdome. J</hi> ſhall beginne with the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
wherein the framers of theſe Canons have
aſſumed unto themſelves a Parliamentary power,
and that too in a very high degree, for they have
taken upon them to define what is the power of
the King, what the liberty of the Subjects, and
what propriety he hath in his goods. If this bee
not proper to a Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> J know not what
is. Nay it is the higheſt matter that can fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conſideration of a Parliament, and ſuch
a point as wherein they would have walked with
more tenderneſſe and circumſpection, then theſe
bold Divines have done. And ſurely as this was an
act of ſuch preſumption as no age can parallell:
ſo is it of ſuch dangerous conſequence as nothing
can bee more. For they doe not onely take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to determine matters of this nature, but
alſo under great penalties, forbid all Parſons,
Vicars, Curats, Readers in Divinitie &amp;c. To
ſpeake any other wayes of them then as they
had defined, by which Meanes having ſeiſed
upon all the Conduits, whereby knowledge is
conveyed unto the people, how eaſie would it
be for them in time, to undermine the Kings
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96360:3"/>
prerogative, and to ſuppreſſe the Subjects li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or both.</p>
            <p>And now (Sir) I beſeech you to conſider how
they have defined this high and great point: they
have dealt with us in matter of Divinity, as the
Judges had done before in matter of Law: they
firſt tooke upon them to determine a matter that
belonged not to their Judicature, but onely to
the Parliament, and after by their judgement they
overthrew our propriety, and juſt ſo have theſe
Divines dealt with us: they tell us that Kings are
an Ordinance of God, of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and
founded in the Prime Lawes of Nature, from
whence it will follow that all other formes of
government, as <hi>Ariſtocracies,</hi> and <hi>Democracies,</hi> are
wicked formes of Government contrary to the
Ordinance of God, and the Prime Lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is ſuch new Divinity as I never read
in any Booke, but in this new Booke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> We all know that Kings, and
States, and Judges, and all Magiſtrates are the
Ordinances of God, but (Sir) give me leave to
ſay they were the Ordinances of men, before
they were the Ordinances of God. J know I am
upon a great and high point, but <hi>J</hi> ſpeake by as
great and as high a warrant, if Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire
cannot erre (as Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſtles cannot) thus
he teacheth us, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the
King as ſupreame, or to the Governour, as to him that
is ſent by him &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96360:4"/>
(Sir) it is worthy noting, that they are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of men, but that they are to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto for the Lords ſake, and truely their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is as juſt, and their ſubjects alleageance as
due unto them, though we ſuppoſe them to be firſt
ordinances of men, and then confirmed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
by Gods Ordinance, as if wee ſuppoſe
them to be immediate ordinances of God, and ſo
received by men. But there was ſomewhat in it,
that theſe Divines aimed at, I ſuppoſe it was this.
If Kings were of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> as the Office of a
Paſtour, in the Church, or founded in the prime
Lawes of Nature, as the power of a Father in a
Family; then it would certainly follow, that they
ſhould receave the faſhion and manner of their
government, onely from the Preſcript of Gods
Word, or of the Lawes of Nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
if there be no text neither of the <hi>Old</hi> nor
<hi>New Teſtament,</hi> nor yet any Law of nature, that
Kings may not make Lawes without <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
they may make Lawes without <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and if
neither in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Kings be forbidden to lay taxes or any kind
of impoſitions upon their people without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> they may doe it out of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
and that this was their meaning, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it after in plaine termes, for they ſay that
Subſidies and taxes, and all manner of aydes are
due unto Kings by the Law of God, and of nature.
(Sir) if they bee due by the Law of God and of
nature, they are due, though there bee no act of
<hi>Parliament</hi> for them, nay (Sir) if they be due by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96360:4"/>
ſuch a right, a hundred acts of <hi>Parliaments</hi> cannot
take them away, or make them undue. And
(Sir) that they meant it of Subſidies and aides ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
without conſent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> is cleerely
that addition, that they ſubjoyne unto it, that
this doth not take away from the Subject the
propriety hee hath in his goods, for had they ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Subſidies and aides given by conſent in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
this would have beene a very ridiculous
addition, for who ever made any queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the giving Subſidies in <hi>Parliament</hi> did take
away from the Subject the propriety hee hath in
his goods, when as it doth evidently imply they
have a propriety in their goods? for they could
not give unleſſe they had ſomething to give: but
becauſe that was alleadged as a chiefe reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſhip-money, and other ſuch illegall pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
levied upon the people, without their
conſent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that it did deprive them of
their right of propriety which they have in their
goods, theſe <hi>Divines</hi> would ſeeme to make ſome
anſwer thereunto, but in truth their anſwer is
nothing elſe but the bare aſſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtion of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and it is an eaſie thing to ſay a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but impoſſible to reconcile it; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if it be a true rule (as it is moſt true) <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uod me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
eſt ſine conſenſu meo, non poteſt fieri alienum;</hi>
to take my goods without my conſent muſt needs
deſtroy my propriety. Another thing in this
firſt Canon, wherein they have aſſumed unto
themſelves a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> power, is in that they
take upon them to define what is Treaſon, beſides
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96360:5"/>
what is determined in the ſtatute of Treaſons.
They ſay, to ſet up any coactive independent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is treaſonable both againſt God and the King,
the queſtion is not whether it be true they ſay or
noe, but whether they have power to ſay what
is Treaſon, and what not? But now (Sir) that
I am upon this point, J would gladly know what
kind of power that is, which is exerciſed by
<hi>Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Arch-Deacons,
&amp;c.</hi> Coactive certainly it is, all the Kingdome
feeles the laſh thereof, and it muſt needes bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,
if it be <hi>jure Divino,</hi> as they hold it,
for they doe not meane by an independent power,
ſuch a power as doth not depend on GOD.
Beſides if their power bee dependent, of whom
is it dependent? not of the King, for the Law
acknowledgeth no way whereby Eccleſiaſticall
juriſdiction can bee derived from his Majeſtie,
but by his commiſſion under the great Seal, which
as I am informed, they have not: I ſpeake not of
the High Commiſſion, but of that juriſdiction
which they exerciſe in their <hi>Archiepiſcopall, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall,
Archidiaconall Courts, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore
if their owne ſentence bee juſt, wee know what
they are, and what they have pronounced againſt
themſelves. But (Sir) it were worth knowing
what they aymed at in that independent, coactive
power, which they terme popular. J will not
take upon mee to unfold their meaning; but wee
know Doct. <hi>Beale</hi> had a hand in the making of
theſe Canons, and if wee apply his <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> to
the text, it may give us ſome cleereneſſe. <hi>J</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96360:5"/>
amongſt other notes of his this was one,
that we did acknowledge the Kings Supremacy,
but would joyne unto him an aſſiſtant <hi>(viz.)</hi> the
people, meaning this Houſe, which being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
body of the COMMONS of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and claiming, as it is ſo, a ſhare in the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
power, Doct: <hi>Beale</hi> calleth this a joyning
of an aſſiſtant to the King, in whom ſoly he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the power of making Lawes, and that it
is but of grace, that he aſſumeth either the Lords,
or Commons for the making of Lawes with him.
Now (Sir) the Legiſlative power is the greateſt
power, and therefore coactive, and it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
power, and therefore independent, and if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Eſtate for the proportion it hath therein,
ſhould not have ſuch a power, it ſhould not have
it of right, as founded in the Fabricke and frame,
of the policy and government, but of Grace, or
by Commiſſion, as Doctor <hi>Beale</hi> affirmeth. J have
done with the firſt Canon, onely J ſhall adde
this, that conſidering the Principles and poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are laid downe therein, and comparing
them with a clauſe towards the end of the Canon,
that in no caſe imaginable it is lawfull for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to defend themſelves, wee may judge how
farre forth theſe Canons were to prepare mens
mindes for the force that was to follow after; if
the accuſation againſt my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> be
layed aright. For the matter it ſelfe, I hope
there will never be any need to diſpute that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and J doe beleeve they had as little need,
to have publiſhed that poſition, had it not beene
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96360:6"/>
upon deſigne. As for the ſecond Canon, therein
alſo they have aſſumed to themſelves a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
power, in taking upon them, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
Holidayes, whereas the Statute ſaith in
expreſſe wordes, that ſuch dayes ſhall bee onely
kept as Holy dayes as are named in the Statute, and
no other, and therefore though the thing may
be <hi>bonum,</hi> yet it was not done <hi>bene,</hi> becauſe not
ordained by Parliament, notwithſtanding what
hath beene alleadged to the contrary: it ſeemeth
to me to be the appoynting of an Holy day, to
ſet a time a part for Divine Service, and to force
men under penalties to leave their labours,
and buſineſſe, and to be preſent at it. And of
the ſame nature is that other clauſe, in the ſame
Canon, wherein they take upon them without
<hi>Parliament,</hi> to lay a charge upon the people, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
two Bookes at leaſt for that day, to be
bought at the charge of the Pariſh, for by the ſame
right, that they may lay a penny on the Pariſh
without <hi>Parliament,</hi> they may lay a pound or any
greater Summe.</p>
            <p>As to the third Canon, I ſhall paſſe it over, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the obſervation that my neighbour of the long
Robe made upon it, ſeemes unto mee ſo good as
that it is worth the repeating, that whereas in the
Canon againſt Sectaries there is an eſpeciall <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi>
that it ſhall not derogate from any Statute,
or Law made againſt them (as if their Canons had
any power to diſanull an act of <hi>Parliament)</hi> there
is no ſuch <hi>Proviſo</hi> in this Canon againſt Papiſts,
from whence it may be probably conjectured, that

they might have drawne ſome colour of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from the penall Lawes eſtabliſhed againſt
them from this Canon,, becauſe it might ſeeme
hard that they ſhould be doubly puniſhed for the
ſame thing, as we know in the point of abſence
from the Church; the Law provideth, that if
any man be firſt puniſhed by the ordinary, he ſhall
not be puniſhed againe by the Juſtices.</p>
            <p>For the fourth Canon againſt <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi>
therein alſo theſe Canon-makers have aſſumed
to themſelves, a Parliamentary power, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
an Hereſie not determined by Law, which
is expreſſely reſerved to the determination of a
Parliament. <hi>It is true, they ſay it is a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many hereſies, condemned in the foure
firſt Conncills, but they doe not ſay what thoſe
Hereſies are, and it is not poſſible that Socinianiſme
ſhould bee formally condemned in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills,
for it is ſprang up but of late;</hi> Therefore
they have taken upon them, to determine and
damne a Hereſie, and that ſo generally, as that it
may be of very dangerous conſequence, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<hi>Socinianiſme</hi> for an <hi>hereſie,</hi> and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
what is <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> it is left in their
breſts whom they will judge, and call a <hi>Socinian.</hi>
I would not have any thing that I have ſaid
to be interpreted, as if J had ſpoken it in favour
of <hi>Socianiſme,</hi> which (if it be ſuch as J appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it to be) is indeed a moſt vile aud damnable
<hi>hereſie,</hi> and therefore the framers of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
are the more to blame in the next Canon
againſt Sectaries, wherein beſides that in the pre-Preamble
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96360:7"/>
thereof, they lay it downe for a certaine
ground, which the holy Synod knew full well,
that other Sects (which they extend not onely
to <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> but alſo to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that for the ſpace of a moneth, doe abſent
themſelves without a reaſonable cauſe, from
their owne Pariſh Churches) doe equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the Subverſion of the Diſcipline, and
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
although the worſt of them doe not beare
any proportion, in that reſpect to the Papiſts, J
ſay beſides that they make them equall in crime,
and puniſhment to the Papiſts, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great diſproportion of their Tenents,
there is an other paſſage in this Canon relative
to that againſt <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> which I ſhall eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
offer to your conſideration, and that is this.
If a Gentleman comming from beyond Seas
ſhould happen to bring over with him a Booke,
contrary to the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or ſhould give ſuch a Booke to his friend,
nay if any man ſhould abett, or maintaine an
opinion contrary thereunto, though it were but
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> if he thought it fit to be altered, by
this Canon hee is excommunicate <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and
lyeth under the ſame conſideration, and is lyable
to the ſame puniſhment; as if he had maintained
an opinion againſt the Deity of CHRIST, and of
the Holy Ghoſt, and of our Juſtification by the
ſatiſfaction of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>(Sir) if in things that are in their owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
indifferent, if in things diſputable, it ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96360:7"/>
be as heynous to abett or maintaine an opinion,
as in the moſt horrible and monſtrous hereſies,
that can bee imagined, what liberty is left to
us as Chriſtians? What liberty is left to us as
men? I proceed to the ſixt Canon, wherein
theſe <hi>Canoniſts</hi> have aſſumed to themſelves a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary</hi>
power, and that in a very high degree,
in that they have taken upon them to impoſe
new Oathes, upon the Kings Subjects. (Sir)
under favour, of what hath beene alleaged to the
contrary, to impoſe an Oath, if it bee not an
higher power, then to make a Law, it is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of making a Law of a moſt high Nature, and
of higher and farther conſequence then any other
Law, and I ſhould much rather chuſe that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
ſhould have a power to make Lawes, to
bind my perſon and my eſtate, then that they
ſhould have a power to make Oathes to bind my
conſcience: a Law binds mee no longer then till
another Law be made to alter it, but my Oath
bindes mee as long as I live. Againe, a Law
bindes mee either to <hi>obedience,</hi> or to undergoe
the penalty inflicted by the Law, but my Oath
bindes mee abſolutely to <hi>obedience.</hi> And laſtly,
a Law binds me no longer then I am in the Land,
or at the fartheſt no longer then I am a Member
of the <hi>State;</hi> wherein and whereby the Law is
made, but my Oath once being taken, doth bind
mee in all places, and in all conditions ſo long as
I live. <hi>Thus much J thought good to ſpeake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the power of impoſing new Oathes: as
to the matter of this new Oath, it is wholy illegall.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96360:8"/>
It is aginſt the Law of this Land, it is againſt the
Law and Light of Nature, it is againſt the Law
of GOD, it is againſt the Lawes of this KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME;
And that, no obſcure Lawes, nor
concerning any meane, or pettie matters. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law of the Kings Supremacie, in that
it maketh <hi>Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Arch-Deacons,
&amp;c.</hi> to be <hi>jure Divino,</hi> whereas the
Law of this Land hath annexed to the <hi>Imperiall</hi>
Crowne of this Realme, not onely all <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
Juriſdiction, but alſo all <hi>Superiority,</hi> over
the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> State, and it is to bee derived
from him by Commiſſion under the great Seale,
and conſequently it is <hi>Jure humano.</hi> Againe,
it is againſt the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> eſtabliſhed by
Law point blanck, for therein I am ſworne not
onely to conſent unto, but alſo to aſſiſt, and to the
uttermoſt of my power, to defend all Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
preheminence, &amp;c. annexed to the Imperiall
Crowne of this Realme, of which this is one
(and that which immediately precedeth this
Oath in the Statute, and whereunto it doth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
relate) <hi>That his Majeſtie may exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Juriſdictions, or Eccleſiaſticall government by
his Commiſſion under the great Seale directed to
ſuch perſons, as hee ſhall thinke meet, ſo that if hee
ſhall thinke other perſons more meet, then Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoos,
Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> I am ſworne in the Oath of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi>
not onely to aſſent thereunto, but to aſſiſt,
and to the uttermoſt of my power to defend ſuch
an appointment of his Majeſty, and in this new
Oath J ſhall ſweare never to conſent unto ſuch an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96360:8"/>
alteration. In the like manner it is againſt the
Law, and Light of Nature, that a man ſhould
ſweare to anſwere, (&amp;c.) to he knowes not what.
It is againſt the Law and light of Nature, that a
man ſhould ſweare never to conſent, to alter a
thing, that in its owne nature is alterable, and may
prove inconvenient, and fit to be altered. Laſtly,
it is againſt the Law of God: for whereas there
are three rules preſcribed to him that will ſweare
aright, that he <hi>ſweare in Judgement, in Truth, and
righteouſneſſe:</hi> hee that ſhall take this new Oath,
muſt needs breake all theſe three Rules. <hi>He can not
ſweare in judgement, becauſe this Oath is ſo full of
ambiguities, that hee can not tell what hee ſweares
unto; not to ſpeake of the unextricable ambiguity
of the &amp;c.</hi> There is ſcarce one word that is not
ambiguous in the principall parts of the
Oath, as Firſt. <hi>What is meant by the Church
of England, whether all the Chriſtians in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
or whether the Clergie onely, or onely the
Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, &amp;c. or whether the
Convocation, or what?</hi> In like manner it is as
doubtfull what is meant by the Diſcipline, and
what by the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
for what ſome call ſuperſtitious Jnnovations, if
others affirme to be conſonant to the Primitive,
and that the pureſt Reformation in the time of
<hi>Edward the</hi> 6. and in the beginning of the Reigne
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo for the Doctrine of
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> if all the Poſitions that
of later yeares have beene challenged by ſome of
our Divines to bee <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96360:9"/>
contrary to the Articles of our Religion, and
which on the other ſide have beene aſſerted and
maintained as conſonant to the Doctrine of our
Church, and if the Articles of Religion were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, they might make a prety volume,
nay <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> will maintaine it in deſpight of
the <hi>Puritanes, that the Doctrine of the Church of
Rome, is the Doctrine of the Church of England.</hi>
Truely it were very fit that we knew, what were
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
before we ſweare to it, and then (Sir) give
me leave to ſay, that J ſhould bee very loath to
ſweare to the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> or to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
Tenents of the pureſt Church in the World, as
they are collected by them, farther then they agree
with the Holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Laſtly, it is as doubtfull
what is meant, by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
eſtabliſhed, and what by altering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to alter, whether that is accompted, or
eſtabliſhed, which is eſtabliſhed by act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or wheter that alſo that is eſtabliſhed, by
Canons, Injunctions, &amp;c. and whether it ſhall
not extend to that which is publiſhed by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
with the allowance of authority,</hi> and ſo
for conſenting to alter whether it be onely meant
that a man ſhall not be active in altering, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it extend to any conſent, and ſo that a man
ſhall not ſubmit to it, nor accept of it, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the <hi>State.</hi> More ambiguities might be
ſhewen, but theſe are enough to make it cleere,
<hi>that hee that ſhall take this Oath cannot ſweare
in judgement.</hi> Nor can he ſweare in truth, for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96360:9"/>
it is full of untruthes. It is not true that <hi>Diſcpline</hi>
is neceſſary to Salvation. Jt is not true, that <hi>Arch-biſhops,
Biſhops, Deanes, Arch-Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> are
<hi>jure Divino,</hi> as they muſt needs be, if the Law-makers
ought of right to eſtabliſh them, as they
are eſtabliſhed: for the Law-makers are not bound
as of right, to frame their Lawes to any other then
the Lawes of God alone. Now whether <hi>Biſhops</hi>
be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> we know it is a diſpute amongſt
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and never did any Proteſtant hold
it till of late yeares, but that <hi>Arch-biſhops, Deanes,
Arch-Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be <hi>jure Divino,</hi> I doe
not know that ever any Chriſtian held it before
and yet he that taketh this Oath muſt ſweare it.
Laſtly as he that taketh this Oath cannot ſweare
in judgement nor in truth, ſo neither can hee
ſweare in <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> for it is full of <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi>
being indeed, as hath beene well opened, a
Covenant in effect againſt the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
for if the whole State ſhould find it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
to alter the Government by <hi>Arch-biſhops,
Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> a great part of the Kingdome, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the <hi>Gentry</hi> (for not onely the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
but all that take degrees in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> are
bound to take it) will be preingaged not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to it, or admit of it. Againe it is a great
wrong to thoſe that ſhall bee <hi>Parliament</hi>-men,
that their freedome ſhall bee taken away being
bound up by an Oath, not to conſent to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of a thing, which it may bee fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for a <hi>Parliament</hi> to alter. And ſuppoſe that
for the preſent it be no hinderance to the ſervice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96360:10"/>
of God, nor yet burdenſome, to the King, and
Kingdome, yet if it ſhould prove ſo hereafter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for a man to bee bound by an Oath never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to alter it, may be a great wrong to God in
his ſervice, and to the King and Kingdome in
their peace and well-fare, and therefore this
Oath cannot bee taken in <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> For the
other Oath <hi>de parendo juri Eccleſiae, &amp; ſtando man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datis
Eccleſiae,</hi> though it make leſſe noyſe then the
other, yet it is not of leſſe dangerous conſequence.
If I remember well the Story, this was the Oath
that the <hi>Pope</hi> made King <hi>John</hi> to take, and when
he had ſworne <hi>ſtare mandatis Eccleſiae,</hi> the Pope
commanded him to reſigne his Kingdome to him,
and truely be hee Gentleman or Nobleman, or
what ever elſe when hee hath once put his necke
into this nouſe, his Ghoſtly Fathers may drag
him whither they will, <hi>for they have the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and the quality of the penance in their owne
breſt,</hi> and if they ſhall enjoyne him to give any
ſumme towards the building of a Church, or the
adorning of a <hi>Chappell,</hi> he muſt pay it, or if they
ſhould enjoyne him any ſervile or baſe action (as
there are not wanting examples of that kinde in
the time of <hi>Popery)</hi> they are ſworne <hi>ſtare manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
Eccleſiae,</hi> and ſo cannot recede, but muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it. Nay I dare not warrant any man from
the rods of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, or of <hi>Raymond</hi> of
<hi>Tholouze;</hi> what hath beene done may be done, J
am ſure the power is the ſame. And that other
Oath alſo (though more uſuall in practiſe, and
more confirmed by th<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe new <hi>Canons)</hi> which is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96360:10"/>
adminiſtred to <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> would bee looked
into. For it is hardly poſſible for them that take
it not to be for ſworne, being they ſweare to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particulars, <hi>that they cannot mind, and to
ſome that they cannot underſtand,</hi>  as how many
<hi>Church-Wardens</hi> are there in <hi>England,</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> is, in caſe they be ſworne,
to preſent the offenders againſt that <hi>Canon,</hi> which
concernes that matter. I ſhall onely adde a
word or two concerning two <hi>Canons</hi> more, which
ſeeme to be Canons of Reformation. The firſt is,
concerning excommunication, to bee pronounced
onely by a <hi>Divine,</hi> wherein it is alleadged for the
framers of theſe Canons, that if they have not
more Law on their ſides, yet they may ſeeme to
have more reaſon. For my part, as in all other
things, I thinke they have ſo mended the matter,
that they have made it farre worſe, for before
that which was found fault with was this, that a
Lay-man did that which the grave <hi>Divine</hi> ſhould
have done, and now the grave <hi>Divine</hi> muſt doe
what ever the Lay-man would have done, for the
<hi>cogniſcance</hi> of the cauſe, and the power of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
is wholy in the Lay-man, onely the grave
<hi>Divine</hi> is to bee his Servant, to execute his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and hath ſuch a kind of managing the
ſpirituall ſword allowed onely unto him, as the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> in ſome caſes were wont to afford unto
the civill Magiſtrate, in reſpect of the Temporall
ſword, for as if the Civill ſword by an implicite
<hi>Faith</hi> had beene pinned, to the Lawn-ſleeves, they
condemned men of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and then delivered
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96360:11"/>
them over to the Secular power; but what to
doe? Not to have any <hi>cogniſance</hi> of the cauſe, nor
to exerciſe any power of judicature, but onely to
bee their executioners, and to burne the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
whom they had condemned, and ſo they
judged men excommunicate, and then the civill
power was to ſend out writtes <hi>de Excommunicato
<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>apiendo</hi> againſt them, but one ſaid well, that the
ſword without <hi>cogniſance</hi> of the cauſe, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was like <hi>Polyphemus</hi> without his eye, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
violence and fury. But being accompanied
with the eye of judgement, it is equity and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
and ſurely where the ſpirituall or civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
is called upon to ſtrike, hee muſt bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to ſee and judge whom and wherefore hee
ſtrikes, otherwiſe he will bee able to give but an
ill accompt to God, of the managing of the ſword,
wherewith hee is inſtructed. The other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
is the laſt <hi>Canon</hi> againſt vexatious citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein they ſeeme to have ſome ſenſe of
the great grievances that poore people lye under,
by occaſion of vexatious citations, and moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Courts,</hi> and I verily beleeve
that there is not a greater oppreſſion in the whole
Kingdome upon the poorer ſort of people, then
that which proceedeth out of theſe <hi>Courts.</hi>
But now (Sir) Let us ſee what proviſion they
have made againſt it by this <hi>Canon.</hi> They ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
great grievances may fall upon people by
citations upon pretence onely, of the breach of
that Law without any preſentment, or any other
juſt ground, that no citations, grounded onely as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96360:11"/>
aforeſaid, ſhall iſſue out, except it be under the
hand and Seale of the <hi>Chancellour, Commiſſary,
Arch-Deacon,</hi> or other competent Judge, ſo that
(if there bee any ſenſe in theſe words) though
there bee no preſentment at all, nor any other
juſt ground, yet a citation may iſſue out, ſo it be
under the hand and Seale of the <hi>Chancellour, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary,</hi>
or other competent Iudge, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall not be diſcharged without paying his fees,
nor have any reliefe by this <hi>Canon.</hi> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the citation bee not under the hand and
Seale of any competent Judge, and that there
was neither preſentment nor any juſt ground for
it ſhall he then be diſmiſſed without paying any
fees? No, unleſſe firſt contrary to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there being no preſentment nor juſt ground
of accuſation againſt him, hee ſhall by his oath
purge himſelfe of pretended breaches of Law,
and then too hee ſhall onely have the fees of the
Court remitted, but ſhall have no ſatisfaction
for his troubleſome and chargeable journey, and
for the loſſe of his time, and being drawne away
from his aff<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ires. Nay leſt they ſhould ſeeme to
have beene too liberall of their favour, they adde
a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the cloſe of the <hi>Canon,</hi> that this grace
of theirs ſhall not extend to any grievous crime,
as <hi>Schiſme, Incontinency,</hi> misbehaviour in the
Church, or obſtinate inconformity. And what do
they call misbehaviour in the Church? If a man
doe not kneele at the Confeſſion, or have his hat
on, when the Leſſons are reading. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
what doe they call obſtinate inconformity?
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96360:12"/>
If a man will not thinke what they would have
him thinke, if a man will not ſay what they would
have him ſay, if a man will not ſweare what
they would have him ſweare, if a man will not
read what they would have him read, if a man
will not preach what they would have him preach,
if a man will not pray what they would have him
pray, In ſhort, if a man will not doe what ever they
would have him doe, then he is an inconformiſt,
and after that they have duely admoniſhed him,
<hi>primò, ſecundò, tertiò,</hi> all in one breath, then hee is
contumacious, then he is an obſtinate Jnconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</p>
            <p>Now (Sir) my humble motion is, that in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all the premiſſes, and what beſides
hath beene well laid open by others; wee ſhould
proceed to damme theſe Canons, not onely as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Lawes of the <hi>Land,</hi> but alſo as
containing ſundry matters, deſtructive of
the rights of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and of the
fundamentall and other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<hi>Lawes</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi>
and otherwiſe of very
