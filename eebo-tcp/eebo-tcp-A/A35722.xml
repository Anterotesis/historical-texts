            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THe following Book was at firſt drawn up in a rude manner, only to pleaſe my ſelf, and divert the vacant hours of a Solitary Country Life. But it is now publiſhed, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hopes of its doing ſome good in the World, among ſuch, whoſe Genius and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lead them to Mechanical Studies, or thoſe whoſe buſineſs and livelihood it is.</p>
            <p>Many there are, whoſe fault, or calamity it is, to have time lying upon their hands; and for want of innocent, do betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hurtful pleaſures. This is the too common misfortune of Perſons of Quality. Among ſome of the courſer ſort of theſe, if this Book ſhall find ſome acceptance, it may be a means to compoſe their looſe Spirits; and by an innocent guile, initiate them in other Studies, of greater uſe to themſelves, their family, and country. However it may hinder their commiſſion of many ſins, which are the effects of idleneſs.</p>
            <p>If there be any one perſon, in whom theſe good effects are produced, I ſhall think my idle hours well beſtowed, and bleſs God for it. However upon the account of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of my end in publiſhing this Book, and that it was written only as the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>leſs (I
<pb facs="tcp:40878:3"/>
may add alſo the vertuous) ſport of leiſure hours; I think my ſelf excuſable to God and the World, for the expence of ſo much time, in a ſubject different from my Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>But beſides, I think my ſelf under ſome little obligations of Juſtice and Charity, to publiſh the enſuing papers for the ſake of thoſe, whoſe buſineſs the Mechanick part is. I take it to be a Charity to the Trade; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are many (altho excellent in the working part) who are utterly unskilled in the artificial part of it. And then, it is a debt I pay: becauſe I owe ſomewhat of health, as well as diverſion to the Study, and practice of theſe ſort of Mechanicks. And the beſt requital I can make for my treſpaſs, is to publiſh what I have had better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities perhaps of Learning, than many Workmen have.</p>
            <p>And further yet, there is another rea&amp;;son, which much prevailed with me to publiſh this Book, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe no body, that I know of, hath prevented me, by treating ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intelligibly of this ſubject, as to be underſtood by a vulgar Workman. I have often wondered at it, that ſo uſeful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful a part of Mechanical Mathematicks ſhould lie in any obſcurity, in an age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch vaſt improvements have been made therein, and when many Books are daily publiſhed upon every ſubject. I ſpeak here of this Art remaining in obſcurity; not as if nothing was ever written of it, and I the

in venter of Automatical Computation.</p>
            <p>But altho I cannot aſſume the glory of being the firſt Writer upon this ſubject, yet very few have as yet done it; of which I ſhall next give ſome account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cardan, Kircher,</hi> and <hi>Scottus</hi> promiſed it; but I do not find they ever publiſhed any thing to the purpoſe of it. Our great Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> I take to be the firſt that ever wrote to any purpoſe about the Calculation of <hi>Automata:</hi> And I believe he was the firſt that brought that Art under Rules, in his little treatiſe called <hi>Automtaa.</hi> This Book was firſt ſurreptitiouſly publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh</hi> in a little Book, called <hi>Horolog. Dialogues,</hi> in the year 1675; and afterwards far more compleatly in <hi>Latin,</hi> at the Theatre in <hi>Oxon,</hi> among Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> s <hi>Opuſc. Mathem.</hi> in the year 1677. This laſt edition it was my misfortune not to meet with, until it was too late, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have been forced to quote the firſt, and worſt in my Book.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> had wrapt up in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Algebraick obſcure Characters, was afterwards put into plainer Language<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by that excellent Mathematician Sir <hi>Jon. Moor,</hi> with ſome additions of his own; which you have in his <hi>Math. Compend.</hi> and ſince him, by Mr. <hi>Leyborne,</hi> in his <hi>Pleaſure with Profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not be judged to have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Rules of Modeſty, in coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r three ſuch famous men; neither ſhould I
<pb facs="tcp:40878:4"/>
venture that cenſure, but for two reaſons. One is, I find by experience, that what they have written, is underſtood by very few Workmen. And therefore I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with all induſtry, to make the matter as plain as I could for ſuch. For which reaſon, I hope the more learned Reader will excuſe my uſing many words, when fewer would have ſerved <hi>his</hi> turn; and that I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to low things, (and to him need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) as teaching the Golden-rule, &amp;c. The other reaſon is, that what thoſe three have written, relates only, or chiefly to the Watch-part. To which I have added ſeveral other things of my own: particularly the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clock-part, &amp;c. I have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to reduce to Rules my ſelf, and to name no more, the Hiſtorical part hath not been ſo much as attempted before, that I know of.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons will, I hope, excuſe me with the moſt cenſorious Reader, not only for preſuming to write after ſo accurate a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>piece, as Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> s is, but alſo the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the ſubject, will I hope procure for me a candid interpretation of the faults and blunders, that I may have unwittingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>To the preceeding account of what others have written (which ſhews what help I have had from printed Books) I ſhall ſubjoyn my acknowledgments, and thanks to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of my friends, who have given me thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

names I ſhall not make more publick than mine own, being unwilling to be diſcovered my ſelf. In the Chap. of the Terms of Art, I owe much to the aſſiſtance of <hi>L. Br....</hi> a judicious Workman in <hi>White-chappel,</hi> who drew me up a Scheme of the Clock-maker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. In the Hiſtory of the Modern Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I have had (among ſome others) the aſſiſtance chiefly of the ingenious <hi>Dr. H....</hi> and <hi>Mr. T....<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The former being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſome, and well acquainted with others, of the Mechanical Inventions of that fertile Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and the latter actually concerned in all, or moſt of the late inventions in Clock-work, by means of his famed skill in that, and other Mechanick operations.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other contrivances of this laſt age (beſides thoſe I have mentioned) which I have paſſed over in ſilence; becauſe either they are only branches, or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the inventions I have taken notice of, (ſuch as ſeveral ways of repeating work, &amp;c.) or elſe, they only collaterally relate to Watch-work (as the inventions of Cutting-Engines, Fuſy-Engines, &amp;c.) To treat of all theſe, would ſwell my Book far beyond its intended bounds; which I have already ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. I ſhall therefore commit this task to ſome better Pen, hoping that no perſon will take it amiſs, that I have not mentioned what I have been beholding to him for the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40878:5"/>
For the reſons laſt mentioned, I have alſo left out of my Book, a Chapter of the Art of making, and uſing many ſorts of Sodders, the way of colouring Metals, &amp;c. uſeful in the practice of Clock-work. This I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the ſake of Mercurial Gentlemen, but omitted printing it, and ſome other things, out of Charity to poor Apprentices and other Workmen, whoſe purſes I am unwilling my volume ſhould too much exceed.</p>
            <p>If I have at any time invaded the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's province, it was not becauſe I pretend to teach him his Trade; but either for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen's ſakes, or when the matter led me neceſſarily to it.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to add, but that I would have this little Treatiſe looked upon only as an Eſſay, which I hope will prompt ſome abler pen to perform the task better, eſpecially in the Hiſtorical part. For ſince Watch-work oweth ſo much to our Age, and Country, tis pity that it ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: eſpecially when we cannot but lament the great defect of Hiſtory, about the beginning and improvements of this ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uſeful Art.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of the Terms of Art, or Names by which the parts of an <hi>Automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> are called.</head>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that I ſhould ſhew the meaning of thoſe Terms which Clock-makers uſe, that Gentlemen and others, unskilful in the Art, may know how to expreſs themſelves properly, in ſpeaking; and alſo underſtand what I ſhall ſay in the following Book.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a recital of every name that doth occur, but only ſuch as I ſhall have occaſion to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40878:8"/>
uſe in the following diſcourſe, and ſome few others that offer themſelves, upon a tranſient view of a piece of work.</p>
            <p>I begin with the more general Terms: as, the <hi>Frame;</hi> which is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Wheels, and the reſt of the work. The <hi>Pillars,</hi> and <hi>Plates,</hi> are what it chiefly conſiſts of.</p>
            <p>Next for the <hi>Spring,</hi> and its appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. That which the Spring lies in, is the <hi>Spring-box;</hi> that which the Spring laps about, in the middle of the Spring-box, is the <hi>Spring-Arbor;</hi> to which the Spring is hooked at one end. At the top of the Spring-Arbor, is the <hi>Endleſs-Screw,</hi> and its Wheel.</p>
            <p>That which the Spring draweth, and about which the Chain or String is wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and which is commonly taper, is the <hi>Fuſy.</hi> In larger work, going with weights, where it is cylindrical, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Barrel.</hi> The ſmall Teeth at the bottom of the Fuſy, or Barrel, that ſtop it in winding up, is the <hi>Ratchet.</hi> That which ſtops it when wound up, and is for that end driven up by the String, is the <hi>Garde-caut,</hi> or <hi>Guard-Cock,</hi> as others; and <hi>Garde-du-Cord,</hi> and <hi>Gard-du-Gut,</hi> as others call it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40878:8"/>
The parts of a <hi>Wheel</hi> are, the <hi>Hoop,</hi> or <hi>Rim:</hi> the <hi>Teeth:</hi> the <hi>Croſs:</hi> and the <hi>Collet,</hi> or piece of Braſs, ſoddered on the Arbor, or Spindle, on which the Wheel is rivetted.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Pinion</hi> is that little Wheel, which plays in the teeth of the Wheel. Its teeth (which are commonly 4, 5, 6, 8, &amp;c.) are called <hi>Leves,</hi> not Teeth.</p>
            <p>The ends of the Spindle, are called <hi>Pevetts:</hi> the holes in which they run, <hi>Pevet-holes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The guttered Wheel, with Iron ſpikes at the bottom, in which the line of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Houſe-Clocks doth run, is called the <hi>Pully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not ſpeak of the <hi>Dial-plate,</hi> the <hi>Hand, Screws, Wedges, Stops,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus much for general Names, which are common to all parts of a Movement.</p>
            <p>The parts of a <hi>Movement,</hi> which I ſhall conſider, are the <hi>Watch,</hi> and <hi>Clock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Watch-part</hi> of a Movement is that which ſerveth to the meaſuring the hours. In which the firſt thing I ſhall conſider is the <hi>Ballance:</hi> whoſe parts are, the <hi>Rim,</hi> which is the circular part of it: the <hi>Verge,</hi> is its Spindle: to which belong the two
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40878:9"/>
               <hi>Pallets,</hi> or <hi>Nuts,</hi> which play in the fangs of the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Wheel: in Pocket-Watches, that ſtrong Stud in which the lower Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet of the Verge plays, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which one Pevet of the Crown-Wheel runs, is called the <hi>Pottans:</hi> the wrought piece which covers the Ballance, and in which the upper Pevet of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance plays, is the <hi>Cock.</hi> The ſmall Spring in the new Pocket-Watches is the <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The parts of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> are, the <hi>Verge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pallets</hi> and <hi>Cocks,</hi> as before. The <hi>Ball</hi> in long Pendulums, the <hi>Bob</hi> in ſhort ones, is the Weight at the bottom. The <hi>Rod,</hi> or <hi>Wire</hi> is plain. The terms pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>Royal Swing,</hi> are the <hi>Pads,</hi> which are the Pallets in others, and are fixed on the <hi>Spindle.</hi> The <hi>Fork</hi> is alſo fixed on the Spindle, and about 6 inches below, catcheth hold on the Rod, at a flat piece of Braſs, called the <hi>Flatt,</hi> in which the lower end of the <hi>Spring</hi> is faſtened.</p>
            <p>The names of the Wheels next follow. The <hi>Crown-Wheel</hi> in Small pieces, and <hi>Swing-Wheel</hi> in Royal Pendulums, is that Wheel which drives the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ballance, or Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40878:9"/>
The <hi>Contrate-Wheel,</hi> is that Wheel in Pocket-Watches, which is next to the Crown-Wheel, whoſe Teeth and Hoop lye contrary to thoſe of other Wheels.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Great-Wheel,</hi> or <hi>Firſt-Wheel,</hi> is that which the Fuſy, &amp;c. immediately driveth. Next it, are the <hi>Second-Wheel, Third-Wheel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Next followeth the Work between the Frame and Dial-Plate. And firſt, is the <hi>Pinion</hi> of <hi>Report;</hi> which is that Pinion which is commonly fixed on the Arbor of the Great-Wheel, and in old Watches uſed to have commonly but four Leaves; which driveth the <hi>Dial-Wheel,</hi> and this carrieth about the <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Part which I ſhall ſpeak of, is the <hi>Clock,</hi> which is that part which ſerveth to ſtrike the Hours: In which I ſhall</p>

Theſe numbers are equal, <hi>viz.</hi> 36 times 8 is equal to 32 times 9; both producing 288. If you divide 36 by 6, and 8 by 2, and multiply as before is ſaid, you will have for 36 times 8, 24 times 12, equal to 288 alſo.</p>
               <p>If this Rule ſeem to the unskilful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hard to be underſtood, let him not be diſcouraged, becauſe he may do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, altho it may be of good uſe to him that would be a more compleat Artiſt.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Becauſe in the following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, I ſhall have frequent occaſion to uſe the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> or <hi>Rule of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it will be neceſſary to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Reader, how to work this noble Rule.</p>
               <p>If you find 3 or 4 numbers thus ſet, with four ſpots after the ſecond of them, 'tis the Rule of Proportion; as in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, 2. 4:: 3. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> As 2 is to 4:: So is 3 to 6.</p>
               <p>The way to work this Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> by the 3 firſt number to find a fourth, is,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40878:16"/>
To multiply the ſecond number and the third together, and divide their product by the firſt. Thus 4 times 3 is 12, which 12 divided by 2, gives 6; which is the number ſought for, and ſtands in the fourth place.</p>
               <p>You will find the great uſe of this Rule hereafter; only take care to bear it in mind all along.</p>
               <p>§ 5. To proceed. If in ſeeking for your Pinion of Report, or by any other means, you happen to have a Wheel and Pinion fall out with croſs numbers, too big to be cut in Wheels, and yet not to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the former Rules, you may find out two numbers of the ſame, or a near pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, by this following Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> As either of the two numbers given, is to <note place="margin">Id. ib.</note>the other:: So is 360 to a fourth: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that fourth number, as alſo 360 by 4. 5. 6. 8. 9. 10. 12. 15. (each of which numbers doth exactly meaſure 360) o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by any one of thoſe numbers that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a quotient neareſt to an integer (or whole number.) Thus if you had theſe two numbers, 147 the Wheel, and 170 the Pinion, which are too great to be cut in ſmall Wheels, and yet can't be reduced

                  </gap>s, becauſe they have no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meaſure, but unity: ſay therefore according to the laſt paragraph, As 170 is to 147; or as 147 is to 170:: So is 360 to a fourth number ſought. In numbers thus, 170 147:: 360. 311. or 147. 170:: 360. 416. Divide the fourth number and 360 by one of the foregoing numbers; as 311 and 360 by 6, it gives 52 and 60. In numbers 'tis thus,

                  </gap> what hath been ſaid into practice, by ſhewing how to proceed, in Calculating a piece of Watch-work.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing you are to do, is to pitch upon your Train, or beats of the Ballance in an hour: as, whither a ſwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Having thus pitched upon your Train, you muſt next reſolve upon the number of turns you intend your Fuſy ſhall have; and alſo upon the number of Hours, you would have your Piece to go: As ſuppoſe 12 turns; and to go 30 hours, or 192 hours (which is 8 days) or &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being all ſoon determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; you next proceed to find out the beats of the Ballance, or Pendulum, in one turn of the Fuſy, by the laſt § 6. part 3. <hi>viz.</hi> As the turns of the Fuſy, To the hours of the Watch's going:: So is the Train, To the number of beats in one turn of the Fuſy. In numbers thus, 12. 16:: 20000. 26666. Which laſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40878:18"/>
number are the beats in one turn of the Fuſy, or Great-Wheel; and (by Sect. I. § 5. of this Chap.) are equal to the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients of all the Wheels unto the ballance, multiplied together. This number there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be broken into a convenient parcel of Quotients: which you are to do after this manner. Firſt, half your num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beats, <hi>viz.</hi> 26666, for the reaſons in Sect. I. § 6. of this Chap. the half whereof is 13333. Next you are to pitch upon the number of your Crown-wheel, as ſuppoſe 17. Divide 13333 by 17, the Quotient will be 784 (or to ſpeak in the language of one that underſtands not Arithmetick, divide 13333 into 17 parts, and 784 will be one of them.) This 784 is the number left for the Quotients (or turns) of the reſt of the Wheels and Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which being too big for one or two Quotients, may be beſt broken into three. Chuſe therefore 3 numbers, which when multiplied all together continually will come neareſt 784. As ſuppoſe you take 10, 9, and 9. Now 10 times 9 is 90; and 9 times 90 is 810, which is ſomewhat too much. You may therefore try again other numbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſuppoſe 11, 9, and 8.

The proceſs whereof is thus: Firſt, having reſolved upon your beats in an hour, you are next to find how many beats there will be in a minute, by dividing your deſigned Train into 60 parts. And accordingly you are to find out ſuch proper numbers for your Crown-wheel, and quotients, as that the Minute-wheel ſhall go round once in an hour, and the Second-wheel once in a minute.</p>
               <p>An Example will make all plain. Let us chuſe a Pendulum of 6 inches to go 8 days, with 16 turns of the Fuſy. By <note place="margin">Horol.

               <p>Theſe two laſt Rules are of no great uſe (as the firſt is) but may ſerve to correct your work, if need be, when in breaking your Strokes into Quotients (of which preſently) you cannot come near the true number, but a good many ſtrokes are left remaining.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 6. The foregoing Rules are of greateſt uſe, in Clocks of a larger conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; altho, where they can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they will indifferently ſerve all. But this Rule (which will ſerve larger Clocks too) I add chiefly for the uſe of leſſer Pieces, whoſe continuance is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by hours.</p>
               <p>The Rule is to find the Strokes in the Clock's continuance, <hi>viz.</hi> As 12, is to 78:: So are the hours of the Clocks continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40878:26"/>
To the number of Strokes in that time.</p>
               <p>This Rule (I ſaid) may be made uſe of for the largeſt Clock; but then you muſt be at the trouble of reducing the Days into Hours Whereas the ſhorteſt way is to Multiply the ſtrokes in one turn of the Great-wheel, by the number of Turns. Thus in an 8 day piece the Strokes in one turn are 78. Theſe multiplied by 16, the turns, produce 1248; which are the Strokes in the Clock's continuance. If you work by the foregoing Ruled the hours of 8 days are 192. Then ſay, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 78:: 192. 1248.</p>
               <p>§ 3. In this Paragraph, I ſhall ſhew the uſe of the preceding Rules, and by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples make all plain that might ſeem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in them.</p>
               <p>I begin with ſmall Pieces: of which but briefly. And firſt, having pitched upon the number of turns, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, you muſt find, by the laſt Rule, how many Strokes are in its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Then divide theſe Strokes by the number of turns, and you have the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Striking-pins. Or divide by the number of Pins, and you have the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Turns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40878:26"/>
Thus a Clock of 30 hours, with 15 turns of the Great-wheel, hath 195 ſtrokes. For by the laſt Rule, 12. 78:: 30. 195. Divide 195 by 15, it gives 13 for the Striking-pins. Or  if you chuſe 13 for your number of Pins, and divide 195 by it, it gives 15, for the number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But ſuppoſe you would calculate the numbers of a Clock of much longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, which will neceſſitate you to make your Pin-wheel further diſtant from the Great-wheel, you are to proceed thus: Having re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>SECT. 4. Of Quarters and Chimes.</head>
               <p>THe Reader will expect that I ſhould ſay ſomewhat concerning Quarters and Chimes: but becauſe there is little, but what is purely mechanical in it, I ſhall ſay the leſs, and leave the Reader to his own invention.</p>
               <p n="1"> § 1. The <hi>Quarters</hi> are generally a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct part from the Clock-part, which ſtriketh the Hour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Striking-wheel</hi> may be the Firſt, Second, or &amp;c. Wheel, according to your Clock's continuance. Unto which Wheel you may fix the Pinion of Report.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Locking-wheel</hi> muſt be divided (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Locking-wheels) into 4, 8, or more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal parts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o as to ſtrike the Quarter, and lock at the firſt Notch; the half-hour, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40878:30"/>
lock at the ſecond Notch, &amp;c. And in doing this, you may make it to chime the Quarters, or ſtrike them upon two Bells, or more.</p>
               <p>'Tis uſual for the Pin-wheel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Locking-wheel, to unlock the Hour-part in theſe Clocks; which is eaſily done by ſome jogg or Latch, at the end of the laſt Quarter, to lift up the Detents of the Hour-part.</p>
               <p>If you would have your Clock ſtrike the Hour, at the Half-hour, as well as whole Hour, you muſt make the Locking-wheel of the Hour-part double: <hi>i. e.</hi> it muſt have two Notches of a ſort, to ſtrike 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. twice apiece.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. As for <hi>Chimes,</hi> I need ſay nothing of the Lifting-pieces and Detents, to lock and unlock; nor of the Wheels to bridle the motion of the Barrel. Only you are to obſerve, that the Barrel muſt be as long in turning round, as you are in Singing the Tune it is to play. As for the <hi>Chime-Barrel,</hi> it may be made up of certain Barrs, that run athwart it, with a convenient number of holes punched in them, to put in the Pins, that are to draw each Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. By this means, you may change
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40878:30"/>
the Tune, without changing the Barrel. This is the way of the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> Clock in <hi>London,</hi> and of others. In this caſe, the Pins or Nuts, which draw the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, muſt hang down from the Barr, ſome more, ſome leſs, and ſome ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the Barr: the reaſon whereof is, to play the Time of the Tune rightly. For the diſtance of each of theſe Barrs, may be a Semi-brief, or &amp;c. of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But the moſt uſual way is, to have the Pins that draw the Hammers, fixed on the Barrel. For the placing of which Pins, you may make uſe of the Muſical Notes, or proceed by the way of Changes on Bells, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far the better way, I ſhall ſpeak of that chiefly, eſpecially becauſe the latter will fall in to be explained with it.</p>
               <p>And firſt, you are to obſerve what is the Compaſs of your Tune, or how many Notes or Bells there are from the higheſt to the loweſt: and accordingly you muſt divide your Barrel from end to end. Thus in the examples following, each of thoſe Tunes are 8 notes in compaſs; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Barrel is divided into 8
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40878:31"/>
parts. Theſe Diviſions are ſtruck round the Barrel, oppoſite to which are the Hammer-tails.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak here, as if there was only one Hammer to each Bell, that the Reader may more clearly apprehend what I am explaining. But when two Notes of the ſame ſound come together in a Tune, there muſt be two Hammers to that Bell, to ſtrike it. So that if in all the Tunes you intend to Chime, of 8 notes compaſs, there ſhould happen to be ſuch double Notes on every Bell, inſtead of 8, you muſt have 16 Hammers: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you muſt divide your Barrel, and ſtrike 16 ſtrokes round it oppoſite to each Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-tail. Thus much for dividing your Barrel from end to end.</p>
               <p>In the next place, you are to divide i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (round about) into as many diviſions, as there are Muſical Barrs, Semibriefs, Minums, &amp;c. in your Tune. Thus the 100th Pſalm-tune hath 20 Semibriefs; the Song-tune following, hath 24 Barrs of triple time: and accordingly their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels are divided. Each diviſion therefore of the 100th Pſalm Barrel is a Semibrief, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd of the Song-tune 'tis three crotchets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40878:31"/>
And therefore the intermediate Spaces ſerve for the ſhorter notes: as, one third of a diviſion, is a Crotchet, in the Song-tune. One half a diviſion, is a Minum; and one quarter a Crotchet, in the Pſalm-tune. Thus the firſt note in the 100th Pſalm, is a Semibrief, and accordingly on the Barrel, 'tis a whole diviſion from 5 to 5. The ſecond is a Minum, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 6 is but half a diviſion from 5; and ſo of the reſt. And ſo alſo for the Song-tune, which is ſhorter time: The two firſt notes being Quavers, are diſtant from one another, and from the third pin, but half a third part of one of the diviſions. But the two next pins (of the bell 3, 3) being Crotchets, are diſtant ſo many third parts of a diviſion. And the next pin (of the bell 1) being a Minum, is diſtant from the following pin (4) two thirds of a diviſion.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, you may conceive the ſurface of a Chime-barrel, to be repreſented in the Tables following, as ſtretched out at length: or (to ſpeak plainer) that if you wrap either of theſe Tables round a Barrel, the Dotts in the Table, will ſhew the places of the

               <head>SECT. 5. To Calculate any of the Celeſtial Motions.</head>
               <p>The Motions I here chiefly intend, are the Day of the Month, the Moons age, the Day of the Year, the Tides, and (if you pleaſe) the ſlow motion of the Suns <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> of the Fixed Stars, the motion of the Planets, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. For the effecting theſe Motions, you may make them to depend upon the Work already in the Movement; or elſe meaſure them by the beats of a Ballance, or Pendulum.</p>
               <p>If the latter way, you muſt however contrive a Piece (as before in Watch-work) to go a certain time, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of turns.</p>
               <p>But then to Specificate, or determine the Motion intended, you muſt proceed one of theſe two ways: either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Find how many beats are in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution. Divide theſe beats by the beats in one turn of the Wheel, or Pinion, which you intend ſhall drive the intended Revolution; and the Quotient ſhall be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40878:35"/>
the number to perform the ſame. Which, if too big for one, may be broken into more Quotients. Thus, if you would repreſent the Synodical Revolution of the Moon, which is 29 days, 12 ¾ hours) with a Pendulum that ſwings Seconds, the Movement to go 8 days, with 16 turns of the Fuſy, and the Great-wheel to drive the Revolution. Divide 2551500 (the Beats in 29 days 12  ¾ hours) by 43200 (the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel) and you will have 59 in the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: which being too big for one, may be put into two Quotients. Or</p>
               <p n="2">2. You may proceed as is directed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Ch. 2. Sect. 2. § 7.</note>in the Section of Calculating Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, <hi>viz.</hi> Chuſe your Train, turns of the Fuſy, Continuance, &amp;c. And then inſtead of finding a Quotient for the Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Report, find a number (which is all one as a Pin. of Report) to Specificate your Revolution, by this following Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule.</hi> As the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel. To the Train:: So are the Hours of the Revolution, To the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the Revolution.</p>
               <p>Thus to perform the Revolution of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> (which is 29 years, 183 days) with a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40878:35"/>
16 hour Watch, of 26928 Beats in one turn of the Fuſy, and 20196, the Train: the quotient of the Revolution, will be 193824. For, As 26928, To 20196:: So 258432 (the Hours in 29 y. and 183 d.) To 193824. Note here, That the Great-wheel Pinion is to drive the Revolution work.</p>
               <p>But if you would have the Revolution to be driven by the Dial-wheel, and the Work already in the Movement (which in great Revolutions, is for the moſt part, as nice as the laſt way, and in which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to treat of the particular Motions) in this caſe, I ſay, you muſt firſt know the Days of the Revolution. And becauſe the Dial-wheel goeth round twice in a day, therefore double the number of the days in the Revolution, and you have the number of turns of the Dial-wheel in that time. This number of turns is what you are to break into a convenient number of quotients, for the Wheels and Pinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſhall be ſhewed in the following exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

The Quotients and Crown-wheel and 2 Pallets multiplied together continually, produce 2736, which are the Strokes of the Ballance, in one turn of the Great-wheel, by Sect. l. § 4, 5. of the laſt Chapter. And by the Quotient of the Dial-wheel (which is 12) it appears, that the Great-wheel goeth round once in an hour. Or you may find the Beats in an hour, by § 5. laſt cited.

            <head>CHAP. IV. To ſize the Wheels and Pinions, or proportion them to each other, both Arithmetically and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. FOr the exact and eaſie moving of the Wheels and Pinions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is neceſſary that they ſhould fit each other, by having their teeth and leaves of the ſame wideneſs, or near of the ſame wideneſs. For many do make
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40878:42"/>
the Leaves of the Pinion narrower than the Teeth of its Wheel, by reaſon of their running deep in each other; which is as if the Diameters of the Wheel and Pinion were leſs. But this I leave to thoſe, whoſe practice and obſervations are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than mine in theſe matters.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. To make the Teeth of a Wheel and Pinion alike, the way <hi>Arithmetically</hi> is thus, Firſt you muſt find the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your Wheel and Pinion; which you may beſt do by the Rule of Three (ſo often made uſe of before) the Rule is thus, as 7 is to 22:: ſo is the Diameter to the Circumference. Or more exactly thus, as 1, is to 3, 1416:: So Diam. to Circum.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you have a Wheel of 2 inches diameter, and 60 Teeth, and would fit to it a Pinion of 6 Leaves. Firſt 7 22:: 2. 6, 3. The circumference of the Wheel, is then 6 inches, and 3 tenths of an inch. Then ſay, as the Teeth of the Wheel, to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference <note place="margin">Sir <hi>J. Moor</hi> Mat. Com. R. 5.</note>of it:: So are the Leaves of the Pinion, to the circumference thereof. In numbers thus 60<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 3:: 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, 63. The Pinion then is 63 hundredth parts of an inch round.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:40878:43"/>
Now to find the Diameter, 'tis but the reverſe of the former Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> As 22. to 7:: So the Circumference to the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In numbers thus, for the foregoing Pinion, 22. 7::, 63<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, The Diameter then of the Pinion muſt be two tenths of an inch, to fit the aforeſaid Wheel of 2 inches diameter.</p>
            <p n="3">ſect 3. But becauſe this way may be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to perſons unacquainted with Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Arithmetick, which is very neceſſary here; therefore I ſhall ſet down a way to do it <hi>mechanically.</hi> Having drawn a Circle, divide it into as many parts, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend leaves in the Pinion you would ſize. From two of theſe points in the Circle, draw two lines to the Center: to which apply two of the Teeth of your Wheel, guiding them up and down until they touch at the ſame width on theſe Radii. Mark where this agreement is, and a ſmall circle drawn there, will repreſent the circumference of the Pinion ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

And the ſhorter, and leſſer the Pendulum is, ſo much the more ſubject ſuch Watches are to theſe annoyances.</p>
            <p>There are two ways to obviate theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences in ſome meaſure. One way is, to make the Pendulum long, the Bob heavy, and to vibrate but a little way from its ſettlement.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40878:44"/>
               <note place="margin">Id. ib. Rule 3.</note> he believes this latter to be the better way. And Mr <hi>Hugens</hi> calls it <hi>admirable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any deſire to know how to make thoſe Cycloidal Cheeks, fit to all Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, I refer him to the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichem</hi>'s <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Horol. Oſcil.</hi> p. 10, 11, 12.</note>Book, becauſe I can't ſhew how to do it, without the trouble of Figures; and this way is much ceaſed, ſince the Crown-wheel method (to which it is chiefly proper) is ſwallowed up by the Royal Pendulums.</p>
            <p n="2">ſect 2. Another thing to be remark'd in Pendulums is, That the longer the Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lower it is. For if two iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrone Pendulums do move, one the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of a circle, the other not above 3 or 4 degrees, this latter ſhall move ſome-what quicker than the former. Which is the true reaſon, why ſmall Crown-wheel Pendulums go faſter in cold weather, or when ſoul, than at other times. Yea, in the beſt Royal Pendulum, if you put a divided plate behind the Ball, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its ſwings, you may perceive the Vibrations to be ſometimes ſhorter; and that then the Watch doth gain too much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Somewhat alſo may perhaps be attributed to the rarity or denſity of the air; which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40878:44"/>
I have not yet had an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, by comparing with a good Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, the various vibrations of a good Royal Pendulum. But Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> ſays, that a Pendulum moveth as long, and as <note place="margin">Machina Pneumat. Exp. <hi>26.</hi>
               </note>faſt in a thick medium, as a thin one; contrary to the opinion of ſome Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who think the contrary. His opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded upon the experiment of a Pendulum vibrating in his air-pump, the air ſucked out, and in the open air; wherein was no alteration.</p>
            <p n="3">ſect 3. For the calculation of all Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, 'tis neceſſary to fix upon ſome one, to be as a Standard to the reſt. I pitch upon a Pend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to vibrate Seconds each ſtroke.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hugens</hi> lays down the length of a Pend. to ſwing Seconds to be 3 feet, 3 inches, and 2 tenths of an inch (according to Sir <hi>J. Moor</hi>'s reduction of it to <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>)</p>

            <p>If it be deſired to fit a Ball of a triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, quadrangular, or any other form to this Pend, the center of Oſcillation in any of theſe bodies, may be found in the laſt cited book of Mr <hi>Zulichem.</hi>

If it be asked, What is the meaning of the Center of Oſcillation? The moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible anſwer (altho not perfectly true) is, That it is that point of the Ball, at which if you imagine it divided into two parts, by a circle, whoſe center is in the point of Suſpenſion, the lower part of the Ball ſhall be of the ſame weight (or near ſo) with the upper.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. Having thus fixed a Standard, I ſhall next ſhew how from thence to find the Vibrations, or Lengths of all other Pendulums. Which is done by this Rule, <note place="margin">Hugen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moor, <hi>ib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore to find the length of a Pend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As the Square of the Vibrations given: To the Square of 60 (the Standard):: So is the length of the Standard <hi>(viz.</hi> 39, 2) To the length of the Pend. ſought.</p>
            <p>If by the length, you would find the Vibrations, 'tis the reverſe of the laſt Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> As the length propoſed: To the Standard (39, 2):: So is the Square of 60 (the vibrations of the Standard): To the Vibrations ſought.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40878:46"/>
Suppoſe for example, you would know what length a Pend. is, that vibrates 153 ſtrokes in a minute. The Square of 153 <hi>(i. e.</hi> 153 times 153) is 23409. Say, 23409. 3600:: 39, 2. 6. A Pend. then that vibrates 153 in a minute, is about 6 inches long.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if you would know how many ſtrokes a Pend. of 6 inches hath in a minute; Say, 6. 39, 2:: 3600. 23520. The ſquare root whereof is 153, and ſomewhat more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Becauſe 141120 is always the Product of the two middle terms multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied together, therefore you need only to divide this number by the Square of the Vibrations, it gives the length ſought: by the length, it gives the ſquare of the Vibrations.</p>
            <p>If you operate by the Logarithms, you will much contract your labour. For if you ſeek the length, 'tis but Subſtracting the Logarithm of the Square of the Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, out of the Logarithm of 141120, which is 5. 149588, and the Remainder is the Logarithm of the length ſought.</p>
            <p>If you ſeek the Vibrations, it is but Subſtracting out of the aforeſaid Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithm

5. 149588, the Logarithm of the length given, and half the Reſidue is the Logarithm of the Vibrations required. The following examples will illuſtrate each particular.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40878:48"/>
of the Nut upon the Screw.</p>
            <p>Conſidering this irremediable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, I am of opinion, that Mr <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi>'s <note place="margin">Ibid. de <hi>Centro Oſcil.</hi> Prop. 23.</note>way would do very well, added to this. His way is, To have a ſmall Weight, or Bob, to ſlide up and down the Pend. rod, above the Ball (which is immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.) But I would rather adviſe, that the Ball be made to ſcrew up and down, to bring the Pend. pretty neer its gauge: and that this little Bob ſhould ſerve only for more nice corrections; as the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Second, or &amp;c. Which it will do, better than the Great Ball. For a whole turn of this little Bob, will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the motion of the Pend. near ſo much as a ſmall alteration of the Great Ball.</p>
            <p>The Directions Mr <hi>Hugens</hi> gives, about this little Corrector, is, That it ſhould be equal to the weight of the Wire, or Rod of the Pend., or about a 50th part of the weight of the Great Ball, which he appoints to be three pounds.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this Bob may do its office, if it be made to ſcrew only up and down the lower part of the Rod, below the Ball. If not, you muſt make it ſlide above the Ball, or be ſcrewed up and down there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40878:48"/>
Seeing this little Bob is not the only Corrector (as in Mr <hi>Zulichem</hi>'s way) therefore it is not neceſſary to inſert here, that ingenious perſon's Table, ſhewing what alterations of Time will be made by ſliding the Bob up and down the rod. Only thus much may be obſerved in that Table of his, <hi>viz.</hi> That a ſmall alteration of the Corrector towards the lower end of the Pend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, doth make as great an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Time, as a greater raiſing or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, doth make higher. Thus the little Bob raiſed 7 diviſions of the Rod, from the Center of Oſcillation, will alter the Watch 15 ſeconds; raiſed 15, 2 'twill alter it 30″. But whereas, if it be raiſed to 154<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3 parts of the Rod, it will make the Watch go faſter 3 minutes, 15 ſeconds, the Watch ſhall be but 3′. 30″ faſter, if the Bob be raiſed to 192<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. So that here you have but 15″ variation, by raiſing the Bob above 38 parts; whereas lower, you had the ſame variation, when raiſed not above 7 or 8 parts.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, it appears, that about half a turn of this little juſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bob, will at no time alter the Watch, above a ſecond in 24 hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40878:49"/>
above a whole turn, will not alter it ſo much, higher on the Rod; ſuppoſing that the Bob at every turn aſcended or deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a whole degree of the Rod; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will not do in 20 turns: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, it will require many turns, to alter the Watch but one ſecond.</p>

            <p>§ 1. THe firſt that invented the way of applying Pendulums to Watch-work, was Mr <hi>Chriſtian Hugens</hi> of <hi>Zulichem;</hi> as he affirmeth of himſelf, with very cogent reaſons.</p>
            <p>This excellent invention, he ſays, he put firſt in practice in the year 1657<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <note place="margin">

Others have claimed the honour of this Invention; among which, the great <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo</hi> hath the moſt to be ſaid on his ſide. Dr. <hi>John Joachim Becher</hi> (who printed a Book when he was in <hi>England,</hi> entituled; <hi>De Nova Temporis dimetiendi ratione Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> &amp;c. which he dedicated to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Royal Society, <hi>Anno</hi> 1680.) he, I ſay, tells <note place="margin">p. 8.</note>us, <q>That the <hi>Count Magalotti</hi> (the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>'s Reſident at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Court) told him the whole Hiſtory of theſe Pendulum Clocks, and denied Mr <hi>Zulichem</hi> to be the Author of them.</q> Alſo, <q>That one <hi>Treffler</hi> (Clock-maker to the Father of the then G.

            </p>
            <p>As to theſe matters thus related by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay by <hi>Becher,</hi> and ſo expreſsly affirmed by the Academy, I have little to reply, but that Mr <hi>Hugens</hi> does expreſsly ſay, He was the Inventer, and that if <hi>Galilaeo</hi> ever <note place="margin">

            <p n="2">§ 2. After Mr <hi>Hugens</hi> had thus invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Pendulum Watches, and cauſed ſeveral to be made in <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr <hi>Froman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Clock-maker, came over into <hi>England,</hi> and made the firſt that ever were made here: which was about the year 1662.

            <p n="3">§ 3. For ſeveral years this way of Mr <hi>Zulichem</hi> was the only method, <hi>viz.</hi> Crown-wheel Pendulums, to play between two cycloidal cheeks, &amp;c. But afterwards Mr <hi>W. Clement,</hi> a <hi>London</hi> Clock-maker, <note place="margin">

Which is now the univerſal method of the Royal Pendulums. But Dr <hi>Hook</hi> denies Mr <hi>Clement</hi> to have invented this; and ſays that it was his Invention, and that he cauſed a piece of this nature to be made, which he ſhewed before the <hi>R.

            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:40878:58"/>
But as to the former of theſe, which had no Spiral Spring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Verges of its Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, had each but one Pallet apiece, about the middle of the Verge. The Crown-wheel lay (contrary to others) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, in the middle of the Watch, in the place, and after the manner of the Contrate-wheel. The teeth of this Crown-wheel, were cut after the manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate-wheel teeth, <hi>viz.</hi> lying upwards, but very wide apart, ſo as that the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets (which were about one tenth of an inch long, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrow) might play in and out between each tooth. The Verges of the two Ballances, were ſet one on one ſide, the other on the other ſide of the Crown-wheel, ſo that the Pallets might play freely in its teeth. And when the Crown-wheel in moving round, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered its ſelf of one Pallet, the other Pallet on the oppoſite ſide, was drawn on to make its Beat, by means of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the other Ballance had given its Ballance, (the two Ballances moving one another, as hath been ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Paragraph.) And ſo the ſame back again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:40878:58"/>
It may be here noted, that for the more clear underſtanding of the laſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, I have deſcribed the two Ballances, as having Teeth on the edges of their Rims, running in one another. But the contrivance was really thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was a ſmall Wheel under each Ballance, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the width of the Crown-wheel. But the Ballances were much larger. And ſo the Teeth of theſe two little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Wheels or Ballances, running in one another, moved the larger Ballances above them, all one, as if theſe two great Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances had been toothed and played in each other.</p>
            <p>§ 4. The other way, with two Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances alſo, moving each other (as was ſaid in the beginning of the laſt §) had a Spiral Spring to each Ballance, for its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulator. In this Invention, only one Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance had the Pallets, as the common Ballances have: and the Crown-wheel operated upon it, according to the uſual way. But then when this Ballance vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth, it giveth the ſame motion back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, to the other ballance; as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:40878:59"/>
The firſt of theſe two ways, was never proſecuted ſo far, as perhaps it deſerved. And the excellency of the latter is, that no jirk, or the moſt confuſed ſhake, can in the leaſt alter its Vibrations. Which it will do in the beſt Pendulum Watch with one ballance now commonly uſed. For if you lay one of theſe Watches upon a Table, and by the Pendant jirk it back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, you will put it into the greateſt hurry; whereas the laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Watch, with two ballances, will be nothing affected with it. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this inconvenience, yet the Watch with one ballance and one Spring (which was alſo Dr. <hi>Hooks</hi> Invention) prevailed, and grew common, being now the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Mode: but of the other very few were ever made. The reaſon hereof, I judge, was the great trouble and vaſt nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs required in it, and perhaps a little foulneſs in the ballance-teeth may retard the motion of the ballances. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is eaſier made, and performeth well enough, and in a pocket is ſcarce ſubject to the aforeſaid diſorder, which is cauſed rather by a turn, than a ſhake.</p>

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:40878:59"/>
§ 5. The time of theſe Inventions was about the year 1658, as appears (among other evidence) from this inſcription, upon one of the aforeſaid double Ballance-Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, preſented to K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, <hi>viz. Robert Hook inven.</hi> 1658. <hi>T. Tompion fecit</hi> 1675.</p>
            <p>This Watch was wonderfully approved of by the King; and ſo the Invention grew into reputation, and was much talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of at home, and abroad. Particularly its ſame flew into <hi>France,</hi> from whence the Dauphine ſent for two; which that eminent Artiſt Mr. <hi>Tompion</hi> made for him.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Dr. <hi>Hook</hi> had long before this, cauſed ſeveral pieces of this nature, to be made, altho they did not take till after 1675. However he had before ſo far proceeded herein, as to have a Patent (drawn, tho not ſealed) for theſe, and ſome other Contrivances, about Watches, in the year 1660. But the reaſon why that Patent did no further proceed, was ſome diſagreement about ſome Articles in it, with ſome Noble Perſons who were concerned for the procuring it. The ſame ingenious Dr. had alſo a Grant for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for this laſt way of Spring Watches
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40878:60"/>
in the year 1675: but he omitted the taking it out, as thinking it not worth the while.</p>

               </gap> had a Patent for them) which I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>This Watch of Mr. <hi>Zulichem</hi>'s agreed with Dr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s, in the application of the Spring to the ballance: only Mr. <hi>Zuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>'s had a longer Spiral Spring, and the Pulſes and Beats were much ſlower. That wherein it differs, is 1. The Verge hath a Pinion inſtead of Pallets; and a Contrate-wheel runs therein, and drives it round, more than one turn. 2. The Pallets are on the Arbor of this Contrate-wheel. 3. Then followeth the Crown wheel, &amp;c. 4. The ballance, inſtead of turning ſcarce quite round (as Dr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s) doth turn ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rounds every vibration.</p>

§ 8. As to the great abilities of Mr. <hi>Hugens,</hi> no man can doubt, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Books, and his ſhare in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, &amp;c. But I have ſome reaſon to doubt, whether his fancy was not firſt ſet on work, by ſome Intelligence he might have of Dr <hi>Hook</hi>'s Invention, from Mr <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> or others his correſpondents here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether or no that ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth owe any thing herein to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Dr <hi>Hook,</hi> it is however a very pretty, and ingenious contrivance; but ſubject to ſome defects: <hi>viz.</hi> When it ſtandeth ſtill, it will not vibrate, until it is ſet on vibrating: which, tho it be no defect in a Pendulum Clock, may be one in a Pocket-Watch, which is expoſed to continual jogs. Alſo, it doth ſomewhat vary in its Vibrations, making ſometimes longer, ſometimes ſhorter turns, and ſo ſome ſlower ſome quicker vibrations.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen ſome other contrivances of this ſort, which I mention not, becauſe they are of younger ſtanding. But theſe two (of Dr <hi>Hook</hi> and Mr <hi>Hugens)</hi> I have taken notice of, becauſe they were the firſt that ever appeared in the world.</p>

               <p>By the permiſſion of my ingenious friend Mr <hi>Flamſteed,</hi> I here inſert a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Mr <hi>Olaus Romer,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Mathematician's Inſtrument, to repreſent the Motion of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s <hi>Satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;</hi> a copy of which he ſent to Mr <hi>Flamſteed</hi> in 1679.</p>
               <p>Upon an axis (which turns round once in 7 days) are four Wheels fixed: one of 87 teeth; a ſecond of 63; the third 42; and the laſt of 28 teeth. On another axis run 4 other Wheels (or Pinions you may call them) which are driven by the aſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Wheels. The firſt is a Wheel, or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of 22 leaves, driven by the Wheel 87, which carrieth round the firſt Satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite. The ſecond is 32, driven by the Wheel 63, which carrieth round the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Satellite. The third hath 43 leaves, driven by the Wheel 42, which carrieth the third Satellite. And laſtly, is the Pinion 67, driven by the Wheel 28, which carrieth round the fourth Satellite.</p>
               <p>On the firſt axis is an Index, that point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a circle divided into 168 parts, which are the hours in 7 days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:40878:68"/>
On the other axis all the Pinions run concentrically, by means of their being hollow in the middle. In the midſt of them all, the axis of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a little Ball at the top, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s body. On the ends of 4 ſmall Wires, fixed in the four ſeveral Sockets of the aforeſaid Pinions, may 4 leſſer Globules be placed (at their due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Globule) to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the 4 Satellites going round that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>

Multiply the Pinion you like better, by this number of turns, and the Product is the Wheel.

               <p>This Table ſhews how much the Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, goeth faſter than the Solar day, in any number of nights for a month. So that obſerving by your Watch, the nice time when any fixed Star cometh to the Meridian, or any other point of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: if after one Revolution of that ſame Star to the ſame point, your Watch goeth 3′. 57″ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lower than the Star; or after two nights 7′. 54″; or 16 nights, 1 h. 3′. 20″, &amp;c. then doth your Watch keep time rightly with the Mean motion of the Sun. If it vary from the Table, you muſt alter the length of your Pend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make it ſo keep time.</p>
               <p>To obſerve the time nicely, when the Star cometh again to the ſame point of the heavens, 'tis neceſſary to make the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with a Teleſcope, that hath croſs threads in the focus of the object-glaſs; and ſo leaving the Teleſcope fixed in the ſame poſture, till a ſecond Obſervation. You may do this with the teleſcopular ſights of a Quadrant, or Sextans, and ſo leaving it ſtanding until anoher night of Obſervation. Or for want of this more nice way, you may do it by looking along by the edge of two Strings, ſuſpended with Plumbets,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40878:71"/>
in a room, at ſome diſtance from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Or by looking at the edge of a Chimney, &amp;c. as Mr <hi>Watſon</hi> hath direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the end of Mr <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Horo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Remarks upon the Table.</head>
               <p>The Column of the Sun's Refractions, I owe to that accurate obſerver of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial motions, Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Flamſteed.</hi> Which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions, altho in the Table the ſame, yet do differ at different ſeaſons of the year, nay perhaps, according to the different temperature of the air ſometimes, in the ſame day. Thus Mr <hi>Flamſteed</hi> found the Refractions in <hi>February,</hi> very different from thoſe in <hi>April:</hi> and it is obſerved, that the Refractions are commonly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when the <hi>Mercury</hi> is higher in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer.</p>
               <p>The Table therefore doth not ſhew what the Refractions always are, but only about the middle quantity of them, at every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, of the 10 firſt of the Sun's altitude. And accordingly I have calculated the Variations thereby made in the hour of the day.</p>
               <p>Theſe Variations of the hour are greater or leſſer, according as the angle of the Sun's diurnal motion is acuter with the horizon. The reaſon is plain; becauſe as the Sun appears by refraction higher than
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40878:72"/>
really he is; ſo this falſe height doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the hours in Winter, more than the Summer half year.</p>
               <p>There is no ray indeed of the Sun, but what cometh refracted to a Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>dial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſequently, there is no Dial but what goeth more or leſs falſe (except at Noon in Dials that caſt a Shade, where the refraction makes no variation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) But the Refraction decreaſeth apace, as the Sun gets higher, and cauſeth a variation of not above half a minute, at 10 degrees of the Sun's altitude; except when the Sun is in, or near the Southern Tropick. Nearer than half a minute, few common Sun-dials ſhew the time. And therefore, partly for this reaſon, and partly, becauſe Mr. <hi>Flamſteed</hi>'s obſervations reach not much farther, I have calculated my Table to only 10 degrees.</p>
               <p>The Table needs little explication. For having the Sun's height, you have againſt it, in the next Column, the Refraction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the 3 next the alterations of the hour, at 3 times of the year. Taking therefore by a Quadrant the Sun's alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and obſerve at the ſame time, the hour of the day by a Sun-dial, by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40878:73"/>
you ſee how many minutes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, the Dial is too faſt. As at the Sun-riſing a Sun-dial is too faſt 4′. 34″, about <hi>June</hi> 11, and 3′. 32″, about <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. and <hi>Sept.</hi> 12, and 4′ 38″ about <hi>Dec.</hi> 11.</p>

            <p>TO the Fifth part of the Rule in § 6. p. 21. If you have occaſion to lay the Pinion of Report upon any other Wheel, and not the great-Wheel, you may do it by this Rule, <hi>As the Beats in one turn of any Wheel; To the Beats in an hour:: So are the hours of the Dial; To the Quotient of the Hour-wheel divided by the Pinion of Report.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To page 66. Suppoſe in altering an old Watch, you would have it ſhew minutes, as well as hours; you may do it thus: Divide the Beats in one turn of the Great-wheel, by the Beats in an hour; the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will ſhew in how many hours the Great-wheel goeth round once. If the Beats in the Great wheel exceed the Train, you muſt chuſe your Minute-wheel firſt, and multiply it by the Quotient; this will give the Pin. of Report. But if the Train exceeds the Beats of the Great-wheel, you muſt chuſe the Pin. of Rep. and multiply the Quotient by it: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is the Minute-wheel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40878:74"/>
But it often falls out, that the Train and Beats of the Great-wheel will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly meaſure one another: if ſo, the beſt way is to half the two numbers, as far as they will equally admit of halfing; or divide them by ſome common diviſor, and ſo having brought them to as ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as you can, you may ſuppoſe them to be a Wheel and Pinion, and reduce them to leſſer numbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Chap. 2. Sect. 2. § 5. Thus ſuppoſe you would make the old dull Movement there mentioned, a Minute-watch; you may reduce the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Great-wheel 2188<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Train 9368, to a Pinion and Wheel 28) 12. Which Pin. 28 being ſet upon the Spingle of the Gr. Wh. will drive a Wheel 12 round once in an hour, to ſhew Minutes. If you make this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wh. 12 drive another of 48; (concentrical to which, is a Pin. 12 driving a Wheel 36 (which Wheel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical with the Minute-wheel) this will carry a Hand round in 12 hours. But in this caſe, you muſt place the Pin. 28 on the Spindle of the Gr. Wh. ſo as to ſlide round ſtiffly, when you turn the Minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to rectifie the Watch.</p>
