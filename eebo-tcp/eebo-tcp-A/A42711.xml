         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REmember the Command and Example of Chriſt Jeſus, and obey and follow the ſame, who ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, I am Meek and Lowly, and ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls;</hi> if thou takeſt his counſel and followſt his example, then thou wilt read in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lowlineſs of Mind, and if thou ſo read, I queſtion not, but what I have writ in this following Teſtimony will meet with an anſwer in thy Conſcience, and ſome benefit may come to thee thereby, and if ſo it come to paſs, it will be matter of true rejoycing to me; for I do take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Well-being of the Sons and Daughters of men every way, both in Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that the Holy, Glorious Lord God of Heaven &amp; Earth doth give Life and a Being upon Earth unto all mankind, for one and the ſame purpoſe, even that all ſhould ſerve him with their Souls and with their Bodies, which are his; it is equitable in God to require this ſervice, therefore ſaith the holy Apoſtle, <hi>This is your reaſonable ſervice, at this the Law of God directly pointed</hi> (given by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after through ſin man-kind was fallen from God) ſaying, <hi>Hear O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind;</hi> this is the firſt and greateſt Commandment, and the ſecond is like unto it, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus in the days of his Fleſh, did not only ratifie and confirm this, and commend the ſame to his Diſciples and to the Multitude, but alſo opened or expounded the latter, yea, enlarged the ſame unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, ſaying, <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to thoſe who do deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perſecute you.</hi> Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews, Think ye I came to deſtroy the Law?

               </hi> and thoſe Believers in him (who received him into their hearts by Faith) were not born of fleſh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God, theſe were born of the Spirit, and led by it, and they are the Children of God, who are led by the Spirit of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, through the Grace, Favour and tender Mercy of God</hi>

Reader, take notice that after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the 9th Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> hath repeated what God ſaid to the Woman while the Children were in her Womb; he brings the following words <hi>(As it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated)</hi> out of the firſt Chapter of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> where the Lord ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Malachi, Was not</hi> Eſau Jacob<hi>'s Brother? yet I loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and I hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and I laid his Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains waſte for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs:</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken by the Lord, through the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> unto the Off-ſpring of <hi>Jacob,</hi> long after <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> had finiſhed their Dayes upon Earth. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a plain faithfull Man, made ſo and kept ſo by the Spirit of the Lord, whom he loved: <hi>Eſau</hi> was a prophane Man, who relected the Counſel of God, in Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his good Spirit which he gave him to Inſtruct him, by which he was lighted to know Good from Evil, and therein Power was freely tendred to him (and Time) to believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; ſo it was poſſible that he might believe and obey: ſo that his Unbelief and Diſobedience was not of God, but of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; not according to the Will of God, who would have all Men and Women ſaved, but according to the Will of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who would have all Men and Women deſtroyed, whom that prophane Spirit, the Prince of the power of the Air did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, Corrupt, and brought into Prophaneneſs; ſo he that was the Falſe Teacher to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who led them to break the holy Law of God, and ſin againſt him, the ſame led <hi>Eſau</hi> into his Prophaneneſs, becauſe of which he was hated of God: and the ſame Evil teacher led <hi>Cain</hi> to Kill his Righteous Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> whoſe Sacrifice was accepted of the pure God, becauſe it was offered up with a Clean, Right and Harmleſs Mind, into which Mind he was brought, and in the ſame kept by God his Maker, out of the Evil Spirit, which corrupted his Brother <hi>Cain;</hi> and his God, who never ſlumbers nor ſleeps, kept him, yea, he gave him Dominion over the Evil, Hurtfull Spirit, and he is Eternally bleſſed, though he was ſlain by his Ungodly Brother: And God ſaid unto <hi>Cain</hi> [before he killed his Brother] <hi>Why art thou Wroth?

            <p>In the Prophecy of <hi>Obediah</hi> there is much ſaid concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> and his Generation, &amp; of the juſt Judgments of God againſt them for their Wickedneſs, Verſe 6.

            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteonſneſs, becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them: and becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God; and even as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge,</hi>

               <hi>God gave them up to a Reprobate Mind,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 1. 18, 19, 21, 28.

            </p>
            <p>Reader, here thou mayſt ſee that the Apoſtle took great care of thoſe who had believed in Chriſt, that they might make their Calling and Election ſure: So it appears that diligence in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Grace (by which they were ſaved) was required of them, in which diligence they being found, the Spirit of Grace did make them Fruitful in thoſe good things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and the diligent did not fall, but made their <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> ſure: the ſame Apoſtle Exhorted the Saints, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the error of the Wicked fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; but grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Here again the Apoſtle ſheweth not only his great care that the Saints might make their Calling and Election ſure, and ſo STAND, but alſo ſheweth that it was poſſible that they might be led away with the Error of the Wicked, and ſo FALL, if they did not diligently attend upon the Spirit of Grace, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deny all Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and to live Soberly and Godly in this preſent World.</p>

            <p>Note Reader, the holy Apoſtles and the reſt of the faithful <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were come to Repentance, and were Regenerated and Born of God, and ſo were new Creatures in Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47409:8"/>
But the Long-ſuffering of God is exerciſed towards the Ungodly, who is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance; and he gives them time to repent, and doth viſit them with his good Spirit in tender Love, to enable them to Repent; but many reject his tender Love herein, and will not obey his Voice, as he ſaid, Iſrael <hi>would have none of me;</hi> and as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews, Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi>

Mark Reader, though God gave her Space, that is, Time to Repent, yet ſhe Repented; now her not Repenting proceeded from her own [Self] willfullneſs, and not from God's holy Will; for inaſmuch as God gave her time to Repent, ſhe was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition by him to Repent, and therefore might have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented within the time he gave her to Repent, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it might be hid from her Eyes, as it was in the Caſe of <hi>Eſau.</hi>

            <p>Reader, here take notice that the holy Man of God, who writ this Epiſtle, ſpeaks of ſome who was Sanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, who afterwards did tread under Foot the Son of God, and counted the Blood of the Covenant, by which he was Sanctified, an Unholy thing, and did Deſpite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit of Grace: Now he that did ſo, did fall from the Grace, as the holy Man ſaid to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe the ſaid author ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. <hi>For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, &amp; have taſted of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt; and have taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance; ſeeing they crucifie unto themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame,</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.

But, note Reader, there may be ſome ſliping and ſliding in the Spiritual Journey, after Man or Woman is come to know the Truth and a place in it; this I ſay may come through want of watchfulneſs on the Creatures part, and yet through the tender Mercy of the Lord ſnch may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed into ſavour with God again through his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Creatures unfeigned Repentance: And this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; renewing into favour with God is wrought by the vertue

of the Mediator and Advocate, Chriſt Jeſus; At this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle points, ſaying, <hi>Mylittle Children, theſe things write I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that ye Sin not; and if any man Sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. But let all who knows the Truth, and hath a Place or a Habitation in it, keep in the holy fear of the Lord God ſtedfaſt, and lowly in mind; and let none by what is here ſaid take liberty to Sin that Grace or Favour may abound, no, God for-bid, as ſaith the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the Polutions of the World, through the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; they are again Entangled therein, and</hi> OVERCOME; <hi>the latter end with them is worſe than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have known the Way of Righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment,</hi> DELIVERED UNTO THEM. <hi>But it is happened</hi> (or come to paſs) <hi>unto them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own Vomit again, and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22. Here the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, that ſome had eſcaped the Polutions of the World, through the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, they had the holy Commandment delivered to them; and they turned from it, and they turned like the Dog to his own Vomit, or like the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire. God did not will that they ſhould turn from the holy Commandment which he had delivered unto them, nor that they ſhould turn into the Polutions of the World again, out of which they had eſcaped through the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; for God who is unchangeable, hath ſaid, <hi>If any man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him,</hi> Heb. 10. 38.</p>

might receive the Grace of God, and through their own Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, Sloth and Unwatchfulneſs might fall from it and Periſh; and certainly ſome did ſo, as <hi>Jude</hi> doth ſhew in his Epiſtle, and <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle unto the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he ſaid unto them, <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Galatians! <hi>who hath bewitched you?</hi> and he ſaid unto them, <hi>Whoſoever of you are Juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. and 3. 1. Note Reader, their falling from Grace was not becauſe the Grace was not ſufficient to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, but becauſe of their Sloth, Negligence and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfullneſs: the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> Exhorted thoſe he writ to, <hi>To be good Stewards of the manifold</hi> GRACE <hi>of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 10. thoſe who were good Stewards did grow in Grace, and were ſaved by it, as the holy Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved, through Faith;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>It is a good thing that the Heart be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Grace. It hath appeared to all men,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 2. 5, and 8. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13. 9. and its appearance unto all men is for one and the ſame Cauſe, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or End, even to bring Salvation unto all the good Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the Grace, have Salvation by it. But the Evil and Unjuſt Stewards do deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace (read <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.) and ſuch are the Idle Stewards, wh o are ſpoken of by Chriſt in his Parables, ſaying, <hi>Take that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt and Idle Servant, who hath hid his Lord's Money in the Earth, and Bind him Hand and Foot, and caſt him into utter Darkneſs, where there is Weeping and Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> By this it doth appear, that the holy Apoſtles did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and know, that the Grace of God, which bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which hath appeared unto all men, is ſufficient to bring and give Salvation unto all men. And thoſe who have not Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it, the Fault is not in God or Chriſt, or the Grace, but in themſelves. <hi>The Sluggard is cloathed with Rags; and the Rebellious ſhall dwell in a dry Land; the Backſlider God hath no pleaſure in, he ſhall be filled with his own Evil Wayes; and Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft, but the diligent hand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Rich; and he that is faithfull in a little ſhall be made Ruler over much: God rejects the Proud; but he teacheth the Humble;</hi> he gives encreaſe of Grace and of Faith unto them. The holy

Apoſtles great Labour and Care was, to bring people to the Grace of God, and to keep them to it; they knew the ſufficiency of it; yet alſo knew that the Serpent (who drew <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> from God, to ſin againſt him) would labour to keep people in Rebellion againſt the Grace of God, and alſo would labour to draw thoſe into Rebellion againſt it, who were come into Obedience to it; and they knew the Serpent might readily prevail if a diligent Watch were not kept; and this our Lord Jeſus well knew, and therefore ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>What I ſay unto one, I ſay unto all, Watch;</hi> WATCH <hi>and Pray leſt ye enter into Temptation.</hi> The holy Prophet ſaid, <hi>I will hear what the Lord will ſay, for he will ſpeak Peace to his Saints; but let them not turn again to Folly.</hi>

And though God ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh, I have raiſed thee up to make my Power known in thee;</hi> yet God did not ſay to him, I Created thee on purpoſe that thou ſhouldſt be a Wicked, Cruel and Hard hearted Man; NO, it were great Blaſphemy to ſay or think ſo; though after he was hardened, God ſuffered him for a time to oppreſs his People, yea, to riſe higher and higher in his Oppreſſion, yet afterwards God's Power was known in his Deſtruction, and in the deliverance of his own People.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here its clear that God calls Fools and Scorners to Repent, he wills that they ſhould Repent, and he puts them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they may Repent; he puts them into a condition that they may Turn at his Reproof from the Evil which he doth Reprove them for; he puts them into a condition, that they may take his Counſel, and chuſe the Fear of the Lord. It were

horrible Blaſphemy to ſay, That though God called them to turn at his Reproof, yet he did not Will or Intend that they ſhould turn at his Reproof, chuſe his Fear, or take his Counſel, or to ſay, he knew they could not do it, is likewiſe Blaſphemy. And it is Blaſphemy to ſay or think, that God who commands peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be Holy, FORCETH &amp; CONSTRAINETH them to be wicked and ungodly, by WITH-HOLDING his Spirit of Grace and Truth from them, which ſhould enable them to turn at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to receive his Counſel &amp; chuſe his Fear: without the Spirit of Grace and Truth (which comes by Jeſus Chriſt, who is the true Light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world) NO Man or Woman can turn from ſin, take Gods Counſel, nor chuſe his Fear, but that all the Wicked might Repent, and Turn from their Evil Wayes, while the Day of their Viſitation laſteth. <hi>The Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to All Men</hi> (as the holy Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Teaching us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live godly in this preſent World.</hi> The Grace of God appears unto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for one and the ſame Cauſe, Purpoſe or End, even to teach all to deny Ungodlineſs, and to live godly in this preſent World: but as <hi>Jude</hi> the Servant of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Wicked</hi> (not being Obedient unto it) <hi>turn into Wantonneſs;</hi> and as its elſe-where writ, <hi>The Wicked do deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.

Now for any perſon to ſay or think, That it was the Will of God that they ſhould Rebell againſt him, and Vex his holy Spirit? this is horrible Blaſphemy <hi>[Mark]</hi> theſe had the Spirit, and did Rebell againſt it, and thereby did grieve or vex it, for which cauſe he became their Enemy, and Fought againſt them [Mark] he did not become their Enemy nor Fight againſt them until by their Rebellion; they vexed his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo theſe Rebells being Reprobated from Reſt and Peace with God, their Deſtruction was of themſelves, and the Lord God is clear. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in his 9th Chapter ſaith concerning the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Lord, thou gaveſt thy good Spirit to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them; but they Rebelled againſt thee.</hi> Now for any perſon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47409:13"/>
to ſay or think, that it was Gods Will that they ſhould Rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; this is horrible Blaſphemy, as I ſaid before; or for any perſon to ſay or think, that God gives his good Spirit to ſome perſons on purpoſe that they may Rebell againſt it, and thereby cauſe him to become their Enemy and to Fight againſt them this is no leſs then Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> With whom was God grieved forty Years? was it not with them that had ſinned, whoſe Carkaſes fell in the Wilderneſs, to whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his Reſt, but to them that believed not? So we ſee they could not enter in becauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief; let us labour to enter into that Reſt, leſt any man <hi>FALL</hi> after the ſame example of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, <hi>Heb. 3. 17, 18, 19, &amp; 4. 11, 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note here Reader, the Apoſtle doth not place the Fall of theſe rebellious <hi>Jews</hi> (who came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Moſes)</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the decree, or will, or fore-appointment of God, BUT up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Unbelief, Rebellion and Apoſtacy, which the Devil, (NOT GOD) was the author of; for they might have entred, if they had improved that help and ability which God gave them. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>God gave them his good Spirit to inſtruct them, but they rebelled againſt it, they were diſobedient and rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and caſt thy Law behind their Backs and ſlew thy Prophets,</hi> WHICH TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM TO TURN THEM UNTO THEE, <hi>and they wrought great provocation,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Reader, by this it appears plainly that God had not reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Rebels from all Eternity, or ordained them before they were Born to ſlay his Prophets: For ſaith <hi>Nehemiah, Thou ſent thy Prophets whom they ſlew, to turn them unto thee.</hi> It were horrible Blaſphemy to ſay that Gods will and purpoſe, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination was that they ſhould ſlay his Prophets which he ſent unto them to turn them unto him: And it were horrible Blaſphemy to ſay, that God did not will or intend that they ſhould be turned unto him, but only told them ſo; and it would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47409:13"/>
be no leſs Blaſphemy to ſay, that God both ſent the Prophets to turn them to him, and alſo ſent them to ſlay the Prophets; this would render God to be the author of Confuſion, which cannot be; for he is the God of good and holy order, &amp; not of Confuſion (as ſaith the holy Apoſtle) nay, it would render him the author of Murder, and ſo make him contradict his own holy Law, which he hath given unto the Sons and Daughters of men, whoſe command is expreſly, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder;</hi> yea, it would render him as contradicting his own Charge and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands unto the Sons and Daughters of men, who ſaith, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed,</hi> DO MY PROPHETS NO HARM, 1 <hi>Chrou.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 15.

            <p>Reader, by what the holy Apoſtle here ſaith, it is plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Fall and Deſtruction of theſe people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was their own Wickedneſs; for they all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and Drank the ſame ſpiritual Drink, which ſpiritual Meat and Drink was Chriſt: ſo its plain that thoſe that FELL; did eat of the ſame Meat and Drink, which thoſe did eat of, who did not

It would be horrible Blaſphemy to ſay, that it was God's will that theſe people who fell ſhould be Fornicators and Idolaters, Murmurers, &amp;c. that ſo God might damn them to all Eternity, and caſt them into the Lake of Endleſs Miſery. And it were alſo great Blaſphemy to ſay, that Chriſt, who was the heavenly ſpiritual Meat and Drink, of whom they eat and drink, COULD NOT or WOULD NOT keep them from Falling, or to ſay that it was the Will of God the Father that he ſhould not keep them from falling. For it was their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Self-will, which was the cauſe of their Deſtruction, in which they with-ſtood the tender Mercies of the Lord God, and revolted and went a whoring from him: and this the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle well knew, and therefore ſaid, <hi>God was not</hi> WELL-PLEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED <hi>with them, for they were overthrown, &amp;c. Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe things were our</hi> EXAMPLES <hi>to the intent that we ſhould not Luſt after evil things as they luſted: Neither be</hi> IDOLATERS, FORNICATORS, MURMURERS <hi>as they were neither tempt Chriſt as they did, who</hi> FELL <hi>in one day three end twenty thouſand,</hi> as aforeſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all theſe things came upon them for Enſamples, and they are written for our AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONISHION</hi> (or Warning) <hi>wherefore let him that</hi> THINK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH <hi>he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall:</hi> he knew their ſtanding depended upon God, in their diligent and full improvement of that Gift and Ability which he had given them. And that which was the CAUSE of their fall, was their Slothfulneſs, Negligence, WANT of holy Fear and true Watchfulneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the holy Fear of the Living God. <hi>Jude</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Jeſus Chriſt was truly ſenſible of theſe things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid unto the Saints, <hi>I will put you in remembrance (though you once knew this) how that the Lord having ſaved the people out of</hi>

               <hi>the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>afterwards deſtroyed them that believed not; and the Angels which kept not their</hi> FIRST STATE <hi>but left their own</hi> HABITATION, <hi>he hath reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great</hi> DAY.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, The <hi>Jews</hi> whom God brought out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> at that time was in a ſtate ſo near unto God, that they were not ONLY made partakers of an outward Deliverance, but in that day they were in a condition in which they might have had an Eternal or Everlaſting Salvation to their immortal Souls; and thoſe who had not that SALVATION, but periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eternally: their Deſtruction was of themſelves, as God ſaid unto <hi>Iſrael; O</hi> Iſrael <hi>thou deſtroyeſt thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Angels which fell had a State of Reſt and Peace with God; this was their firſt ſtate which <hi>Jude</hi> here ſpeaks of, but they kept not this Firſt STATE and Habitation, but LEFT IT, yea, Loſt it, through Preſumption, Irreverence and Neglect of their Duty, whom God in his Righteous Judgments <hi>hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Everlaſting</hi> CHAINS <hi>under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great day,</hi> Jude 6. the keeping and preſervation of Angels and Men from falling is in their Humble, Lowly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant depending upon God, in the diligent improvement of all that God hath given them for his Glory, and their Preſervation, (Moreover) <hi>Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and the Cities about them in like manner, giving themſelves over to Fornication, and going after</hi> STRANGE FLESH, <hi>are ſet forth for Example, ſuffering the Vengance of</hi> ETERNAL FIRE, &amp;c.

            <p>Note Reader, Here theſe holy Men ſhew, that God ſpared not the Angels which ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell. It would be horrible Blaſphemy to ſay, that God ordained, willed

and purpoſed that they ſhould ſin againſt him, that ſo he might caſt them down to Hell; this is not only Unſcriptural and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable; but its wholly contrary to the nature of the holy glorious Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who is LOVE, as the Apoſtle ſaith, yea, <hi>a pure Fountain of Divine Love, who made all things good, yea,</hi> VERY GOOD <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1.</note>

            <p>Note this Reader, here is a clear and undeniable proof, that God never did, NO, nor never will Ordain, Predeſtinate, Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint or WILL that any Man or Woman ſhould be Evil, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Wicked; or that any Man or Woman ſhould imploy their Hearts and Minds at ANY TIME in that which is EVIL; much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that the Imaginations of the THOUGHTS of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Hearts ſhould be ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY.

            <p>Reader, by what is above written, it doth clearly and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appear, that the duty of all mankind is to love God, to hearken unto him, to obey his Voice, to do juſtly, to be lovers of Mercy, and all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt obey the Command of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>be merciful,</hi> &amp;c. and muſt walk Humbly with the living God, who giveth Life and a Being unto all Mankind; by whoſe pure power they have their being continu'd upon Earth; &amp; who of his free bounty gives them Food and Rayment, Health
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47409:18"/>
and all neceſſary things which they do enjoy; and without love to God, doing Juſtly, loving Mercy, and walking Humbly with God, as aforeſaid, Man and Woman cannot be accepted of God. The juſt equal Lord God, who requires this of all mankind, doth put all into a capacity ſo to do; And mens doing contrary unto this, proceeds not of or from God, but of and from the wicked one, the falſe Teacher, who led <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to Sin againſt God. Therefore let none who do WICKEDLY, ſay, It is Gods Will that they ſhould DO SO. For God who is Holy, who made man holy, juſt and good, his WILL is, that all ſhould be holy, who ſaid, <hi>Be ye holy, I the Lord your God am holy.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to chuſe the Good and refuſe the Evil, and they have Power tender'd unto them [by him] ſo to DO; &amp; it becomes their Sin who do not SO; ſuch do not improve that which God hath afforded them to enable and lead them to chuſe the good, and ſuch are the idle unjuſt Servants, who hide their Lords Money in the Earth, as Chriſt ſaid in his Parables, <hi>Such in their</hi> EVIL SELF-WILL <hi>chuſe the Evil,</hi> [THE SIN] <hi>the Wages of which is Death,</hi> as ſaith the holy Apoſtle. Now for any perſon to ſay, that though God commands People to chuſe the good, to chuſe Life; yet he doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> NOT WILL or Intend that they ſhould obey this his command in chuſing Life; this is horrible Blaſ phemy, or to ſay, that he knows they cannot chuſe the good (by his help) they cannot chuſe Life; this is alſo Blaſphemy: For this would render the pure juſt, holy, equal Lord God a Mocker in this great and weighty concern: the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid unto HIM, <hi>Thy Throne O God is forever and ever; the Scepter of thy Kingdom is a righteous Scepter: thou loveſt Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and</hi> HATEST WICKEDNESS; <hi>therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the Oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows,</hi> Pſal. 45. 6, 7. Heb. 1. 8. Thus it plainly appears that God and Chriſt loves Righteouſneſs and HATES all Sin and Wickedneſs. Therefore the Call of the Lord God WAS (AND IS) <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the</hi> UNRIGHTEOUS MAN HIS THOUGHTS: <hi>let him turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, unto our God and he will abundantly pardon.</hi> God ſaid by the Mouth of the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Draw near unto God,</hi>

            <p>Note Reader, Here is a general &amp; comortable Proclamation of the favour &amp; good will of God to all people, every one hath a T me or Day of Viſitation given unto them (by their mercifull Creator) to turn unto him from their ſin, to eat that which is good; he ſaith, Whoſoever WILL, let him come, and take of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Water of Life freely. So it plainly appeareth by this that God would have all people eat of his Bread, and drink of his Milk and Wine which he hath mingled, and if they do not eat and drink thereof, and ſo live to God by the vertue of the ſame, it is not becauſe God fore-appointed that they ſhould NOT do ſo, but it is becauſe they have given up their Minds and Ears to the Whiſperings and Lyes of that old Deceiver, which firſt led Man and Woman from God, and ſo he hath corrupted their Wills; ſo hath led them to love ſin, and to chuſe to abide in it all their Dayes; ſo the Selfiſh-corrupt-will which the Devil hath begotten in fallen Man, this WILL doth not chuſe Chriſt nor the Croſs, which his true Diſciples bear, nor the Bread of Life, or Water of Life, nor Wine nor Milk, which they eat and drink of abundantly to their immortal Souls ſtrength, joy and comfort, and the Glory of the Lord. So it is true which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ye will not come to me that you may have Life.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he wept over the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I would have gathered thy Children as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, but ye would NOT.</hi> Mark, He did NOT ſay, that they could not, but that they would not; and this his Teſtimony is true, Gods Spirit which convinceth the World of ſin, MOVETH upon the hearts of ſinners, to purifie their Wills, that ſo they may chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil, and his Spirit doth EFFECT this in all that do not withſtand his tender Viſitation therein (and thereby) till the day of their Viſitation be over,

So as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>God is</hi> NO <hi>Reſpecter of Perſons; but in every Nation he that fears God and works Righteouſneſs is accepted of him.</hi> God doth NOT Partially or IN diſ-reſpect to SOME Perſons, foreordain that they ſhall be wicked, and ſo to be damned and caſt into the Lake of everlaſting Miſery; NO, that is contrary to his tender love, who gave his only begotten Son for the Redemption of the World, which lieth in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>We have all ſinned,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle; and God hath Mercy upon all, as HE ſaith, and wills that all may be ſaved: He ſent his Son to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, and to bring back again to himſelf that which hath been driven away; God ſaith concerning him, <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him; he ſhall bring forth Judgment to the</hi> Gentiles: A BRUISED <hi>Reed ſhall he</hi> NOT <hi>break, the ſmoking Flax ſhall he not</hi> QUENCH: <hi>he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto Truth he ſhall not fail, &amp;c.—And the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> Iſa. 42. 1, 3, 4.

Faith freely tendered to them, that thereby they might be led out of the Sin of Unbelief by the Lord God; yea, it is his free gift unto them, given to beget and work Faith in them: and if they STILL continue in Unbelief, this gift will condemn them, and God juſtly will puniſh them for their Rebellion, Hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, Unbelief, &amp;c. and it convinceth them of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (in ſome degree) that thereby they might be led to do that which is juſt and righteous in the ſight of God, who is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous (&amp; in the ſight of men.) <q rend="margQuotes">For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt ALL Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of men, &amp;c.—Becauſe that which may be known of God IS ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt IN them; for God hath SHEWED it unto them.

Thoſe who are ſo hardened by the Devil (that great hardener of Hearts) that they will not have God, nor Chriſt, nor the Spirit of Grace and Truth, nor Faith: this their refuſing of God and Chriſt, the Spirit, Faith, &amp;c. is NOT according to the WILL and mind of God, nor Chriſt, nor the Spirit of Truth; but according to the curſed Will and Mind of the old Deceiver (who led <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to Sin againſt God (and againſt their own Souls) and according to their own curſed will and mind which he the old Deceiver and Deſtroyer hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in them againſt God, Chriſt, the Spirit of Truth, &amp;c.

            <p>Note Reader, here he pronounceth Wo againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not Faith, or were not in the true Faith; here the juſt God ſhews that he did not with-hold the true and real means, and cauſe of Faith from them; but they in their corrupt wicked WILL did reſiſt the working of the ſame, till God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtrive with them (for their Salvation:) So their being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, and periſhing for want of it, was of themſelves, and the Lord God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit of Truth was and is clear of them and all ſuch.</p>
            <p>It would be blaſphemous to ſay, that it was God's will that they ſhould have no Faith, (though he cryed Wo againſt them, becauſe they omitted it, and condemned them for not being found

in it.) But it is no very ſtrange thing that all men have not Faith, ſeeing many in former Ages, and divers in this have made SHIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WRACK of the true Faith which they ONCE HAD. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> charged <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>Hold</hi> FAITH <hi>and a</hi> GOOD CONSCIENCE, <hi>which ſome having put</hi> AWAY; <hi>concerning Faith have made Shipwrack,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 18, 19. Moreover <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy, The Spirit ſpeaks expreſly, that in the latter Times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils, ſpeaking Lyes in Hypocriſie, having their Conſcience ſeared with a hot iron; forbidding to Marry, and commanding to abſtain from Meats,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3.

Again, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy, Hold faſt the form of ſound Words, which thou haſt heard of me in</hi> FAITH <hi>and Love—this thou knoweſt, that all they which are in</hi> Aſia <hi>be turned away from me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. 15.

            <p>Reader, thus it doth plainly appear, that thoſe who once had the true Faith did depart from it, and fell into Apoſtacy, and ſo made Shipwrack of that Faith which the Spirit of Truth had begotten in them, and ſuch became as Trees twice Dead plucked up by the Roots, &amp;c. and as wandring Stars, (or wandring reſtleſs Spirits) for whom is reſerved the miſt of Darkneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as its written in the holy Scriptures, the Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of ſuch were grown very hard, benumed and greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, eyen anſwering in a Spiritual ſenſe that ſaying, <hi>viz.</hi> Having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot Iron, ſuch are forward and bold to commit Sin with pleaſure and greedineſs, and to make a mock at true Tenderneſs, holy Fear and true Watchfulneſs, and at the godly Sorrow, and unfeigned Repentance of thoſe whoſe Hearts God hath broken by his Righteous Judgments, through the effectual operation of the Word of FAITH, which is to be known nigh in the Heart and in the Mouth, which Word is as a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47409:24"/>
Hammer to break the hard Heart, and as an Ax or Sword to cut down the Luſt and Wickedneſs thereof, and as a Fire to burn up the ſame, and as a ſtrong Wind to drive away the Aſhes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wo, wo to the Ranters and Atheiſts, who have ſold themſelves to work Wickedneſs with greedineſs, who make a Mock at God &amp; at his Works in Judgment and in Mercy unto the Children of men, who ſport themſelves in their Deviliſh prophane Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; wo to them, it had been better for them that they had not been Born: And wo to all Apoſtates who are departed from the true Faith, which they once had, who have ſinned out the Day of Gods tender Viſitation to them, who are the Trees twice dead, pluckt up by the Roots, whoſe end is to be burned; it had been better for them that they had not had Faith, then after they had it, to depart from it. Therefore let all People, who have not ſinned out the day of God's tender Viſitation, HEAR and Fear the mighty God, who is a conſuming Fire unto the Wicked, as its written; and let all ſuch bow their Hearts and Minds unto God's ſearching Spirit and Word nigh in their Hearts; and that will work true Faith, and encreaſe the ſame, and will preſerve them from making Shipwrack of Faith; and it will beget a good tender Conſcience, and it will continue and uphold the ſame in all thoſe who continue to HEAR and Fear the living God, who as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Is the Saviour of all men; but eſpecially of thoſe that believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 10. His Sun ſhines upon the Evil and the Good, and his Rain falls upon the Juſt and the Unjuſt; he is good unto the Unthankful and to the Evil, as is ſhewed before: So God ſends and gives his Mercies unto the Wicked and Rebellious (in ſome degree) not only in things Temporal, but alſo in things Spiritual (as is largely ſhewed in this Book) ſo that in the day of Gods Viſitation unto them, he is a Saviour unto them, and ſaves and preſerves them from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: and he doth ſuffer long to lead the Wicked to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who ſaith, <hi>As I live, I have no pleaſure in the Death</hi> (or Damnation or Deſtruction) <hi>of the Wicked, but that the Wicked ſhould turn and live.</hi> But when they will not turn unto him in the day of his Long-ſuffering and tender Viſitation, he caſts them out of his favour forever; as Chriſt hath ſaid unto the

            <p>Note Reader, by what is above written, it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that there is a time when man may ſeek after God and find him, and have eternal Salvation given by him; yea, there is a time when HE is near, and then he being call'd upon will hear and anſwer: But if man IN his SELF-WILL, careleſneſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence REFUSE this ſeaſonable time, then he may ſeek,

and NOT find, call, and NOT be anſwered. Therefore bleſſed are all they who prize and imbrace the time and day of Gods tender Viſitation, who ſaid, TO <hi>day, if ye will hear my Voice,</hi> HARDEN NOT <hi>your Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>They that hated Knowledge, who did</hi> NOT CHUSE <hi>his fear;</hi> theſe did harden their Hearts, contrary to the will and mind of God: they ſet at naught ALL his Counſel, and would have NONE of his Reproof, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>they ſhall eat the Fruit of their own wayes, &amp;c.

            <p>Note Reader, here it plainly appeareth <hi>Saul</hi> had the Spirit of God, and it departed from him, becauſe of his Diſobedience and Rebellion againſt God: God did not will or fore-appoint that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould rebell againſt him; for after his Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Word of the Lord came unto the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It repenteth</hi> ME <hi>that I have ſet up</hi> Saul <hi>to be King, for he is turned</hi> BACK <hi>from following me, and hath not performed my Commandments;</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 10, 11. <hi>David</hi> who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Saul</hi> in the Kingdom, did ſee that God took his Spirit away from him becauſe of his Diſobedience and Rebellion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>David</hi> had committed that great Sin againſt God in the caſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> and his Wife, dread, terror and fear ſeiſed upon him, he was afraid that God would take his Spirit from him, as he did from <hi>Saul;</hi> but in the BOWEDNESS of his Heart he fell under the righteous Judgments of the Lord, and cryed unto him, ſaying, <hi>Create in</hi> ME <hi>a new Heart, O God, and renew</hi> IN ME <hi>a right Spirit: Waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter than Snow; caſt me not away from thy preſence; take</hi> NOT <hi>thy holy Spirit from</hi> ME. He unfeignedly Repented, God heard his Petition, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his Iniquity, and received him graciouſly: He ſaid, <hi>Make me to hear Joy and Gladneſs, that the Bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce: Reſtore to me the joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Therefore bleſſed are all they who deſpiſe NOT the day of ſmall things, who deſpiſe not the ſmalleſt, the loweſt, or leaſt appearance or manifeſtation of God, but do thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and improve the ſame, in obeying and following God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the underſtanding, ſtrength and ability which God hath given them; ſuch ſhall grow in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs as the Willows by the Water Courſes, as the Trees by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Water, which bring forth their Fruit in due ſeaſon: But as for the Wicked, who deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, who improve not that little that God hath given them, <hi>There is no Peace to them,</hi> ſaith the Lord God, <hi>they ſhall be like the Chaff which the Wind driveth to and fro. God is a Spirit,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith; <hi>His preſence filleth Heaven and Earth,</hi> as its written, he is Omnipreſent, or preſent in all places.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, beſides what I have ſhewed before, how God taketh his Spirit from the Rebellious; I further ſay, it may be properly ſaid, that man hath not the Spirit when he believeth not therein, neither obeyeth it, &amp;c. and ſo is not governed by it, and therefore no real Poſſeſſor of it, NOT being in UNION with it in this latter ſenſe he enjoyeth it not, he hath not Reſt &amp; Peace in it, becauſe he believeth not nor obeyeth it; yet this Spirit of Truth enlightneth his Soul in ſome degree, by which he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Sin, and reproved for it in ſecret THEREBY, and in this ſence of God's Omnipreſence, <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto God, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 139. 7, 8. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writeth thus, <hi>viz.

Chriſt's Doctrine are governed by the Lord God; and ſuch have both the Father and the Son, as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter the Kingdom of God, and ſhall not be able, therefore (thoſe who ſeek and are not able to enter the Kingdom) were ordained by the Lord God to be damned before they were Born, and caſt into Hell.</hi>

            <p>Note Reader, Chriſt did NOT tell him, who asked, if few were SAVED, that many (no, nor that any) were ordained to be damned before they were Born, nor yet that few were ſaved, but exhorted in general, ſaying, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Note Reader, this is WORTHY of thy obſervation, that <hi>Eſau</hi> SOLD his Birth-right; and the following words of the Apoſtle are theſe (viz.) <hi>You know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that afterward, WHEN he would have inherited the BLESSING, he was RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTED,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 17.</p>
            <p>Note, here the holy Ghoſt renders <hi>Eſau</hi> a Prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and rendereth the SELLING and deſpiſing of his Birth-right as a proof of his Prophaneneſs, for which he was rejected of God, and could not inherit the Bleſſing, though he Afterwards ſought it, &amp;c. The holy Ghoſt or Spirit ſaid by <hi>Moſes, Thus</hi> Eſau <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed his Birth-right,</hi> Gen. 25. 34. God did not fore-appoint <hi>Eſau</hi> to be a prophane or wicked man; he did not fore-appoint him to ſerve and obey the Devil, the Original and firſt cauſe of all Prophaneneſs and Wickedneſs. It is written, that <hi>Ahab</hi> SOLD HIMSELF to work Wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 25, 20. So Wickedneſs and Prophaneneſs alwayes proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Devil, and CORRUPT SELF; but all Purity and Holineſs proceeds from God, who is everlaſting Holy: his command unto all People is, <hi>Be ye Holy, for I the Lord your God am Holy: Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> as ſaith the holy Ghoſt; and alſo ſaith, <hi>Holineſs becomes the Lords Houſe forever.</hi> God DID NOT SELL <hi>Eſau</hi> to work Wickedneſs, but he ſold himſelf, or gave up himſelf to the Original of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Devil; for after he was corrupted by him who is the Original of all Prophaneneſs and Wickedneſs, he deſpiſed his Birth-right, and ſold it for a Meſs of Pottage, and after he had done this God rejected him; but before this, he had a day or time of Viſitation, in which he might have entred into Reſt and Peace with God.

            <p>Note Reader, here God plainly tells <hi>Eſau</hi> in his Seed and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, of the many acts of Pride and Cruelty which he did, which he ſhould not have done, and becauſe he did them, God was angry with him, and therefore rejected him, and cut him off, and returned a reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon him according to his evil works: So <hi>Eſau's</hi> ruin, miſery and deſtruction was of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the effect and reward of his own rebellious evil Works, which the Devil (not God) was the Original and cauſe of, and God was and is juſt in his righteous Judgments that he brought upon him, and which he brings upon all ſuch.</p>
            <p>Moreover concerning ſtriving to enter into the Kingdom, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> in the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>And if a man alſo ſtrive for maſtery, yet is he not crowned (or gaineth not Victory) except he ſtrive lawfully,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 5.

The Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>by the holy Ghoſt gave a true Relation of the Voice which he &amp; others heard from the excellent Glory, concerning Chriſt Jeſus, ſaying,</hi> This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, &amp;c. <hi>After he had given this true Relation, he further ſaid,</hi> We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto <note place="margin">Note, here the Darkneſs is within, in the Heart of man in the Fall, and the Light ſhines to expell the Darkneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> within, &amp; the Day is to dawn, and the Day-ſtar is to ariſe in the darkened fallen mans Heart.</note>ye do well that ye take heed as unto a Light that ſhines in a dark place, untill the Day dawn, and the Day Star ariſe in your Hearts, <hi>2 Pet. 1. 17, 18, 19.</hi> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with.

            <p>
               <hi>Take notice Reader,</hi> God is Light, God is a Spirit; Chriſt is the Light of the World, <hi>as he ſaith, yea,</hi> the true Light that lighteth everyone that cometh into the World. There was a Man ſent from God, whoſe Name was <hi>John,</hi> the ſame came for a Witneſs, to bear witneſs of the Light, that <hi>ALL MEN</hi> through him might believe; he <hi>(to wit, John)</hi> was not that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſs of that Light, which was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the World: he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not: he came unto his own, and his own received him not; but as many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, &amp;c.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47409:29"/>
which were Born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, <hi>1 John 1. to verſ. 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note Reader, Chriſt in his Divinity, as he is the Word which was in the beginning, by whom all things was made, he is the true divine Light, who lighteth every man that cometh into World: He ſaid unto the World, whom he enlightneth, <hi>Believe in the Light, that ye may be the Children of the Light.</hi> The Children of the Light are the Children of God; for God is Light, as is ſhewed before. This holy Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Light ſhined in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</hi> Therefore was <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſent from God to bear witneſs to that Light, which ſhineth in Darkneſs, that all men through him might believe; mark, all being enlightned by Chriſt, who is given for a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to be Gods Salvation to the ends of the Earth (for ſo it is written of him by the Holy man) therefore Gods will is that all People, Male and Female, may believe in the Light, wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned them: this Light being believed in giveth to ſee Chriſt, and leads to him the giver of it, and to God the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning or changing, as ſaith the holy Apoſtle. Mankind in the fall and alienation from God in their Sin, are darkened by the God of the World who hath blinded their minds: Man in that ſtate is ſaid to be Darkneſs. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>For ye were ſometimes Darkneſs, but now are ye Light in the Lord; walk as Children of the Light: for the Fruits of the Spirit is in all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Righteouſneſs, and Truth,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 8, 9. And ſo here the Light and Spirit are joyned together by the Apoſtle whoſe Fruits are one, their Teſtimony and Work one, and they are one as God, who is Light and Spirit is one, and not divided. For God being a Spirit and Light, and Chriſt as he is the divine Word, is God, is Light, is a quickening Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo the Light and Spirit floweth from the Father, in and through his Son, and thereby are all men enlightned to know Good from Evil (in ſome degree or meaſure) this Light is the Condemnation of all them that hate it. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and men love</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47409:30"/>
               <hi>Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were Evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his deed ſhould be reproved: but every one that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God,</hi> John 3. 19, 20, 21. To be turned to this Light, is the great and weighty concern of the fallen darkened Sons &amp; Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore was that great and faithful Prophet <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> ſent to bear witneſs of the Light, that all men might believe; here is none fore-ordained of God to be Unbelievers; here none is Reprobated by him before they were Born: Chriſt according to the Fleſh dyed for all; yea, his Soul was made an Offering for Sin; by his divine Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he enlightneth all: <hi>He is the Propitiation,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, not for our Sins only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi>

            <p>Reader, this is the COMMON Salvation that <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of in the beginning of his Epiſtle: to believe in the Light as aforeſaid is true Belief, or true <note place="margin">

               <hi>Note Reader, that Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of true Faith, as it is written of him,</hi> Heb. <hi>12. 2.

            <p>Reader, thus it plainly, clearly and evidently appears in the words of the holy Scripture, that God and Chriſt is Light, and by God, in and through Chriſt are all Men and Women en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned (in ſome meaſure or degree) to know good and evil, the one from the other; in and by this Light is true and ſaving Faith tendred or offered to ALL. <hi>They who take heed unto this Light, which ſhineth in their dark ſinful Hearts</hi> (and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth them of, and reproveth them for Sin) <hi>they do well,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle; ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.

Now thoſe who ſtrive to enter the Kingdom of God out of this Light and Faith, are as Thieves and Robbers, who will not come to Chriſt the Light, the Door to enter in by him, but would climb up by another way, and therefore muſt be caſt down; and though they ſtrive never ſo much in their fallen corrupt Self-will, out of the true Light and Spirit of God and Chriſt, yet can they not be able to enter.

            <p>
               <hi>Note Reader, the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto ten Virgins, five Wiſe and five Fooliſh; both wiſe and fooliſh had Lamps, yea, and both had Oyl (ONCE) for the fooliſh ſaid unto the wiſe,</hi> Give us of your Oyl, for our Lamps are gone out; <hi>This ſheweth that they were once IN, lighted and burning, but through ſloathfulneſs they neglected to renew their Lamps with Oyl, and ſo their Lamps went out (which ſhews they were once in) and they could not enter with the Bride-groom, for the Door was ſhut: So will it be with the hardned Apoſtates, who taſted of the heavenly Gift, and have been made pertakers of the Power of the World to come, who turned from the heavenly Gift delivered to them, who made Shipwrack of that Faith which God gave them, and put away a good Conſcience which they once had, who have trampled the Blood of the Covenant under Foot, whereby they were ſanctified, who are grown paſt feeling whoſe Conſcience is ſeared with a hot Iron; ſuch having ſinned out the day of Gods tender Viſitation unto them, they are as Trees twice dead plucked up by the Roots, whoſe end is to be burned; Wells without Water, Clouds without Rain, carried about of Tempeſts, wandring Stars, for whom is reſerved the miſt or blackneſs of Darkneſs forever.</hi> Enoch <hi>the ſeventh from</hi> Adam <hi>Propheſied of theſe, &amp;c. the Apoſtle</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and</hi> Jude <hi>write of theſe in their ſeveral Epiſtles, as may be read at large. Though theſe, like</hi> Balaam <hi>the Enemy of God and of his People, ſhould deſire to dye the death of the Righteous, and have their latter end like his (which is to enter into the Kingdom of God) and ſit down in Peace and Reſt in it, yet can they not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein, ſeeing they have refuſed, rejected, done deſpite unto, and what they can, trampled upon that bleſſed Gift which God hath given to lead thereinto. Again, the Diſciples of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid unto him,</hi> Declare unto us the Parable of the Tares of the Field; <hi>he anſwered and ſaid unto them,</hi> He that ſoweth the good Seed is the Son of man; the Field is the World; the good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47409:33"/>
the Wicked, the Enemy that ſowed them is the Devil; the Harveſt is the end of the World, the Reapers are the Angels. <hi>Again, Chriſt ſpake a Parable, and ſaid,</hi> Behold a Sower went forth to Sow, and when he ſowed, ſome Seeds fell by the High-way ſide, and the Fowls came and devoured them up; ſome fell upon Stony places, where they had not much Earth, and forth-with they ſprang up; but becauſe they had not deepneſs of Earth, when the Sun was up they were ſcorched, and becauſe they had not Root they withered away, and ſome fell among Thorns, and they ſprung up and choaked them; but others fell in good Ground, and brought forth Fruit, ſome an hundred Fold, ſome ſixty Fold, ſome thirty Fold. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid,</hi> Hear ye therefore the Parable of the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart; this is he which received Seed by the way ſide: but he that received the Seed into Stony places, the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it, yet hath he not Root in himſelf, but dureth for a while; for when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation or Perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, by and by he is offended; he alſo that received Seed among the Thorns, is he that heareth the Word, and the cares of this World, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Riches choak the Word, and he becometh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But he that received the Seed into the good Ground, is he that in an honeſt and good Heart, having heard the Word, keeps it, and brings forth Fruit with patience; <hi>ſee</hi> Matth. <hi>1.</hi> Luke <hi>8. 15. Again,</hi> The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net that was caſt into the Sea, which when it was full they drew to Shore, and gathered the good into Veſſels, but caſt the bad away; ſo ſhall it be at the end of the World, the Angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the Wicked from among the Juſt, and ſhall caſt them into the Furnace of Fire, there ſhall be Weeping, and Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth. <hi>Again, Jeſus ſpake a Parable, and ſaid,</hi> A certain man made a great Supper, &amp;c. and ſent his Servant at Supper-time, to ſay to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready: and they all with one conſent began to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; the firſt ſaid unto him, I have bought a piece of Ground, I muſt needs go and ſee it, I pray thee have me excuſed; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſaid, I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, I go to prove them, I pray thee have me excuſed; and another ſaid, I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come, &amp;c. And he ſaid, that none of thoſe which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper; <hi>ſee</hi> Luke <hi>14. 16. to the 24. verſe.

            </p>
            <p>Note Reader, the Seed that is ſown in ALL theſe ſeveral ſorts of Ground is of ONE and the SAME Nature (to wit, good) as it is written. The Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>Say not in thy Heart, Who ſhall aſcend up to Heaven, that is, to fetch Chriſt from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to bring Chriſt up again from the Dead, or who ſhall go beyond the Sea to fetch the Word unto us, that we may hear it and do it, but what ſaith it, The word is</hi> NIGH THEE, <hi>even in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth, that thou mayſt do it;</hi> ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. This good Seed is ſown on all theſe ſeveral ſorts of Grounds, for ONE and the ſame cauſe or end, even that it might take deep Root in all, and bring forth Fruit in all: and the Lord God in mercy to all Men and Women, doth put them in a condition &amp; give them a time, in which it is poſſible for this Word, the good Seed to take deep Root in their Hearts; and to bring forth Fruit INALL, ſome thirty, ſome ſixty, ſome an hundred Fold: He can as he hath promiſed, take away the Stony Heart, and renew a right Spirit and Mind. God makes none of theſe Grounds evil or bad, but the Devil doth it; but God can change them from evil or bad into the good; he can cut them out of the wild Olive, and plant them in Chriſt the true Vine. But it is not wholly impoſſible that men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, through their Self-willfulneſs, Sloathfulneſs, Negligence, Preſumption and Careleſneſs may turn away their Hearts and Minds from the Voice of the living powerful Word of God, and ſo give up their Hearts, Minds and Ears to the Devil, who led <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> into Sin againſt God; they were placed in the Paradiſe of God, in the likeneſs of God (which is Holineſs and Purity) it was poſſible that they might have ſtood in that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47409:34"/>
glorious ſtate, wherein God ſet them; but it was NOT im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they could fall from that ſtate. God cannot fall or change, in God and Chriſt ONLY is infallibility, that which is the preſervation of Men and Angels from falling, or failing of their duty to God and Men, is the Word and Power of God, and of Chriſt, but they that turn away their Minds, Hearts and Ears from the powerful Word of God manifeſt in their Hearts: Satan the EVIL Seeds-man, ſows his evil Seed of Sin and Wickedneſs in their Hearts, to wit, Unbelief, the fear of Perſecution, the cares of this Life, and the deceitfulneſs of Riches, Luſt of the Fleſh, Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life; yea, in many, Idolatry, Envy, Whoredoms, and many other Evils, ſo as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that ſoweth and begetteth this Generation of Evil-doers,</hi> and nurſeth them up, and maketh them ſtrong to do Wickedneſs, <hi>is the Devil.</hi> Chriſt ſaid to ſuch, <hi>You are of your Father the Devil; for the Luſts of your Father you'l do; he was a Murtherer and a Lyar from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. The Devil and his Generation are NOT the Elect, but the Reprobates; the Devil, or his Seed, or Generation, CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOT enter the Kingdom of Heaven, though they ſtrive never ſo much; but the Lake of Fire is the place appointed for them, there to be tormented, as it is written. But Chriſt and his Seed, and Generation, who are Born again, not of corruptible Seed, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God, of the incorruptible Seed, which liveth and abideth forever; theſe are the Elect of God, who enter into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and are in ſafety, Peace and Reſt with him: Here are the ſtates of Election and Reprobation, Scripturally and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally witneſſed unto. Again, Jeſus ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>The time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God Service.</hi> Note, theſe are ungodly Thoughts, and the kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Diſciples of Jeſus are ungodly Actions; the Devil (NOT GOD) is the Author of theſe Thoughts and Actions: as Chriſt ſaid unto the Murthering <hi>Jews,</hi> who betrayed and murthered him, <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil; he was a Lyar and a Murtherer from the beginning.</hi> Now thoſe who thought they did God ſervice in killing the Diſciples of Chriſt, they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47409:35"/>
thought (no doubt) this their work of Murther, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them acceptable with God, and ſo to have admittance to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God: But herein the Devil, the old Deceiver, had greatly befooled them, and bewitch'd them, toxecated them, and made them mad. The holy man of God told the Murthering <hi>Jews, how their Fathers Perſecuted the Prophets, and ſlew them which ſhewed before the coming of the Juſt one, of whom ye have been now the Betrayers and Murtherers;</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51, 52. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever hateth his Brother is a Murtherer; and ye know that no Murtherer hath eternal Life abiding in him;</hi> ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. 15.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, that the Apoſtle in the holy Ghoſt, chargeth him that hateth his Brother to be a Murtherer; therefore keep out of Hated, and love thine Enemy, as Chriſt commands, and if thou ſo do, thou wilt not Hate and Murther thy Friends, it being truly ſo, that Hatred is Murther in the ſight of God; though he that hateth, do not, or cannot reach to kill him that he hates; then actually to kill the Prophets of God, and Diſciples of Chriſt, is Murther in the higheſt degree, and is a great breach of the holy Law of God, which commands expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther:</hi> Which good, and holy, and ſtanding Law of God, Chriſt came not to abrogate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but to fulfill, as he ſaid; who ſaid, <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you;</hi> and alſo ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever you would that men ſhould do unto you, do you even ſo unto them.</hi> Bleſſed are all they who do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have right to the Tree of Life, and to enter into the Kingdom of God, therein to reſt in Joy and Peace for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: but the Unbelievers, Murtherers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death; ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 18. and 22. 14, 15. Again, The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto the Believers in Chriſt, <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye, for the Spirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you, &amp;c. but let none of you ſuffer as a Murtherer, or as a Thief, &amp;c. yet if any man ſuffer as a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf;</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16.</p>

               <hi>Note Reader, here the Apoſtle plainly ſhews, that he that is a Murtherer, &amp;c. is not a</hi> Chriſtian; <hi>and if he ſuffer for his Murther, he ſuffers not as a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>but as a great Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the holy Law of God given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>and not only ſo, but alſo a breaker of the glorious and ſpiritual Law of Chriſt, which commands and leads to love Enemies, as I have ſhewed before.

The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> by the holy Ghoſt ſaid, <hi>By Faith</hi> Iſaac <hi>bleſſed</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>concerning things to come;</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 20. By this it appeareth that God did not hate <hi>Eſau</hi> in the Womb, before he was Born; for if he had then hated him, or before he had done Evil, how could <hi>Iſaac</hi> have bleſſed him in that Faith which God gave him? For it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>Iſaac</hi> in that Faith which is the gift of God, to oppoſe God's purpoſe concerning <hi>Eſau.</hi> For though in the words that <hi>Iſaac</hi> uttered in the bleſſing of <hi>Jucob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> he tells <hi>Eſau</hi> that he ſhall ſerve his Brother; yet he doth not tell <hi>Eſau</hi> he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be damned before he was Born, nor yet that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in the Womb. I would have all thoſe conſider of theſe things, who have ſo hard &amp; wrong thoughts of God, as to believe that he hated <hi>Eſau</hi> in his Mothers Womb, or ordained him to be eternally damned before he was Born. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.

               <hi>we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead, and that he dyed for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them, and roſe again: wherefore henceforth know we no man after the Fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, though we have known Chriſt after the Fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more: Therefore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature, old things are paſt away, behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new, and all things are of God,</hi> &amp;c. ſee verſ. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, firſt that under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, every one muſt receive a reward according to their Deeds, whether they be good or bad, as the Apoſtle in the holy Ghoſt, here and elſe-where ſaith, and as Chriſt ſaith, as I have ſhewed before. Secondly, note that the Apoſtles did truly judge that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all; and that thoſe that live, might not live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but unto Chriſt that dyed for them and roſe again; ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we</hi> NO <hi>man after the Fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the Fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him</hi> NO MORE; <hi>therefore if any man be</hi> IN <hi>Chriſt, he is a new Creature, old things are paſt away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> ALL <hi>things are become new, and all things are of God,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>Note Reader, here the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only ſpeak his own Belief and Senſe concerning the Death of Chriſt, but alſo the belief <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chriſt preached unto his Diſciples, ſaying,</hi> Let your Light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your <hi>GOOD WORKS,</hi> and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Mat. 5. 14. The Apoſtle who preached down the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy works of the Law, ſaid,</hi> We are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto <hi>GOOD WORKS,</hi> which God before ordained that we ſhould walk <hi>IN THEM,</hi> Epheſ. <hi>2. 10. The Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>ſaith,</hi> Faith without Works <hi>IS DEAD,</hi> being alone, as the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit is dead, ſo Faith without Works is dead alſo. Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by Faith only. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> believed, and it was counted to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and he was called the Friend of God: Theſe are not the ſhadowy Works of the Law, by which no Fleſh can be juſtified in the ſight of God; but theſe are the ſubſtantial Works of the Goſpel, wrought in &amp; through Chriſt, in all his true and real Diſciples, <hi>ſee Ja. 2. 17. to the end. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prayed for the</hi> Hebrews <hi>or</hi> Jews, <hi>ſaying,</hi> The God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep; through the Blood of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant make you <hi>PERFECT</hi> in every good Work <hi>TO DO HIS WILL,</hi> working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be Glory forever and ever, Amen. <hi>Heb. 13. 20, 21.</hi>
               </note>and ſence of the reſt of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in this weighty matter, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his fore-going words, that their belief, judgment and ſpiritual ſence was, that Chriſt dyed for all, and that all were dead, as he ſaith. Here the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews plainly that it was his, and his Brethrens belief; firſt that Chriſt dyed for all; ſecondly, that the end of his offering up himſelf, and his dying for all,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47409:37"/>
was that all might live through him; thirdly, that they ſhould NOT henceforth live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Sin and Wickedneſs, but unto him that dyed for them, and roſe again; that as he was raiſed from the Dead by (the Power) &amp; Glory of the Father; ſo they might walk in newneſs of Life, in Righteouſneſs, Holineſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. For this was &amp; is the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> mark; by this the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of Old knew one another to be the REAL Members of the Church, or Body of Chriſt; and by this mark do the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> know one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther NOW; and not by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of God &amp; Chriſt in words ONLY. After our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was put to Death accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh, and riſen again, and aſcended, the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> KNOWLEDGE of him was not after the Fleſh, but in, or after the Spirit; though they had once known him after the Fleſh, yet from THIS knowledge of him they ceaſed; <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>henceforth know we him no more.</hi> Their knowledge of him from THENCEFORTH being in the Spirit, who by his ſpiritual BAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISM with the holy Ghoſt and FIRE, purged their Conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God in newneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life; theſe were of Old,

&amp; ſuch now are the living Branches in Chriſt, the living Vine, they are NEW Creatures in him, created in him and through him unto good Works, which God before ordained that we ſhould walk in them; the OLD ſinful Works &amp; Luſts of the Fleſh are put off, &amp; paſt away, all things are become new, &amp; are of God, as he ſaith; this is the Birth that is born of God; this is the <hi>Jacob</hi> that ſupplants &amp; overcomes the Prophane Birth of the Fleſh; this is the Birth that wreſtleth with God like a Prince, for the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and obtains it; this is the Birth that is Elect of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe ſpiritually born Children, are the Generation of the Juſt, theſe are the Righteous Nation, which keepeth the Truth; theſe are they who are waſhed from all Filthineſs of the Fleſh &amp; Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God, as the Apoſtle exhorted: But thoſe who do profeſs God &amp; Chriſt in Words, but DENY both God and Chriſt in WORKS, calling upon God with their Mouthes and Lips, but their Hearts are afar off, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in their ſins, and growing up in them more and more, taking pleaſure in them, and pleading a neceſſity to continue in them all the dayes they live upon Earth, or until they go to the Grave; theſe, as Chriſt ſaid (of ſuch) <hi>are of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, and the Luſts of their Father they will do, he was a Lyar and a Murtherer,</hi> &amp;c. theſe that repent not, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not their ſins, but grow up in them, as afore-ſaid, theſe are the TARES (ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39, 40.) <hi>he that ſows them is the Devil,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid: theſe are the REPROBATES; this Birth of the Serpents Seed is the Prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> which God Hates; this Birth is Curſed in its firſt Conception, in its Youth and in its Old Age.

Too like theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> are many Teachers &amp; high Profeſſors of Chriſt (in Words) in our Age, who though they will talk much of Chriſt, as he was born, and dyed, and roſe again accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, yet can they not endure to hear him preached as he preached himſelf, and as the holy Apoſtles preached him (to wit) the Light of the World, the true Light which lighteth every one that cometh into the World: This is the Stone which all the Builders do reject and ſet at nought, who build up their VAIN Religions, Faiths and Worſhips in the Serpentine Earthly Deviliſh Wiſdom, in Murther, Cruelty, Oppreſſion and Idolatry; but when this Stone falls on them in Judgment, it will grind them all to Powder; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 24. O Bleſſed will all they be who come unto and believe in this Living Stone; their hard Hearts ſhall be broken by it, and made ſoft and tender, and thereby be made fit to enter into the Kingdom of God, into which nothing that is Unclean can enter; and their ſins that are paſt, though they be many, God will freely Pardon, Remit and Forgive them in his tender Mercy and forbearance, in the Name (and Power) of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all,</hi> as ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4, 6. Again, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>He commanded us to Preach unto the People,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47409:41"/>
               <hi>and to Teſtifie, that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead; to him all the Prophets gave witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins;</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42, 43. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 28.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, The Command which the Apoſtles received from Chriſt concerning Remiſſion of ſins, it was that they ſhould preach the Remiſſion or Forgivneſs of the ſins that were PAST; they did NOT receive Command from Chriſt to preach unto people, that they muſt continue in ſin all their Dayes; NEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER did he Command them to preach, that he had paid the DEBT for all ſins paſt, PRESENT and to COME; NO, he nor his Apoſtles never preached this Doctrine; this Doctrine proceeds from him whoſe Kingdom ſtands in Sin, who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lyes, who firſt LEADS people into ſin, &amp; then tells them that they can NEVER come out of it while they are on this ſide the Grave, and to encourage and embolden them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin all their dayes; HE tells them Chriſt has paid the DEBT for it ALL; and he tells them that God ſees no ſin in them, the Debt being paid for all, &amp;c. So tells them that they are the Elect, and therefore cannot totally fall, &amp;c. Its greatly to be Lamented, that many do GIVE UP themſelves to believe theſe his Lyes, to their own Ruin and Deſtruction. We do ſay, that NOT only the ſins, which Man and Woman doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in their Dark, Unbelieving State is forgiven when they come to believe &amp; repent; but ALSO thoſe who through unwatchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, negligence fall into ſome ſin, after they have believed and Repented, if THEY find a place of Repentance &amp; ſo Forgivneſs; this forgiveneſs alſo is in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but we do utterly DENY that God or Chriſt doth WILL or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that any Man or Woman ſhould live in ſin ALL their DAYES upon Earth: And thoſe who do continue in ſin all their dayes, who Repent not, who Forſake not, this their ſin will ſink them into the Pit of Everlaſting Deſtruction, where there is Weeping and Wailing and Gnaſhing of Teeth, and when they are THERE, they will ſee how the Devil hath deceived and cheated them, and then they will know that Chriſt hath NOT paid the Debt for all their ſins paſt, preſent and to come, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47409:41"/>
they ſhall know he hath not paid the Debt for their ſins which they do never Repent of; for which they muſt ſuffer Vengeance of Eternal Fire, as a juſt Reward from the Hand of the Lord God, who ſaid, <hi>Be ye Holy for I the Lord your God am Holy.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>JEſus Chriſt ſaid unto the Unbelieving</hi> Jews, Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>(or,</hi> ye ſearch the Scriptures) for in them you think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which teſtifie of me, and YE will NOT come to me that ye might have Life, <hi>John 5. 39, 40.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note Reader, Chriſt told them not that they COULD NOT come unto him, but told them that they WOULD NOT come unto him; ſo their NOT coming unto him, Chriſt doth not place upon the fore-ordination or appointment of God, but he placeth it upon their CORRUPT SELF-WILL; for as it is before expreſſed (in this Book) <hi>God's will is that all Men might come to the Knowledge of the Truth and be SAVED:</hi> This is a Goſpel Truth, ſpoken by the holy Apoſtle, as he was moved by the holy Ghoſt. Well ſaid the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, the Scripture came not in Old Time by the Will of Man, but holy men of God gave them forth as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt</hi> (or Spirit) the holy <hi>Scriptures are things of God.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man,</hi> SAVE <hi>the Spirit of a man, which is in him? even ſo the things of God know no man, but the Spirit of God; but that Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11. There is two weighty things to be conſidered and underſtood from the afore-ſaid Words of Chriſt, the one I have ſaid ſomething to, Namely, that it was NOT the Fore-appointment or Decree of God, which HIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRED thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> from coming to Chriſt, but their own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt WILL, &amp;c. for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father; he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him,</hi> John 5. 23. Chriſt the Son of God, ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the World;</hi> [Mark that] he is not the Light of the Saints and true Believers ONLY (for he ſaid unto the Saints, <hi>Ye are not of the World,</hi> &amp;c.)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47409:42"/>
but he is the Light of the World that lieth in Wickedneſs; by his Light in their Conſciences, he doth convince them of their ſins and wickedneſs. Now all that honour the Son, according to the Will of the Father, they do believe this is Doctrine, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o do believe in the Light, where-with he has enlightned them, who is the true Light that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enlighteneth every one that cometh into the World, according to <hi>John.</hi> 1. 9. he ſaid, <hi>Believe in the Light, that ye may be Children of the Light: He taſted Death for every man,</hi> as ſaith the holy Scripture: <hi>He is a Propitiation, not for our ſins only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John;</hi> as the Will of God is that all men ſhould believe in the Father, ſo his Will is that all men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Son, and ſo in believing and obeying, both honour the Father and the Son. The ſecond thing which I may ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to upon the foreſaid words of Chriſt, concerning the grand Miſtake of thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not come to Chriſt; their Miſtake was, that they thought to have Eternal Life in the Scriptures; for though the Scripture teſtifies of him (as he ſaith) yet the Scripture doth NO where ſay that Eternal Life is IN THEM, but they do teſtifie, that Life is in HIM: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GREAT was their Error, who thought to have Eternal Life where it was not to be had; and the ſame Error ſome are fallen into, in our day, and their Error in this weighty matter is greatly to be LAMENTED; and my Soul, with many more do greatly, deſire that out of this great Miſtake they may be delivered. There are two great EXTREAMS which many run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to concerning the holy Scriptures (in this our day) the one is that which I have ſpoken to already, which IS in thoſe who think to have Eternal Life in the Scriptures, where it is not to be FOUND, but IN Chriſt (as I ſaid before) the other Extream is run into by Prophane perſons, who do not value them and eſteem them as they are truly worthy, but in their Pride and Preſumption greatly ſlight them, yet make EVIL uſe of them many times in wreſting of them to uphold and juſtifie themſelves in their Ranteriſm and Debauched Wicked Converſations; the State alſo of the latter is greatly to be Lamented, and it is the earneſt deſire of my Soul with many more, that thoſe might
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47409:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come to Unfeigned Repentance for this their great EVIL, that ſo they might come to a true and godly uſe &amp; Eſteem of the holy Scriptures, and ſo to have profit by them, and comfort in them, as the true Believers had in Primitive Times, and ſuch now have, Glory to the Lord God for the ſame; it is the Spirit (or Light) of Truth, which leads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the true Believers into all Truth, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the World of ſin) that giveth a right Underſtanding, and leadeth to a right uſe of the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>es this Spirit was mans Guide before the Scriptures were written, by it men were made holy, before they gave forth the holy Scriptures; this is the Key which openeth them and leadeth to a right uſe and application of them; but they whoſe Minds are gone ASTRAY from this Spirit who have not, &amp; do not LEARN of it; thoſe do WREST the Scriptures to their own Deſtruction, as ſome did in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Dayes, againſt whom he teſtified; Chriſt told ſome amongſt the earthy Wiſe <hi>Jews, Ye neither know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nor the Power of God;</hi> yet thoſe were great Talkers of them; and even as they knew them not, not owning the Key that openeth them, ſo many in our day knoweth them NOT, becauſe they believe not in the Spirit of Truth, which ONLY openeth them.</p>

            <p>Reader, ſee how theſe holy men of God agree in their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in this weighty matter: theſe holy men did abide in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, they by virtue of his divine ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dwelling in them, were ſtrengthned and enabled in their Lives and Converſations to follow that holy Example which he gave them in the dayes of his Fleſh, who went about doing Good, who never did Evil; and though they had ſinned, he redeemed them from it, and from the Devil the Author or Original of it. And ſo many came to behold their good Converſation in Chriſt, COUPLED WITH FEAR, as the Apoſtle exhorteth; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We know that whoſoever is Born of God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> NOT—<hi>And we know that we are of God, and the whole World lieth</hi> IN WICKEDNESS. <hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath give us an underſtanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; this is the true God and Life eternal. Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, keep your ſelves from Idols, Amen.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20, 21. Here the Apoſtle ſhews plainly who are true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> [and who are not] the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are in Chriſt, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them out of the bondage of Corruption, into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty of the Sons and Daughters of God; and ſuch have the Spirit of Chriſt bearing witneſs with (or unto) their Spirits that they are the Children of God [according to the promiſe of God] <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 21. And they are NOT TRUE <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who Lye, or continue all their dayes in Sin and Wickedneſs; theſe are the World, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith.

            <p>Reader, there are ſeveral things worthy of thy ſerious and weighty Conſideration, in theſe words of the holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> the firſt is, that the Elders of the Church of God and Chriſt did and do (as Inſtruments in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od's Hand, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring (that is, Serving) in his own Spirit and Power) feed the Flock of God and Chriſt: Secondly, That they did and do take the over-ſight of the Flock, not by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47409:44"/>
but willingly: God makes them willing by his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, they are NOT made willing by Gold or Silver, Corn or Cattel, or any earthly thing, neither do they AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECT Titles of Elderſhip in Pride or Vain Glory; but the Falſe Teachers and Elders are made willing to Preach for Gold and Slver, Corn and Cattel, and Earthly things; &amp; how ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Titles &amp; Earthly things more then the true Elders WORK is known to God, and it is diſcerned by many in this Morning of his heavenly Day, which is dawned in this our Age, glory to the Lord God for the ſame: Such who feed with the Fat, and cloath with the Wooll, and make a PREY upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are in <hi>Balaams</hi> Way and Error, who covet the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs; yea, many in <hi>Cains</hi> way, in Envy, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting about theſe things, ſome even to Death; and for theſe things they ſtrive one againſt another; the ſtrife is, who ſhall have the fatteſt Benefice. The TRUE Elders and Miniſters did not, nor do not take the overſight of the flock of God for FIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY LUCRE, but of a ready mind, which God begetteth in them by his good Spirit; FILTHY Lucre is Earthly gain ILL GOTTEN. Chriſt Jeſus commanded his Diſciples, (whom he made Elders, to watch over his Church) ſaying, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> Thoſe who eſteem themſelves Chriſts Miniſters, yet take the over-ſight of their Flocks, and watch over them, and teach them for Gold, Silver, Corn, Hay, &amp;c. this their Gain is ungodly, it is Ill gotten, becauſe in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it they break Chriſts Command (whoſe Servants they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be) and in ſo doing they greatly diſhonour him: Yet ſtill the Miniſters of Chriſt have power to eat ſuch as is ſet before them freely, but not to force or compel by Perſecution thoſe who did or do receive Spiritual things from them (the Spirit of God makes ſuch willing, there is no uſe for outward Force and Perſecution in this concern) ſo then to be ſure they had not power by outward Force to compel thoſe who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor receive their Teſtimony, or to pay them for preaching, though the true Apoſtles and Elders had power to eat, &amp;c. and where they did ſow Spiritual things to reap Carnal, yet they laboured with their own hands, that they might make the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47409:44"/>
without charge; ſo far were they from deſiring or receiving any outward thing for preaching from Unbelievers, that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with their own hands that they might not be chargeable to the Believers; No, the Miniſters and Elders who were and are made by Chriſt, were and are men of nobbler Spirits then to do ſo. The true Elders and Miniſters were not, nor are not Lords over God's Heritage, but were and are good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples, and true Servants to the Flock; And their Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was and is, to walk as they had and have them for Enſamples, Glory to the Lord for the ſame.</p>
            <p>The faithful Elder and Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> by the holy Ghoſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Be thou an Example of the Believers, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity—Neglect not the Gift that is in thee, &amp;c. take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto the Doctrine, continue in them; for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt ſave both thy ſelf, and them that hear thee;</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. to the end. Again, Chap. 5. 22. <hi>Lay Hand ſuddenly on NO man, neither be partaker of other mens Sins;</hi> KEEP <hi>thy ſelf</hi> PURE, &amp;c. They are bleſſed, who follow the bleſſed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his holy Apoſtles and the Elders made by him, who abide in his Doctrine, and in the Faith which he is the Author and Finiſher of, and in the love which reacheth to all People, both Friends and Enemies; which Love thinketh no Evil, neither doth any Wrong or Evil; which Love is ſtronger than Death, it is not puffed up, it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have it ſelf unſeemly: <hi>This Love is the fulfilling of the holy Law of God,</hi> as ſaith the holy Apoſtle. All who keep therein are PLEASANT to the Lord, and honoured by him with a truly tendred Heart, and lowly mind, and with the pure Patience (in and through all Tribulation, Trials and Affliction, which cometh upon them for Chriſt's ſake) in which they poſſeſs their Souls in peace and quietneſs, being kept by the mighty Power of God, through the precious Faith and Love which is ſhed abroad in them, BY and in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him ought himſelf alſo to walk even as he walked;</hi> ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6.</p>

            <p>J. B. Though all the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy were and are as filthy Rags; yet the Righteouſneſs of the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (the Church in God, made of Living Stones choſen and precious) are not as filthy Rags: It were horrible

Blaſphemy to ſay ſo, for Chriſt is the Righteouſneſs of the true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as ſaith the holy Apoſtle, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Ieſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption;</hi> ſee 1 Cor. 1. 30.</p>
            <p>J. B. Take notice of this, Chriſt was and is in the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> made of God unto them Wiſdom, which Wiſdom did and doth lead them out of ſin, which the Wiſdom of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hath led into; ſo Chriſt the Power and Wiſdom of God, who leads them out of Unrighteouſneſs (which is Sin) he did and doth become THEIR Righteouſneſs, who Redeemeth and Sanctifieth them. And this is the Righteouſneſs which we (the People of God called <hi>Quakers)</hi> own, ſtand and Plead for, and NO OTHER: This is the Righteouſneſs which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to be found in, and not in his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was of the Law, which he did ſometime hold up in oppoſition to Chriſt the Subſtance, as may be ſeen at large in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap. 3. The ſame Apoſtle ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in their Apoſtacy (thus) <hi>For they being Ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, and going about to Eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; for Chriſt is the end of the Law, for Righteouſneſs ſake to every one that believes,</hi> Rom. 10. 3, 4. Chriſt offered up himſelf through the Eternal Spirit, as a Lamb without Spot and Blemiſh, who by offering up himſelf once for all, put an End to the <hi>Jews</hi> Offerings of Lambs, the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and all the reſt of their Carnal Shadowy Ordinances, which could not take away Sin, nor make the Comers thereunto Perfect, as appertaining to the Conſcience.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47409:48"/>
upon and judged what they did to be Righteous, and this the Apoſtle eſteems their own Righteouſneſs, &amp; ſo they did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Righteouſneſs of God, (WHICH IS CHRIST) but ſtumbled at the ſtumbling Stone, as its written: And TOO like theſe are many of the Profeſſors of our Times, who hold up thoſe JEWISH Shadows (which never were a Command to us <hi>Gentiles)</hi> in Oppoſition to Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the World, and he that follows me ſhall not walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but have the Light of Life:</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Believe in the Light that you may be the Children of the Light.</hi> Now as concerning Chriſts putting an End to the Work of the Law, we do NOT believe that Chriſt has put an end to the Command of God, who ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart; and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf: Thou ſhalt do no Murther: Thou ſhalt not Steal, nor Covet any thing that is thy Neighbours: Thou ſhalt not bear Falſe Witneſs, nor remove the Antient Land-mark,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>Now as to J. B's Charge,</hi> That we hold forth and own, that Perfection in degree is attainable in this Life.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, The Word <hi>Degree</hi> concerning <hi>Perfection,</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Word, nor did I ever read it in the Scriptures of Truth, as uſed by him concerning <hi>Perfection.</hi> But this word <hi>Degree</hi> he hath thruſt into his Charge againſt us, thinking (no doubt) thereby to make it the more ſtrong; but all his labour is in vain: He doth not declare what he meaneth by the word DEGREE; but if by <hi>Degree</hi> he mean a <hi>freedom from acting or committing Sin,</hi> ſuch a Perfection we do believe is attainable in this Life, by and through the mighty working of God and Chriſt in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and this is according to the command of God &amp; Chriſt, &amp; the Doctrine and Experience of the holy Apoſtles: But if by the word <hi>Degree,</hi> J. B. mean a Perfection of Glory in the HIGHEST attainment of Glory that can EVER be enjoyed, then we DEEM that ſuch a Perfection is attainable in this Life, or while we dwell here upon Earth: For WE are of the ſame Faith the holy Apoſtle was of, who when he was near to depart out of this World, ſaid, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have kept the Faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>J. B. hath taken upon him to interpret the Apoſtle</hi> John's <hi>words, who ſaith,</hi> Whoſoever is Born of God doth not commit Sin; he cannot Sin, &amp;c. <hi>J.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What Confuſion, Falſneſs and Nonſence is this, to ſay that he who commits Sin doth not practiſe Sin; this is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible abuſe, and wreſting the holy Scriptures, which God will bring him to Judgment for: and if he do not Repent, and ceaſe from ſuch Ungodly ſilly work as this, he will bring Deſtruction upon himſelf. As I do underſtand this J. B. is one of that ſort of men, who do in their Confeſſions tell the Lord God, that <hi>they do Sin in their moſt holy Duties.</hi> Now if their moſt holy Duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have Sin in them, then there is Sin in all thoſe other things, which they call Duties, and conſequently in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they do not account Holy Duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo they make it their Practice to Sin; and ſo according to his own Argument <hi>Such who make it their Practice to Sin, are not born of God:</hi> But to ſpeak his mind more fully, I do apprehend his meaning is, that <hi>the Children of God do not commit ſo much Sin, as the Children of the Devil do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that is Born of God, doth not commit Sin;</hi> he alſo ſaith, <hi>He that commits Sin is of the Devil.</hi> In the next verſe he ſaith, <hi>In this is the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 10. J. B. I ask thee, doſt not thou believe that God is GREATER then the Devil? why then muſt Sin needs be in thoſe who are Born of God? (as thou wouldſt have it) Oh that thou ſaw thy Blaſphemy herein! it would ſurely make thee aſhamed and bring Sorrow upon thee: But if in thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thoſe whom God BEGETS, who are BORN of him, muſt commit Sin, and live in it all their dayes, and Sin in their moſt Holy Duties. I ask, what DIFFERENCE doſt thou put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God's Children, and the Devil's Children whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, and who are Born of him; for the Devil hath a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whom he is the Father, as Chriſt ſaid (ſee <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47409:49"/>
For we believe that he that is Born of God is REGENERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED, that is, waſhed and cleanſed through the virtue of the holy Spirit of Chriſt, which is ſhed abroad abundantly in the Hearts &amp; Souls of the true Believers; &amp; by virtue of this, growing up in it, as the Branches in the living Vine are they redeemed out of the ACT of Sin, and have dominion given them in and by Chriſt over IT, and the Devil who is the Author of it; and ſuch can ſay, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the World</hi> (to wit) <hi>the Wicked,</hi> BY WHOM <hi>we overcome them;</hi> and ſuch can ſay as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Of my ſelf I can do nothing, but I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me;</hi> and ſuch can ſay, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We are</hi> CONQUERORS, <hi>and more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors through him that hath loved us;</hi> and ſuch do know Satan BRUISED under their Feet, BY CHRIST the bleſſed Seed, whom God promiſed ſhould bruiſe his HEAD: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle told the Believers in Chriſt, <hi>That God whom they waited for ſhould ſuddainly come, and bruiſe Satan under their</hi> FEET. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me; and the Life that I</hi> NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH, <hi>it is by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> [Mark] this Life was not a Life in Sin; for Faith in the Son of God gives Victory over Sin and the Devil, that is the author of it, Rom. 6. 2, 7. and the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin live any longer therein</hi>—and he ſaid, <hi>He that is dead is freed from Sin.</hi> And he alſo ſpeaks in one of his Epiſtles of <hi>dying daily;</hi> and in the aforeſaid Chapter ſayes, <hi>I am dead with Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. So he knew a time of diyng unto Sin, after his underſtanding was opened to ſee the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it, &amp; ſo dying gradually to it, he came to be dead to it, and ſo he ſaid (as before) <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities,</hi> Acts 3. 26. Mark J. B. thus God ſent his Son to bleſs People, in turning them from their Iniquities; all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is Sin, &amp; all Sin is of the Devil: ſo THEY who are turned from Sin, which is the Devil's work, are under the Bleſſing: but they that continue in Sin to the end of their dayes, who Repent not, who forſake not, they are under the Curſe.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47409:50"/>
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin, is the Servant of Sin,</hi> John 8. 34. And the Apoſtle exhorted, ſaying, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you,</hi> James 4. 7. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> wrote to the Young-men, ſaying, <hi>Ye are ſtrong, the word of God abides in you, ye have overcome the wicked One.</hi> Now mark J. B. theſe Young men were ſtrong, the Word or Seed of God did abide in them, and by his virtue and ſtrength they had overcome the wicked One, as he ſaith; and he wrote unto the Fathers, ſaying, <hi>You have known him that is from the beginning.</hi> He doth charge NEITHER of theſe with the act of Sin, or committing of Sin at that TIME, though they had all ſinned; for ſaith he, <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned, we make him a Lyar, and his Word is not in us.</hi> But theſe had CEASED from Sin, according to the command of the Lord, who ſaid, <hi>Cleanſe your Hands, ye Sinners, and purifie your Hearts ye double-minded,</hi> &amp;c. But to the Little Children he ſaid, <hi>I write unto you Little Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your Sins are forgiven you for his Name-ſake;</hi> but alſo ſaid, <hi>Little Children, theſe things I write unto you, that ye Sin not.</hi> Shewing hereby that though then all Sin was not vanquiſh't or overcome in them, yet they were to wait to grow up into Chriſt, and in him to Reign over it, as the Fathers and Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did.</p>
            <p>J. B. here take notice <hi>John</hi> writes to three ſtates, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of which he named his little Children, who though they had a love to him, and the Teſtimony born by him, yet were they not eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, over all Sin and the Devil, the author of it, as the Aged and ſtrong in Chriſt were. And as for <hi>John's</hi> ſaying, <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves.</hi> I ſay and affirm, that his ſo ſaying doth no more prove him an actual ſinner at that TIME, then the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his ſaying, <hi>With the Tongue we curſe men,</hi> proves <hi>James</hi> a Curſer of men at that time, which is juſt no proof at all: For <hi>Iames</hi> writes to the twelve Tribes ſcattered, many of whom were wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Tongued, and Curſers, as he ſaid; and he being a natural <hi>Jew,</hi> who ſprung from the Loins of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as did all the <hi>Jews;</hi> in that ſence he called them Brethren, but he was then no Curſer, but abode in the Doctrine of his Maſter, who ſaid, <hi>Bleſs</hi>

               <hi>them that Curſe you:</hi> And <hi>Iames</hi> ſaid, <hi>That mans Religion is Vain that hath not a Bridle to his Tongue.</hi> And if <hi>James</hi> had been a Curſer at that time, his own Religion had been VAIN, and he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Chriſt &amp; by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo for a Hypocrite, for judging that in them which HE ACTED HIMSELF, but he was a holy Man of God and lived in the Poſſeſſion of the Good he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them unto, and out of the bad he reproved them for—So <hi>John</hi> in the ſame way and manner ſpeaking in condeſcention, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thoſe his little Children to have ſome relation to him, he being a faithful Labourer and traveller for their converſion, ſaith (with reſpect to them) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c. John</hi> ſaith, <hi>that which we have heard and ſeen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you, that you alſo may have fellowſhip with us, and truly our fellowſhip IS with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt: This then is the Meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all: if we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we Lye, and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, then have we fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin,</hi> 1 John 1.</p>
            <p>J. B. Here take notice <hi>John,</hi> had fellowſhip with the Father and Son, and he wrote to the little Children and others, <hi>That they might have fellowſhip with him,</hi> &amp;c. which none can have when and while they are committing ſin, which is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils work (but may when they have repented and forſaken it.) Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Ye</hi> CANNOT <hi>ſerve</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>ye muſt forſake the one &amp; cleave unto the other.</hi> This <hi>Mammon</hi> ſignifies <hi>Earthly Riches,</hi> and if man cannot ſerve God and them at one and the ſame time (that is) ſet them up as Idols in his Heart, then to be SURE Man cannot ſerve God and the Devil both at one time; for Light has no Communion with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor Chriſt with <hi>Belial,</hi> nor the Temple of God with Idols. Now the words of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> are as follow, <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning; for this purpoſe was the Son of God made manifeſt, that he might Deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi> Theſe words we

and all who believe in the Spiritual and Divine Light of Chriſt, which ſheweth them their ſins, and PATIENTLY wait THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IN, they will ſee this Work wrought in order to their Salvation; though they firſt ſow in Tears, they ſhall certainly afterwards reap in Joy, and though their Temptations, Troubles and Sorrows may be many, God will certainly deliver them out of them all.</p>
            <p>J. B. As for thy interpretation of <hi>John</hi>'s Words (that is) <hi>He that is born of God doth not commit Sin:</hi> It is Unſcriptural, Unreaſonable and Ungodly; it is not the holy Scriptures, nor the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, which thou calleſt the <hi>Original</hi> that is thy Rule for this thy Ungodly Writing and Perverting of <hi>John</hi>'s Words, but thy own Wicked, Dark and Sinfull Imaginations; I deſire thou may find a place of Repentance, and ſo forgiveneſs at Gods hand, and ceaſe from ſuch Ungodly Work as this, for if thou do not, God will reward thee according to thy Ungodly Deeds, and the Cup which thou muſt drink (as the reward of thy Work) will be Bitter. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>In this is the Children of God made manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil; whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs is not of God:</hi> But thou argueſt, <hi>That the born of God do commit ſin,</hi> which is Blaſphemy; but ſeeing this is thy Ungodly Opinion, that the born of God doth commit ſin; I ſay, the born of the Devil doth no more but commit ſin; ſo here thou put'ſt not a right difference betwixt the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the Wicked, and ſo thou art not God's Miniſter or Mouth to the People, but in theſe thy Ungodly Interpretations of the holy Scriptures thou art the Miniſter and Mouth of the Father of Lyes, who hath led people into ſin, who telleſt them they muſt never come out of it on this ſide the Grave. Thus thou and many others have made agreement with Death, and a Covenant with Hell for Term of Life, and if you do not know this Covenant broken by Chriſt Jeſus, and by him be led out of ſin, your Reward will be Miſerable in the World to come: but we greatly deſire your Unſeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Salvation.</p>
            <p>What a Wild Diſtracted Interpreter of the holy Scriptures is this J. B? If he go on to interpret the reſt of the Commands of God and Chriſt, as he hath done theſe Commands to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47409:52"/>
Holy, &amp;c. what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mad Work will he make? it ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pears it is not the Scriptures of Truth, nor the Spirit of God that muſt be his Rule, but rather the Temptations of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One, which hath large room in his Unbelieving Heart, as this Ungodly Plea doth largely manifeſt. Gods Command is, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder:</hi> Now according to J. B's Wild Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the before-mentioned Commands, he may ſay, Thoſe who are born of God may or muſt Murder: But they may not Murther with that allowance that ſome other Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers do, or they muſt not do ſo much Murder as ſome others do. Again, God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal:</hi> But J. B. may ſay by his Mad Rule of arguing; they may or muſt Steal; but they who are born of God may not or muſt not Steal with that allowance that others who are not born of God do, or they muſt not ſtteal ſo much as ſuch do. And after this his Ungodly way of arguing he may deal thus with the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>J. B. to ſtrengthen thy Plea for the Devil, and Sin, which is his Work; thou mentioneſt <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, who ſaid, <hi>That which I would not do, that do I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Paul <hi>and all the Saints, who did (and do) wait dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently upon God, did and do grow from one degree of Grace unto another; and</hi> Paul <hi>did grow up in Chriſt unto a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtronger State: He ſaid,</hi> I am Crucified with Chriſt, &amp;c. I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me; and the Life that I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> I have fought a good fight, I have kept the Faith, &amp;c. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath ſet me Free from the Law of Sin and Death. <hi>Thus it doth appear that he did out-grow thoſe Weakneſſes which he doth mention in the 7th Chapter to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>J.

Mouth of his holy Prophet, that he will take away the Stony Heart out of the Fleſh, and that he will give a Heart of Fleſh, that People may walk in his Statutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. And the Spirit of Truth, which doth lead the Saints into all Truth, the ſame doth Convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and Judgment: and whatſoever is reproved and condemned by God in Men and Women, the ſame is made known to be Evil, by the ſpiritual Light of Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Every one that doth Evil, hates the Light, and will not bring his Deeds to it: But he that doth Truth bringeth his Deeds to the Light, that they may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that they are wrought in God,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>J. B.

Thou haſt given large Proof in this thy <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> that thou art not covered with the Spirit of God; for if thou wert, thou wouldſt not thus wickedly wreſt the holy Scriptures to cover thy ſelf in thy Sins, neither wouldſt thou rake up the weakneſs and failings of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt God's People, who at ſometimes did Evil, but Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forſook their Evils, and were forgiven by the Lord, as in the caſes of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> God made Man perfect, and the Devil hath brought man into Imperfection, by leading him into Sin and Rebellion againſt God.

Chriſt is God's free Gift (as I have plainly ſhewed before) both unto <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, to be his Salvation to the ends of the Earth; he taſted Death for every man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.

Therefore Wo unto thoſe who go on in their ſins unto the end of their Dayes upon Earth, Raking up and down in the Scriptures of Truth, to gather up the Failings &amp; MISCARRIAGES of ſome among God's People, who for want of diligent Watchfulneſs were overcome by their Souls Enemy, but Unfeignedly Repented and Ceaſed from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, &amp; did learn to do well, and ſo were forgiven; as in the caſes of

The Woes were of Old, and now are, unto all thoſe Preachers and Hearers, who are covered, and NOT with the holy pure Spirit of the Lord God, in which <hi>spirit God is worſhipped,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Wo to the Rebellious Children, who take Counſel but not of me</hi> (ſaith the Lord God) <hi>who cover with a Covering, but NOT of my SPIRIT, that they may ADD Sin unto Sin,</hi> Iſa. 30. 1. <hi>Wo unto them that call Evil Good, and Good Evil, &amp;c.

1 Tim. 2. 9, 10. So all Women both Old and Young ought to obey the Command of Chriſt, who commands to be Meek and Lowly; and ought to follow the good Example of theſe holy <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Women, who were cloathed and beautified with a Meek and Humble Quiet Spirit, and with good Works, as the holy Apoſtle Exhorts. <hi>Depart from Evil, and do good, and dwell</hi> (or live) <hi>for evermore.

            <p>Reader, Take notice, here <hi>David</hi> owns Perfection; he ſaith, <hi>Mark the Perfect Man, behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, for the end of that Man is Peace:</hi> Thus it plainly appears that God and Chriſt, and the true Prophets and Apoſtles and holy Men and Women were and are for Perfection, Holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the Devil, Anti-chriſt, Falſe Prophets, Falſe Apoſtles, and all Wicked Men and Women are for Imperfection, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, Unholineſs, Sin and Wickedneſs, who plead for a continuance in Sin until Men and Women go to the Grave: This Plea for Sin and Wickedneſs, is not a Plea for God and Chriſt, but for the Devil, who is the author of Sin. In the Grave there is no Repentance, neither is there any Purgatory (as ſome do falſly teach) to purge people from their ſins after they are dead and put in their Graves. No Unclean thing can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; therefore bleſſed are they who come to Chriſt Jeſus and follow him, who came to take away Sin and bring in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs; to waſh and cleanſe from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and to ſtrengthen

his to perfect Holineſs in the fear of the Lord God; unto which the holy Apoſtle exhorted, as is ſhewed before.</p>
