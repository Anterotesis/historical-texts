            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Words of the Text are a general Propoſition, but made uſe of as a reaſon to juſtify the Severity of the Threatning here denounced by a Prophet againſt the Houſe and Family of <hi>Eli;</hi> whoſe Sons at that time executed the Prieſts Office under him at <hi>Shiloh:</hi> Of whom, and their caſe, it is requiſite to give ſome account,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62715:4"/>
as an Exemplification of the Text, and what may ſerve alſo as a Comment on it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eli,</hi> that was then High Prieſt, was a Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of <hi>Ithamar</hi> the Younger Son of <hi>Aaron;</hi> but how the Succeſſion came to be alter'd, which from <hi>Aaron</hi>'s death had probably continued for <note place="margin">V. Ezra. 7. 3.</note>Seven Generations in the Line of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Elder Brother, the Scripture is ſilent.</p>
            <p>There is nothing to be collected from thence to <hi>Eli</hi>'s diſadvantage and diſparagement, in the double charge he Officiated in, whether as a <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 18.</note>Judge, in which Station he was for Forty Years together, or as the High Prieſt.</p>
            <p>There is not a Syllable that charges him with Intruſion any more into the Prieſthood, than into the Judicature.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 6. 7.</note> There was in being at that time a <hi>Meraioth</hi> or an <hi>Amariath,</hi> one of the Family of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and the next in Blood and pretence too, if a direct Succeſſion were inviolably to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and yet it is no where imputed to <hi>Eli</hi> that he invaded or was poſſeſs'd of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Right; nor is it ſaid that any did <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the offering of the Lord</hi> for that reaſon, as they <note place="margin">Chap. 2. v. 17.</note>did for another.</p>
            <p>No! There we find <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> (and without doubt thoſe pious Perſons were not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62715:4"/>
alone) repairing to the Tabernacle at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seaſons, and applying themſelves to him as <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 15, 26.</note>God's Miniſter, and the Director of the Publick Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him, and his Sons, were they wont to bring their Offerings, as it is expreſly ſaid there,</hi> v. <hi>3.</hi> When Elkanah went up out of his city yearly to worſhip, and to ſacrifice unto the Lord of Hoſts in Shiloh; the two ſons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, the prieſts of the Lord, were there.</p>
            <p>Whence this Tranſlation of the Prieſthood, from the Elder to the Younger Houſe, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or when it was, whether before, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it began in <hi>Eli</hi> (as it is moſt probable) is not certain. It ſeems, whenever it was, to have been by God's approbation, if not his immediate direction; and that, perhaps, for ſome groſs neglect, or great Miſcarriages, or ſome incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city on the other ſide: Or from the neceſſity of having ſuch a Perſon in that Station in thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and uncertain Times, as would by a wiſe and ſteady Hand, and his prudent Conduct, and above all, by his Exemplary Piety and Vertue, maintain the Honour and Dignity of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and keep the People firm to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under all the inclinations, and too often prevailing inclinations to Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62715:5"/>
This ſeems to have been the ſtate of Affairs at that time, and the reaſon of <hi>Eli</hi>'s introduction into the Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>And becauſe of the difficult Service he was to enter upon, God encouraged him (as he was wont to do in great undertakings) by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar promiſe of eſtabliſhing his Poſterity in that Sacred Function; as the words immediately preceding the Text do intimate; <hi>I ſaid indeed that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy father ſhould walk before me for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eli,</hi> as to his own perſon, and whilſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſeems to have anſwer'd this Character, and to have acquitted himſelf worthy of the choice made of him, in both capacities, as a Prieſt, and a Judge; for during the whole time of his Adminiſtration, the Times ſeem to have been quiet, and the Nation in an orderly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for about forty years together; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is paſs'd over in ſilence in the Sacred Annals.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 15.</note> But <hi>Eli</hi> grew ſuperannuated, being 98 years old, and blind, and uncapable of officiating in perſon at the Altar; and ſo it fell to his Sons, two diſſolute Young Men, that being from under their Father's Eye, and poſſeſs'd of ſo large a power, as from him devolved upon themſelves,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62715:5"/>
ſet no bounds to their arbitrary and licentious Humours, but broke through all the ties of Piety and Modeſty, treating the Inſtitutions of their Religion with ſo prophane an Inſolence, that <hi>men abhor'd the offering of the Lord;</hi> and ſo <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 17.</note>lewd were they in their Converſation, that by their Example and Encouragement, they <hi>made</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 24.</note>(as their Father tells them) <hi>the Lord's people to tranſgreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a Caſe too hard and perverſe to cure by gentle means and calm reaſoning, the way uſed by their over-indulgent Father, <hi>verſe</hi> 23, 24. therefore it was time for God to appear to threaten and to puniſh: 'Tis time then for him to reverſe his own Laws, to cancel his Promiſes, and recal his Favours which were ſo ungratefully and impiouſly abuſed; ſo it is repreſented in this <hi>verſe, Wherefore the Lord God of Iſrael ſaith, I ſaid indeed, that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy fathers, ſhould walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me for ever: but now the Lord ſaith, Be it far from me: For them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall Treat of theſe Words by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a general Propoſition, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62715:6"/>
ſeveral important Truths, and that are worthy of our moſt ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall Treat of them with reſpect to the Context, and make uſe of them by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the occaſion.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to which, give me leave to obſerve, That though it is in the power of every man, more or leſs, as well as it is his Duty, to honour God by his Words and Actions, by the Obedience he gives to his Laws, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments he makes of his Providence, by the regard he pays to the Sacred Offices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Religion; yet that this more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belongs to thoſe that are in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Station, and have greater advantages and opportunities for doing Good, than others, by their Authority, Power, and Example. Of theſe it's ſaid, that if they then <hi>Honour God,</hi> and lay out themſelves, and uſe their utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for promoting his Religion in the World, he will then <hi>Honour</hi> them, that is, will ſhew himſelf to be their God, by ſupporting them under all the diſcouragements they meet with, by directing them to the moſt proper methods, and giving ſucceſs to all their endeavours; by raiſing them a juſt eſteem, and making even their Enemies to be at peace with them; and by a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62715:6"/>
thouſand other ways, that good and worthy Perſons have the comfortable experience of in the faithful diſcharge of their Duty toward God and Men. To theſe the words (as they are before us) do more eſpecially belong, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> Of which I ſhall treat firſt of all, as a Propoſition in general, and by it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall treat of the Words by themſelves, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Honour due to Almighty God, is founded upon the ſame reaſon as his Being; and by the ſame Arguments and ways that we know him to be, by the ſame is he concluded to be of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power and Wiſdom, and indued with all thoſe Perfections which make him to be God, are peculiar to him, and do diſtinguiſh him from all other Beings beſides; and for that reaſon we can no more be wanting in the Honour due to ſuch a Being, than we can ſuppoſe him not to be, or not endued with thoſe glorious Perfections that unalienably belong to his Nature.</p>
            <p>And therefore if we did not underſtand the depravation of human Nature, nor had any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the ſtate and inclinations of Mankind, we might well ſuppoſe that we ſhould find the whole World a Temple, and all Mankind, in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62715:7"/>
Fact, agreeing in a conſtant Adoration and Honour of God, as they do in the Belief of Him.</p>
            <p>For who can conſider the wonderful Power and Wiſdom ſhining through the Works of the viſible Creation, without the profoundeſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for their Great and Almighty Creator?</p>
            <p>Who can Contemplate his Goodneſs and his Mercy, his Mercy to the worſt, and his Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to all; his readineſs to Give what we Want, and to Forgive when we have Offended; but muſt expreſs his ſenſe of it by an humble Love to his Gracious Benefactor, and a hearty deſire of being Conformable to him in the like Divine Temper?</p>
            <p>Who can conſider God's Government of the World, and his conſtant Preſervation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and an Order amongſt them under all Viciſſitudes and Changes, which like an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake tear up, as it were, the foundations of Kingdoms; but muſt own his and the World's Preſerver by his Prayers to him, and a Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him?</p>
            <p>Who that conſiders the Equity and Perfection of the Divine Law, how ſuitable to the Nature, Reaſon, and Condition of Mankind, but muſt teſtifie his regard to it by a ready and chearful Obedience?</p>
            <p>

Who can reflect upon the Preſervation of a Church (the Conſervator of Divine Truth) under all the oppoſition it has met with from the fury of Bad men, and the malice and craft of evil Spirits, that with one conſent have been Confederates againſt it; but muſt acknowledge the watchful Providence that preſides over it, and which has made even the Blood of its Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and the Sufferings of its Confeſſors, to be the Seed of the Church?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Who is there that has made any obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of himſelf, and look'd into the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Life in the various Scenes of it, of Youth and Manhood, of Proſperity and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, of Health and Sickneſs, of Succeſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, of the Miſtakes and Miſcarriages when he has truſted to his own Wiſdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and the wonderful turn of Affairs to his advantage, when he often leaſt thought and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but muſt own a Cauſe ſuperiour to himſelf, and his obligations to this Almighty Power?</p>
            <p>Theſe are Conſiderations lie open to every man's eye; and, in reaſon, we might as ſoon find ſo many Infidels and Atheiſts in the World, as any Contemners of the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>Surely there is no need of any other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the nature of the thing to induce us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62715:8"/>
to honour our Creator, Preſerver and Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; and ſo the Text may ſeem to be in vain, when 'tis ſaid by way of Argument, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> What need is there of this Doctrine? What need of any Rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and promiſed, any more to provoke, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and oblige us to honour God, than to love our ſelves? Since the ſame reaſon that will direct us to the one, will alſo direct us to the other.</p>
            <p>Surely then there cannot be an inſtance given of ſo hateful a Creature as the other part of the Text ſuppoſes, of one that <hi>deſpiſes</hi> God, no more than of one that denies him: And if ſuch an one there were, it may reaſonably be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole World would with one mouth condemn him, and caſt him out of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>But it was not in that Age alone that there were ſuch <hi>Hophni's</hi> and <hi>Phineas's,</hi> ſuch <hi>Sons of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note>
               <hi>Belial,</hi> that <hi>knew not the Lord;</hi> and ſuch among the People that <hi>abhorred the Offering,</hi> and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Divine Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>It has been too much the Vice of moſt Ages; and I wiſh I could ſay, that this in which we live, were among thoſe that are to be excepted: For then, whatever need there were of this Doctrine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62715:8"/>
in a degenerate Age and Nation, there would be no need of it in ours.</p>
            <p>But though, bleſſed be God, we are not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to that prodigious ſtate of Impiety, and that the Offerings to Almighty God, and the publick Offices of our Religion, are not ſo prophaned, as among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at that time; but are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, generally ſpeaking, by the Guardians of the Law, and the Governors of the Church, as well as by the Laws and Eſtabliſhed Order: Yet we may find too much of that Impiety inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelf among us; and work enough for all concerned in the government of Church and State to provide againſt. And therefore that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Text is fit to be inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall refer the treating of it in this way to the Second General.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as the words lie before us, we may collect from them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Religion and the Civil Intereſt are cloſely connected: The honouring of God, and God's honouring thoſe that thus honour him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Religion is in the firſt place to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into conſideration: Firſt honour God, and then God will honour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. According as Religion is encouraged, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62715:9"/>
God thereby honoured, may we judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of Perſons or Nations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Religion and the Civil Intereſt are cloſely connected.</p>
            <p>It was ſtrictly ſo among the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was a Theocracy, the Conſtitution of God's ſole Contrivance, and his immediate Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; ſo that they could not admit of any alteration, or revocation, but by the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority.</p>
            <p>And the Law of the Land being then of God's own Inſtitution, there was a peculiar Providence and Bleſſing that was connected to their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by a Divine Promiſe: And by this they were eminently diſtinguiſhed from other Nations.</p>
            <p>But though it was thus with them after an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial manner, yet the whole World always was, and ever will be under the government of God's Providence; and the ſame general Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are there for it over the face of the Earth. It being in this caſe, as it is in Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, which however it varies, whether a Monarchy, Ariſtocracy or Democracy, has the ſame foundation, and the ſame Ends to purſue; which are the determining and ſecuring mens Rights, the impartial adminiſtration of Juſtice,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62715:9"/>
and the preſervation of the Publick Peace and Order.</p>
            <p>And howſoever the Providence of God may vary in its motions, now turning it ſelf this way, and then another; yet there are immoveable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which it always proceeds, and that is Religion, and the Bleſſing of God; our honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and his honouring of us, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and co-operation.</p>
            <p>For Religion will ſtand to the World's end, whatever become of particular Perſons and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: As the Earth will abide for ever, though the Inhabitants of one Age give way to another; though Rivers change their courſe, and Mountains their ſtation. And 'tis Religion that gives the ſureſt eſtabliſhment, and infuſes a new life into a Nation, or a Cauſe, when it ſeems to be upon point of expiring; for that engages Providence on its ſide; and then they have in reality what the Heathens had in imagination only, when they fought, as they conceived, againſt poor Mortals, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having their gods concerned in their quarrel.</p>
            <p>While Mortals engage with Mortals only, there is the like Force to defend, as to aſſault; and the ſucceſs depends upon the greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62715:10"/>
the inbred Courage of the Soldiery, the Conduct of the Commander, or ſome fortunate Accident: And the laſt ſometimes has the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all the reſt, and is inſtead of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Conduct, or Courage; ſo that as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerves, The <hi>battel</hi> is no more <hi>to the ſtrong,</hi> than the <hi>race</hi> is always to the <hi>ſwift,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 11.</p>
            <p>But now when the Divine Providence comes to be concerned, it is not what the Number, or the Courage, or the Conduct, nay or Accidents, are on the adverſe ſide: Becauſe that's all in it ſelf, and becomes all whereever it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there it will be, where the Honour of God and Religion is concerned. This was it that inſpired</hi> David <hi>with an undaunted Reſolution;</hi> Thou comeſt to me with a ſword, and with a ſpear, and with a ſhield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hoſts, whom thou haſt defied, <hi>1 Sam. 17. 45.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are no more to be ſeparated, than the Soul and the Body; for if we once with <hi>Goliah</hi> defy, or to ſpeak in milder terms, neglect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Religion, and have no regard to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God in our Conſultations and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our Affairs and Proceedings, we are upon the brink of deſtruction; and if we are preſerv'd, and become ſucceſsful, it is not for our own ſakes, but for the ſake of others, or ſome
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62715:10"/>
further deſign the Providence of God has in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for us.</p>
            <p>There is a vaſt difference between what is done by Divine Providence for our own ſakes, and what for the ſake of others, or for other Reaſons than what appear, and what are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known at preſent to us. If for our own ſakes, as it is, when grounded upon Religion, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we pay to Almighty God, it will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and laſt as long as the Reaſon laſts upon which it ſtands. But if it be for other Reaſons that we ſucceed in a Deſign, and not for our own ſakes; then when the Reaſons ceaſe, our aſſiſtance that we had from the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ceaſes with it. Thus it was with the haughty <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> who proſper'd in his Invaſion of <hi>Judea,</hi> not as he himſelf thought, by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own Counſel, and the mere force of his Arms; but as he was <hi>the rod of God's Anger,</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> by his ſpecial Commiſſion <hi>againſt that hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Nation.</hi> But that Service ended, there was a ſtop put to his Victory, and he ſoon fell under the like Calamity; As it follows, <hi>When the Lord hath performed his whole work on Mount Zion, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and the glory of his high looks,</hi> Iſa. 10. 5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62715:11"/>
In which Caſe Proſperity and Succeſs may be ſo far from being a Bleſſing, that it becomes a Curſe; and often Men are thereby made but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of miſchief to each other, and the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> is conquer'd by the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> by the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> by the <hi>Grecian;</hi> and the <hi>Grecian</hi> after a little time dies, as it were, upon the ſpot; and the Power, which when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, was confiderable, broke and crumbled into numerous Kingdoms, and came to nothing.</p>
            <p>And thus it has been throughout the World from the time of the <hi>mighty hunter Nimrod,</hi> to the preſent Age; when it has been a mere humane World, ſubſiſting, as it were, by it ſelf, and managed by the Policy, and too often by the Paſſions and Vices of Mankind; by their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their Pride, their Revenge and Cruelty, the great Incentives and <hi>Boutefeus</hi> of the World. And thus there will be a circulation of riſing and falling, of puniſhing and being puniſhed; and like Billows of the Ocean, of ſwallowing up, and being ſwallowed up, till the World's end; whilſt in this condition, whilſt acted and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Intereſts of Men, without reſpect had to a higher Cauſe, and Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion, and the Providence of God. But now if we conſider the World as a compound State, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62715:11"/>
there is as certain connexion between Religion and the State, as between the Soul and the Body; then there is another account to be given of things, and a better State to be expected. The World is then as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State was, a kind of Theocracy, God is the Governor, and Religion, as it were, the Soul of it: And then it is that God becomes their Patron, and his Providence their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Indeed without the Providence of God, we are neither ſecure of what we have, nor can be ſure of ſucceſs in what we pretend to. It is there only that we are ſafe, by that only we can hope to ſucceed. And therefore as there cannot be a more comfortleſs proſpect in view, than to take a cauſe in hand, where we cannot promiſe to our ſelves that aſſiſtance; ſo there cannot be a greater or more dangerous error committed in the conduct of Affairs, than to leave that out of our conſideration, and to ſeparate thoſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Religion and Civil Affairs, which God hath ſo advantageouſly, as to the Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, joyned together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As theſe Two are thus to be connected, ſo Religion is to have the preference: <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62715:12"/>
Second Cauſes have this advantage of the firſt, that they are viſible, and ſo ſooner affect us than the Supreme, who is inviſible; and therefore Mankind have been inclined to direct their expectations and endeavours another way. And as the Heathens, for want of looking further, made the moſt conſpicuous, and ſometimes the meaneſt Creatures, becauſe preſent, the Objects of their Adoration; ſo when ſecond Cauſes ſtare us in the face, and we ſee how one moves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from what immediate reaſons the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of affairs doth ariſe; we are apt to begin with them, there to ſtay our hand and lodge our thoughts, and depend upon their concourſe and influence as if they all moved of and from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and there were no Superior Power, no Inviſible Agent, that they had a relation to, and dependance upon. Thus it was with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 8. &amp;c. They <hi>looked to the armour of the houſe of the foreſt, made up the breaches, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the waters of the lower pool, made a ditch for the old pool; but,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>ye have not looked to the maker thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is an unpardonable overſight, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thus at the wrong end; as if becauſe an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer uſes a Pencil and Colours in the various Figures which he draws, and ſets off by his Skill
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62715:12"/>
to the greateſt advantage; that a Perſon ſhould impute all to the Inſtruments the Artiſt uſes and applaud their Skill, and apply himſelf to them as the Operator, and paſs by the Painter, upon whoſe Judgment they wholly depend in their Uſe and Operation.</p>
            <p>Much ſo do they that apply themſelves to the next Cauſes, and to the Means (how proper and ſufficient ſoever they are in their own nature to anſwer the deſign) to the neglect of Him who is the Supreme Cauſe, and that gives Laws and Activity to all Inferior Agents, and directs, and over-rules, and determines them as he pleaſes. An imprudence that no Perſon would be guilty of in any caſe beſides. It is not to be denied but all theſe inferior Powers, theſe ſecond Cauſes, theſe Inſtruments and Means, may be and are very proper, convenient, and neceſſary in their place and order; but to begin with them without asking leave, and begging the Bleſſing of God in the uſe of them; is of Inferior to make them Supreme, of Inſtruments and Means, to make them the Efficient; and what therefore they may with the like Devotion, as the <hi>Romans</hi> applied themſelves to Fortune, make the Objects of their Prayer.</p>
            <p>Prayer is ſomewhere due, for we receive what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62715:13"/>
we cannot of our ſelves procure; we live as well as we begin to be, by the like Power; and if we enter upon our affairs under the influence only of our own wiſdom and power, we may as well pray to our ſelves, as depend upon our ſelves; ſince where our dependance is, there are our devotions due. But how ridiculous would he appear, that ſhould thus adore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and pray to himſelf? A folly greater than that of <hi>Caligula,</hi> who when he required others to own him for a god, could not in the mean time think himſelf to be ſo. And yet this is a folly he muſt be guilty of that doth not in the firſt place own a God and a Providence, in the guidance and conduct of human Affairs; and darkly purſues them under the covert of a blind Chance, or of a Wiſdom of his own, very often as blind as that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are taught a wiſer courſe, and what will always hold and continue to be ſo,</hi> Prov. <hi>3. 5, 6.</hi> Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own underſtanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths. <hi>Or as it is here;</hi> Them that honour me, I will honour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. According to the honour we give to God, and the regard ſhewn to Religion, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62715:13"/>
to be honoured by him; ſuch we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Event will be.</p>
            <p>It is an eaſy thing to conceive that ſuch the Event will be, foraſmuch as God Governs the World; and when we lay things in their proper order, there is no reaſon to think but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, honour, and ſucceſs, ſhould attend thoſe that honour God; as heat and light do the Sun. And we may as well queſtion, whether it will be day when the Sun riſes; and whether it will be Summer with us when the Sun is in <hi>Cancer;</hi> as whether God, who is infinitely Good, and has the Sovereign diſpoſal of all things, will not ſo Govern and Order, as ſhall be for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, Good, and Happineſs, of ſuch as honour him.</p>
            <p>And yet if we draw near, and view the caſe as it is often in Fact, we ſhall find it far different from what it is in Speculation.</p>
            <p>If indeed this were conſtantly ſo, that thoſe that honour God were always honoured by him with ſuch peculiar marks of favour as diſtinguiſhed them from others, it would ſerve as a character by which the Good might be known from the Bad. But ſince nothing is more evident from common experience, than that <hi>all things,</hi> generally ſpeaking, <hi>come alike to all;</hi> then thoſe that do not honour God, may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62715:14"/>
fare alike with ſuch as do; and thoſe that do honour him, fare no better than thoſe that do not; and ſo the force of the Argument in the Text will be loſt.</p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide, for the preſent, what may be ſaid in defence of the method of Divine Providence in ſuch a ſeeming promiſcuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of things (as the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſpeaks of) and the reconcileableneſs of the propoſition in the Text to it, as to particular perſons; we are to remember what has been already ſaid, that it is more eſpecially to be applied to ſuch Perſons that are of eminent Character in reſpect of Quality, or Office; or for the advantages they have and improve to the honour of God, and promoting of Religion. Such as theſe God doth honour in the eye of the World, and by Providences as extraordinary as their ſtations and improvements, doth often, and for the moſt part, crown with ſucceſs, or a Bleſſing greater than that. So that even their diſapointments ſhall be to their advantage, their danger to their ſecurity, and their fall, if not to their after-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement (as was the caſe of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Joſeph)</hi> ſhall be, however, to their reputation and honour.</p>
            <p>Such as theſe that do good for goodneſs ſake, and that lay out themſelves for the honour of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62715:14"/>
God, the ſervice of Religion, and therein for the publick Good, are Benefactors to Mankind; and had they lived among the Heathen, who had no better, they ſhould have been taken into the Kalendar of their Gods: And ſurely ſuch as theſe will God more eſpecially regard.</p>
            <p>But if we raiſe the argument higher, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to Nations and Communities, it improves in our hands, and we have a noble Inſtance of this Truth. It muſt be granted, that God that has a regard to the Flowers of the Field, the Fowls of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Earth, is as much more concerned in the Good, Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Happineſs of Mankind, as theſe in their Nature exceed the other; but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee not into all the Events and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relating to men in this World, and that there is a reſerve for them in another; we cannot ſo ſettle what relates to them, but that we are forced to ſuſpend, and muſt acknowledge there are great difficulties, and that muſt remain ſo to be, till the whole comes to be diſcloſed. But now as to Men combined together in Societies, the caſe is not ſo perplexed; for there we may, generally ſpeaking, obſerve, and perhaps, if a careful Hiſtory of Acts and Events were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it would appear, that God doth honour
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62715:15"/>
thoſe Nations which honour him; and that there is no People among whom, as well by their Practice as Laws, Virtue and Religion have been, and are encouraged, but has a ſuitable Bleſſing attending it, and the Divine Providence eminently appearing in their behalf. Even among the Heathens this was both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and experimented. And if we will but take the pains to conſider the periodical Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among the <hi>Jews,</hi> we ſhould find all along through the courſe of that Hiſtory, that it is a continued Series and Narrative of the Divine Providence, proceeding by this Rule: So that I am confident there cannot be one Inſtance given to the contrary, that ever they were delivered up to their Enemies, or had any great Misfortune befel them, but what was brought upon them from ſome foregoing Apoſtacy, and high Provocation.</p>
            <p>And if there be any thing wanting for the proof of this part (of God's honouring them that honour him (as ſurely there is not) yet there are Inſtances upon Inſtances on the other part, that thoſe <hi>that deſpiſe</hi> Religion, <hi>ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome Vices that in their own nature and apparent conſequences root up Families, make Nations effeminate, and poor-ſpirited, and render them an eaſy Prey to the bold Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62715:15"/>
As was evident in the declining Times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, declining in Vertue as well as Power, and declining in Power, becauſe they declined in Vertue.</p>
            <p>But there are other Sins that have as bearing an influence in the Judgments that befal a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſpecially a Nation in Covenant with God, as a Church, that deprives them of their beſt Defence, the protection of God, and expoſes them to the worſt of dangers; and theſe Sins are a profane contempt or neglect of things Sacred.</p>
            <p>Of which we need ſeek no further for an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than the times we are upon, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Judges; inſomuch, that during the 450 years of <note place="margin">Act. 13. 20.</note>that Adminiſtration, there were 111 of thoſe years, years of Oppreſſion; the reaſon of which is all along aſcribed to their Apoſtacy from the True Religion; and that therefore God <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judg. 3. 8. 12. 4. 1. 6. 1. 10. 6.</note>their Adverſaries, and <hi>deliver'd</hi> and <hi>ſold</hi> them into their hands.</p>
            <p>And if we deſcend lower, and conſider the Example ſet before us in this Chapter, we have one Inſtance beyond all exception, in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Eli;</hi> whoſe Sons <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> were both ſlain in one day, the Ark taken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which had been the place of its Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 60.</note>for 340 years, (if not more) left deſolate.</p>
            <p>

A Caſe ſo remarkable, that in as degenerate an Age, when they placed as much confidence in the Temple, as theſe did in the Ark, they are ſent to this Monument of God's juſt Indignation for their confutation. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4, 12. <hi>Go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we find to be the uſual method of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence throughout the Book of God: That whilſt Religion was maintained, and the Hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> held up, the <hi>Jews</hi> prevailed againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and proſper'd whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they went: But if they fell, and Religion declined, that Contempt gave force and ſucceſs to the Stratagems and Combinations of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Then God will forſake his own <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 60.</note>and deliver up his <hi>ſtrength</hi> into the hands of their Enemies, that he may make them ſenſible, that his Juſtice and his Word are greater than the Ark, which was to be worſhipped for his ſake; as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

            <p>So that in fine, if we would make a juſt calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is like to be the fate of a People, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the better or the worſe, to the ſucceſs or diſappointment, the ſafety or ruin of a Nation, we need not have recourſe to the Stars, and the vain Pretences of a Deluſive Art: But we may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62715:16"/>
go no farther than to the ſtate of it as to Religion and Vertue on the one hand, or Vice and Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the other; and then without the Spirit of Prophecy we may come to a point, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel how it ſhall be with them in the latter end.</p>
            <p>And this is a Subject fit for the ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a People, and eſpecially at ſuch a time as this, when we are aſſembled together before Almighty God, to implore his Bleſſing upon the Publick Counſels and Proceedings, upon which the good of this Nation, and the Fate of the Weſtern part of <hi>Europe</hi> more eſpecially, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. And this will lead us to the Second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the Propoſition in the Text, with relation to the Context; and to the matter of Fact it is ſubjoyned to.</p>
            <p>We have a remarkable Inſtance of this before us in <hi>Eli,</hi> who was (as aforeſaid) as well a Judge as a Prieſt, and eſtabliſhed in both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; that by this conjunction of two of the higheſt Offices in himſelf, he might be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of recovering the priſtine honour of Religion and the Nation; which for a long time had been in a very declining ſtate, and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Fall of <hi>Sampſon, Eli</hi>'s immediate Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor (as may be conceived) little leſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than deſperate, in human appearance.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62715:17"/>
               <hi>Eli</hi> being thus inveſted with the Supreme Power and Authority, had an opportunity for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt Good, for Reforming matters in Church and State, and ſetling them upon a ſure and laſting Foundation. In which, how happily ſoever he ſucceeded for a time, and ſo as to have the former part of the Text verified in him, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour;</hi> yet afterwards there followed ſo great diſorders, through the evil Practices of his Sons, and his Indulgence to them, that drew upon him as ſevere a Train of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to the threatning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elkanah</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay) as ever a Perſon or a Family felt and ſuffer'd; to the confirming the latter part of the Text in the higheſt ſenſe of it, <hi>Thoſe that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> that is (according to the uſual <hi>Meioſis</hi> in Scripture, and as we are taught by the Event) ſhall be moſt ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4. 1 Cor. 10. 6.</note> Now theſe things <hi>were our enſamples,</hi> and <hi>are written for our admonition:</hi> For the Hiſtory of Scripture is a practical Comment upon Divine Providence; and what was in its deſign compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the uſe of all future Ages, that Poſterity might by the numerous Examples of all kinds as to good or evil, be encouraged as to the one, and cautioned againſt the other.</p>

And to ſuch as theſe is our Text more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be applied; to ſuch a People, and ſuch Perſons, whom God by his ſignal Providence hath been propitious to above the common ſort and caſe of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eli</hi> had much to anſwer for, becauſe more might juſtly be expected from him by reaſon of the Advantages he was ſuperior to many others in: That <hi>Eli,</hi> whom God had thus choſen to his Service, and had thus dignified beyond any other of his Succeſſors; as was alſo the Nation he was of, beyond any People in the World.</p>
            <p>And to what doth all this ſerve, but to teach Perſons of Eminence for their Quality or Office, for their Intereſt, Power and Authority, what uſe they ſhould make of it? That ſo they whom God hath honoured in advancing them to ſuch a degree of Superiority, may not as the degenerate Sons of <hi>Eli, make themſelves vile</hi> and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: That when God has made them to be Stars in the Firmament of Heaven, to give light, and ſhed their benevolent influence upon the Earth, they ſhould in the iſſue prove no other than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, ſhewn to the World for a time, but all o'th' ſudden expire without any benefit to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Can we think that no more is expected from us, whom God hath endued with the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62715:18"/>
and fitted for Service in the Station and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we are, than from the Horſe and the Mule that have no underſtanding; and that we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the end of our Beings, if we ſpend our days in a torpid and unprofitable ſloth, or in ſuch things as the Bruits can do as well as we?</p>
            <p>And can ſuch Perſons whom God hath bleſſed with Gifts and Talents above others, or rais'd by his Providence to a ſtate of Eminence, think that there is no more required of them, in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Station, than if they drowzed away their time in ſome obſcure Corner, alike unknown, and unprofitable to the World?</p>
            <p>No ſurely; but as we ought often to reflect upon our ſelves, and to conſider how we that are reaſonable Creatures, and whom God hath made <hi>veſſels to honour,</hi> may employ our Talents to the Glory of our Creator, ſuitable to the dignity of our Nature, and to high and nobler purpoſes than thoſe Creatures that are made <hi>veſſels to diſhonour:</hi> So ought thoſe, who out of the common maſs of Mankind are exalted above others, to anſwer the dignity of their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to conſult how they may demean themſelves worthy of that honour their Creator hath thought fit to place ſuch a diſtinguiſhing Character upon.</p>

Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more:</hi> Luke 12. 48. And eſpecially may this be expected from thoſe that are the Repreſentatives of a People, and that are concerned in making thoſe Laws for the promoting of Religion and the honour of God, by which they themſelves, as well as the Community, are to be Governed. How doth it become ſuch to eſtabliſh the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe Sanctions by their Example, and not to take that undue Liberty to themſelves, which they, in the Laws they make, deny to others?</p>
            <p>How doth it become them to be the ſupport of Religion, to ſtand up in the defence of it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive its drooping Spirits, and to make that by their Authority as Sacred as the Holy Mount, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, which no man ſhould dare to break in upon and violate!</p>
            <p>Here is a Cauſe not only worthy of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and their Zeal, but what alſo is at this time Neceſſary, when the very Foundation of Religion is Attempted; and that which all the World has ſo much wanted, and deſired where it was not, I mean Revelation, is expoſed; and that which we all venture our Salvation upon,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62715:19"/>
the Chriſtian Inſtitution, the Sacrifice and the Mediation of our Bleſſed Saviour, is openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>Derogatory</hi> to the Perfections of Almighty God, and Injurious to Men.</p>
            <p>We are here a Chriſtian Aſſembly met together in the Fear of God, and with a Hope in his Mercy through Jeſus Chriſt; and it is an happy oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offer'd to us by the Supreme Authority of the Nation, for Imploring the Divine Bleſſing upon the Publick Councels and Affairs; by which we declare to the World what honour we bear to Almighty God, what dependance we have upon him, and do profeſſedly put our ſelves under his Protection: And how can this better be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Patriots of our Countrey, than by taking his Religion into theirs, by bearing as great a regard to, and being as much concerned for the Honour and juſt Rights of it, as for their own?</p>
            <p>If this be the Event of this Solemn Appearance, and ſhall be the Compaſs by which they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſteer in their Conſultations and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; as they will therein <hi>honour</hi> God, ſo he for their ſo doing will honour them, and make them a publick Bleſſing to the Nation; and the Nation as <hi>Jeruſalem, a praiſe in the earth,</hi> Iſa. 62. 7.</p>
