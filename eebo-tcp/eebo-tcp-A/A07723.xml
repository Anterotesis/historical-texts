            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Spaine</hi> was nurſed with the milke of paganiſme, vertue not knowne; nor God honoured, there liued a people ſo ripe in ſin, that the kéene edge of ſhames ſickle, lay euen ready whetted to reape them downe for confuſions harueſt: yet the ſubiects then liuing where not ſo wicked as the King vitious: a King we name him, (if illuſtrious title of maieſtie, may grace ſo pernitious a foe to nature with ſo royall a ſtile) his birth was fatall, for when the midwife pulled him from the cradle of his conception, the earthquake, and heauen rained blood: his parents ominous, the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by wolues, the other burnt to death by thunder: his youth full vnlucky chances, his age tirannous and miſchieuous, and all his life ſubiect to blacke miſdéedes. When his parets by heauens wrath had ended thus their, dates, he raigned King, and wore the imperiall Diademe, but ſuch a King, good men thought neuer ſprong from wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans wombe. <hi>Morindos</hi> for ſo we name him, being ſeated vpon the throane of maieſtie, ruled not in loue but by force, making his nobles flaues to his ſinne, and their
<pb facs="tcp:21401:4"/>
wiues, feeders of his luſt: for every day in the yeare hee had a ſeuerall concubine, all young, beawtifull, and loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: nature framed their bodies faire, though ſinne made their ſoules blacke: for both art and riches indeuored to delight his inſatiate deſires: earths chiefeſt pleaſures were at his command: and all the lullabies of content, rockt him in the cradle of ſecuritie: thus careles of heauens wrath, he more honoured the Deuill, then he loued God: and what was the vileſt to nature, he moſt doted vppon. But now after al theſe pleaſures of his wanton youth, the kind imbraces of his fayre concubines, which like earthly Angells made him happy in natures ſports, he wickedly fell inamored vppon one of the Deuills blacke ſaints, one <hi>Madam Miracola,</hi> a Witch of damnation, now burning in heli for her blacke deedes: this <hi>Madam Miracola</hi> borne of noble parentage, brought vp in the deepeſt artes, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Magick charmes, and incantations, who hauing ſpent ſeauen yeres in that déepe miſtery of coniuration, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſleeping without the ſoſciety of ſpirrits, fayries, goblins, or nigtly ſhapes: hir chiefeſt ſtudie and ayme was at principallitie, to rule ſole Queens and gouernour of the Kingdome, and no way was there to attaine to that imperial ſeat, but by marying with king <hi>Morindos,</hi> though not a match fit, he being diſcended royally, ſhe but nobly: yet by ſorceries, witchcrafts, and magicke deuiſes, ſhee obtained hir purpoſe, and in this manner obtained it.</p>
               <p>Vppon a time when King <hi>Morindos,</hi> in the height of his reuelles, whilſt ſome of his faireſt concubines, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before him naked in their cambrick ſmockes: the more to inkindle luſtes fire, ſhee entred the chamber of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious ſports, with a maske of wonder, the like neuer ſeene in Princes court: for all the Maskers (except hir ſelfe) were infernall ſpirrits, viſſible, but not tanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all in the ſhape of young Ladis, attired in more changeable ſilkes then the collours of the Rainebowe: hir
<pb facs="tcp:21401:4"/>
ſelfe in a robe of ſuch richnes, as it ſémed to exceede the glorie of the ſunne for brightnes: hir owne bodie ſhee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathed and ſupled with a water of ſuch inchantment, that what man ſoeuer firſt ſet eye vppon her, either preſent loue or preſent death, had deſtinie allotted him: for well knew ſhe that no man preſumed his preſence, during this time of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This Madam <hi>Miracola,</hi> aſiſted by the blacke ſtates of hell, by deluſions won the kings loue: whoſe vnconſtant eyes, no ſooner firt their inflecting beames on this killing cokatrice: but all on a ſodaine fire his loue inflamed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could quench it, but hir loue ioyned to his, which were imediately ſealed togither: loue, deſire, and luſt, ſo conſpired againſt his bewitched heart, that he preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the chamber of his intifing damſels, and ſhee of hir deluding ſpirits: remaining then but two bodies, two hearts, and two tongues, he began to reueale loues ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in this manner: Madam quoth he (knowing hir to be a long attender in his court) good or euill fortune hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted me, and now thy preſent loue or hate, muſt either glorifie me with earthly happineſſe, or ſend me wandring to the dark ſome walkes of death, where no ſoſcietie but crawling wormes and dead mens benes are reſident: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me not therefore good Madam, I am this countries Potentate, I can commaund both wealths and power, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, towers, and townes: Stateſmen ſtoope, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kneele vnto my ſoote: royalties, dignitles, and al other kingly promotions, are at my diſpoſing: vnto my pleaſurs all the land ſubmits: delights are my vaſſels, both land, &amp; ſea as ſubiects ſtriue to make me happy: I am an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, be thou my Goddeſſe, take all theſe honours, I will attend on thee, Ile bee thy ſubiect, thy ſeruant, I will kiſſe thy foote: deny not my loue for thou haſt bewitcht my heart, inchaunted me, fired mee with a quenchleſſe flame, all my boddie burnes and nothing but the ſweete Dewe of the graunt can
<pb facs="tcp:21401:5"/>
quallifie it: make mee either vnfortunate or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſweet Madame. This being breathed from his longing ſoule, ſhe farre more tractable to loues motions then he, made a full concluſion of a willing acceptance in this fort: I haue a minde imperious monarche (ſaid ſhe) ſoaring vp to the batlements of heauen, no bace deſires nor lowebred thought, ſhall any whit aſpire my princely will: I ayme at a kingly bed, where maisſtie ſleepes, whoſe chamber is imperious, garded with commanding ſtateſmen: ſeauen weary winters, and as many ſommers haue my hopes bene climing vp this kingly ladder, and now on the top of fortunes wheele am I fallen into a princes boſome: in louing me (great King) thou conquereſt fate, thou ſubiecteſt hell, thou maiſt (by my aſſiſtance) commaund legions of the black hoaſt to houer ouer thy Pallace, and in the twinkling of an eye, blaſt vp all thy wicked conſperators: if our mindes but once proue equall in the cheare of ſoueraingty, the earth ſhall be farre too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for thy gouernement: my magick charmes ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowell the earth, rip vp her boſome, ranſack her rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for thy vſe: my magicke charmes for thee, and for thy pleaſure ſhall empty the vaſt Drean and cram thy kingdome with thoſe riches that mans eye hath not ſéene ſince the worlds creation: my charmes for thy content ſhall paue thy Court with pearles, emrodes and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds: commaund great king, and the marble ſtones that now compaſe thy pallace ſhal daunce, and the ayer like ſinging Cherubins ſound vs heauenly hermony: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents delights, pleaſures, ioyes, and all the ſolaces of heauen and earth, ſhall be thy attendants by inueſting me thy equall in great maieſtie: thus, and in this manner did ſhe clime the ſupremacie, and tyed vpon her backe the title of a Quéeue. Being both inchanted thus, and intangled in the ſnares of deſire, they imediately tied <hi>Himens</hi> knot, aband that none ſunders but death: the mariage they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized the ſame night, not able to ſtay the mornings riſe,
<pb facs="tcp:21401:5"/>
but as blacke thoughts haue blacke euents, ſo in blacke manner was this mariage celibrated, it was even at the midle of night, when the Scritch-owle, Kockes, and Doremice, ſleepe in foggy miſtes: it was euen at that houre when the ghoaſtes of dead men walke, when mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers dreame of villany, even when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth had her fable garments on, was this ſacred knot vnited, both being impatient of delay, he burning in luſt, ſhe aſpiring a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, conuerted the holy temple to a mariage bed: be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer black this deede of hell, and neuer be it ſould but with a trembling tongue, for neuer was night more darke then this: the fable curtines of the ayer were all as pitch, and ſeemd ſo hide this poluted ſinne: the earth caſt vp ſuch a miſty vapour, that extingguiſhed both fire and creſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: art could not make one candles flame, nor any meane of brightneſſe to beholde each other: ſo wicked was this enterpriſe of theirs, that both heauen &amp; earth ſhewed fatall prodegies, and euerie thing (that diſmall night) grew different from nature: nothing was heard but bowling Dogges, croaking Loades, and hiſſing ſnakes, vnknowne voyces bellowed in the court, and the polluted Temple ſo vilely ſtained, was compaſſed about with gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits, Fire-drakes and walking Goblins. But marke now the ſtrangeſt of al wonders, euen at the verie inſtant when the ſeede of procreation conioyned; euen as it were a crie of mandrakes ſtrooke the King into a madnes, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming heauen till his tongue grew dumbe, his eyes blinde, his eares deaſe, his ioyntes numbe, and all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye ſhapeleſſe. And as a Beare new whelpt like a lampe of fleſh without faſhion, lay claſped in the armes of this new made Queene. But now when the morning came, and that the light of heauen ſommond all creatures from ſleepe, the Nobles of his court came to his bed, five, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to giue them both a ioyfull good morrow, but euen as their lips gaue way to their tongues paſſage, their eies eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied this fearefull accident: a iudgement that heauen hath

ſildome yet ſhowne, which was a king, deafe, dumb, blinde and ſenceles, by breathing life: which ſtraunge fight ſtroke the nobles into ſuch a maze, that without any further ſpeach they forſooke the court, confidently thinking it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie, in harboring ſo vile a monſter as this king was. Now this new made Queene or damned inchantreſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing purchaſed a kingdome by hirblacke proceedings, was ſo blinded with the greatneſſe of maieſtie, and ſo rauiſhed with the brightneſſe of a crowne, being now ſole Queene and gouernour thereof, made a careleſſe ſport of gods indg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hauing in hir court none left but paraſites, and flatterers, ſuch as are commonly the right hands to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, made the greateſt ſinners the moſt honorable, and held the vitious in beſt regard: the deformed ſhape of the king hauing life but no ſences, ſhe cauſed to be put in a braſen coffen, and fed him dayly with humane blood, which ſhe poured into his mouth through quilles of filuer: the ſucceſſe hereof you ſhall heare in the next chapter, and what a ſtraunge conception ſhe had after this firſt night of hir mariage.</p>
