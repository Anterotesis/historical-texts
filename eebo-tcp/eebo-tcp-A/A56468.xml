            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A CONFERENCE About the Next SUCCESSION TO THE Crown of England:</p>

            <p>The Second containeth The Speech of a Temporal Lawyer, about the particular Titles of all such as do, or may pretend (within <hi>England</hi> or without) to the next Succession.</p>

            <p>THE first declareth, by many Proofs and Arguments, That the next Propinquity or Ancestry of Bloud alone, though it were certainly known, yet it is not sufficient to be admitted to a Crown, without other Conditions and Circumstances requisite be found also in the person pretendent.</p>
            <p>THE second examineth the Titles and Pretensions of all such as may have Claim or Action to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> at this day; what may be said for them, and what against them. And in the end, though he leave the matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme doubtful, as touching the best right, yet he giveth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conjectures about some persons that are likest to prevail.</p>

            <p>TWo principal Causes among others, (Right Honourable,) are wont to invite men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any Book or Treatise to a Person in Authority; The one, Private Duty and Obligation, the other, Publick Utility, in respect that the Master may concern that Person for the Common Good. And to confess the truth, both of these jointly have moved me at this time to present unto your Honour, above others, the two Books ensuing, which contain a Conference had in <hi>Holland</hi> not long since, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>out the Pretences and Pretenders to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as your Honour shall perceive by the Preface of each Book, and therefore hereof I shall need say no more, but only declare the aforesaid two Causes of this Dedication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then I say, that my particular obligation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Honours Person, riseth partly of good Turns and Benefits received by some Friends of mine at your Lordships hands, in your last Voyage and Exploits in <hi>France,</hi> but principally of far greater Favours receiv'd from your Noble Ancestors, I mean not only your Father whose untimely death was to <hi>England</hi> no small Wound, but of your Grand-father also, that worthy Knight, Sir <hi>Walter Deverux,</hi> who though he lived not to come to those Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whereunto he was born; yet left he behind him so rare a memory for his excellent Parts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Wit, Feature of Body, Courtesy, and other such Noble Commendations, as none in <hi>England</hi> perhaps the like in our time, wherein also hath lived your Honours Great Grandfather, Sir <hi>Henry Deverux Visconde Ferys</hi> well remembred yet by divers of my said Friends obliged unto him as also recorded by our <hi>English</hi> Histories, as well for his Merits and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, as in like manner for his Match with the Heir of the most Famous and Noble House of the
<pb facs="tcp:104608:3"/>

VIII.</note> whereof also your Honour is known to be descended, and to hold at this day, as well their Nobility of Blood, as Dignity of Title, and this shall serve in this place for my particular obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, whereof perhaps hereafter upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I may give further relation and testimony to the World, in token of my Gratitude.</p>
            <p>But for the second Point of <hi>Publick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility,</hi> I thought no man more fit than your Honour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate these two Books unto, which treat of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for that no man is in more high and eminent Place or Dignity at this day in our Realm, than your self, whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect your Nobility, or Calling, or Favour with your Prince, or high Liking of the People, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no man like to have a greater part or sway in deciding of this great Affair, (when time shall come for that determination,) then your Honour, and those that will assist you, and are likest to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Fame and Fortune:</p>
            <p>And for that it is not convenient for your Honour to be unskilful in a matter which concerneth your Person and the whole Realm, so much as this doth, and finding this Conference had by two Learned Lawyers, to handle the Question very pithily and exactly, and yet with much Modesty, and without offence of any, and with particular affection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to Her Majesty, and with special care of Her Safety: I thought not expedient to let it lie unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, as also judged that no Hands were fitter to receive the same, nor any Protection more secure or plausible, than that of your Honour, whom God long preserve in all true Honour and Felicity to the Comfort of Your Lordships Faithful Servants and Clients, and to the Publick Benefit of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: From my Chamber in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> this last of <hi>December.</hi> 1593.</p>

               <item>That Succession to government by nearness of bloud is not by Law of Nature, or Divine, but only by humane and positive Laws of every paticular Commonwealth, and consequently, may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on just causes be altered by the same, Chap. 1. fol. 1.</item>
               <item>Of the particular form of Monarchies and Kingdoms, and the different Laws whereby they are to be obtained, holden, and governed in divers Countries, according as each Commonwealth hath chosen and established, Chap. 2. f. 12.</item>
               <item>Of the great reverence and respect due to Kings, and yet how divers of them, have been lawfully chastised by their common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths for their misgovernment, and of the good and prosperous success that God commonly hath given to the same, and much more to the putting back of an unworthy pretender. Chap. 3. f. 30.</item>
               <item>Wherein consisteth principally the lawfulness of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Princes, which in the former chapter is mentioned, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest Princes have in their subjects goods or lives: how Oaths do bind or may be broken by subjects towards their Princes: and finally the difference between a good King and a Tyrant Chap. 4. f. 51.</item>
               <item>Of the Coronation of Princes, and manner of their admitting to their authority, and the Oaths which they do make in the same, unto the Commonwealth, for their good government. Chap. 5. f. 66.</item>
               <item>What is due to onely succession by Birth, and what interest or right an Heir apparent hath to the Crown, before he is Crowned or admitted by the Commonweath, and how justly he may be put back, if he have not the parts requisite. Chap. 6. f. 98.</item>
               <item>How the next in succession by propinquity of bloud, have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been put back by the Commonwealth, and others further off admitted in their places, even in those Kingdoms where suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession prevaileth, with many examples of the Kingdoms of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Chap. 7. f 113.</item>
               <item>Of divers other examples out of the States of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for proof that the next in bloud are sometimes put back from succession, and how God hath approved the same with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Chap. 8. f. 132.</item>
               <item>What are the principal points which a Commonwealth ought to respect in admitting or excluding any Prince, wherein is handled largely also of the diversity, of Religions, and other such Causes Chap. 9. f. 158.</item>

               <head>The Preface, containing the occasion of this, Treatise with the subject, purpose, and parts thereof.</head>
               <p>THere chanced not long ago (I mean in the months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> of this last year <hi>93.</hi>) to meet in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> certain Gentlemen of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, qualities and affections, as well in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as otherwise: (yet the most part <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi>) and they had been in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, studied different Arts, and followed unlike professions: some of Soulders, some of Lawyers both Temporal and Civil, others of meer travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to learn experience and policy: And for that the advice which daily came from <hi>England</hi> at that time, (the Parliament being then in hand) gave occasion to discourse of <hi>English</hi> affairs,<note place="margin">Occasions of meeting</note> they fell into divers points concerning the same: but yet none was treated so largely or so seriously, as was the matter of succession and competitors to the Crown, for that it was presumed a great while,<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed.</note> that some thing would be determined thereof in that Parliament, though one or two of the wisest of that company, held ever the contrary opinion. But when at length news was brought, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all had been done therein, but rather that one or two (as was reported) had been check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or committed for speaking in the same:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wentworth</hi>
                  </note> then came it in question among the Gentlemen, what
<pb facs="tcp:104608:5"/>
should be the cause of such proceeding in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so weighty and so necessary for all <hi>English</hi> men to know?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</note>But two Gentlemen Lawyers of the company, one of the common Law, and the other a Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, alledged so many reasons for justifying the Queens Majesties doings in this behalf, as all did seem satisfied: for that it was made plain, that it could not stand with the safety either of Her Majesty, or of the Realm, or of the party himself who should be preferred, that any decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Heir apparent should be made, during the life of Her Majesty that now is, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous soever the delay thereof may be esteemed for the time to come.</p>
               <p>And so the end of this Speech brought in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the beginning of another, to wit, what were like to be these dangers, and who might be likest of the pretenders to prevail after Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; about which matter, there was much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed by divers Parties, but the conclusion of all was, that both these points remained very doubtful, but much more the second, who should prevail, of the competitors, which they said, did make the former point less doubtful of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of dangers, that thereby did hang over the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> though it wanted not doubt also in particular, what and where they should fall, for (said they) wheresoever many pretenders of the bloud Royal are known to be competitors to a Crown, there cannot chuse but many perils also must be imminent to the Realm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:104608:5"/>To this, one of the company said, that he did not see how there could be either so many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Crown as the day before had been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in that place (for the Common Lawyer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named newly come out of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> had told them that he had heard of some <hi>9.</hi> or <hi>10.</hi> or more Plots that were debated within the Realm, for so many pretenders) or if there were any such great number descended of the Bloud Royal, yet their titles could not be so doubtful, seeing it was an easie matter to discern, who was next in discent of bloud, and who not.</p>
               <p>Not so easie, quoth this Gentleman Lawyer, for that although it cannot be denied, but that there is among all such as may pretend at this day, a certain known order and degree of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in bloud to some King or Queen that hath possessed the Crown before them: and in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent it is known also commonly, who descendeth of the elder house, and who of the younger, and other such like vulgar circumstances: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, for that there be many other points considerable in this affair, as the right of the first stock, whereof each part doth spring,<note place="margin">Sucession doubtful and why.</note> the disable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same stock afterwards by attainders or otherwise: the Bastardies or other particular impediments that may have fallen upon each discent or branch thereof: all these things (said he) may alter the course of common supposed right, in him or her, that is taken to be next in bloud, as proving them not to be truly and lawfully the nearest, though they be the next in degree.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Three or four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal heads of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note>As for example (said he) the whole multitude of competitors or pretendors which I conceive may come in consideration, or have action or claim to the Crown after her Majesty that now is, may be reduced to three or four first heads or principal stocks, to wit, to the House of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> a part, as descended of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gant</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> by his first Wife <hi>Blanch,</hi> sole Heir of the Dutchess of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:104608:6"/>
to have joyned these two houses together, and from this man by his two daughters (for of his Son who was King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth only the Queen that now is) there hath proceeded the house of <hi>Scotland</hi> divided into the families of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Arabella,</hi> as also the Progeny of the two Earls yet living of <hi>Hartford</hi> and <hi>Darby.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto these three heads, which are commonly known to all men, some of our days do add also a fourth, which may seem more ancient then either of these three, to wit by the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> who are descended divers ways of the bloud royal of <hi>England</hi> as may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be declared, whose Heir at this day by lineal descent is the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> named <hi>Dona Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella Clara Eugenia</hi> daughter to King <hi>Philip.</hi> So that hereby we come to discover, no less then ten or eleven families that may pretend, and have all of them friends in <hi>England,</hi> and else where (as yesterday I told you) who do not fail in secret to negotiate and lay plots for them, for that there are none of these, so far off, but to their friends it seemeth (the times standing as they do) that reasons may be given for their preferment, and good hope conceived of prevailing.</p>
               <p>You do well to add (said a Captain there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) the times standing as they do,<note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stances of the time present.</note> or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as they are like to stand, when this matter must come to tryal, at what time, I believe, not you Lawyers, but we Souldiers must determine this title, and then (no doubt) if there were not only these ten by you named, but twenty more also of the Bloud Royal, that would pretend, and had
<pb facs="tcp:104608:7"/>
friends and money to stand by them, we should admit their causes to examination, and perhaps give sentence for him, that by your laws would soonest be excluded, for when matters come to snatching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is hard to say who shall have the better part.</p>
               <p>I do not add this circumstance of the time (said the Lawyer) as though it were the only or principal point which maketh doubtful the matter of Succession, though I confess that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereunto greatly, in respect of the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of mans affections at this day in Religion, which do decline them commonly to judge for him whom they best love: but besides this, I do say, that were the times never so quiet, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion never so uniform, yet are there great doubts in many mens heads, about the lawfulness of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Petitions of the Families before-named; but if you add unto this; the said wonderful diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in matters of Religion also, which this time yieldeth: you shall find the event much more doubtful; and consequently it is no marvel though many may remain in hope to prevail, seeing that where many are admitted to stand for a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there divers may have propability also of speeding.</p>
               <p>An example you may take (said the Civilian Lawyer) in the <hi>Roman</hi> Conclave,<note place="margin">The <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave.</note> at the <hi>Popes</hi> election, where, among three or four score Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals that enter in for Electors, few there are that have not hope also to be elected; not for that they see themselves, all well qualified as others, but because often times, when divers that are more
<pb facs="tcp:104608:7"/>
forward, by likelyhood cannot be agreed upon: it falleth to the lot of him that is farthest off, and so it may among your pretenders (quoth he) in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your example (said the Temporal Lawyer) confirmeth somewhat of that I mean,<note place="margin">Succession includeth also some kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> though it be not altogether in like matter, or manners; for that the <hi>Pope</hi> is made by Election, and here we talk of a King by Succession.</p>
               <p>Your Succession, said the Civilian, includeth also an Election or approbation of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and so doth the succession of all Kings in Christendom besides, as well appeareth by the manner of their new admision at their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the people are demanded again, <hi>if they be content to accept such a man for their King:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of this more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4, 5.</note> though his title of nearness by bloud be never so clear. And therefore much more it is like to be in this case of <hi>English</hi> pretenders now, where their lawful nearness in bloud is so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as you have signified; and so I do come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your former proposition, of the doubtfulness of the next Successor in <hi>England,</hi> with another reason besides that which you have alledged of the ambiguity of their true propinquity in bloud: for I say further, that albeit the nearness of each mans succession in bloud, were evidently known, yet were it very uncertain (as things now stand in <hi>England</hi> and in the rest of Christendom round about) who should prevail, for that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a man to be next only in bloud, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to pretend a Crown, but that other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also must concur; which if they want, the bare

best of all other ways; but yet there may hapen out such extraordinary cases sometimes, against this ordinary rule, as your common law must needs take also consideration of them, except it will be contrary to all other law and reason, both divine and humane; as for example, if it should fall out, that the next in bloud should be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fool or a mad-man: if he should be taken by <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors</hi> in his infancy and brought up in their religion, and would maintain the same in your Country, with all his forces, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like urgent cases, wherein it is not probable, but that your common law must needs have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration, then of the bare propinquity of bloud only, for that otherwise it should be a very imperfect law, that hath not provided for accidents so weighty and important, as these are, for saving and conserving of your common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>At this speech, the residue of the company began to smile, to see the two Lawyers grow into some heat and comparison of their professions.

                  <hi>that the next successor of</hi> England <hi>must needs be very doubtful:</hi> they rrquested them both with very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that each one would be content to prove his assertion a part, to wit, the temporal Lawyer to shew that the titles and pretenions of all those ten or eleven families of the <hi>English</hi> bloud Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which remain at this day, are ambigous and doubtful, according to the common laws of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He examples before alledged, (said the Civil Lawyer) of a Mad or Furious Heir apparent, or of one that were by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Turk or Moor in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or by nature deprived of his Wit, or senses, do plainly prove that propinquity of Birth or Blood alone, without other circumstances, is not sufficient to be preferred to a Crown: for that no Reason or Law, Religion or Wisdom in the World, can admit such persons to the Government of a Common-wealth, by whom no good, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction may be expected to the same; seeing that Government was ordained for the benefit of the weal-publick, and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>And albeit some one or two in these our days have affirmed the contrary,<note place="margin">Bellay apollog. pro reg. cap. 20.</note> and publisht the same in Writing for the defence, flattery, or advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some Prince whom they favour, affirming that even a Fool, Mad or Furious man, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise so wicked as he would endeavour to destroy the Common-wealth, were to be admitted to the Seat-Royal, without further consideration, if he be next in Blood: Yet this is so manifestly against all reason, and Conscience, and against the first end and purpose of Institution of Commonwealths,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104608:11"/>
and Magistrats, as it shall not need to be refuted in this place, albeit afterwards there will not want place and commodity for the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Not only Succession sufficient.</note>Hereof it doth ensue, that some other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also must needs be requisite, for coming to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Succession, besides the only propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or priority in Blood, and that these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must be assigned and limited out by some higher authority then is that of the Prince himself, who is bound and limited thereby, and yet it seems evident they are not prescribed by any Law of Nature or Divine, for that then they should be both immutable, and the self-same in all Countries; (as God and Nature are one, and the same to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change,) where notwithstanding we see, that these conditions and circumstances of succeeding by Birth, are diverse or different in different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; as also they are subject to changes according to the diversity of Kingdoms, Realms, and People, as after shall be shewed more in particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are forced to conclude that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Countrey and Commonwealth hath prescribed these conditions to it self, and hath authority to do the same.</p>
               <p>For better proof whereof, it is first of all to be supposed,<note place="margin">That no particular form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that albeit sociability or inclination to live together in company, Man with Man, (whereof ensueth both City and Common-wealth, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> gathers in his first Book of Politiques) be of nature, and consequently also of God, that is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature: Though Government in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Jurisdiction of Magistrates, which doth follow necessarily upon this living together in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; be also of nature, yet the particular form or manner of this or that Government, in this or that fashion, as to have many Governours, few, or one; and these either Kings, Dukes, Earls, or the like: Or that they should have this or that Authority,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104608:11"/>
more or less, for longer or shorter time, or be taken by Succession or Election, themselves and their Children, or next in Blood; All these things (I say) are not by Law either Natural or Divine, (for then as hath been said, they should be all one in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Nations, seeing God and Nature is one to all) but they are ordained by particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Laws of every Country, as afterwards more largely shall be proved.</p>
               <p>But now that Sociability in mankind,<note place="margin">To live in Company, is Natural to man, and the ground of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealths.</note> or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to live in company, is by Nature, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ordained by God, for the common benefit of all, is an easie thing to prove; seeing that all ground of Realms and Common-wealths depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of this point, as of their first Principle, for that a Common-wealth is nothing else but the good Government, of a multitude gathered together, to live in one; And therefore all Old Philosophers, Law-makers, and Wise men, that have treated of Government or Common-wealths; as <hi>Plato</hi> in his ten most Excellent Books, which he wrote of this matter, Intituling them, <hi>Of the Common-wealth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato de repub. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero de repub.

And <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that perhaps excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them both, in eight Books which he called his Politiques; all these I say do make their entrance to treat of the Commonwealth Affairs, from this first principle, to wit, <hi>That man by Nature is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable, and inclined to live in Company</hi>; Whereof do proceed, first, all Private Houses, then Villages, then Towns, then Cities, then Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths.</p>
               <p>This ground and Principle then do they prove by divers evident reasons; as first,<note place="margin">Divers Praeses.</note> for that in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, never so wild or barbarous, we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that by one way or other,<note place="margin">

                  </note> wherefore wittily said <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of his Book of Politiques, <hi>That he which flieth to live in Society, is either,</hi> Deus aut Bellua, <hi>a God or a Beast</hi>; for that either he doth it because he hath no need of any which is proper to God, or else for that he will do good to none, and seeleth not that Natural Instinct, which man hath to live in Conversation, which is a sign rather of a beast then of a man.</p>

               <p>And I have been the longer in speaking of this natural instinct to Society, for that it is the first fountain of all the rest, that ensueth in a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as hath been said: For of this come Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Villages, Towns, Castles, Cities, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, all which <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named, doth prove to be of nature; for that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104608:13"/>
this first inclination to live together, (whereof all those other things do spring,) is of nature, as hath been declared.</p>
               <p>Out of this, is the second point before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deduced, to wit,<note place="margin">That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates is also of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that Government also, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and Jurisdiction of Magistrates, is likewise of nature, for that it followeth the former; and seeing that it is impossible for men to live together with help and commodity of the one, to the other, except there be some Magistrate or other to keep order among them, without which order there is nothing else to be hoped,<note place="margin">

               <p>These two points then are of Nature, to wit, the Common-wealth, and Government of the same by Magistrates; but what kind of Government each Common-wealth will have, whether <hi>Democretia</hi>?<note place="margin">Particular form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is free.</note> which is Popular Government by the People it self, as <hi>Athens, Thebes,</hi> and many other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> had in old time, and as the Cantons or <hi>Switzers</hi> at this day have: Or else <hi>Aristocretia,</hi> which is the Government of some certain chosen number of the Best; as the <hi>Romans</hi> many years were governed by Councels and Senators, and at this day the States of this Countrey of <hi>Holland</hi> do imitate the same, or else Monarchia, which is the Regiment of one, and this again either of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, King, Duke, Earl or the like: These par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Forms of Government (I say) are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God or Nature, as the other two points before, for then they should be all one in all Nations as the other are, seeing God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are one to all, (as often hath been said) but these particular Forms are left unto every Nation or Countrey to chuse that Form of Government,

               <p>In like manner is it evident, that as the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth hath this authority to chuse and change her Government, so hath she also to limit the same with what Laws and Conditions she pleaseth, whereof ensueth the great diversity of Authority and power which each one of the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth limiteth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Authority.</note> as for example, the Councils of <hi>Rome</hi> were but for one year, other Officers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates were for more or less time, as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth did alot them: The Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> at this day are for their Lives; (except in certain cases, wherein they may be Deposed) and those of <hi>Genua</hi> only for two years, and their Power (as I have said) is very small, and much limited, and their Heirs have no claim or pretence at all after them to that Dignity, as the Children and next of Kin of other Dukes of <hi>Italy</hi> have, though in different sort also: For that the Dukedoms of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> are limited only to Heirs Male, and for defect thereof, to return to the Pope or See of <hi>Rome; Florence</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> for like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defects are to return to the Empire, and do not pass

to the Heirs Female, or to the next of Kin, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> and some others do.</p>
               <p>And now if we respect God and Nature, as well might all these Governments follow one Law, as so different, for that neither God nor Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth any of these particular Forms, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth with any that the Common-wealth it self appointeth; and so it is to be believed, that God and Nature concurred as well with <hi>Italy</hi> when it had but one Prince, as now when it hath so many, and the like with <hi>Germany,</hi> and the like also with <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which once was one Common-wealth only under Dukes and Marquesses of <hi>Austria,</hi> and now are devided into thirteen Cantons or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, under Popular Magistrates of their own, as hath been said: So as when men talk of <hi>a Natural Prince, or Natural Successor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Natural Prince.</note> (as many times I have heard the word used,) if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of one that is born within the same Realm or Countrey, and so of our own natural blood, it hath some sense, though he may be both good or bad, (and none hath been worse or more Cruel many times then home born Princes:) But if it be meant as though any Prince had his particular Government or Interest to succeed by Institution of Nature, it is ridiculous, for that Nature giveth it not, as hath been declared, but the particular Constitution of every Common-wealth within it self; and so much for this first point, which must be the ground to all the rest that I have to say.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy the best Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>First of all then, is to be considered, that of all other Forms of Government, the Monarchy of a King in it self, appeareth to be the most excellent and perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so doth hold not only <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his forenamed Books of Politiques, and namely in his third; (with this only condition, that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by Laws,) but <hi>Seneca</hi> also and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Morals,<note place="margin">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104608:16"/>
so we read that among the <hi>Syrians,</hi>

                  <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> their first Governours were Kings: and when the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did ask a King at the hands of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which was a thousand years before the coming of Christ, they alleadged for one reason,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 8.</note> that all Nations round about them had Kings for their Governours; and at the very same time, the chiefest Cities and Commonwealths of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the <hi>Laceaemonians, Athenians, Corinthians</hi> and others, whereof divers afterwards took other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments unto themselves, for the abuses in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government committed;<note place="margin">Dionys. Haly l. 5. Cornel. Tacit. l. 3. Cicero l. 1. Offic.</note> at that time were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Kings as at large proveth <hi>Dionysius Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnessas, Cornelius Tacitus, Cicero</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> also began with Kings, as before I have noted, and the reason of this is, for that as our Christian Doctors do gather,<note place="margin">Hierom. l. 2. epist. 12. Chrisost. ho. 23.</note> (especially St. <hi>Hierome</hi> and St. <hi>Chrisostom</hi>) this kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment resembleth most of all the Government of God, that is but one: it representeth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of one Sun that lighteth all the Planets, of one Soul in the Body that governs all the Powers and Members thereof; and finally they shew it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be most conform unto Nature, by example of the Bees which do chuse unto themselves a King, and do live under a Monarchy as the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all other Governments; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose also I have heard alleadged sometimes by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers those words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Subjecti estoti omni humanae creaturae propter Deum, sive regi quasi pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenti: sive ducibus ab eo missis, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Be you subject of every humane creature, for Gods cause, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to a King, as the most excellent, or to Dukes sent by God for the punishment of evil men, and praise of the good. Out of which words some do note two points;<note place="margin">Two Points to be noted.</note> first that as one the one side the Apostle doth plainly teach that the Magistrates authority is from God, by his first institution, in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104608:17"/>
that he sayeth, we must be subject to them for Gods cause; so on the other side, he calleth it a <hi>humane Creature,</hi> or a thing created by man for that by mans free choice this particular Form of Government (as all other also) is appointed in every Common-wealth, as before hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: And that by mans Election and consent, the same is laid upon some particular man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, according to the Laws of every Countrey, all which maketh it rightly to be called both a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creature, and yet from God.</p>
               <p>The second point which divers do note out of these words,<note place="margin">How St. <hi>Peter</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a King most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> is, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth a King most excellent, which though it may be understood in respect of the Dukes Authority, whereof imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly there followeth mention: Yet may it seem also to be taken and verified of Kingly Authority, in respect of all other Governments, seeing that at this time when the Apostles write this Epistle, the chief Governour of the World, was not called King, but Emperor; and therefore seeing in such a time St. <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth the state of Kingly Government to be most excellent, it may seem he meant it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, signifying thereby that this is the best kind of Government among all others; though to confess the truth between the Title of King and Emperor, there is little or no difference in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but only in name, for that the Authority is equal, every King is an Emperor in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>And finally the excellency of this Government above all other, is not only proved by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof in it self, as for that it is most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,<note place="margin">Utilites of a Kingdom and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</note> Simple and conform unto Nature, and most resembling the Government of God himself, as hath been said, but by the effects also and utility that it bringeth unto the Subjects, with far less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences then any other Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104608:17"/>
whatsoever, if we compare them together: For in the Monarchy of one King, there is more Unity, Agreement and Conformity, and thereby also celerity in dispatching of business, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Common-wealth, then where many heads be, less Passions also in one man then in many; as for example in <hi>Democratia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cicero l. 1. offic. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratia.</note> where the Common people do bear the chief sway, which is <hi>Bellua mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum capitum,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> wisely said, that is, a beast of many Heads, there is nothing but sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, trouble, tumults, outrages and injustices com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon every little occasion, especially where Crafty and Cunning men may be admitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense or asswage them with Sugred words, such as were the Orators in <hi>Athens,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> that had this Government, and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other such popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and plausible men, who could move the waves, raise up the winds, and inkindle the fire of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar peoples affections, passions or furies at their pleasure; by which we see that of all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, these of Popular Government have have soonest come to ruine, which might be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only by old examples of <hi>Greece, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but also of many Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Florence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miseries of Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bolonia, Siena, Pisa, Arezzo, Spoleto, Perugia, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi> and others, which upon the fall or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (under which they were before) took unto themselves Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein they were so tossed with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sedition, Mutinies, and banding of Factions, as they could never have end thereof, until after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Murthers, Massacres and Innundation of Blood, they came in the end to be under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of some one Prince or other, as at this day they remain: so that of all other Governments this is the worst.</p>
               <p>The second Form, which is called <hi>Oligarchia</hi> or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104608:18"/>
                  <hi>Aristocratia</hi> (for that a few and those presumed to be the best, are joyned together in Authority,) as it doth participate some thing of both the other Governments, to wit, of <hi>Monarchia</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratia,</hi> or rather tempereth them both; so hath it both good and evil in it, but yet it inclineth more to the evil; for the disunion that commonly by mans infirmity and malice, is among those heads, for which cause the States before-named of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> which were wont to have simply this Government of <hi>Aristocratia,</hi> in that their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was by certain chuse Senators, were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the end to chuse Dukes also, as Heads of their Senates for avoiding of dissention, and so they have them at this day, though their authority be but small as hath been said.</p>
               <p>We see also by the examples of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> where Government of <hi>Aristocratia</hi> took place, that the Division and Factions among the Senators of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. liv. l. 30.</note> was the cause why Aid and Succour was not sent to <hi>Hannibal</hi> their Captain in <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eutrop. l. 3. Oros. l. 5. &amp; 6.</note> after his so great and Important Victory at <hi>Cannas,</hi> which was the very cause of the saving of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the loss of their own. As also afterwards the Emulations, Discord, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators among themselves in the Affairs and Contentions of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla,</hi> and of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> was the occasion of all their destruction, and of the Common-wealth with them.</p>
               <p>Evident then it is, that of all other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Monarchy is the best, and least subject to the Inconveniences that other Governments have; and if the Prince that governeth alone, and hath Supream Authority to himself,<note place="margin">The cause why Laws be added to Kings.</note> as he resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth God in this point of sole Government, so could he resemble him also, in Wise, Discreet, and Just Government, and in ruling without Passion;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104608:18"/>
no doubt, but that nothing more excellent in the world could be desired for the perfect felicity of his Subjects; but for that a King or Prince is a man as others be, and thereby not only subject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Judgment, but also to passionate affections in his will; for this cause it was necessary that the Commonwealth, as it gave him this great power over them, so it should assign him also the best helps that might be, for directing and rectifying both his will and judgment, and make him therein as like in Government to God, whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth, as mans frailty can reach unto.</p>
               <p>For this consideration they assigned to him first of all the assistance and direction of Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to govern; which Law (<hi>Aristotle</hi> saith) <hi>Est mens quaedam nullo perturbata affectu</hi>;<note place="margin">Arist. l. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pol. c. vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. III. Of Kings lawfully chastised by their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, for their Misgovernment; and of the good and prosperous Success that God hath commonly given to the same.</head>
               <p>THe Company was no sooner come together the next morning, but they were all at the Civilian Lawyer to perform his promise, and to prosecute the matter he had propounded the night before; To whom he answered, You require of me (if I be not deceived) two points joyntly to be proved unto you:<note place="margin">Two points to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> The first, That Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths have chastized sometimes lawfully their lawful Princes, though never so lawfully descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or otherwise lawfully put in possession of their Crown: And secondly, That this hath fallen out ever, or for the most part, commodious to the weal publick; and that it may seem that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and prospered the same, by the good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and Successors that ensued thereof. Which two points I am content (quoth he) to shew unto you by some examples, for that the reasons hereof have in part been declared before, and shall be more in particular hereafter; but yet must I do this with the protestation before-mentioned, that nothing be taken out of this my Speech,<note place="margin">Nothing hear spoken against due respect to Princes.</note> against the Sacred Authority and due Respect and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that all men do ow unto Princes, both by God's Law and Nature, as hath been proved; but only this shall serve to shew, that as nothing under God is more honourable, amiable, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or sovereign, than a good Prince; so nothing is more pestilent, or bringeth so great Destruction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104608:25"/>
and Desolation as an evil Prince. And therefore as the whole Body is of more Authority than the only Head, and may cure the Head if it be out of tune,<note place="margin">☜</note> so may the weal publick cure or cut off their Heads if they infect the rest; seeing that a Body Civil may have divers Heads, by Succession, and is not bound ever to one, as a Body Natural is, which Body Natural, if it had the same ability that when it had an aking or sickly Head, it could cut it off and take another, I doubt not but it would so do, and that all men would confess that it had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sufficient, and reason to do the same, rather than all the other parts should perish, or live in pain and continual torment: But yet much more clearer is the matter that we have in hand for disburdening our selves of wicked Princes, as now I shall begin to prove unto you.</p>
               <p>And for proof of both the points joyntly which you require,<note place="margin">Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in Scripture.</note> I might begin perhaps with some Examples out of the Scripture it self, but that some man may chance to say, that these things recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not so much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Acts of the Commonwealth, as for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Ordinations of God himself,<note place="margin">☜</note> which yet is not any thing against me, but rather maketh much for our purpose, for that the matter is more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized hereby, seeing that whatsoever God did ordain or put in ure in his Commonwealth, that may also be practised by other Commonwealths, now having his authority and approbation for the same. Wherefore (said he) I do hasten to Examples that are more nearer home, and more proper to the particular purpose whereof we treat, yet can I not omit to note some two or three out of the Bible, that do appertain to this purpose also; and these are the Deprivation and putting to Death of two wicked Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> named <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Reg. 31. 4 Reg. 21.44.</note> (though both of them were lawfully placed in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104608:26"/>
that Dignity,) and the bringing in of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Josias</hi> in their rooms, who were the two most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princes that ever that Nation or any other (I think) have had to govern them.</p>
               <p>And first, King <hi>Saul,</hi> though he were elected by God (as you know) to that Royal Throne, yet was he slain by the <hi>Philistines,</hi> by God's order, as it was foretold him, for his Disobedience, and not fulfilling the Law and Limits prescribed unto him. <hi>Amon</hi> was lawful King also, and that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Descent and Succession; for he was Son and Heir to King <hi>Manasses,</hi> whom he succeeded, and yet was he slain by his own People, <hi>quia non ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavit in via Domini</hi>; for that he walked not in the way prescribed unto him by God: And unto these two Kings so deprived God gave two Successors,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>King</hi> Josias</note> (as I have named<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the like whereof are not to be found in the whole rank of Kings for a Thousand years together:<note place="margin">2 Paralip 34.</note> For of <hi>Josias</hi> it is written, <hi>Fecit quod erat rectum in conspectu Domini, &amp; non decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit neque ad dextram neque ad sinistram; He did that which was right in the sight of God, neither did he decline to the right hand nor the left.</hi> He reigned 31. years; and <hi>Jeremias</hi> the Prophet that lived in his time loved this good King so extremely,<note place="margin">2 Paralip. 35.</note> as he never ceased afterwards to lament his Death, as the Scripture saith.</p>

                  </note> we shall find divers things notable in that State also to the purpose we have in hand.

valiant Princes, who have done infinite important Acts in their Commonwealths; and among other have raised many Houses to the Nobility, put down others, changed States both abroad and at home, distributed Ecclesiastical Dignities, altered the course of Descent in the Bloud-Royal, and the like; all which was unjust, and is void at this day, if the changes and deprivations of the former Princes could not be made; and consequently none of these that do pretend to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> at this day can have any Title at all, because they descend from those men who were put up in place of the Deprived.</p>
               <p>And this may be sufficient for proof of the two principal points which you required to be discussed in the beginning of this Speech, viz. <hi>That lawful Princes have oftentimes by their Commonwealths been lawfully deposed for misgovernment; and that God hath allowed of, and assisted the same with good success unto the Weal-publick</hi>; And if this be so, or might be so in Kings lawfully set in possession, then much more hath the said Commonwealth Power and Authority to alter the Succession of such as do but yet pretend to that Dignity, if there be due reason and causes for the same, which is the head point that first we began to treat of, said the Civilian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with this ended he his Spech, without saying any more.</p>

               <p>But in all good and well-ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, where matters pass by Reason, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Wisdom and Consultation, and especially since Christian Religion hath prevailed, and given perfection to that natural light which moral good men had before in matters of Government: since that time (I say) this point of mutual and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Oaths between Princes and Subjects,<note place="margin">The Rites of Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings</note> at the day of their Coronation or Admission (for all are not Crowned) have been much more established, made clear and put in ure.

                  <note place="margin">2 Reg. 2.</note> whom God caused to be anointed by his Priests and Prophets, in token of his Election, and as a singular Priviledge of Honour and Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence unto them, whereof King <hi>David</hi> made so great account, when he said to the Souldier that had killed <hi>Saul</hi> his Enemy in the War, <hi>quare non ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muisti mittere manum tuam in Christum Domini?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.

               <p>Probable then I say it is, that albeit the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this ceremony of <hi>Anointing</hi> Kings be much elder than the Christian Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>: yet is this particular and Majestical manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same by way of <hi>Coronation,</hi> the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in <hi>France</hi> above all other Kingdoms round about, especially if it began with the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King <hi>Clodoveus</hi> not full 500.

               <p>But among all other Kingdoms it seemeth that <hi>England</hi> hath most particularly taken this custom and ceremony from <hi>France,</hi> not only for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before-alledged, that divers of our <hi>English</hi> Kings have come out of <hi>France,</hi>

the Altar, so much as was required of him by the said Arch-bishop and Clergy, for the special safety of Religion, and these Ecclesiastical Liberties, which is the self same point that we have seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as well in the Oath of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as also of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours both <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Gerusan.</hi>

Wherefore he desired him to permit and suffer the Church to enjoy the Priviledges and Liberties which in time of his Predecessors it did enjoy, and to fear that King which reigneth in Heaven, and by whom all other Kings do reign: Moreover he desired him to consider his promise also to all the Realm, which was, that he would preserve unto every man their Right and Title, so far as in him lay.</hi> By which speech of the Arch-bishop the King was so far moved, as he would hear no more of that Bill of Laity; but said that he would leave the Church in as good estate, or better than he found it; and so he did: but yet hereby we come to learn what Oath the Kings of <hi>England</hi> do make at their Coronations touching the Church and Clergy.</p>
               <p>The other conditions also of good Government are partly touched in the speech of the Arch-bishop,<note place="margin">Holings. <hi>in his Chro. pag. 476.</hi> &amp; <hi>1005.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Which after he had sworn, laying his hands upon the Gospels: then doth the Arch-bishop (turning about to the people) declare what the King hath promised and sworn, and by the mouth of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld at Arms asketh their Consents, whether they be content to <hi>submit themselves unto this man, as unto their King or no, under the conditions propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> whereunto when they have yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then beginneth the Arch-bishop to put-upon him the Regal Ornaments,<note place="margin">Regal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</note> as the Sword, the Ring, the Scepter and Crown, as before in the French Coronation you have heard; and namely, he giveth him the Scepter of <hi>S.

                  <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> of whom we spake before,) did read unto them what this new King was bound by Oath unto, and then he took the Ring, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was to wed him to the Common-wealth, (which Wedding importeth, as you know, an Oath and mutual Obligation on both sides in every Marriage,) and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and high Constable of <hi>England,</hi> for that day, was willed to shew the said Ring to the People, that they might thereby see the band whereby the King was bound unto them. And then it was put upon his finger, and the King kissed the Constable in sign of acceptance, fell on his knees also to prayer that he might observe his Promise, and other like ceremonies (saith <hi>Stow,</hi>) were used; and this was done the 13. of <hi>October</hi> 1359. and therefore upon good reason might this same Arch-bishoop put him afterward in mind of this his Oath, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have shewed that he did.</p>

                  </note> and yet I mean to repeat them again in this place, for that they appertain to this purpose; his former is, <hi>That a Prince once entred to Government, and so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as hath been said, is under no Law or restraint at all of his authority, but that himself only is the Quick
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104608:61"/>
and Living Law, and that no imitation can be given unto him by any power under Heaven, except it be by his own will, and that no Nation or Commonwealth can appoint or prescribe how they will obey, or how their Prince shall govern them, but must leave his Authority free from all bands of Law, and this either willingly or by violence, is to be procured</hi> By which words it seemeth that he painteth out a perfect pattern of a Tyrannical Government, which how it may further the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s pretence, in the case he standeth in presently in <hi>France,</hi> I do not see.</p>
               <p>His other Proposition is, <hi>That,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. Apolog. pro Rege cap. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>albeit the Heir apparent, which is next by Birth to any Crown, should be never so impotent, or unfit to Govern, as if (for Examples sake) he should be deprived of his senses, mad, furious, lunatick, a fool, or the like, or that he should be known on the other side to be most malitious, wicked, vitious or abominable, or should degenerate into a very Beast; yea if it were known that he should go about to destroy the Commonwealth, and drown the Ship which he had to guide, yet</hi> (saith this man,) <hi>he must be sacred and holy unto us, and admitted without contradiction to his Inheritance, which God and Nature hath laid upon him, and his direction, restraint or punishment, must only be remitted to God alone, for that no man or Commonwealth may reform or restrain him.</hi> Thus saith <hi>Belloy,</hi> which I doubt not will seem unto you rather belly and base Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than to come from the head of any learned or discreet man, that regardeth the end why Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths and Kingdoms, and all Governments were ordained by God and Nature, and not the flattering or adoring of any one miserable man that shall stand over them to destroy the whole.</p>
               <p>But now to the particular matter that we are to treat of, which is, what is to be attributed to this Succession or propinquity of Birth alone; I am of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104608:62"/>
opinion,<note place="margin">Succession of Princes by Birth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than meer Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and why.</note> as before I signified, that, albeit there want not reasons on both sides among Learned men, what kind of providing Governours to Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths is best, either by simple and free Election only, or by Succession of Birth: my opinion (I say,) is, that Succession is much to be preferred, not for that it wanteth all difficulties and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, (which all temporal things upon Earth have,) but like as before I have shewed of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Government of a Monarchy in respect of other forms of Regiment, to wit, that it wanted not all, but had fewer inconveniences than other forms of Regiment have, so say I also of this, that albeit some inconveniences want not in Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; yet are they commonly far less and fewer, than would follow by meer Election,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>I.</hi> Reason.</note> which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to great and continual dangers of ambition, emulation, division, sedition and contention, which do bring with them evident peril of universal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and desolation of the whole Body, and this at every change of the Prince, which change on the other side is much assured by Succession, for that great occasions of strife and contention are thereby cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">II.</note>And besides this, the Prince, who is in present possession knowing that his son, or next of kin, is to be his Heir, hath more care to leave the Realm in good order, as we see that the Husband-man hath to till and manure that ground, which is his own, and to remain to his posterity:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">III.</note>A third commodity also there is, for that less mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and alterations are seen in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth where Succession prevaileth, for that the Son following his Father, doth commonly retain the same Friends, Counsellours, Officers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which his Father had before him; pursueth the same Actions and Intentions, with the same manner of Proceeding for the most part; whereas
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104608:62"/>
he that entreth by Election, being an alien to him that went before him, and never lightly his friend, doth change, alter, and turn upside down all things</p>
               <p>Furthermore, (which may be also a fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,) he that entreth by Succession,<note place="margin">IV.</note> for that he is either born a Prince, or hath been much respected still for his Title to the Crown, bringeth with him less passions of hatred, emulation, anger, envy, or revenge against particular men, (for that no man durst offend him,) than doth he which entreth by only Election, for that he having been a Subject and equal to others before his advancement, and thereby holden contention with many, especially of this Election, must needs have matter of quarrel with many, which he will seek easily to revenge, when he is in authority; as on the other side also such as were his equals before, will bear him less respect, and more unwillingly be under him, than if by birth he had been their Soveraign.</p>

                  </note> Yet would God have this younger to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the said priviledge of Eldership from <hi>Esau</hi> by divers means, as first by bargain, and after by guile,<note place="margin">Two Points to be noted.</note> according to the Story we read in <hi>Genes.</hi> Out of which Story two points may be pondered much to our purpose, First that <hi>primogeniture</hi> or eldership
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104608:63"/>
of birth, (as I have said) was greatly respected by God; and according to that, all the descents and Successions of Kings were commonly among that people; for that ordinarily the eldest son ever suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his father in the Crown of Jury. And the second point is, that God would shew even in this beginning that yet this priviledge was not so invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, but that upon just causes it might be broken, as it was by this his choice of <hi>Jacob</hi> the younger, and rejecting <hi>Esau</hi> the Elder: and many times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in matter of Government the same was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by God himself, as when <hi>Judah</hi> the fourth Tribe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Genes. 29.</hi> &amp; <hi>49. Exod. 1.</hi>
                  </note> and not <hi>Reuben</hi> the first and eldest, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to enjoy the Scepter and Crown of the <hi>Jewes</hi>; as also when King <hi>David</hi> dyed, not his first,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 5. 1 Paral. 3.</note> second, or third son, but his tenth in order, to wit, <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was also the fourth that he had by <hi>Bersabee,</hi> was appointed for his Successor.</p>
               <p>So that in very deed we have here both our two Cases,<note place="margin">Two Cases resolved.</note> that were propounded in the beginning, over-ruled and determined by Authority and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Holy Writ it self; namely and first of all, that priority and propinquity of Bloud in Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is greatly to be honoured, regarded and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in all affairs of Dignity and Principality, and yet (which is the second point) are we not so absolutely and peremptorily bound thereunto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but that upon just and urgent occasions that course may be altered and broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences by Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>Which Licence or Liberty is indeed the only (or at least wise,) the most principal Remedy for such Inconveniences as do or may ensue in the course of Succession, which inconveniences as before I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be far less and fewer than are wont to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of bare Election alone; yet did I confess also, that some did or might fall out, as namely that the person, who by succession of Bloud is next, may be unable or unfit, or pernicious to Govern: In
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104608:63"/>
which Cases the remedy is, (as before hath been declared) either to help and assist him by Laws, and Directions, and wise Councels, if he be capable thereunto, or else to remove him, and take in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same Bloud-Royal, (though further off in degree or propinquity) in his place.</p>
               <p>And this is and hath been the custom and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Nations and Commonwealths from the beginning, since Succession hath been established among them, as afterwards I shall demonstrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by great store of evident Examples and Presidents; and by this means we come to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the difficulties and inconveniences of both kinds of making our Kings and Princes, which are <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Succession,</hi> as hath been said: for by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession we do remedy the inconveniences and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers before-mentioned of bare Election, to wit,<note place="margin">Election and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion do help the one the other.</note> of strife, banding, ambition, and the like: and by this other mean of adding also Election, Consent and Approbation of the Realm to Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion alone, which inconveniences are principally, that some unapt, impotent or evil Prince may be offered sometimes to enter by priority of Bloud, whereof the Realm may deliver it self by this other means of not admitting him, so as Election by Succession, and Succession again by Election is salved, and the one made a Preservative and Triacle to the other: and this is the Wisdom and high policy left by God and Nature to every Commonwealth, for their own conservation and maintainance, and every man that is of Reason and Judgment, and void of passion, will not only allow, but also highly commend the same.</p>
               <p>Now then to answer in particular to the two Questions made at the beginning of this speech,<note place="margin">Answer to the two Principal Questions.</note> to wit, what is to be attributed to <hi>Succession</hi> alone, and Secondly, What Interest a Prince hath thereby to any Crown, before he be Crowned or admitted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104608:64"/>
by the Commonwealth,<note place="margin">Succession greatly to be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> To the First I say, that to Succession alone; or priority of Bloud only great honour, reverence and respect ought to be born, as before hath been declared; for that it is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal circumstance &amp; condition which leadeth us to the next Succession of the <hi>Crown</hi> infallibly, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all strife: If his propinquity be clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that other necessary circumstances and conditions do concurr also in the same person, which conditions were appointed and set down at the same time, and by the same authority that this Law of Succession was established; for that both the one and the other of these two Points were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Commonwealth, to wit, that the Elder and First in Bloud should succeed, and that he should be such a person as can and will Govern, to the Publick Weal of all, as often and largely before hath been avouched and proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What an Heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation.</note>To the second Question I answer, That an Heir apparent to a Crown, before his Coronation and Admission by the Realm, if he have the Conditions before-required, hath the same Interest to the Kingdom, which the King of <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> hath to the <hi>German</hi> Empire after his Election, and before he be Crowned: And to use a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Example to <hi>Englishmen,</hi> as the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> hath to the <hi>Mayoralty,</hi> after he is chosen, and before he be admitted; or have taken his Oath. For as this man in rigour is not truly <hi>Mayor,</hi> nor hath his Jurisdiction before his Oath and Admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, nor the other is properly Emperour, before he be Crowned, so is not an Heir apparent truly King, though his Predecessor be dead, and he next in Succession, untill he be Crowned or Admitted by the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Examples of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>Another Example is there in Marriage also, whereby our matter is made more plain, for in this Contract go both the Betrothing and actual Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104608:64"/>
together of the Parties in Wedlock; the First is done by words <hi>de futuro,</hi> or for the time to come, and is not properly Marriage, but Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal only: The other is by words <hi>de praesenti,</hi> that is, by mutual present consent given of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and this second is only and properly true Marriage; which two points are expresly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the state of an Heir apparent, and of a Crowned King; for that the Heir apparent by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity of Bloud, is only espoused or betrothed to the Commonwealth, for the time to come, and is married afterwards by present mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of both Parties in the Contract and knitting up of the matter, at his Coronation, by the Oaths which either part maketh the one to take the other, and by putting on the Ring and other Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garments before-mentioned in their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by all which the Heir apparent, (which was but Espouse,) is made now the true King and Husband of the Commonwealth, which before he was not, by only Succession, but only a betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed Spouse, or designed King, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it followeth also,<note place="margin">What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is due to an Heir apparent.</note> that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth oweth no allegiance or subjection unto the Heir apparent in rigour of Justice, until he be Crowned or Admitted, though his Predecessor be dead; for that in very deed, until that time, he is not the true King and Soveraign, though for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter keeping of Order, and avoiding of Tumults, all Commonwealths lightly that have their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Succession, have ordained in these latter Ages, that from the death of the former Princes, all matters of Government shall pass in the Name of his next Successor, (if his Succession be clear) and this (as I say,) for avoiding of Garboils, and under supposal of Confirmation and Approbation afterwards of the Commonwealth at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104608:65"/>
for which cause also,<note place="margin">Why Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do count their years from the death of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</note> and for better account of years, it was ordained that the beginning of the Successors Reign should be reckoned from the day of the death of his predecessor, and not from the day of his Coronation, as otherwise in rigour it ought to be, and as in old time it was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be,<note place="margin">Gerard du Hailan l. 3. de Pestare pag. 241.</note> as <hi>Gerard,</hi> Secretary and Chronicler of <hi>France,</hi> to wit, that Kings in old time were wont to account the years of their Reigns from the day only of their Anointing and Coronation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">No Heir aarent King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>This point also that <hi>Heirs apparent are not true Kings, until their Coronation, how just soever their Title of Succession otherwise be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though their Predecessors be dead</hi>; it might be confirmed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Arguments, but especially and above all others,<note place="margin">An evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> for that the Realm is asked again three times at their Coronation, <hi>Whether they will have such a man to be King, or not,</hi> as before hath been shewed, which thing were in vain to ask, if he were truly King, (as <hi>Belloy</hi> saith,) before his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation.</p>
               <p>Again we see in all the Forms and different manners of <hi>Coronations,</hi> before-recited, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prince hath sworn divers times to <hi>Govern well and justly,</hi> then do the Subjects take other <hi>Oaths of Obedience and Allegiance,</hi> and not before; which argueth, that before they were not bound unto him by Allegiance, and as for the Princes of <hi>England,</hi> it is expressly noted by <hi>English</hi> Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers in their <hi>Coronations,</hi> how that <hi>no Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is due unto them before they be Crowned,</hi> and that only it happened to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">A rare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> V.</note> among all other his Predecessors to have this Priviledge, and this for his exceeding <hi>towardliness,</hi> and for the great <hi>affection</hi> of the People towards him, that he had homage done unto him before his <hi>Coronation,</hi> and Oath taken.

               <p>This I might prove by many Examples in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> it self, where <hi>Admission</hi> hath prevailed against <hi>Right of Succession,</hi> as in <hi>William Rufus</hi> that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and in King <hi>Henry</hi> the First his Brother, in King <hi>Stephen,</hi> King <hi>John</hi> and others, who by only <hi>Admission</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> were <hi>Kings,</hi> against the <hi>Order of Succession,</hi> as after more at large I shall shew you in a particular speech of this point I shall make unto you, and very specially it may be seen in the two Examples before-mentioned of the <hi>Admission</hi> of the two Kings, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> both sirnamed <hi>the Fourth,</hi> whose entrances to the <hi>Crown,</hi> if a man do well consider, he shall find, that both of them founded the best part and the surest of their <hi>Titles</hi> upon <hi>the Election, Consent and Good-Will of the People</hi>: yea both of them at their dying-days ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some remorse of <hi>Conscience</hi> (as it seemed) for that they had caused so many men to die <hi>for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of their several Rights and Titles,</hi>

               <p>And for more ample proof hereof, and fuller conclusion of all the whole matter, I had thought to have laid down also in this place some number of the most notorious Examples, that I have read, (for I have read many,) wherein the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth upon just Occasions hath extended her <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to alter the <hi>natural course of Succession by Birth</hi>; but for that the thing requireth some little study and looking over some <hi>Notes</hi> that I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Stories,</hi> for help of Memory, I shall deferr it until our next Meeting, at what time I shall by God's Grace make this point very clear, and so end my whole Discourse, for I see that I have been much longer than at the beginning I purposed; and now I desire much to give place unto our <hi>Temporal Lawyer,</hi> here present, who (I doubt not,) hath matter to say of more delectation and pleasure than this, though you of your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies have done me so much favour as to hear me

hitherto with patience and attention. Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole company answered, that not with patience, but with great pleasure, delight and contentation they had heard him, and so they would do the <hi>Temporal Lawyer</hi> also in his turn; But yet they desired him that nothing of this discourse might be omitted, but wholly finished, for that it gave very great satisfaction to all, and opened ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny important Points unto them, which they had never thought of before, and with this they parted for that night, every man unto his Lodging and Habitation.</p>

               <p>AT the next Meeting the <hi>Civilian</hi> came in very pensive, as though his head had been full of study, where being asked the reason, he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he had revolved many Stories since his departure about the point which he promised to treat of,<note place="margin">The Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian cloyed with copy.</note> and that he had found such store and great variety of matter, as he knew not well where to end: <hi>For</hi> (quoth he) <hi>if I should begin with the</hi> Grecian <hi>Kings before-mentioned, it were infinite that might be alledged, and perhaps some man would say they were too too old, and far-fetched Examples, and

                  <note place="margin">Objections.</note> 
                  <hi>and if I lay before you the Examples of</hi> Roman <hi>Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours put in and out, against the Law, and Right of Succession: the same men perhaps will answer, that it was by force and injury of mutinous Souldiers, whereunto that Common-wealth was greatly subject.

               </p>
               <p>Thus (I say,) it may be, that some man would reply, and therefore having store enough of plain and evident matter, which hath no exception, for that it hath happened in settled Commonwealths, and those nearer home, where the Law of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession is received and established, to wit, in <hi>Spain, France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>: but yet putting you in mind before I pass any further, that it is a matter much to be marked,<note place="margin">The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Jewe. <hi>1 Reg. 8.</hi>
                  </note> how God dealt is this point with the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> at the beginning, after he had granted to them that they should have the same Government of Kings, that other Nations round about them had, whose Kings did ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reign by <hi>Succession,</hi> as ours do at this day, and as all the Kings of the <hi>Jews</hi> did afterwards; and yet this notwithstanding, God at the beginning, to wit, at the very entrance of their first Kings, would shew plainly that this Law of <hi>Succeeding</hi> of the one the other, by Birth and propinquity of <hi>Bloud,</hi> (though for the most part it should prevail) yet that it was not so precisely necessary, but that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon just causes it might be altered.</p>

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:104608:68"/>For proof whereof we are to consider, that, albeit he made <hi>Saul</hi> a true and lawful King over the <hi>Jewes,</hi>

                  </note> and consequently also gave him all Kingly Priviledges, Benefits and Prerogatives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Degree and State, whereof one Principal (as you know,) is to have his children succeed after him in the <hi>Crown:</hi> Yet after his death God suffered not any one of his generation to succeed him, though he left behind him many children,<note place="margin">

               <p>And if you say here that this was for the sin of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom God hath rejected, I do confess it,<note place="margin">An Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> but yet this is nothing against our purpose, for that we pretend not that a Prince, that is next in <hi>Bloud,</hi> can justly be put back, except it be for his own defects, or those of his Ancestors.

               <p>This happened then, and I do note by the way, that this <hi>Dona Berenguela</hi> second Daughter of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104608:76"/>
Queen <hi>Eleanor,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Woman, was married, (as hath been said,) to the Prince of <hi>Leon,</hi> and had by him <hi>Don Fernando</hi> the Third of that name, King of <hi>Castilia,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After this again, about threescore years the Prince of <hi>Spain</hi> named <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> sirnamed <hi>de la cerda,</hi> for that he was born with a great gristle-hair on his breast, called <hi>Cerda</hi> in <hi>Spanish,</hi> which <hi>Don Alonso</hi> was Nephew to the King <hi>Fernando</hi> the Saint, and married with the Daughter of Saint <hi>Luys</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> named also <hi>Blancha,</hi> as her Grand-mother was, and had by her two Sons cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alonso</hi> and <hi>Hornando de la cerda,</hi> as the Prince their Father was named, which Father of theirs dying before the King, the Grand-father left them commended to the Realm as lawful Heirs appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Crown, yet for that a certain Uncle of theirs named <hi>Don Sancho</hi> younger Brother to their Father which <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was sirnamed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>el bravo,</hi> for his valour, and was a great Warriour, and more like to manage well the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of War than they: he was made Heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <hi>Spain,</hi> and they put back in their Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time, and by his and the Realms consent, (their father, as I have said, being dead,) and this was done in a General Parliament holden at <hi>Sego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> in the year 1276.<note place="margin">The Cord is put back from the Crown. <hi>1276.</hi>
                  </note> And after this, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was made King in the year 1284 and the two Princes put into prison; but afterwards at the suit of their Uncle King <hi>Philip</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> they were let out again, and endued with certain Lands, and so they remain unto this day; and of these do come the Dukes of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> and all the rest of the House of <hi>Cerda</hi> which are of much Nobility in <hi>Spain</hi> at this time, and King

               <p>Not long after this again when <hi>Don Pedro</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>the Cruel King of Castile,</hi> was driven out, and his bastard brother <hi>Henry</hi> the Second set up in his place, as before hath been mentioned:<note place="margin">Garabay l. 15. c. 1. an. 1363.</note> the Duke of <hi>Lancaster, John</hi> of <hi>Gant,</hi> having married <hi>Dona Constantia</hi> the said King <hi>Peter</hi>'s daughter and Heir, pretended by Succession the said Crown of <hi>Castile,</hi> as indeed it appertained unto him, but yet the State of <hi>Spain</hi> denied it flatly, and defended it by Arms, and they prevailed against <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gant,</hi>

               <p>Well, one Example will I give you more out of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi>; and so will I make an end with these Countreys.

this point, as before hath been noted, great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencis would follow, and we should shake the States of most Princes in the World at this day, as by examples which alreay I have alledged in part may appear.</p>
               <p>And with this also I mean to conclude, and end this discourse in like manner, affirming,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Chapter.</note> that as on the one side propinquity of Bloud is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence towards the attaining of any Crown, so yet doth it not ever bind the Commonwealth to yield thereunto, if weightier Reasons should urge them to the contrary; neither is the Commonwealth bound always to shut her Eyes, and to admit at hap-hazard, or of necessity, every one that is next by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Bloud, as <hi>Belloy</hi> falsly and fondly affirmeth; but rather she is bound to consider well and matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely the Person that is to enter; Whether he be like to perform his duty and charge committed unto him or no; for that otherwise, to admit him that is an enemy or unfit, is but to destroy the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and him together. This is my opinion, and this seemeth to me to be conform to all Reason, Law, Religion, Piety, Wisdom, and Policy, and to the use and custom of all well governed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in the World; Neither do I mean hereby to prejudice any Princes pretence, or Succession to any Crown or Dignity in the World, but rather do hold that he ought to enjoy his Preheminence; but yet so, that he be not prejudiciae thereby to the whole body, which is ever to be respected more then any one Person, whatsoever <hi>Belloy</hi> or other of his opinion do say to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thus said the Civilian, and being called upon and drawn to a new matter by the question that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth, he made his last discourse and conclusion of the whole matter, in manner following.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. What are the principal points which a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ought to respect in admitting or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of any Prince, that pretendeth to succeed: wherein it is handled largely; also of the diversity of Religion, and other such Cases.</head>
               <p>AFter the Civilian had alledged all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Succession, altered or rejected by publick Authority of Commonwealths, and of the allowance and approbation and good success, which for the most part God seems to have given unto the same, one of the Company brake forth, and said, <hi>That this point appeared so evident unto him, as no doubt in the World could be made thereof; I mean, Whether this thing in it self be lawful or no? To alter sometimes the course of Succession,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Causes of Excluding Princes.</note> 
                  <hi>seeing that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths of Christendom, had done it so often; only he said, that it remained somewhat doubtful unto him, whether the causes alledged in these mutations, and changes before-mentioned, were always sufficient or no? For that sometimes they seemed to him but weak and slender, as when (for example) the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Nephews; for that he was a Man, and the other Children, which cause and reason hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been alledged in the former examples, both of</hi> Spain, France, <hi>and</hi> England; <hi>As also when the younger or Bastard Brother is admitted, and the elder and Legitimate Excluded; for that the one is a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, and the other not, and other such like causes are yielded (said he,) in the Exclusions before-rehearsed, which yet seems not sometimes weighty enough for so great an Affair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:104608:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>To this answered the Civilian, <hi>That according to their Law, both Civil and Canon, (which thing also he affirmed to be founded on great reason,) it is a matter most certain, that he who is Judge and ought to give the sentence in the thing it self, is also to judge of the cause,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Who must be Judge of the lawful cause of Exclusion.</note> 
                  <hi>for thereof is he called Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if he have authority in the one, good reason he should also have power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the other, so as, if we grant according to the form and proofs; That the Realm or Commonwealth hath power to admit or put back the Prince or pretender to the Crown; Then must we also confess that the same Commonwealth, hath Authority to judge of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the cause; and considering further that it is in their own affair, and in a matter that hath his whole beginning, continuance and substance from them alone; I mean from the Commonwealth; for that no Man is King or Prince by institution of nature, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been declared, but every King and Kings Son, hath his dignity and preheminence above other men, but authority only of the Commonwealth: Who can affirm the contrary said the Civilian? But that God doth allow for a just and sufficient cause in this behalf, the only will and judgment of the weal publick it self, supposing always, (as in reason we may,) that a whole Realm will never agree by orderly way of judgment (for of this only I mean, and not of any particular Faction of private men against their Heir Apparent,) to Exclude or put back the next Heir in Bloud and Succession without a reasonable cause, in their sight and consure. And seeing that they only are to be Judges of this case, (as now I have said) we are to presume that what they determine, is just and lawful for the time, and if at one time they should determine one thing, and the contrary at another, (as they did often in</hi> England <hi>during the contention between</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Lancaster, <hi>and on other like occasions,) what can a private Man judge otherwise, but that they had different reasons and motions to lead them at different times, and they being
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104608:92"/>
properly Lords and Owners of the whole business com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them: It is enough for every particular man to subject himself to that which his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth doth in this behalf, and to obey simply, without any further inquisition, except he should see that open injustice were done therein, or God manifestly offended, and the Realm indangered.</hi>

                  <hi>Open injustice I call</hi> (said he) <hi>when not the true Commonwealth, but some Faction of wicked Man should offer to determin this matter, without lawful authority of the Realm committed to them; and I call manifest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God, and danger of the Realm, when such a Man is preferred to the Crown, as is evident that he will do what lyeth in him to the prejudice of them both; I mean both of Gods glory and the publick Wealth: as for example, if a</hi> Turk <hi>or</hi> Moor <hi>(as before I have said) or some other notorious wicked Man, or Tyrant, should be offered by Succession or otherwise to govern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, in which cases every man (no doubt) is bound to resist what he can, for that the very end and intent for which all Government was first ordained, is herein manifestly impugned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Civilian discoursed, and the whole Company seemed to like very well thereof, for that they said his opinion appeared both prudent and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;<note place="margin">What are the chief points to be regarded in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:104608:92"/>Hereunto the Civilian answered, that he well saw the fitness and importance of the matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was content to speak a word or two more thereof; Notwithstanding that much had been said already therein, to wit, in all those points which had been disputed about the end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and why it was appointed, which end (said he) seing it is (as largely hath been proved before) to defend, preserve, and benefit the Commonwealth,<note place="margin">Whence the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting or rejecting a Prince are to be taken</note> here hence that is, from this consideration, of the Wel-publick, are to be deduced all other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of most importance, for discerning a good or evil Prince. For that whosoever is most likely to defend, preserve, and benefit most his Realm and subjects, he is most to be allowed and desired, as most conform to the end for which Government was ordained.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary side, he that is least like to do this, deserveth least to be preferred, and here (quoth he,) you see doth enter also that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration mentioned by you before, which divers Commonwealths had in putting back oftentimes Children and impotent People, though otherwise next in Blood,) from Succession, and preferring more able Men, though further off by Descent, for that they were more like to defend well their Realm and Subjects, than others were.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, (said he,) more distinctly and more perspicuously in this matter,<note place="margin">Gerard. <hi>li. 3. de l' Estat. pag. 242.</hi>
                  </note> I would have you call to mind one Point among others which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before out of <hi>Gerard</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Author, to wit, that the King of <hi>France</hi> in his Coronation is new apparelled three times in one day, once as a <hi>Priest,</hi> and then as a <hi>Judge,</hi> and last as <hi>King</hi> armed.<note place="margin">Three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Points to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> Thereby to signify three things committed to his Charge, First <hi>Religion,</hi> then <hi>Justice,</hi> then <hi>Manhood</hi> and <hi>Chivalry</hi> for the Defence of the Realm.</p>
               <p>This Division seemeth to me very good and fit,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104608:93"/>
(quoth he,) and to comprehend all that a Wel-Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hath need of, for her happy State and Felicity, both in Soul and Body, and for her end, both <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Natural.</hi> For by the <hi>First,</hi> which is <hi>Religion,</hi> her Subjects do attain unto their end <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> which is the Salvation of their <hi>Souls,</hi> and by the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third,</hi> which are <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> they enjoy their <hi>Felicity Temporal,</hi> which is, to live in <hi>Peace</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and <hi>Safety</hi> from their Enemies; for which Cause it seemeth that these are the three Points, which most are to be regarded in every Prince, that cometh to Government, and much more in him that is not yet admitted thereunto, but offereth himself to the Commonwealth for the same purpose.</p>

For these Causes, (I say,) shall I accommodate my self to the circumstance of the time, wherein we live, and to the present Case which is in question betwixt us about the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>England,</hi> and leaving aside those other two Considerations of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Chivalry</hi> in a King, which are far less important than the other, (though yet so highly regarded by ancient Commonwealths, as you have heard,) I shall treat principally of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> in this place, as of the first and highest, and most necessary Point of all other to be considered in the Admission of any Prince, for the profit of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: for that without this he destroyeth all; and with this, albeit he should have defects in the other
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104608:93"/>
two Points of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Manhood,</hi> yet may it be holpen, or his defect or negligence may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed much by others, as after I shall shew more in particular: but if he want Fear of God, or care of Religion, or be perversly perswaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the damage of the Wel-Publick is inestimable. <hi>First</hi> of all then, for beter understanding of this Point, we are to suppose, that the first,<note place="margin">The chief end of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> chiefest and highest end that God and Nature appointed to every Commonwealth, was not so much the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral felicity of the Body, as the <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Everlasting</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and this was not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the <hi>Jews</hi> by Holy Scriptur, but also unto the <hi>Gentils</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> by the <hi>Instinct</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of Nature it self. For by this Light of Natural reason the Learned sort of them came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the immortality of the Soul, and that her Felicity, Perfection and full Contentment, which they called her <hi>final End</hi> and <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> could not be in this Life, nor in any thing Created under Heaven, but must needs be in the Life to come, and that by attaining to enjoy some infinit endless and immortal <hi>Object,</hi> which could fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the appetit of our Soul, and this could be no other than GOD, the Maker of all himself. And that consequently all other things of this transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Life, and of this humane Commonwealth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to mans eyes, are ordained to serve and be subordinate and directed to the other <hi>Higher End,</hi> and that all mans actions in this World are first of all, and in the highest degree, to be employed to the recognising, serving and honouring of this great Lord that governeth the whole,<note place="margin">Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers what end they had of their Doings.</note> as Author and End of all.</p>

Countries take in old time, when <hi>Christian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours did flourish; and it hath remained for a Law and President ever since to all Posterity.</p>
               <p>And if we join this with the other Oaths before set down in the V. <hi>Chapter,</hi> which Emperours and Kings did make themselves, (unto their Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prelates, at their first Admission,) about this Point: we should see nothing was so much respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Admission of a Prince, or Governour, (nor ought to be,) as <hi>Religion</hi>; for that, (as I have said before,) this is the chiefest, greatest and highest end of every Commonwealth, intended both by God and Nature, to assist their Subjects to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their Supernatural end, by honouring and serving God in this life, and by living vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, for that otherwise God should draw no other fruit or commodity out of humane Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, than of an Assembly of Brutish Creaturs, maintained only and governed for to eat, drink and live in peace, as before hath been declared.</p>
               <p>But the End of man being far higher than this:<note place="margin">How great a defect is want of Religion in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</note> it followeth that whatsoever Prince or Magistrate doth not attend with care to assist and help his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to this end, omitteth the first and principal part of his Charge, and committeth high Treason against his Lord and Master, in whose place he is, and consequently is not fit for that Charge and Dignity, though he should perform the other two parts never so well of <hi>temporal Justice</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> in his Person, which two other Points do appertain principally to the humane felicity and baser end of Mans Wel-publick, and much more of a Christian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Hereof it ensueth also that nothing in the world can so justly exclude an Heir apparent from his Succession, as want of Religion, nor any cause whatsoever justify and clear the Conscience of the Commonwealth, or of particular men, that in this Case should resist his Entrance, as if they judge him

               <p>And so much the rather he said that he would do this, for that in very truth the <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> speech had put him in a great indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy concerning matter of <hi>Succession,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin of any one Title.</note> and had taken out of his Head many scrupulosities about nice Points of Nearness in Blood, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Examples and Reasons that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of the Proceeding of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths in this Affair, preferring often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times him that was further off in Blood, upon other Considerations of more weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which Point seemed to him to have been so evidently proved, as no man can deny it, and much less condemn the same, without the Inconveniences before alledged and mentioned, of calling all in doubt that now is established in the World, considering that not only foreign Countries, but <hi>England</hi> also it self so often hath used the same putting back the next in Blood.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he said, that for as much as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and the consent, will and desire of each Realm was proved to have High and
<pb facs="tcp:104608:101"/>
Soveraign Authority in this Affair, and that as on the one side Nearness of Blood was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, so on the other there wanted not sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry considerations and circumstances of as great moment as this, or rather greater, for that oftentimes these considerations had been preferred before Nearness of Blood, as hath been declared. I do not know (<hi>quoth he</hi>) who of the Pretenders may next obtain the Garland, whatsoever his Right by Propinquity be, so he have someright (as I think all have that do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) and therefore I mean not to stand upon the justification or impugning of any one Title, but rather to leave all to God and to them, that must one day try and judge the same in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to whom I suppose this Speech of mine cannot be but grateful and commodious, for the better understanding and discerning of those matters, whereof of necessity, ere it be long, they must be Judges and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpires, when God shall appoint, and consequently for them to be ignorant or unacquainted with the same, (as men say that commonly most in <hi>England</hi> at this day cannot be but very inconvenient and dangerous.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Book of M. <hi>Morgan</hi> and Judge <hi>Brown.</hi>

               <p>The Intent then of this Book of the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> is, to refute the other book of <hi>Hales</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and that especially in the two Points before mentioned, which they alledged for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to wit, about <hi>Foreign Birth,</hi> and King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Testament:<note place="margin">Answer to the <hi>I.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> And against the first of these two Points the Bishop alledgeth many <hi>Proofs</hi> that there

is no such Maxim in the common <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to disinherit a Prince, born out of the Land, from his or her Right of <hi>Succession,</hi> that they have by <hi>Blood.</hi> And this <hi>first,</hi> for that the Statute, made for <hi>barring of Aliens to inherit</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> (which was in the 25. Year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> III.) is only to be understood of particular mens inheritance, and no ways to be extended to the <hi>Succession of the Crown,</hi> as by comparison of many other like Cases is declared: And <hi>secondly,</hi> for that there is express exception in the same Statute of the Kings Children and Off-spring: And <hi>thirdly,</hi> for that the practice hath always been contrary both before and after the <hi>Conquest,</hi> to wit, that divers <hi>Princes born out of the Realm have succeeded.</hi>

And <hi>secondly</hi> also by <hi>Witness</hi> of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> that was of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> in those days, and of Sir <hi>Edward Montague</hi> Lord Chief Justice, and of one <hi>William Clark</hi> that set the Kings Stamp to the Writing; all which avowed before the <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, that the said Testament was signed after the King was past sense and memory.</p>
               <p>And <hi>finally</hi> the said Bishop concludeth that <hi>the Line of</hi> Scotland <hi>is the next every way, both in respect of the House of</hi> Lancaster, <hi>and also of</hi> York, <hi>for that they are next Heirs to King</hi> Henry VIII. <hi>who by his Father was Heir to the House of</hi> York.</p>

This man impugneth all the three former Books in divers principal Points, and draweth the <hi>Crown</hi> from both their <hi>Pretenders,</hi> I mean as well-from the House of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as from that of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>first</hi> against the Book of <hi>Hales</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> written (as hath been said) in favour of the House of <hi>Suffolk, Highington</hi> holdeth with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and <hi>Morgan</hi> that these two <hi>Principles</hi> laid by the other, of <hi>Foreign Birth,</hi> and of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Testament against the <hi>Scotish</hi> Line, are of no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, as neither their reasons for <hi>legitimating</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Hartfords</hi> Children, which afterwards shall be handled.</p>
               <p>And <hi>secondly,</hi> he is against both <hi>Morgan</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> also in divers important Points, and in the very <hi>Principal</hi> of all, for that this man, (I mean <hi>Highinton,</hi>) maketh the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be the next and most rightful <hi>Pretender</hi> by the House of <hi>Lancaster:</hi> for proof whereof he holdeth <hi>first</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. had no <hi>Title</hi> indeed to the <hi>Crown</hi> by <hi>Lancaster,</hi> but only by the House of <hi>York,</hi> that is to say, by his Marriage of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> elder Daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> IV<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit himself were descended by his Mother from <hi>John of Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> yet this was but by his Third Wife <hi>Catharin Swinford,</hi> and that the true Heirs of <hi>Blanch</hi> his first Wife Dutchess and Heir of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> (to whom, saith he, appertained only the <hi>Succession</hi> after the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. and his Son, with whom ended the <hi>Line Male</hi> of that House.) remained only in <hi>Portugal</hi> by the Marriage of Lady <hi>Philip,</hi> Daughter of the foresaid <hi>Blanch,</hi> to King <hi>John</hi> the I. of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that for as much as King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> saith this man, hath now succeeded to all the <hi>Right</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to him appertaineth also the onely <hi>Right of Succession</hi> of the House of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> and that all the other <hi>Descendents</hi> of King

                  <hi>Henry</hi> VII. are to pretend only by the Title of <hi>York,</hi> I mean as well the Line of <hi>Scotland</hi> as also of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> for that in the House of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> is evidently before them all.</p>
               <p>Thus holdeth <hi>Highington,</hi> alledging divers Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Arguments and Probabilities for the same, and then adjoineth two other Propositions, which do import most of all, to wit, that the Title of the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was far better than that of <hi>York,</hi> not for that <hi>Edmond Crookback</hi> first Founder of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who was Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. and Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the I. was eldest son to the said <hi>Edward</hi> &amp; injuriously put back for his deformity in Body,<note place="margin">George Lilly <hi>in fine Epit. chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic.

                  </note> as both the said Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> and <hi>George Lylly</hi> do falsly hold, and this man refuteth by many good Arguments, but for that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> being the eldest Son that King <hi>Edward</hi> the III. had alive when he dyed, should in <hi>Right</hi> have <hi>succeeded</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> as this man holdeth, and should have been preferred before <hi>Richard</hi> the II. that was the black Princes Son, who was a degree further off from King <hi>Edward</hi> the III. his Grandfather, than was <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> to whom King <hi>Edward</hi> was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and by this occasion this man cometh to discuss at large the opinions of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Uncle or the Nephew should be preferred in the <hi>Succession</hi> of a <hi>Crown,</hi> to wit, whether the younger Brother or the elder Brothers son, if his Father be dead without being seased of the same, (which is a Point that in the <hi>Civil Law</hi> hath great Disputation and many great Authors on each side, as this man sheweth,) and the matter also wanteth not examples on both parts in the <hi>Succession</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>English</hi> Kings, as our Friend the <hi>Civil Lawyer</hi> did signify also in his discourse, and we may chance to have occasion to handle the same again, and more largely hereafter.</p>

And again these Points had been to be disputed as well touching the <hi>Succession</hi> to the Dukedom of <hi>Lancaster</hi> alone, as also to the Crown jointly, all which Articles shall severally afterwards be handled in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>Thus saith that Book, and he alledgeth many Reasons for the same, as it hath been told me, (for as I said, I never came to have a view of the whole Book,) but divers of his Arguments I have seen laid together, which I shall afterwards in place

               <p>And albeit some Writers of our time have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or at least wise much inclined to favour a certain old report,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Ross <hi>in his Book of the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>Title.</hi> George Lilly <hi>in fine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi> Chron.

               </p>
               <p>The first reason then is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>That</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>was the elder.</hi> Mat. West. in vit. H. 3. &amp; Holling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed ibid. p. 654.</note> for that all Ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers of <hi>England,</hi> and among them <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus Westmonasteriensis</hi> that lived at the same time, do affirm the contrary, and do make <hi>Edward</hi> to be elder then <hi>Edmond</hi> by six years and two days, for that they appoint the Birth of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to have been upon the 16. day of <hi>June</hi> in the year of Christ 1239, and the 24. of the Reign of his Father King <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Birth of Lord <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> to have followed upon the 18. day of the same month 6 years after, to wit, in the year of our Lord 1245 and they do name the Godfathers and Godmothers of them both together, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104608:115"/>
solemnities and feasts, that were celebrated at their several Nativities, so as it seemeth there can be no error in this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The 2d. reason is, for that we read that this Lord <hi>Edmond</hi> was a goodly, wise, discreet Prince, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that some Authors call him Crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and that he was highly in the favour both of his Father King <hi>Henry,</hi> as also of his Brother King <hi>Edward,</hi> and imployed by them in many great Wars, and other affairs of State, both in <hi>France</hi> and other where, which argueth that there was no such great defect in him as should move his Father and the Realm to deprive him of his Succession.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly we read that King <hi>Henry</hi> procured by divers ways and means the advancement of this Lord <hi>Edmond,</hi> as giving him the Earldoms of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> and <hi>Darby,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hollingsh. in vit.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we see that at the death of his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. this Lord <hi>Edmond</hi> was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally left in charge with the Realm, his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince <hi>Edward</hi> being scarsly returned from the War of <hi>Asia,</hi> at what time, he had good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to challenge his own right to the Crown, if he had had any, seeing he wanted no power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, having three goodly Sons at that time alive, born of his Wife Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> Daugher of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> and County of <hi>Champain,</hi> to whom she had born only one Daughter, that was married to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip le Bel</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we shall never read that either he, or any of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104608:115"/>
his Children, made any such claim,<note place="margin">Edmonds <hi>Line never pretended to the Crown.</hi>
                  </note> but that they lived in very good agreement and high grace with King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, as his Children did also with King <hi>Edward</hi> the II. until he began to be mis-led in Government, and then the two Sons of this Lord <hi>Edmond</hi> (I mean both <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> that Successively were Earls of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) made War upon the said <hi>Edward</hi> the II. and were the principal Actors in his deposition, and in setting up of his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the III. in his place, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what time it is evident that they might have put in also for themselves, if their title had been such as this report maketh it.</p>
               <p>A fifth reason is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that if this had been so,<note place="margin">Note this consequent.</note> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> had been the elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then had the controversie between the two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> been most clear and without all doubt at all, for then had the House of <hi>York</hi> had no pretence of right in the World; and then were it evident, that the Heirs general of <hi>Blanch</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Wife of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> to wit, the descendents of Lady <hi>Philip</hi> her Daughter, that was married into <hi>Portugal</hi>; these I say, and none other, were apparent and true Heirs to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> at this day, and all the other of the House of <hi>York</hi> usurpers, as well King <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. as all his posterity and off-spring, for that none of them have descended of the said <hi>Blanch,</hi> as is manifest.</p>
               <p>And therefore lastly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond <hi>a fiction.</hi>
                  </note> the matter standeth (no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> doubt) as <hi>Polidor</hi> holding in the latter end of the life of King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. where having mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these two Sons <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Edmond,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth these words. <hi>There wanted not certain men long time after this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Polyd. in fine vit. Henr. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that affirmed this</hi> Edmond <hi>to be the elder Son to King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> III. <hi>and to have been deprived of his Inheritance, for that he was deformed in body; but these things were feigned, to the end that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104608:116"/>
King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> IV. <hi>that came by his Mothers side of this</hi> Edmond, <hi>might seem to have come to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by right, whereas indeed he got it by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus saith <hi>Polidor</hi> in this place, but afterward in the beginning of the life of the said King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. he saith, that some would have had King <hi>Henry</hi> to have pretended this Title among other reasons, but that the most part accounting it but a meer fable, it was omitted.</p>
               <p>Now then it being clear, that of these two Sons of King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lawful Heir, it remaineth only that we set down their several descents unto the times of King <hi>Edward</hi> the III. and his Children, in whose days the dissention and controversie between these Royal Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> began to break forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104608:124"/>
                  <hi>Lancaster</hi> very clear, and undoubted; but such others as wrote since that time (while the House of <hi>York</hi> hath held the Scepter) they have spoken in a far different manner,<note place="margin">Polyd. in fine vit.

               <p>But now if we will consider the manner and

form of this act, they of <hi>Lancaster</hi> do affirm also,<note place="margin">Whether the manner of deposing K. <hi>Richard</hi> were good.</note> that it could not be executed in better nor more convenient order. First, for that it was done by the choice and invitation of all the Realm, or greater and better part thereof, as hath been said. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that it was done without slaughter; and thirdly, for that the King was deposed by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and himself convinced of his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Government, and brought to confess that he was worthily deprived, and that he willingly and freely resigned the same: neither can there be any more circumstances required (say these men) for any lawful deposition of a Prince.</p>
               <p>And if any man will yet object and say, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this there was violence, for that Duke <hi>Henry</hi> was Armed, and by force of Arms brought this to pass; they of <hi>Lancaster</hi> do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that this is true, that he brought the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to an end by Forces,<note place="margin">Arms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for removing an evil Prince.</note> for that an evil King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed but by force of Arms, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ordinary way of remedy left by God unto the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>; for seeing that a Tyrannical or obstinate evil Prince, is an Armed enemy with his feet set on the Realms head, certain it is, that he cannot be driven nor plucked from thence, nor brought in order, but by force of Arms. And if you say that God may remedy the matter otherwise, and take him away by sickness, and other such means, it is answered, that God will not always bind himself to work Miracles, or to use extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means in bringing those things to pass, which he hath left in the hands of men, and of <hi>Commonwealths</hi> to effectuate, by ordinary way of Wisdom and Justice.

               <p>By all which examples, that fell out almost within one age in divers Nations over the World, (letting pass many others which the <hi>Civilian</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his discourse before, for that they are of more ancient times) these favourers of the House of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> do infer, that the right of the Uncle before the Nephew, was no new or strange matter in those days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and that if we will deny the same now, we must call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the succession and right of all the Kingdoms and States before-mentioned, of <hi>Naples, Sicily, Spain, Britany, Flanders, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>

whose Kings and Princes do evidently hold their Crowns at this day by that very Title, as hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>Moreover they say,<note place="margin">Opinions of Lawyers for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and Uncle.</note> that touching Law in this point, albeit the most famous Civil Lawyers of the World, be somewhat divided in the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, some of them favouring the Uncle, and some other the Nephew, and that for different reasons: as <hi>Baldus Oldratus, Panormitanus,</hi> and divers others alledged by <hi>Gulielm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Touching our Common Laws,<note place="margin">Touching the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England</hi>
                  </note> the favourers of <hi>Lancaster</hi> do say two or three things; first, that the right of the Crown, and interest thereunto, is not decided expresly in our law, nor is it a plea subject to the common rules thereof, but is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104608:138"/>
and more eminent; and therefore that men may not judge of this as of other pleas of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, nor is the Tryal alike, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maxims or rules always of force in this thing, as in others, which they prove by divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cases; as for example, the Widow of a private man shall have her thirds of all his Lands for her Dowry,<note place="margin">Different rules in succession of the Crown, &amp; of other Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances.</note> but not the Queen of the Crown. Again, if a private man have many daughters, and die seized of Lands in Fee-simple, without Heir Male, his said daughters by law shall have the said Lands as co-partners equally divided between them, but not the daughters of a King, for that the eldest must carry away all, as though she were Heir male. The like also is seen, if a Baron match with a Feme that is an Inheritrix, and have Issue by her, though she die, yet shall he enjoy her Lands during his life, as Tenant by courtesie; but it is not so in the Crown, if a man marry with a Queen, as King <hi>Philip</hi> did with Queen <hi>Mary</hi>: and so finally they say also, that albeit in private mens possessions, the common course of our law is, that if the Father die seized of Land in Fee-simple, leaving a younger Son and a Nephew, that is to say a Child of his Elder Son, the Nephew shall succeed his Grandfather, as also he shall do his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, if of three Brethren the elder die without Issue, and the second leave a Son: yet in the inheritance and succession of the Crown it goeth otherwise, as by all the fotmer eight examples have been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this is the first they say about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law.</p>
               <p>The second point which they affirm is, that the ground of our Common Laws,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law grounded in Custom</note> consisteth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and almost only, about this point of the Crown, in custom, for so say they we see by experience, that nothing in effect, is written thereof in the common law, and all old Lawyers do affirm this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104608:138"/>
point, as were <hi>Ranulfus de Granvilla</hi> in his books of the laws and customs of <hi>England,</hi> which he wrote in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and Judge <hi>Fortescue</hi> in his book of the praise of <hi>English</hi> laws, which he compiled in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and others. Whereof these men do infer, that seeing there are so many presidents and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alledged before, of the Uncles case preferred before the Nephew, not only in foreign Countries, but also in <hi>England,</hi> for this cause (I say) they do affirm, that our common laws, cannot but favour also this title, and consequently must needs like well of the interest of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> as they avouch that all the best old Lawyers did in those times: and for example they do Record two by name, of the most famous learned men which those ages had,<note place="margin">Ancient Lawyers that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the House of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
                  </note> who not only defended the said title of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> in those days, but also suffered much for the same. The one was the forenamed Judge <hi>Fortes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and named Father of the common laws in that age, who fled out of <hi>England</hi> with the Queen, Wife of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and with the Prince her Son, and lived in banishment in <hi>France,</hi> where it seemeth also that he wrote his learned book intituled, <hi>de laudibus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Angliae.</hi> And the other was, Sir <hi>Thomas Thorpe,</hi> chief Baron of the Exchequer,<note place="margin">Hollingsh. in vit. Henrici 6. p. 1300.</note> in the same Reign of the same King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterward put into the <hi>Tower</hi> by the Princes of the House of <hi>York,</hi> for his eager defence of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> remained there a long time, and after being delivered, was beheaded at <hi>High-gate</hi> in a tumult, in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.<note place="margin">The sum of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie repeated.</note>
               </p>
               <p>These then are the allegations which the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> do lay down for the justifying of the title, affirming first, that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> ought to have succeeded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104608:139"/>
his Father King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Richard</hi>; and that injury was done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in that King <hi>Richard</hi> was preferred. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> secondly, that King <hi>Richard</hi> (were his right never so good) was justly and orderly deposed, for his evil Government, by lawful authority of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, that after his deposition, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> was next in succession every way, both in respect of the right of his Father, as also for that he was two degrees nearer to the King deposed, then was <hi>Edmond Mortimer</hi> descended of <hi>Leonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi>; and these are the principal and substantial proofs of their right and title.</p>

                  </note>But yet besides these, they do add all these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments and considerations following: first, that whatsoever right or pretence the House of <hi>York</hi> had,<note place="margin">Stow in vit.

                  <note place="margin">Stow in vit. Hen. 6.</note> which afterward was King, with the rest of his off-spring even to the ninth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (as <hi>Stow</hi> affirmeth) in a <hi>Parliament</hi> holden at <hi>Coventry</hi> in the year 1459. and in the 38. year of

the Reign of the said King <hi>Henry,</hi> and the very next year after the said <hi>Richard</hi> was slain in the same quarrel: but the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (say these men) was never attainted of any such crime.</p>
               <p>Secondly they say,that the House of <hi>York</hi> did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> enter only by violence, and by infinite bloudshed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>York</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by violence.</note> and by wilful murthering not only of divers of the Nobility both Spiritual and Temporal, but also of both King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth himself,<note place="margin">Stow in fine vit.

               <p>Thirdly they alledge, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> put down by the House of <hi>York,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The House of <hi>York</hi> put down a Holy King.</note> was a good and holy King, and had Reigned peaceably 40. years, and never committed any act, worthy deposition; whereas King <hi>Richard</hi> the second had many ways deserved the same, as himself came to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thereupon made a personal solemn and publick resignation of the said Crown unto his Cousen <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the which justified much the said <hi>Henry</hi>'s entrance.</p>

thereof, and by the States both Spiritual and Temporal, and with the consent of all foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; so that if there had been any fault in their first entrance, yet was this sufficient to authorize the same, as we see it was in the title of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror, and of his two Sons King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred before their elder Brether, and of King <hi>John,</hi> that entred before his Nephew, and of his Son King <hi>Henry</hi> the third that entred after his Fathers deprivation, and after the election of Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as also of <hi>Edward</hi> the third that entred by deposition of his own Father: of all which Titles, yet might there have been doubt made at the beginning, but by time and durance of possession, and by confirmation of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> they were made lawful, and without controversie.</p>

                  </note>But on the other side, there want not many that do accompt this pretence of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor just, nor any way expedient for the State of <hi>England</hi>; and they do answer largely to all the allegations before mentioned in his behalf.</p>
               <p>And first of all, as concerning his title, by near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of succession, they make little accompt thereof, both for that in it self (they say) it may easily be overthrown, and proved to be of no validity; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for that if it were never so good, yet might it for other considerations be rejected, and made frustrate, as our friend the Civil Lawyer, hath largely and learnedly proved these days; in our hearing.</p>
               <p>To begin then to speak first of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> title by nearness of bloud, these men do affirm, that albeit there be not alledged any bastardy in his des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, from King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh his daughter, as there is in her second marriage against the Lady <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>: yet are there other reasons enough to frustrate and overthrow this claim and pretention, and first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of all, for that he is not (say these men) of the house of <hi>Lancaster</hi> by Lady <hi>Blanch</hi> the only true Heir there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Scots</hi> not of the House of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>

                  </gap>le of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> is better then that of <hi>York,</hi> as by many arguments the favours of <hi>Lancaster</hi> have endeavoured to shew in the former Chapter, they do infer that this is sufficient, to make void all claim of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> that he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by nearness of bloud, especially seeing there want not at this day pretenders enough of the other House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> to claim their right, so as the House of <hi>York</hi> shall not need to enter, for fault of true H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irs, and this is the first argument which is made against the <hi>Scottish</hi> King and all the rest of his lineage, by the favourers and followers of the said House of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A second argument is made against the said Kings succession not by them of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Scots</hi> forrain born.</note> but rather by those of his own House of <hi>York,</hi> which is founded upon his foreign birth, by which they hold that he is excluded, by the common laws of <hi>England</hi> from succession to the Crown, for that the said laws do bar all strangers born out of the Realm, to inherit within the Land; and this is an argument handled very largely between the foresaid books of Mr: <hi>Hales,</hi> Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Ross</hi>; and for that the same doth concern much the pretentions and claims of divers others, that be strangers also by birth, and yet do pretend to this succession, as before hath been declared: I shall repeat briefly in this place, the sum of that which is alledged of both parties in this behalf.</p>
               <p>First then, to the general assertion,<note place="margin">The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain birth.</note> that no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all may inherit any thing, by any means in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104608:146"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> the said books of Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ross</hi> do answer, that in that universal sense, it is false, for that it appeareth plainly by that which is set down by law in the seventh and ninth years of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and in the eleventh, and fourteenth of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may purchase Land in <hi>England</hi>; as also that he may inherit by his Wife if he should marry an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritrix.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers may inherit.</note>Secondly, they say, that the true maxim of rule against the Inheritance of strangers, is grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a Statute made in the 25th. year of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, and is to be restrained unto proper inheritances only, to wit, that no person born out of all the allegiance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> whose Father and Mother were not of the same allegiance at the time of his birth (for so are the words of the Statute) shall be able to have or demand any heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage within the same allegiance, as Heir to any person.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons why the statute toucheth not one case.</note>Thirdly they say, that this axiom or general Rule cannot any way touch or be applied to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Crown, first, for that as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, no Axiom or Maxim of our Law can touch or be understood of matters concerning the Crown, except express mention be made thereof, and that the Crown is priviledged in many points that other private heritages be not.</p>
               <p>And secondly, for that the Crown cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called an Inheritance of Allegiance or within Allegiance, as the words of the said Statute do stand, for that it is not holden of any superior,<note place="margin">The Crown not holden by allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> nor with allegiance, but immediately from God. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that the Statute meaneth plainly of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances by descent (for otherwise as is said an Alien may hold Lands by purchase) but the Crown is a thing incorporate, and descendeth not according to the common course of other private inheritances,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104608:146"/>
but rather goeth by Succession as other Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do, in sign whereof, no King can by Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void his Letters Patents by reason of his noneage, as other common Heirs under age do, but he is ever presumed to be of full age, in respect of his Crown, even as a Prior, Parson, Dean, or other Head In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate, is, which can never be presumed to be within age; and so, as any such Head Incorporate though he be an Alien, might inherit or demand lands in <hi>England</hi> for his Incorporation, notwithstanding the former Statute, so much more the Inheritor to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they say, that in the very Statute it self there is express exception of <hi>Infantes du Roy,</hi> by which words, these men do hold to be understood all the Kings Off-spring or Blood Royal, and they do fortifie their proof, for that otherwise King <hi>Edward</hi> the third being then alive when this Statute against strangers was made, and his Children also, who had dispersed their bloud by marriages over all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they would never have suffered such a Statute to pass to their own prejudice, if the heritage of the Crown should fall unto them, or any of theirs, that should be born abroad.</p>
               <p>And finally,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>5.</hi> Reason.</note> these men do shew how that King <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, born out of the Realm, and of Parents that were not of the allegiance of <hi>England</hi> when they were born, were yet admitted to the Crown without contradiction, in respect of their forraign birth, which argueth that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course of our old common Laws, there was no such stop against Aliens; and that if the Statute made in King <hi>Edward</hi> the third his days would have dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated or abridged this ancient liberty, it would have made scpecial mention thereof, which it doth not, as hath been shewed, and by reasons it seemeth, that they have answered sufficienly to this objection of forraign birth, both for the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104608:147"/>
other pretenders that are foreign born, so as by this impediment they may not in right be excluded from their succession.</p>

                  </note>So as now I will return to shew the other reasons of exclusion which men do lay against the House of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereof one is urged much by the House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and grounded upon a certain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth as before hath been touched, by which Testament the said House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that is to say: the Heirs of the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> and of the Lady <hi>Eleanor,</hi> Neeces to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by his second Sister <hi>Mary,</hi> are appointed to succeed in the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heirs of <hi>Margaret</hi> the first Sister, married in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if King <hi>Henry</hi>'s own Children should come to die without Issue, as now they are all like to do, and this Testament had both the Kings hand or stamp unto it, and divers Witnesses names be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and was enrolled in the Chancery, and was authorized by two Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> two wit, in the 28. and 35. years of King <hi>Henry,</hi> in which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> authority was given to the said King, to dispose and ordain of this point of succession, as he and his learned Councel should think best for the weal publick.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answers to the King's Testament.</note>This is the effect of this Argument, which albeit the former Books of Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> and some other of the <hi>Scottish</hi> favourers, do seek to refut by divers means and ways, as before in the first chapter of this discourse is set down, and especially by the Testimony of the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Montague,</hi> that said the stamp was put unto it after the King was past sense, yet they of of the House of <hi>Suffolk</hi> are not satisfied without that answer; for that they say that at least, howsoever that matter of the late sealing be, yet seeing the King willed it to be done, drawn out and sealed, it appeareth hereby that this was the last Will and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104608:147"/>
judgment of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and not revoaked by him: which is sufficient (say these men) to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the intent and meaning of the Realm, and the authority committed to him, by the foresaid two Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the disposing of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, which two Acts (say these men) contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole authority of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> so seriously and diliberately given, in so weighty an affair, may not in reason be deluded or overthrown now by the saying of one or two men, who for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or contenting of the time wherein they speak, might say or guess that the Kings memory was past, when the stamp was put unto his Testament, which if it were so; yet if he commanded (as hath been said) the thing to be done, while he had memory (as it may appear he did; both by the Witnesses that subscribed, and by the enrollment thereof in the Chancery) no man can deny, but that this was the King's last Will, which is enough for satisfying the <hi>Parliaments</hi> intention, as these men do affirm.</p>
               <p>A fourth argument is made against the King of <hi>Scots</hi> Succession,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Scots</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the statute of associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> by all the other competitors joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it seemeth to them, to be an argument that hath no solution or reply, for that it is grounded upon a plain fresh Statute, made in the <hi>Parliament</hi> holden in the 27 year (if I erre not) of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty that now is; wherein it is enacted and decreed, that whosoever shall be convinced to conspire, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or procure the death of the Queen, or to be privy or accessary to the same, shall lose all right, title, pretence, claim or action, that the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or their Heirs have or may have, to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Upon which Statute, seeing that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> late Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this King, was condemned and executed by the authority of the said <hi>Parliament,</hi> it seeemeth evident, unto these men, that this King who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth all his right to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by his said Mother, can have none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:104608:148"/>And these are the reasons, proofs and arguments, which divers men do alledge against the right of succession, pretended by the King of <hi>Scots.</hi> But now if we leave this point which concerneth the very right it self of his succession by bloud, and will come to examine other reasons and considerations of State, and those in particular which before I have mentioned that his favourers do alledge, utility and common good that may be presumed will rise to the Realm of <hi>England</hi> by his admission to our Crown, as also the other point also of establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion by them mentioned, then I say, these other men that are against his entrance, do produce many other reasons and considerations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, of great conveniencies (as to them they seem) against this point of admission and their reasons are these that follow.</p>
               <p>

First, for that the state and condition of <hi>Scotland</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it seemeth, that it can bring no other commodity to <hi>England,</hi> then increase of Subjects, and those rather to participate the commodities and riches of <hi>England,</hi> then to import any from <hi>Scotland.</hi> And then secondly, the aversion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural alienation of that people, from the <hi>English,</hi> and their ancient inclination to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> against us, maketh it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that, that subjection of theirs to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> would not long endure, as by experience we have seen, since the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, when after the death of their King <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the third, without Issue, they chose King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to be their King, delivered their <hi>Towns</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they say, That if the King of <hi>Scots</hi>

Besides that, the <hi>Scotch</hi>-men themselves (especially those of the Nobility) do openly profess, That they desire not this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Subordination unto <hi>England,</hi> which in no wise they can bear, both for the aversion they have to all <hi>English</hi> Government over them, as also for that their Liberties are far greater (as now they live) than in that case it would be suffered, their King coming hereby to be of greater Power to force them to the form of <hi>English</hi> Subjection, as no doubt but in time he would.</p>
               <p>And seeing the greatest utility that in this Case by reason and probability can be hoped for by this Union, is, That the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation should come to be advanced in <hi>England,</hi> and to be made of the Nobility both Temporal and Spiritual, and of the Privy-Council, and other like Dignities of Credit

yet) I shall in this place repeat in few words the principal points that are alledged in her behalf or prejudice.</p>
               <p>First of all then is alledged for her, and by her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that she is descended of the foresaid La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldest Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. by her second Marriage with <hi>Archibald Douglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Anguis,</hi> and that she is in the third degree only from her; for that she is the Daughter of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> who was Son of <hi>Margaret</hi> Countess of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Daughter to the said Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; so as this Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> is but Neece once removed unto the said Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> to wit, in equal degree of descent with the King of <hi>Scots</hi>; which King being excluded (as the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of this Woman do affirm) by the Causes and Arguments before-alledged against him, no reason (say they) but that this Lady should enter into his place, as next in Bloud unto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is alledged in her behalf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An</hi> English <hi>Woman.</hi>
                  </note> That she is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an <hi>English</hi> woman, born in <hi>England,</hi> and of Parents who at the time of her Birth were of <hi>English</hi> Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, wherein she goeth before the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as hath been seen; as also in this other principal point, that by her admission no such inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience can be feared of bringing in strangers, or causing Troubles or Sedition within the Realm, as in the pretence of the <hi>Scottish</hi> King hath been considered: And this in effect is all that I have heard alledged for her.</p>
               <p>But against her,<note place="margin">Against <hi>Arabella.</hi>
                  </note> by other Competitors and their Friends, I have heard divers Arguments of no small Importance and Consideration produced; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first is, that which before hath been alledged against the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to wit, that neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of them is properly of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not of the House of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
                  </note> as in the Genealogy set down in the third Chapter hath appeared. And secondly, That the title of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:104608:151"/>
is before the pretence of <hi>York,</hi> as hath been proved in the fourth Chapter; whereof is inferred, that neither the King of <hi>Scots</hi> nor <hi>Arabella</hi> is next in Succession; And for that of these two propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there hath been much treated before, I remit me thereunto; only promising, That of the first of the two (which is how King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. was of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> touching Right of Succession) I shall handle more particularly afterward, when I come to speak of the House of <hi>Portugal</hi>; whereby also shall appear plainly what pretence of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First of all, both of these Families do joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this one point, to exclude the House of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> both by foreign Birth, anh by the aforesaid Testament of King <hi>Henry,</hi> authorized by two <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and by the other Exclusions which in each of the titles of the King of <hi>cots</hi> and of Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> hath been before-alledged. But then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they come to vary between themselves about the Priority or Propinquity of their own Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; for the Children of the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:104608:154"/>
and their Friends do alledge,<note place="margin">Allegations of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Darby</hi> and <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> the one against the other.</note> That they do descend of Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> the elder Sister of Lady <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and so by Law and Reason ought to be preferred; But the other House alledgeth against this two Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments; the one, That the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Countess of <hi>Darby</hi> now living, is nearer by one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Stem, that is, to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. then are the Children of the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> had a Wife alive.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently (according to that which in the former fourth Chapter hath been declared) she is to be preferred, albeit the Children of the said Earl were legitimate.<note place="margin">First Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Issue of <hi>Hartford.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly they do affirm, That the said Children of the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> by the Lady <hi>Katharine Gray</hi> are many ways illegitimate. First, for that the said Lady <hi>Katharine Gray</hi> their Mother was lawfully married before to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> now living, as hath been touched,<note place="margin">Stow in vit. Edward</note> and publick Records do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,<note place="margin">An. 1553.</note> and not lawfully separated, nor by lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor for just Causes, but only for temporal and worldly respects; for that the House of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was come into misery and disgrace, whereby she remained still his true Wife, and before God, and so could have no lawful Children by any other whiles he yet lived, as yet he doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Bastardy.</note>Again, they prove the illegitimation of these Children of the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi>; for that it could never be lawfully proved that the said Earl and the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> were married, but only by their own assertions, which in Law is not holden suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for which occasion the said pretended Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was disannulled in the Court of <hi>Arches,</hi> by publick and definitive Sentence of Doctor <hi>Parker</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not long after the Birth of the said Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 Bastardy.</note>Furthermore, they do add yet another Bastardy also in the Birth of Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> her self; for that her Father Lord <hi>Henry Gray</hi> Marquess of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104608:154"/>
was known to have a lawful Wife alive when he married the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> Daughter and Heir of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and of <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Mother of this Lady <hi>Katharine,</hi> for ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the power of the Marquess and favour with King <hi>Henry</hi> in Womens matters was so great at that time, as the Earl could have no remedy, but only that his said Sister (who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many years after) had an Annuity out of the said Marquesses Lands during her life, and lived some years after the said Marquess (afterwards made Duke) was put to death in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time.</p>
               <p>These then are three ways by which the Family of <hi>Darby</hi> to argue the Issue of <hi>Hartford</hi> to be Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate;<note place="margin">The fourth Bastardy common to both Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi>
                  </note> but the other two Houses of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Clarence</hi> do urge a former Bastardy also that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both, to wit, both against the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> and the Lady <hi>Eleanor</hi>; for that the Lord <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> also Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> had a Wife alive (as before hath been signified) when he married the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi>; by which former Wife he had Issue the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> (I mean the Wife of my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> of <hi>Poistlands</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi>) and how long after the new Marriage of her Husband <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> this former Wife did live, I cannot set down distinctly; though I think it were not hard to take particular information there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in <hi>England</hi> by the Register of the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she was buried; But the Friends of the Countess of <hi>Darby</hi> do affirm that she died before the Birth of the Lady <hi>Eleanor</hi> the second Daughter, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Birth of the Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> and thereby
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104608:155"/>
they do seek to clear the Family of <hi>Darby</hi> of this Bastardy, and to lay all four upon the Children of <hi>Hartford</hi> before-mentioned; But this is easie to be known and verified by the means before-signified.</p>

               <p>But as for the third Illegitimation of the Contract between the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> by a Prae-contract made between the said Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> that now liveth, they say and affirm that Prae-contract to have been dissolved afterwards lawfully and judicially in the time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>

                  </note>There remaineth then only the fourth Objection, about the secret Marriage made between the said Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> before the Birth of their eldest Son now called Lord <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi> which, to say the truth, seemeth the hardest point to be answered; For albeit in the sight of God that Marriage might be good and lawful, if before their carnal knowledge they gave mutual consent the one to the other to be man and Wife,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104608:155"/>
and with that mind and intention had carnal Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which thing is also allowed by the late Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it self, which disannulleth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise all clandestine and secret Contracts in such States and Countries where the authority of the said Council is received and admitted; yet to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie these kind of Marriages in the face of the Church, and to make the Issue thereof legitimate and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to Estates and Possessions: it is necessary by all Law, and in all Nations, that there should be some witness to testifie this Consent and Contract of the parties before their carnal knowledge; for that otherwise it should lie in every particular mans hand to legitimate any Bastard of his, by his only word, to the prejudice of others that might in equity of Succession pretend to be his Heirs; and therefore (no doubt) but that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had great reason to pronounce this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to be insufficient and unlawful, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did affirm that they had given mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before of being Man and Wife, and that they came together, <hi>animo maritali,</hi> as the Law of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock requireth; but yet (for that they were not able to prove their said former consent by lawful Witnesses,) their said Conjunction was rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unlawful; and so I conclude that the first Son of these two Parties might be legitimate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and yet illegitimate before men, and consequently incapable of all such Succession as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he might pretend by his said Mother.</p>
               <p>And this now is for the first begotten of these two persons; for as touching the second Child,<note place="margin">How the second Son of the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> may be legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> divers men of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he may be freed of this Bastardy; for that both the Earl and the Lady being examined upon their first Child, did confess and affirm that they were Man and Wife, and that they had mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104608:156"/>
so to be and continue; which Confession is thought to be sufficient, both for ratifying of their old Contract, and also for making of a new, if the other had not been made before. And seeing that in the former pretended Contract and Marriage there wanted nothing for justifying the same before men, and for making it good in Law, but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Testimony of Witnesses, for proving that they gave such mutual Consent of minds before their Carnal knowledge, (for the presence of Priest or Minister is not absolutely necessary,) no man can say that there wanted Witnesses for testifying of this Consent before second Copulation, by which was begotten the second Son; for that both the Queen her self, and her Council, and as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides as examined these Parties upon their first Act and Child-birth, are Witnesses unto them, that their full Consents and Approbations to be Man and Wife; which they ratified afterward in the Tower, by the begetting of their second Child, and so for the reasons aforesaid, he must needs seem to be legitimate, whatsoever my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for that time, or in respect of the great Offence taken by the Estate against that Act, did or might determine to the contrary.</p>

                  </note>But now thirdly entreth in also against the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> the opposition of some of his own House, which is of the Issue of Sir <hi>Geffrey Poole,</hi> Brother to his Grand-father, who say, That when the Lord <hi>Henry Montague</hi> was put to death, with his Mother the Countess of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and thereby both their Pretences and Titles cut off in them, then fell such right as they had, or might have, upon the said Sir <hi>Geffrey Poole,</hi> and not upon his Neece the Lady <hi>Katharaine,</hi> Daughter of the Lord <hi>Henry</hi> his elder Brother, and Mother of the Earl of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; and this for three Causes: First, for that he was not Attainted; and so whether we respect his Grand-father <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> or his Great-grand-father <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the said Right in this respect is descended to him: And secondly, for that he was a degree nearer to the said Duke's Ancestors than was at that time his Neece <hi>Katharine</hi>; which right of nearest Propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity (say these men) is made good and lawful by all the Reasons, Examples, Presidents and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities alledged before in the fourth Chapter of this Conference, in favour of Uncles before their Nephews; And it shall not need that we speak any thing more of that matter in this place, but only to remit your remembrance to that which herein hath been said before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they prove the same in favour of Sir <hi>Geffrey,</hi> for that the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Sir <hi>Geffrey</hi> a man, whose priviledge is so great in a matter of Succession, (as also hath been touched before) that albeit they had been in equal degree, and that Sir <hi>Geffrey</hi> were not a degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, as he was; yet seeing neither of them, nor their Fathers, were ever in possession of the thing pretended, Sir <hi>Geffrey</hi> should be preferred, as hath been shewed before by some Presidents, and shall be seen afterwards in the Case of <hi>Portugal</hi>;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104608:159"/>
wherein the King of <hi>Spain</hi> that now is was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Crown for that only respect, that his Competitors were Women, and in equal degree of descent with him, and he a Man. And the very like Allegations of Propinquity I heard produced for the Lady <hi>Winifred,</hi> Wife of Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> (if she be yet alive) to wit, that she is before the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> and his Brethren, by this reason of Propinquity in Bloud, for that she is one degree nearer to the stock than they.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and lastly, both these and other Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors do alledge against the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi>

                  </note> as an important and sufficient bar against his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the quality of his Religion; which is, (as they say) that he hath been ever known to favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those who commonly in <hi>England</hi> are called <hi>Puritans,</hi> and not favoured by the State; but yet this stop is alledged diversly by Competitors of divers Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For that such as are followers and favourers of the form of Religion received and defended by publick Authority of <hi>England</hi> at this day, whom, for distinction-sake, men are wont to call by the name of <hi>moderate Protestants</hi>; these (I say) do urge this Exclusion against the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> not upon any certain Law or Statute extant against the same, but <hi>ab equo &amp; bono,</hi> as men are wont to say, and by reason of State, shewing infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, hurts, damages and dangers that must needs ensue, not only to the present State of Religion in <hi>England,</hi> but also to the whole Realm and Body-politick, if such a man shall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to govern. And this Consideration of State in their opinion is a more forceable Argument for Excluding such a man, then any Statute or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Law against him could be; for that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the very intention, meaning and drift of all Laws and Law-makers of our Realm, whose intentions must needs be presumed to have been at
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104608:160"/>
all times to have Excluded so great and manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: And thus they say.</p>
               <p>But now those that are of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and contrary both to <hi>Puritan</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> do urge a great deal further this Argument against the Earl, and do alledge many Laws, Ordinances, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Statutes both of the Canon and Imperial Laws, as also out of the old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which (in their opinion) do debar all that are not of their Religion, and consequently they would hereby Exclude both the one and the other Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And in fine, they do conclude, that seeing there wanteth not also some of their own Religion (called by them the Catholick) in the House of <hi>Clarence,</hi> they have so much the less difficulty to exclude the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi>'s person for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if one of that House were to be admitted of necessity.</p>
               <p>And this is so much as seemeth needful to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at this time, and in this place, of this House of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and of the Pretenders thereof.

                  </note>But after this again, these men do shew, how that the said Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> doth descend also from <hi>Henry</hi> III. son of King <hi>John,</hi> by the Dukes of <hi>Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> as before in the second Chapter hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and in the Arbor and Genealogy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the end of this Conference shall be seen; for that King <hi>Henry,</hi> besides his two Sons <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Edmond,</hi> which were the beginners of the two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> had also a Daughter named <hi>Beatrix,</hi> married to <hi>John</hi> the second of that Name, Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> and by him she had <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> II. and so lineally from him have descended the Princes of that House, until their Union with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and from thence unto this Lady Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> that now is, who taketh her self for proper Heir of the said House of <hi>Britany,</hi> and Heir general of <hi>France,</hi> as hath been said.</p>
               <p>By this Conjunction then of the House of <hi>Britany</hi> with the Bloud-Royal of <hi>England,</hi> the Friends of the Infanta do argue in this manner, That seeing she descendeth of the Sister of these two Brothers which were the Heads of the two opposite Houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York</hi>; and considering that each of these Houses hath often-times been Attainted, and Excluded from the Succession by sundry Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and at this present are opposite, and at contention among themselves, why may not this right of both Houses (say these men) by way of Composition,<note place="margin">Admission by Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Peace and Comprize at least be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over to the Issue of their Sister, which resteth in the Infanta?</p>
               <p>Again, they say, That all these three Branches of the Lines, to wit, by the Lady <hi>Constance</hi> Daughter of King <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> by the Lady <hi>Eleanor</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104608:163"/>
Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. and by the Lady <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. it is evident, that this Lady the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> is of the true anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bloud-Royal of <hi>England,</hi> and that divers ways she may have Claim to the same; which being granted, they infer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That seeing matters are so doubtful at this day, about the next lawful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that divers of the Pretenders are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, some for Bastardy, some other for Religion, some for unaptness to Govern, and some for other Causes; and seeing the Commonwealth hath such Authority to dispose in this Affair, as before the Civil-Lawyer hath declared, why may there not Consideration be had among other Pretenders, of this noble Princess also (say these men) especially, seeing she is unmarried, and may thereby commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date many matters, and salve many breaches, and satisfie many hopes, and give contentment to many desires, as the world knoweth.</p>
               <p>And this is in effect as much as I have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged hitherto in favour of the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi>;<note place="margin">Objections against the Infanta's pretence.</note> but against this Pretence others do produce divers Arguments and Objections; As first of all, That these her Claims be very old, and worn out, and are but Collateral by Sisters. Secondly, That she is a Stranger and Alien born Thirdly, That her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is contrary to the State. Unto all which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, the favourers aforesaid do make their Answers, And to the first, they say, That Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hurteth not the goodness of a Title, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is offered to advance the same; especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n Titles belonging to Kingdoms, which commonly are never presumed to die, as hath been said, and <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi</hi> saith our Law. And as for Collateral Lines, they say, That they may lawfully be admitted to enter when the direct Lines do either fail, or are excluded, for other just respects, as in our Case they hold that it happeneth.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104608:164"/>
And as for the second point of Foreign Birth, they say there hath been sufficient answer before, in treating of the House of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that in rigour it is no bar, by intention of any <hi>English</hi> Law; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reason of State and politick Government, it may be a just impediment or no, it shall after be handled more at large, when we come to treat of the House of <hi>Portugal.</hi> To the last point of Religion they answer, that this impediment is not universal, nor admitted in the Judgment of all men, but only of those <hi>English</hi> that be of different Religion from her. But to some others (and those many, as these men do ween) her Religion will rather be a motive to favour her Title, then to hinder the same: so that on this ground no certainty can be builded, and this is as much as I have to say at this time, of these two Families of <hi>Clarence</hi> and <hi>Britany.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> was Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> by the right of his first Wife Lady <hi>Blanch,</hi> and had by her only one Son, as also one Daughter, of whom we need here to speak, for that the other hath left no Issue now living. The Son was King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. who had Issue King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th and he again <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. in whom was extinguished all the succession of this Son <hi>Henry</hi>

               <p>The daughter of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> by Lady <hi>Blanch</hi> was called <hi>Philippa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Issue of Lady <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippa</hi> Qu. of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
                  </note> who was married to <hi>John</hi> the first King of that name of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who had Issue by him King <hi>Edward,</hi> and he again had Issue King <hi>Alfonsus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the fifth King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and he and his off-spring had Issue again the one after the other until our times; and so by this marriage of Lady <hi>Philippa,</hi> to their first King <hi>John,</hi> these Princes of the House of <hi>Portugal</hi> that live at this day, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the Inheritance of <hi>Lancaster</hi> is only in them, by this Lady <hi>Philippa,</hi> for that the succession of her elder Brother King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long ago.

Marriage of the Parties for legitimating such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as are born in simple Fornication; that is to say, between parties that were single, and none of them married, cannot take place here; So as these men conclude, that albeit this Legitimation of Parliament might serve them to other purposes, yet not to deprive the Princes of <hi>Portugal</hi> of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to succeed in their Mothers Right, which she had when she was married to their Father.</p>
               <p>And this they affirm to have been Law and Right at that time, if the said Queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> and Earl <hi>John</hi> had been alive together, when <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth and his Son were put to death; and that this Question had been then moved at the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth,<note place="margin">The Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Lady <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippa</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Causes why <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, For that he had been ever so taken all the time of his Fathers Life, and no man ever doubted thereof, or called the matter in question, until now that himself denyed the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that in the time of <hi>Julius Tertius</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>Pope,</hi> when certain Decrees came out from <hi>Rome,</hi> against the promotion of Bastards; the same <hi>Don Antonio</hi> Sued to the said <hi>Pope,</hi> to be Dispensed withal in that Case; which argueth that then he knew himself not Legitimate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that his Father the Lord <hi>Lewis</hi> had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> often times both by Word and Writing testified the same, that this <hi>Antonio</hi> was his Bastard, and had signified also so much in his last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The said Cardinal as of himself, also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> affirmed, that if his Brother the Lord <hi>Lewis,</hi> had ever done any such thing, as to Marry this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was but Base in Birth, and of <hi>Jewish</hi> Race, as these Stories do affirm: That it is like, that he would have made some of his own Friends acquainted therewith, as a matter so much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104608:172"/>
Important for them to know; but he never did, though the said Cardinal avowed that himself was present with him at his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, he said, that if <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had been Legitimate, how happened that he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Succession before the Cardinal himself, next after the death of <hi>Sabastin,</hi> seeing that he was to have gone before the said Cardinal by as good Right, as his other Nephew <hi>Sabastian</hi> did, if he had been Legitimate; for that he was Son also to the Cardinals Elder Brother, as hath been said.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly and lastly, the said King Cardinal avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> partly the disagreeing, and partly the open confessing of the Witnesses, that they were to be Suborned by him; upon all which Causes and Considerations, he proceeded to the Judicial Sentence before alledged.</p>
               <p>Thus passed the matter in the Case of <hi>Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> who if he had been Legitimate, no doubt, but by all Right he should have been preferred before all the other pretenders to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and must be at this day, towards the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>

               <p>And for Proof and Declaration of this their Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they do require first of all, that this ordinary and common prejudice against Strangers or strange Governments, be laid aside, so long at least, as the matter is in Disputation, and that only the true effects of good and profitable Government may be considered,<note place="margin">The effect of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be considered, and not the Governours</note> without that other circumstance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these fruits do come from Stranger or Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Prince, which effects are Peace, Rest, Justice, Defence of the Innocent, Punishment of the wicked, Wealth Security, and other such benefits, that good Government is wont to bring with it to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. These things (say these men) are to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indifferently, and without passion, by Wise men, and wheresoever these effects are more abundantly to be found, there the Government is best, and there the subjects are in best Case, whatsoever the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours be, or of what Nation or Country soever they be.

               <p>If in two Countries or Commonwealths, lying nigh together, the subjects of the one, should live in all Ease, Wealth and Prosperity, under a stranger, as divers states did under the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should be Beaten, Whipped and Afflicted

And when the Subjects do live well and prosperously, are defended and maintained in Peace, Safety and Wealth, when Justice is done equally to all men, the wicked punished, and the good advanced and rewarded, when God is honoured, and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion maintained, and vertue promoted; this is that which importeth the Realm and Subjects; and not where, or in what Country the Prince and his Officers were Born, or of what Nation, Language or Kindred they be.

               <p>This is that then which these men do first require,<note place="margin">Who are properly Strangers.</note> to wit, that all Fancy and Fond Opinion of the Vulgar people be aparted in this matter, from Truth and Substance; as also say they, we ought to desire and determine who are properly Strangers, or Foreigners, seeing some do take for Strangers and Foreigners, all those that are not of the same Dominion and Government, though otherwise they be of the same Nation and Language, according as those other men that are Enemies to Strangers, said a little before (if you remember) that the Princes of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> and their Kindred are taken for Strangers in <hi>France,</hi> by them that by that means would make them odious to the people, for that their Ancestors in times past came out of <hi>Lorain,</hi> which is a Province joyning hard upon <hi>France,</hi> of the same Nation, Language and Manners, but only under another Prince.

               <p>But yet this matter may seem perhaps the less marvellous, and more excusable,<note place="margin">Execution of Nobility by <hi>Henry</hi> the eight.</note> under those two Kings, for that Troubles and Contentions had passed a little before in the Realm about the Succession, and herupon so many of the Nobility might be cut off: But let us see then what ensued afterwards, when things were established, and all doubt of contention about the Succession taken away, as in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the his days it was; and yet do I find Registred in our Chronicles these persons following, either made away, cut off, or put down, by the said King, to wit, two Queens, <hi>Ann</hi> and <hi>Catharine,</hi> three Cardinals put down and disgraced, <hi>Woolsey, Pool,</hi> and <hi>Fisher,</hi> whereof the last was Beheaded; soon after his Dignity given him in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the first was Arrested, the second Attainted of imagined Treasons: three Dukes put down, to wit, the Noble Dukes of <hi>Buckingham, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi>; whereof the last lost his Lands, Dignities and Liberty only, the former two both Lands and Lives.

This I say is one way, and another is, that this Prince do bring Forces with him, for his own assurance, and these either present, as the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings, <hi>Sweno, Canutus, Haraldus</hi> and <hi>Hardicanutus</hi> did, and as after them the <hi>Norman</hi> Princes also used, I mean not only <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> himself, but also his two Sons <hi>William Rufus</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the I who either by help of the <hi>Normans,</hi> already in <hi>England,</hi> or by others brought in by them afterwards, wrought
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104608:190"/>
their will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else that this Prince so entring have Foreign Forces, so at hand, as he may call and use them when he will, for that they have no Sea to pass, which is the case of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and of both these wayes these men do give their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A foreign Prince without Forces not prejudicial</note>For as concerning the former way, when a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince entreth without any Forces at all, and with intention to live among us, they hold, that there is no danger, nor yet any inconvenience can justly be feared: for that in this case he subjecteth himself rather to the Realm and Nation, than they to him, and if he live and marry in <hi>England,</hi> both himself and his Children will become <hi>English</hi> in a little space. And for his own assurance he must be inforced to favour and cherish and make much of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and be liberal, gentle and friendly to all, for gaining their good wills and friendship. And in one very great and important point his condition is different,<note place="margin">Note this utility of a foreign King.</note> and better for the <hi>English</hi> than any <hi>English</hi> Kings can be, which is, that he entreth with indifferent mind towards all men, hath no kindred or alliance within the Land, to whom he is bound, nor enemy against whom he may be inticed to use cruelty, so as only merit or demerit of each man, must move him to favour or disfavour, which is a great Foundation (say these men) of good and equal Government.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104608:190"/>
and perhaps much more than now it enjoyeth, (for such Princes commonly and upon such occasions of Preferment would yield to much more in those Cases than a home-born Prince would,) and the other Pretenders at home also, should remain with more security than they can well hope to do under any <hi>English</hi> Competitor, if he come to the Crown, who shall be continually egged on by his own kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and by the aversion, emulation and hatred, that he has taken already by contention against the other opposite Houses, to pull them down, and to make them away, and so we have seen it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Examples, for many years, though no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (say these men,) hath ever been offered to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the same so much as now, if any one of the home <hi>English</hi> Bloud be preferred before the rest, and this is so much as they say to this second kind of being under Foreign Princes.

               <p>It is well known, (said he,) that in the Realm of <hi>England</hi> at this day there are three different and opposite Bodies of Religion, that are of most bulk,<note place="margin">Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> and that do carry most sway and power, which three Bodies are known commonly in <hi>England</hi> by the names of <hi>Protestants, Puritans</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> though the latter two do not acknowledge these Names, and for the same cause would not I use them neither, if it were not only for clearness and brevities sake, for that, as often I have protested, my meaning is not to give offence to any Side or Party.</p>
               <p>These three Bodies then, (quoth he,) do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in effect all the Force of <hi>England,</hi> and do make so general a division and separation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Land in the hearts and minds of their Friends, Favourers and followers, as if I be not deceived, no one thing is like so much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in each Pretender, for his advancement or depression, as his Religion or inclination therein, by them that must assist him at that day, and are of different Religions themselves. And more I am of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104608:195"/>
opinion, (said he,) that albeit in other changes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The great Importance of Religion in this Action.</note> as in the entrance of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and of this Queens Majesty that now is, divers men of different Religions did for other respects concurr and joyn together for these Princes advancement, (notwithstanding that afterwards many of them repented the same) which is to be seen, in that for King <hi>Edward</hi> all the Realm without exception did concurr, and for Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it is known, that divers <hi>Protestants</hi> did by name, and among other points it is also known that Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> a fervent <hi>Protestant</hi> in those days, being of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Privy Chamber, did not only advise her of the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and decay of King <hi>Edward</hi> from day to day, but also was the first that sent an express Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to advise her of her Brother's death, and what the two Dukes of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> did contrive against her, and that with such celerity, that King <hi>Edward</hi> dying but on <hi>Thursday</hi> night, the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was most certainly advised thereof by <hi>Saturday</hi> morning next, and that very early, in <hi>Kenning-hall</hi>-Castle of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> 80. Miles off, and divers other <hi>Protestants</hi> did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist her also, in that her Entry, as in like manner all those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, did assist her Majesty that now reigneth, after the decease of the said Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and this was then.</p>
               <p>But I am of opinion, that matters will fall out far otherwise at the next Change, and this partly peradventure,<note place="margin">The next Change like to be difficult, and why.</note> for that the titles of Succession in the Pretenders are not so clear, but rather much more doubtful now than they were then, and partly, (or rather principally,) for that men in time are come to be of more resolution and determination in matters of Religion, and by contention and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing one the other, are become more opposite and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104608:195"/>
enemies, and more desirous of revenge, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also than this, those that be of milder and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition, and have not these passions in them, yet by Reason and Experience they do see the great absurdity and inconvenience that ensueth, by that a man of one Religion should give aid to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a Prince, of a contrary Religion, to that which himself doth esteem and hold for only truth, which, in him that so doth, cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that it is a point of little zeal at the least, if not contempt of God and of Religion, or of plain atheism, as others will call it. And moreover, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the <hi>Civilian</hi> before in the end of his Speech, inveighed also much against this point, and shewed that besides lack of Conscience and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it was in like manner against all humane wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and policy, to favour a pretender of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religion from himself, and this for divers reasons, that he laid down, which reasons I confess prevailed much with me, and I do allow greatly of that his opinion and assertion, which averred that the first respect of all others ought to be <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in this great Affair of making a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen,</hi> and that without this no Title whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to prevail or be admitted by <hi>Christian</hi> men, and that the Cities of <hi>France</hi> at this day do not amiss but justly and religiously (so long as they are of that Religion that they are) to stand against the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> (though otherwise by descent they do confess his Title to be clear and evident,) for that he is of contrary Religion to them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore seeing that the very same Case is like or rather certain to ensue one day in <hi>England,</hi> and that it is most probable that each Party of the Realm will stand most upon this Point, that is to say, upon the defence and advancement of their Religion, and of such a King as shall be known to favour the same that themselves be of; let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min

The points, that may invite, are his Youth, his being a King, his moderate nature in that he hath shed little blood hitherto, his affection in Religion to such as like thereof, and the like; but, on the other side, the reasons of State before laid against him, do seem to be of very great force, and to weigh much with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>-men, especially those of his Alliance with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and dependance of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation. And
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104608:199"/>
as for his Religion, it must needs displease two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of three before mentioned, and his manner of Government therein perhaps all three.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Arabella,</hi> in that she is a young Lady,<note place="margin">Arabella.</note> she is thereby fit, (as you know,) to procure good wills and affections, and in that she is unmarried, she may perhaps by her Marriage join some other Title with her own, and thereby also Friends.

And as for her Title, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as doubtful as the rest, if not more, as by that which hath been said before, hath appeared.

               <p>Thus he said, and fain would have left off here, but that the whole Company opposed themselves with great vehemency against it, and said, that he must needs perform his promise, made at the beginning of this Speech, to give his censure and verdict in the end, what he thought would be the Success of all these Matters, whereunto he answered, that seeing no <hi>nay</hi> would serve, he briefly quit himself by these few words following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First of all,</hi> (said he,) <hi>my opinion is,</hi>

                  <hi>that this Affair cannot possibly be ended by any possibility moral, without some War, at least wise, for some time at the beginning, whereof my Reasons be these that do ensue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This matter cannot be disputed and determined during the life of the Queen, that now is, without evident danger of her Person, for the reasons that all men do know importing such perils as are wont to

follow like cases, of declaring Heirs apparent, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially her Majesty the present possessor growing now to be old, and without hope of Issue.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This declaration and determination of the Heir apparent to the Crown, if it should be made now, would move infinite humours and affections within the Realm, and it were to stirr coals and to cast fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands over all the Kingdom, and further perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, which now lie raked up and hidden in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> This declaration now if it were made, would be hurtful and dangerous for him that should be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for on the one side it would put the Prince reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in great jealousy and suspicion of him; and on the other side would joyn and arm all the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders and their favourers against him: and so we read that of two or three only, that in all our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are recounted to have been declared Heirs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the Crown (they being no Kings Children) none of them ever came to reign: as namely Duke <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Britanny, Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>John de la Poole</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sup. c. 4.</note> as before hath been declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Again the multitude of Pretenders being such as it is, and their pretentions so ambiguous, as hath been declared, it is to be presupposed, that none or few of them will presently at the beginning cast away their hope and forego their Titles, but will prove at least wise what friends shall stand unto them, and how matters are like to go for or against them, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing they may do it without danger, no Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104608:203"/>
against them, and their Rights and Pretences so manifest, that no man can say they do it of ambition only, or malice, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or conspiration against others, and for this essay or first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Arms are necessary.</p>
               <p>Moreover if any man in process of time would forego or give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> over his Title, (as it is to be imagined that divers will at length,<note place="margin">A conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be marked.</note> and many must, for that one only can speed,) yet to the end he be not suddenly oppressed, or laid hands on, at the beginning by his adversary party, or made away, as in such cases is wont to succeed it is very likely that each Pretender for his own safety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will arm himself and his Friends at the beginning, for that better conditions will be made with armour in hands, than when a man is naked or in the power of his adversary, and no doubt but the more Pretenders shall stand together armed, at the beginning the easier and the surer peace will be made with him that shall prevail, for that they being many with whom he hath to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, he will respect them the more, and yield to more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and honourable conditions, than if there were but one, and he weak that should resist, for that a fault or displeasure is more easily pardoned to a multitude, and to a potent adversary, then to one or two alone that are of less account And on the other side, the peril of these other pretenders, that should not prevail, being common to them all, would knit them better together for their own defence, in living under the person that should prevail and reign, and he would bear more regard unto them, as hath been said: and this both for that they should be stronger by this union to defend themselves, and he that reigneth should have less cause to suspect and fear them, to work treason against him, for that they are many, and consequently not so easy to agree between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who should be preferred, if the other were pulled down, which to the person regnant would be also a ground of much secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>These are my Reasons and Conjecturs why it is like that Arms will be taken at the beginning in <hi>England,</hi> before this controversy can be decided.</p>
               <p>My <hi>second</hi> Position and Conjecture is,<note place="margin">The second conjecture no main Battel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</note> that this matter is not like to come easily to any great or main Battel, but rather to be ended at length, by some composition and general agreement, and my reasons for this be these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> for that the Pretenders be many, and their Powers and Friends lying in divers and different parts of the Realm, and if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there were but two, then were it more probable, that they would soon come to a Battel, but being many each one will fear the other, and seek to fortify himself where his own strength lieth, and especially towards the Ports and Sea-side, for receiving of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104608:204"/>
as easily may be done, by reason of the multitude of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, as hath been said, which will cause that at home the one will not much urge or press the other, at the beginning, but every part attend rather to strengthen than it self for the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A <hi>second</hi> Reason of this is, for that the foreign Princes and States round about us are like to be much divided in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, some as Pretendents for Themselves or their Kindred and Friends, and others as favourers of this or that Party, for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, so as there will not want presently offers of Helps and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from abroad, which Succours albeit they should be but mean or small at the beginning, yet will they be of much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when the Forces at home be divided, and when there shall be different Ports<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Harbours and Holds, ready within the Land, to receive and harbour them, so as I take it to be most likely, that this Affair will grow somewhat long, and so be ended at length by some composition only, and that either by Parliament and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Consent of all Parts pretendents, and of all three Bodies of Religion meeting together by their Deputies, and treat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude some form of agreement, as we see it practised now in <hi>France,</hi> or else by some other means of Commissaries, Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Legatss Deputies, or the like, to make the conclusion with every Party asunder.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The third Conjecture who is likest to prevail.</note>My third and last conjecture, (and for a meer conjecture only, I would have you to hold it,) that seeing there be two sorts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">For the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note>My <hi>Reasons</hi> for the former part, about the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> are, that she is a Woman, and may easily join, (if her Father will,) the Titles of <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> together, she is also unmarried, and by her Marriage may make some other composition, either at home or abroad, that may facilitate the matter, she is a great Princess and fit for some great State, and other Princes perhaps of Christendom would more willingly yield and concur to such a composition of Matters by this Lady, and by casting all Foreign Titles of <hi>Britanny</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> upon her, then that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should pretend for himself, and thereby encrease his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which other Princes his Neighbours, in reason of State, would not so well allow or bear.</p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> also it self if any Party or Person be affected that way, he would think hereby to have the more reason, and if any be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104608:204"/>
against Strangers, some such moderation as this would take away much of this aversion, as also of Arguments against it: for that hereby it seemeth that no subjection could be feared to any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Realm, but rather divers utilities to the Realm of <hi>England</hi> as these men pretend by the reasons before alledged in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter.</p>
               <p>I said also, that this Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> or some other by her Title and her Fathers good will, was likest of all Strangers to bear it away, for that if she should either dye or be married in any other Countrey, or otherwise to be disposed of, as her pretence to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> should be disenabled before this Affair came to be tried, then may her said Father and she, if they list, cast their foresaid Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and Titles, (as divers men think they would,) upon some other Prince of their own House and Blood, as for example, either upon some of the Families of <hi>Parma</hi> or <hi>Bragansa</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> seeing there wanteth not many able and worthy Princes of that House, for whom there would be the same reasons and considerations to perswade their admission by the <hi>English,</hi> that have been alledged before for the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the same utilities to the Realm, and motives to <hi>English</hi>-men, if such a matter should come in consultation, and the same Friends and Forces would not want abroad to assist them.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>second</hi> part of my <hi>Conjecture</hi> touching the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s second Son, or one of the Countess of <hi>Darbyes</hi> Children,<note place="margin">For the Earl of <hi>Hartfod</hi>'s second Son.</note> my Reasons be, <hi>First,</hi> for that this second Son seemeth to be cleared in our former Discourse of that Bastardy that most importeth, and nearest of all other lieth upon those Children, which is for lack <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of due proof of their Parents Marriage,<note place="margin">Sup. c. 6.</note> for which defect they do stand declared for illegitimate by publick sentence of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as before hath been declared, from which sentence this second Son is made free, by the arguments before alledged, and therein preferred before his elder Brother.</p>
               <p>And <hi>secondly,</hi> for that this younger Son is unmarried, for any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thing that I do know to the contrary, which may be a point of no small moment in such an occasion, as hath been noted divers times before, for joining or fortifying of Titles by Marriage, and for making of compositions of Peace and Union with the opposite Parties. And <hi>finally,</hi> for that this second Son, being young, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is not much talked of, and consequently every Party may have hope to draw him to their side, especially he being also free, as I have said, to follow what he shall think best, or most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for his own advancement, without knot or obligation to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low other mens affections or judgments in that point, as he would be presumed to be, if he were married, or much obliged to any other Family.</p>

                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> I do name the Children of this Countess in general, and not the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> particularly above the other, though he be the eldest, for two respects; <hi>First,</hi> for that his younger Brother is unmarried, which is a circumstance whereof divers times occasion hath been offered to speak before, and therefore I need to add no further therein.
