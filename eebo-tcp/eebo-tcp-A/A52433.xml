            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Affliction your <hi>Ladyship</hi> is under for the loss of your Sight is so <hi>great,</hi> and your Complaints upon that occasion so <hi>just,</hi> that I can neither blame you for the one, nor excuse my self from pittying you for the other. And indeed since you have been so unhappy as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the use of your Eyes, I think I owe your <hi>Ladyship</hi> so much Compassion, that I cannot better employ <hi>mine,</hi> than in writing you such a
<pb facs="tcp:95935:3"/>
                     <hi>Consolation,</hi> as the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of my New Retirement, with the serious Reflections I have lately made in it, will suggest.</p>
                  <p>And that I believe will be <hi>such,</hi> as is more peculiarly adapted to the <hi>Circumstance</hi> of your trouble, which tho oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd by a <hi>Common</hi> Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet, I find, proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Uncommon</hi> Principle. For tho 'tis to be presumed that, notwithstanding your great Contempt of the World, it must be a considerable part of your Affliction to lose the Sight of some delectable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in it, since the Wisest of Men (from whom your Ladyship cannot much dissent)
<pb facs="tcp:95935:3"/>
after a censure of vanity past upon all things under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is yet forc'd to confess that <hi>truly the Light is sweet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun</hi>; yet I perceive the chief reason why your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is so concern'd for the loss of your Sight, is because you are thereby deprived of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with your Books, and consequently retarded in your earnest pursuit after Learning and Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>'Tis upon this <hi>hinge</hi> I know that the main <hi>weight</hi> of your Sorrow <hi>turns,</hi> and therefore you will not want a <hi>Specific</hi> proper for your Malady, if you should chance
<pb facs="tcp:95935:4"/>
to be convinced that our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is generally misplaced, and that such an importunate pursuit after Learning and Knowledge is no way agreeable to the present Station and condition of Man. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you will no longer lament the loss of your Eyes, for disabling you from doing that, which perhaps would not be adviseable for you to do, if you had them again. If therefore you once come to be convinc'd of this, one main ground of your discontent is removed; and that you may, is the design of the following Reflections.</p>

What Reflections I made upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95935:5"/>
my <hi>own,</hi> are too peculiarly Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for my proper Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to be of any General use, and therefore I shall not trouble you with them. But as for those past upon the conduct of <hi>Humane Life,</hi> I think they are of too general use, and withal of too Weighty Consequence, not to be Communicated. These therefore I shall think worth while to draw up into a little more orderly form than wherein they were first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and present to your <hi>Ladyships</hi> Consideration.</p>

                     <p>First then I consider that the Conduct of Human Life must be to the <hi>End</hi> of Human Life, which is the same with the End of <hi>Man,</hi> which is <hi>Happiness.</hi> This conduct therefore must be and and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is, in <hi>Gross</hi> to <hi>Happiness.</hi> But now whereas there are two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or Powers of Man, by the right ordering of which this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is to be attain'd, <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>

and <hi>Will,</hi> therefore more immediately and distinctly, this Conduct of Human Life is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Government and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of these two Faculties, the due Regulation of which is the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate End,</hi> to which Human Life is to be Conducted.

                     <p>The business of this first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection shall be to Tax the General Conduct of Human Life, for placing Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in such things as are little or nothing Perfective of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. This I confess to be a Charge of more than ordinary Severity and Boldness; because it fastens an Imputation of Folly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Learned Order</hi> (for with them only is my present Concern) and not only so, but also in <hi>that</hi> very thing wherein they think their Wisdom and Intellectual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95935:6"/>
consists, and upon which they value themselves above the rest of Mankind. To question their Conduct in any thing else, would be but a trivial Charge, and such as they would not only readily <hi>Pardon,</hi> but <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi>; it being a common thing with Learned Men not only to <hi>own,</hi> but studiously to <hi>affect</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in things besides their Profession, as in Secular business, the common Affairs of Life, the Mysteries of Trades and the like. But to censure them as defective in that one thing they pretend to, to make that their <hi>Blind-side</hi> where they think they see clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; to maintain that they are not only not really wise and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that generally they don't so much as know what true Knowledge is, and that they generally place it in such things as contribute little or nothing to the Perfection of that, whereby they <hi>really</hi> excel the <hi>Brutes,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95935:7"/>
would be <hi>thought</hi> to excel the <hi>Common sort</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>; this is so high, and so disobliging a charge, that I fear those who from the force of what shall be here urg'd, may be <hi>convinc'd</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>forgive</hi> the <hi>Boldness</hi> of it.</p>

                     <p>But as high a charge as it is, I question not but that it may be, and will be here made good. And that it may appear to be true, we will first of all by way of <hi>Address</hi> or <hi>Preparation,</hi> consider what antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent grounds of probability there are, that men should generally place Learning and Knowledge in such things as are little or nothing perfective of the <hi>rational Part</hi>; and then in the second place we will proceed directly to prove that they do so.</p>

                     <p>As to the first, your <hi>Ladyship</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so little acquainted either with <hi>hidden Springs,</hi> or <hi>outward Workings</hi> of humane Nature, as not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95935:7"/>
to have observ'd that however strong and uuiversal is the desire of Knowledge, yet men are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more in Love with the <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> of it, than with the <hi>thing</hi> it self. There are indeed here and there a few <hi>humble retired</hi> Souls that are otherwise disposed, and like your <hi>Ladyship</hi> are so far from loving the Fame and Credit of knowledge <hi>before</hi> knowledge it self, that they don't love it at <hi>all,</hi> but are content to court Wisdom privately, and enjoy their own <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Dark.</hi>
                        <q>For it may be they consider that be their Attainments what they will, Fame is a thing of infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and contingency, that it depends more upon the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of men, or some more secret unaccountable <hi>Fate,</hi> than upon real excellency and merit, that some have the luck to be popular and cry'd up for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when in the mean while others that are really and highly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95935:8"/>
deserving can scarce keep their Heads above <hi>Contempt</hi>; that the World is seldom just to true Merit, and that nothing is weigh'd in a falser Ballance than real excellency, whether Moral or Intellectual; and that there is little reason to expect it should ever be otherwise as long as <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> hold the <hi>Scales.</hi> Then again it may be they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with themselves, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose true worth were secure of Reputation, yet what a poor slender good is it! For what is it to be <hi>talk'd of,</hi> or <hi>pointed at</hi>? Should a Man be never so Popular the <hi>Antipodes</hi> will never hear of him, or if they do, what is he the <hi>better</hi> for what is said of him <hi>there</hi>? And should his Fame, like the Sun, Travael round the whole Globe, besides that he is but Master of a Point when he has All, he can enjoy no more of it but just what he <hi>hears,</hi> which is inconsiderable.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95935:8"/>
And yet as inconsiderable as it is, 'tis like to be his whole Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as for <hi>Posthumous</hi> Glory, it comes too late to be any thing valuable. He will either not be sensible of it, or despise it. For certainly it must needs be mightily beneath the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of a separate state to put any value upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious praises of poor Mortals here below. Or suppose that a Deceas'd Spirit could take any delight in reflecting upon the Fame he has left behind him, yet 'tis to be considered that <hi>the Fashion of this world passes away,</hi> that those in whose praises he outlives himself, must also shortly dye, and that then his <hi>Fame</hi> will have a Funeral, as well as <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
                        </q>
These perhaps, or such like Considerations, may prevail with your <hi>Ladyship</hi> and a few more <hi>thinking</hi> Persons, to have but a very cold and indifferent regard for the Reputation of Learning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95935:9"/>
and Knowledge: But as for the generality of mankind it must be own'd that they are fond of it to a strange degree, and are more concern'd to be accounted Wise and Learned, than really to be so. Otherwise I question whether our <hi>Libraries</hi> would be so full as they are.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95935:9"/>
one <hi>determinate</hi> kind or nature in general, and consequently must require a certain peculiar frame and disposition of mind. Not a <hi>capacity,</hi> because the generality of men are known to have but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Intellectuals, suited to the exigencies of <hi>common</hi> life, when as true knowledge (what ever it be) must be supposed to be a thing of uncommon difficulty, and the study of it a work fit only for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer wits, the more elevated and <hi>Awaken'd</hi> part of Mankind.</p>

Why, the Latter Few may succeed well in the search of what they were naturally quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, and having attain'd to a

Competency of true Knowledge, such as is Perfective of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, they find themselves under no <hi>Temptation</hi> to place it in any thing else, or to bring into Credit any other sort of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Because having arrived so far, they are either wise enough to <hi>undervalue</hi> the Fame of being Learned, or else despair not of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it by their Proficiency in <hi>True Knowledge.</hi> Here therefore they take up their rest.</p>

                     <p>But now what shall we do with the <hi>others</hi>? Are they to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that they are not of a <hi>Make</hi> for the Study and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning? You'll find it tough work to convince them of that. But suppose it possible that they could be made sensible that they are not like to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence very Learned and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet all the World shall never be able to perswade them to lay aside that Natural itch of being

They have therefore but one way left, and that is, to <hi>turn the Tables,</hi> and cry up something or other for Learning which they are capable of. No matter whether it <hi>deserve</hi> that name, that is, whether it be really perfective of the Rational Part or no, 'tis enough if they can <hi>reach</hi> it. For those that can't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass <hi>true</hi> Riches, and yet will have the <hi>Name</hi> and credit of it, are put upon the Necessity of <hi>Coyning</hi> and <hi>Counterfeiting.</hi>

                     <p>And truly this Supposition seems to me so very reasonable,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95935:11"/>
that were experience altogether <hi>Silent</hi> in the Case, and were I utterly unacquainted with the State of Learning in the World, yet if I had a Draught given me of Human Nature, and were told how much the Ambition of being esteem'd as Learned and Knowing exceeds both the <hi>Desire</hi> and the <hi>Ability</hi> to be so, and were then ask'd what I thought would be the Intellectual Conduct of Human Life, I should without any further enquiry conclude that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability Men would generally place Learning and Knowledge in such things as signifie little or nothing to the Perfection of the understanding.</p>

                     <p>Here then 'twill be necessary to premise a Consideration of the Kinds of good. The most general distribution of which I conceive to be into these two, <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Contingent</hi> good. By necessary good I understand that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be good, that which is always and immutably good. And

this comprizes under it the good of the <hi>End</hi> which is desireable for it self, commonly called <hi>Pleasant good.</hi> And the good of the <hi>Means,</hi> which has an immutable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with it, and is desirable for the other, commonly call'd <hi>Profitable Good.</hi> By <hi>Contingent</hi> good I understand that which may, or may not be good, and is good, whenever it is so, only upon a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> account, because enjoyn'd by the Will of a Competent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This can never be the good of the <hi>End,</hi> or a self-desirable Good; nor can it be <hi>such</hi> a good of the <hi>Means</hi> as has a <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> connexion with it; but is always an Arbitrary and Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Means.</hi>

                     <p>This being briefly premised, I shall venture to assert that that good which is the Objective Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Will is <hi>Necessary Good.</hi> Either that which is <hi>Self-desirable,</hi> as God the Universal, or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95935:13"/>
any other particular pleasant good. Or else that which has an <hi>immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Connexion</hi> with it, as Moral good. As for Contingent good, that is no otherwise perfective of the Will, than in the force and vertue of the necessary good. For Obedience to a positive Law is no otherwise a Vertue, than as 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in some general natural Law, whereof 'tis a contingent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.

that it <hi>may</hi> be demonstrated. If then a Reason be demanded why the objective Perfection of the Will is only necessary, not contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent good, 'twill be sufficient to say, that that only is Perfective of the Will, which naturally, and of it self, makes it <hi>Happy,</hi> and wherein she can <hi>acquiesce</hi> with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and delight. But this is only necessary good, that which is essentially, intrinsically, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably good, either as the <hi>End,</hi> or as having a <hi>Natural Connexion</hi> with it, either of which involves Happiness.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95935:17"/>
Truth, that is, of the <hi>Divine Ideas</hi> wherein 'tis contain'd. As for Example, when I Speculate some Particular Artificial Triangle which is a Contingent Simple Truth, it is no otherwise Perfective of my Understanding than as it is beheld in its Necessary and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Nature, or (which is all one) in the <hi>Divine Idea.</hi> And thus again when I form a <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> concerning this Triangle, by ascribing to it some Property or other, which is a Contingent Complex Truth, this again is no otherwise Perfective of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding than as it belongs to, and is beheld in the Nature of a Triangle in <hi>Common,</hi> which is Necessary and Immutable, being no other than an Idea, or a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Mode</hi> of the <hi>Divine Omniformity.</hi> So that at length the Perfection of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is resolv'd into the Knowledge of Necessary Truth, which is its only Objective Perfection; that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95935:17"/>
which is Contingent being no way perfective of it, but only in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the other.</p>

                     <p>I am (<hi>Madam</hi>) very sensible how strange and Paradoxical this way of Philosophizing will seem to those who are either unaddict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Meditation in general, or not conversant in Theories of this kind, and therefore for <hi>their sakes,</hi> rather than for any <hi>inevidence</hi> of the <hi>Argument,</hi> I will give some Proof and Confirmation of it, which I will so order, that it shall be an <hi>Explanation</hi> at the same time. I will therefore first shew that <hi>'tis</hi> so, and secondly, <hi>how</hi> and <hi>why</hi> 'tis so. That it is so I prove thus: First, I suppose that God was once when there was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides God. Again, I suppose that as the Being of God did go before all other being in Order of <hi>time,</hi> so in Order of <hi>Nature</hi> it was ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent even to the Will of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, putting, or permitting any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95935:18"/>
thing. Again, I suppose that there was therefore then no other Truth but necessary Truth, that is, the Divine Ideas with their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Habitudes and Complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I suppose again, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God must be <hi>consider'd</hi> as knowing then only these <hi>necessary Truths.</hi> And yet I suppose again, that God was as perfect then as he is now; and consequently, that the Divine <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> was as perfect then as now, the Nature of God requiring not only that he should be <hi>Absolutely Perfect,</hi> but that he should be so in <hi>himself.</hi> Whence I infer, that therefore the whole Perfection of the Divine Understanding is to be resolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sole knowledge of <hi>Necessary Truths,</hi> and that the knowledge of <hi>Contingent Truth</hi> gives no Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, any otherwise than as 'tis beheld in that which is necessary, as was said before.</p>

                  <div n="27" type="part">
                     <head>XXVII.</head>
                     <p>From this Process of Reasoning,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95935:18"/>
I presume 'tis sufficiently evident, that the Objective Perfection of the <hi>Divine Vnderstanding</hi> is only <hi>Necessary Truth,</hi> which I take in the first place to be a strong ground of presumption, that the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Human Vnderstanding</hi> does also consist in the same. But to make it further plain that it does so, I suppose again, that nothing were to exist but only God, and one Intelligent Being; and that this Intelligent Being had the full and perfect fruition of God. Upon this supposition I enquire, whether this Intelligent Being would be perfectly Happy or no? Without all question he would, as enjoying an <hi>All-sufficient Good.</hi> Well, if so, then he must be perfectly happy in his <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> And yet 'tis most certain, that he could then have the knowledge of very little more than <hi>Necessary Truth</hi>; for all that he could possibly know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, would be only that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did exist, and that he knew
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95935:19"/>
these Necessary Truths, and that he was happy in the knowledge of them, and the like. And lest the knowledge of such Contingencies should be thought any Accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his Happiness, we will carry our Hypothesis a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by supposing that this Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Being were not to <hi>attend</hi> to any of his own Perfections, or to any of those few Contingent Truths resulting from them, but were only to Contemplate God and the Divine Ideas; and then I demand whether his understanding would be sufficiently perfected or no? 'Tis necessary to answer in the Affirmative, whence 'tis also as necessary to conclude, that the only Objective Perfection of our understanding is <hi>Necessary Truth.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95935:20"/>
of whatever is besides himself, or that whatever is, is either God or the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of God, is a clear and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd principle.

                  <div n="31" type="part">

                     <p>That it is not the Effect of God, is evident from the many Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that would follow upon that Supposition. For first, God would be then a <hi>Necessary Agent</hi>; for if Necessary Truth be an <hi>Effect,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Necessary</hi> Effect, and a Necessary Effect must have a Necessary Cause. Again, God would not only be a <hi>Necessary</hi> Agent, but also (which is worse) an <hi>Vnintelligent</hi> Agent. The consequence is unavoidable, for if Truth be the Effect of God, then antecedently to the effecting of it, there was no Truth, and consequently no <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Again, if Necessary Truth be the Effect
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95935:21"/>
of God, then the Perfection of the Divine Understanding must be supposed to depend upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not God; nay, upon something Created <hi>by</hi> God. 'Twill follow again, that God has made something which he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy. And lastly, to add no more, if Necessary Truth be the Effect of God, then there will be something <hi>Necessary,</hi> Immutable, and Eternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides God. The <hi>Consequences</hi> are all <hi>plain,</hi> and so are the <hi>Absurdities.</hi> The last of which appeared so great to the Excellent <hi>Monsieur Poiret,</hi> a stiff Opposer of your beloved <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche,</hi> and of the <hi>Ideal Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>

                        <hi>being</hi> of Necessary Truth, which however is sufficiently conclusive to the purpose we now aim at, that Necessary Truth is not the <hi>Effect</hi> of God. For if it were, then his Absurdity would come in, and there would be something Necessary besides God. Since then Necessary Truth is not the Effect of God, it remains by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>premised Disjunction,</hi> that it must be no other than the very Substance and Essence of the Deity.</p>

                     <p>I further consider, that the Essence of God is intimately and immediately united to the mind of Man; this is plain from <hi>Scripture,</hi> which tells us that in God is our <hi>Life,</hi> our <hi>Motion,</hi> and our <hi>Being.</hi> And from <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which assures us, that what pervades all things, must needs be immediately united with every thing.<note place="margin">

                     <p>Now upon these two Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that Necessary Truth is the same with God himself, and that the Essence of God is immediately united to the Mind of Man, 'tis easie to Conceive <hi>how</hi> and <hi>why</hi> Necessary Truth should be the Objective Perfection of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; since to make an Object Perfective of the <hi>Faculty,</hi> nothing else is requisite, than that it be its <hi>proper Good,</hi> and that it be <hi>intimately Present</hi> to it. And this will also sufficiently give us to understand that <hi>Contingent Truth</hi> cannot be the <hi>Objective</hi> Perfection of the Mind; first, because <hi>that</hi> is a Created Being, whereas God alone is our proper Good. And secondly, because 'tis <hi>without</hi> us, and cannot be immediately united to our minds, without which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were it never so <hi>Perfective</hi> otherwise, it could contribute

                     <p>And thus have I given a full Resolution to that Curious and Important Question which the Proof of my Supposition ingaged me upon, and which is to be the Measure of what follows in this Reflection. It is plain from hence, that there are some things the Knowledge whereof is little or nothing perfective of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. For as I have shewn, 'tis not <hi>Contingent</hi> but <hi>Necessary</hi> Truth, wherein the Perfection of the Understanding does consist. Whence it follows that True Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be placed in the Knowledge of <hi>Necessary Truth,</hi> in the Comprehension of those Arts and Sciences whose Foundations are not Arbitrary, but Stable and Immutable, and in understanding the Eternal and Unchangeable Laws and Measures of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Consequence.</hi> He therefore is the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95935:23"/>
truly Learned and Knowing Man, who has furnish'd his Mind with bright and clear Ideas, lodg'd them orderly and regularly in his Head, and settled the Relations and Consequences of one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that is able to think clearly and distinctly (for so much a Man knows, as he distinctly understands, and no more) to judge truly and solidly, and to reason dependently and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially. In short, he that sees most of the <hi>Divine Ideas,</hi> is most familiarly conversant in the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible World, and has the largest and the clearest view of the <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> This I hold to be Learning, and Intellectual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and besides what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have alledged in behalf of this Hypothesis; it is further Confirmed by the Authority of <hi>Plato,</hi> when he makes the <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> of Man (for 'tis all one) to consist in the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi> of <hi>Ideas.</hi>

                     <p>But notwithstanding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Certainty of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, this is not that Measure which the generality of the World has thought fit to proceed by.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95935:24"/>
must not be <hi>Learning,</hi> but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else must, that lies more within <hi>Common reach,</hi> tho of no real Moment to the Perfection of the understanding.

                     <p>For first, 'tis reckon'd a notable point of Learning to understand variety of <hi>Languages.</hi> This alone gives a Man a Title to Learning without one Grain of Sense; and on the other side, let a Man be an <hi>Angel</hi> for <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> yet unless he can express the same thoughts in variety of words, he may go for a <hi>Rational,</hi> but will by no means be esteem'd a <hi>Learned Man.</hi> And this brings to my mind a Passage which I met with not long since in <hi>London,</hi> where being in Company with an Ingenious <hi>French</hi> Man, I ask't him of what repute <hi>M. Malebranche</hi> was with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95935:24"/>
the <hi>Learned</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> He told me, that he was look'd upon as a great Master of Notion and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but as a Man of no great Learning. I ask'd him, why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, said he, he understands but few Languages. How much that excellent Authors Talent may lie that way I am not concern'd. But whatever it be, the most <hi>Learned</hi> of them all must give me leave to say, that I would rather be Master of a Quarter of his Sense, than of all the Languages that may be form'd out of the <hi>Alphabet.</hi> But is it not a strange thing that so much <hi>Stress</hi> should be laid upon such a <hi>Triflle</hi>?
For what am I the better for being able to tell what 'tis a Clock in several Languages?
What does this signifie to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of my understanding? Words are purely in order to <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> and therefore are of no further value than as they serve as helps either to <hi>Learn,</hi> or to <hi>Communicate</hi> the other. To
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95935:25"/>
affect them therefore for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> is to turn the <hi>Means</hi> into the <hi>End,</hi> than which nothing is more absurd. And yet this vain peice of <hi>Pedantry</hi> has prevail'd all the World over, and with some to that degree, that they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded <hi>Ideas</hi> with <hi>Words,</hi> and have made all <hi>Science</hi> to terminate in the latter. Thus the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of the <hi>Nominal way,</hi> and particularly Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> who makes Reason to be nothing else but <hi>Sequela Nominum, a well order'd Train of Words.</hi> Never certainly was there a grosser peice of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, nor a plainer Argument of the great degeneracy of Mankind. And tho all the Multipliers of Tongues are not Comprehended under this latter charge, yet it may concern them to consider, how great a Folly it must needs be, to place Learning in that, which is one of the greatest <hi>Curses</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and which shall utterly <hi>Cease</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>

For a thing may <hi>deserve</hi> to be known, not as <hi>perfecting</hi> the <hi>understanding,</hi> but meerly as <hi>touching</hi> upon our <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</hi> I grant therefore that it may be of <hi>Consequence</hi> to know some Historical passages, if we are any way <hi>concerned</hi> in them, and so it may to know the Clock has struck One, if I have appointed an <hi>Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> at that time; but sure the <hi>bare naked Theory</hi> of the Clock's having struck one, can add but little to the stock of my Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Perfection.

                     <p>This is sufficiently plain from the Measure we have premised, by which no Truth is perfective of the understanding but only <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth.</hi> But to address my self more Convincingly to the great Magnifiers of <hi>History,</hi> I shall only desire their answer to this one Question. Suppose such and such Matters of Fact, on the knowledge of which they Found their title to Learning, and perhaps, glory more in the <hi>knowing</hi> them, than the <hi>Actors</hi> themselves did in the <hi>doing</hi> them. Suppose, I say, such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact had never been <hi>done</hi>; suppose <hi>Fabius</hi> had never Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd out <hi>Hannibal</hi> by <hi>Delays</hi>; nor <hi>Cyrus</hi> took <hi>Babylon</hi> by drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the River into the Ditches, what loss or diminution would this have been to the Perfection of their Understandings? They cannot say it would have been any. And why then should the knowing them now they <hi>are</hi> done, be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95935:27"/>
as an Intellectual Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And yet we find that 'tis so, and that Men study these things not only for their <hi>use</hi> (for that I allow) but for their meer <hi>Theory,</hi> placing Learning in <hi>such</hi> History, which has nothing to commend it but only that it tells you such and such things were done. Of this impertinent sort is the greatest part of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> History, which (had not the World <hi>Voted</hi> it for <hi>Learning</hi>) would no more concern a Man to know, than that a Bird has dropt a feather upon the <hi>Pyrenoean</hi> Mountains.</p>

                     <p>Again, it goes for a Notable piece of Learning to understand <hi>Chronology,</hi> to be able to adjust the intervals and distances of Time, to know when such an Action was done, when such a Famous Man flourish'd, and who and who were contemporary, and the like. Now I deny not, but that while Men
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95935:27"/>
live in this World, they may be <hi>concern'd</hi> to have some acquaintance with these things, by reason of some interest or other that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. It may therefore, I say, for some purposes, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to know that. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, there is a twofold Aera (or date) of the Victory at <hi>Actium,</hi> the one reckon'd from the Fight at the Promontory of <hi>Actium,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account of <hi>Dio</hi> and <hi>Xiphilinus</hi>; the other from the taking of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> according to <hi>Ptolemy, Iosephus, Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Censorinus.</hi> But however, <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> this may be, with respect to its <hi>usefulness,</hi> yet certainly as to any <hi>Intellectual Perfection</hi> that accrues by it, it must needs be a very <hi>unedifying Stuffage</hi> of Mind; and yet 'tis counted a great Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment and <hi>Enrichment</hi> of it.</p>

                     <p>Another thing there is which passes for wonderful Learning,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95935:28"/>
which I cannot well reduce either to <hi>Necessary</hi> or <hi>Contingent</hi> Truth, for indeed it does not belong to <hi>Truth</hi> at all, and that is our <hi>Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> way of Disputation. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it may well be call'd so, for as 'tis generally manag'd, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but meer Quibbling and Jesting, not <hi>Arguing</hi> but <hi>Punning.</hi> For suppose the Question be, Whether he that has Faith shall be saved? No says the Opponent, If the Damn'd have Faith, then not every one that has Faith shall be saved; But the Damn'd have Faith. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Here 'tis plain that the Word <hi>Faith,</hi> tho it has <hi>Something</hi> in Common in both Propositions, yet according to the <hi>intire Idea</hi> signifies one thing in one Proposition, and another in another. And why then is not the whole Proceedure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as Idle and Impertinent? As for <hi>downright</hi> Fallacy and Equivocation where there is a <hi>Manifest</hi> Ambiguity (as between
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95935:28"/>
                        <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Dog,</hi> one signifying a Celestial Sign, and the other a Terrestial Animal) this is every where despised and laught at as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming both the <hi>Acumen</hi> and the <hi>Gravity</hi> of a Disputant. And we think we have sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged our hands of such an Argument, by Crying out that these are <hi>Four Terms</hi> in the <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism.</hi> But now I would fain know whether it be not the same to all real purposes in the foremention'd Instance, which is after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of our <hi>Scholastic</hi> Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Is not <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Faith there,</hi> as much an Ambiguity as <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Dog</hi> here? For my part I can perceive but this only Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Dog</hi> have nothing in Common but the <hi>Name,</hi> whereas <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> have some <hi>Generical</hi> Part wherein they agree. But what does this Mend the Matter? For tho there be some <hi>Generical</hi> Agreement, yet take 'em according to their <hi>whole
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95935:29"/>
Ideas,</hi> that is, take the <hi>Generical</hi> part with its <hi>Contracting Difference,</hi> and 'tis plain that they signifie two different things, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there is really as great an Ambiguity <hi>here</hi> as <hi>there.</hi> And this we plainly Confess when we come to <hi>Distinguish.</hi> For what is a <hi>Distinction</hi> but a <hi>Pointing</hi> out of an <hi>Ambiguity</hi>? What is it else but to say, that such a thing is True in <hi>this</hi> Sense, but not in <hi>that,</hi> True in that Sense wherein the <hi>Point</hi> of the Question is <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,</hi> but not in that wherein it <hi>is.</hi> No? why then, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Generical Agreement the Procedure is as fallacious and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent as when the <hi>Question</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about <hi>Star-Dog,</hi> the <hi>Opposition</hi> is about <hi>Land-Dog.</hi> And yet (such is the inconsistency of Human Judgment) the one is counted <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling,</hi> and the other <hi>Serious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</hi> Whereas indeed no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be so, but where the Terms of the Question are first <hi>Defined</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95935:29"/>
(as is done in <hi>Geometry</hi>) and then always used according to the first <hi>Stated</hi> Sense. All Disputing any otherwise than so, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be nothing else but meer <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> only much worse than what is in common use, because 'tis <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> when a Man Pretends to be <hi>Serious.</hi> And yet this is made a considerable Part of our Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi> And to this I add this further Remark, that 'tis reckon'd a notable Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to be able to <hi>Spin</hi> out an Argument to a great length, and he is counted the best Arguer that can thus <hi>Pun</hi> longest.

                     <p>There are many other things which the unaccountable humour of the World has <hi>turn'd up</hi> for Learning, which <hi>Ignorance</hi> will never be the better for, and which <hi>Wisdom</hi> does not <hi>need.</hi> Thus 'tis
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95935:30"/>
counted Learning to have tumbled over a multitude of Books, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if <hi>great</hi> ones, and <hi>old</hi> ones, and <hi>obscure</hi> ones, but most of all, if <hi>Manuscripts</hi>; the recovery of one of which is reckon'd so much added to the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> as they call it. A <hi>Well-read</hi> Man signifies the very same as a <hi>Learned</hi> Man in most Mens <hi>Dictionaries,</hi> and by Well-read they dont mean one that has read <hi>well,</hi> that has clear'd and improv'd his understanding by his reading, but only one that has read a <hi>great deal,</hi> tho perhaps he has puzzled and confounded his Notions by doing so. Thus again it goes for Learning, to be acquainted with Mens <hi>Opinions,</hi> especially of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> to know what this or that Philosopher held, what this or that Author says, tho perhaps he says nothing but what is either <hi>Absurd,</hi> or <hi>Obviously True.</hi> Thus for instance, what can be more Absurd than that <hi>Fancy</hi> of <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docles,</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:95935:30"/>
that there are two <hi>Semi-circles</hi> compassing betwixt them the Earth, one whereof was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of Fire, the other of Air, and that the former made the Day, and the latter Night? And yet to know this is <hi>Learning.</hi> And what again is more obviously true, than that <hi>Grave</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>Privation</hi> must go before the introduction of the <hi>Form</hi> in all Generation? And yet 'tis Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know that he taught thus, tho it be a thing so plain, and so <hi>near</hi> the <hi>Surface,</hi> that a Child can't miss of it. To know the thing is nothing, because so plain and easie, but to know that <hi>Aristotle</hi> held it, that's the Learning. Nay, to instance in a matter of greater difficulty, tho I know very well, and am able to demonstrate the grounds of the <hi>Atomical Philosophy,</hi> or the Motion of the Earth, or the Circulation of the Blood, yet I shall not be admitted into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Learned, unless I am
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95935:31"/>
able to tell that <hi>Moscus</hi> the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> invented the first, and that <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Leucippus</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards improved it, and that the two latter owe their discovery to <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Harvey.</hi> So much more Learned an atchievement is it to know <hi>Opinions</hi> than things; and accordingly, those are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd the most Learned Authors, who have given the greatest Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens of this kind of Knowledge. Thus is <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for the Examination he has made of the Doctrine of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> than any of <hi>them</hi> were for what they deliver'd; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> has got more Credit from the History he gives of their Opinions, in the 2d Tome of his Works, than from any of his Rational and Moral Discourses. And were he not accounted <hi>Learned</hi> for the <hi>Former,</hi> I question whether the <hi>Latter</hi> (tho far more excellent than they are) would ever have given him that Title.</p>

Prayer of Pythagoras, <hi>O Father</hi> Jupiter, <hi>either free all from their Manifold evils, Or else Discover to all what Daemon they use,</hi> Moves this Question, <hi>since they that know God and themselves are free from Mortal Passions; why then are not all freed, since all are sufficiently assisted with the Opportunities of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>? To which he first gives this general Answer,<note place="margin">P. 144.</note> 
                        <hi>Because the greatest part of Men embrace evil of their own accord, since they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see nor hear Neighbouring good.</hi> Then a little after he is more particular in his Account. <hi>Since therefore</hi> (says he) <hi>that any thing may be shewn</hi> to any one,<note place="margin">P. 146.</note> 
                        <hi>'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the actions of two Persons concur (for how can you shew what you have a mind should be shewn, to a Blind Man, although you offer it to him a thousand times, or how can you shew to one that sees, if you offer nothing to his Sight) both these must be present, some good proposed by him that shews, and an Eye ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

of seeing in him to whom it is to be shewn; so that from a visible object, and a Faculty of seeing, may result a Manifestation. This being so, let us suppose that all would be freed from evil, if their Maker did shew to all the knowledge of his own Nature, and what Daemon they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves use.

the Third is by <hi>Prayer.</hi> Upon each of which I shall bestow some few Remarks, such as may rather give <hi>hints</hi> than <hi>full entertainment</hi> to your thoughts, because I Know your Ladyship loves to have something left to <hi>work out</hi> by your self in your own private Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                     <p>The first Method assign'd is <hi>Attention,</hi> or Application of Mind to the Intelligible World, the World of Truth. This is the same with <hi>Thinking</hi> or <hi>Speculating,</hi> which if intelligibly accounted for, will be found to be nothing else but the Conversion of the Mind to the Ideal World, or Omniformity of the Divine Essence; which as it is the <hi>First,</hi> so is it also the <hi>Directest</hi> and most Compendicus Method of Science.

to the <hi>Spring-head,</hi> to the <hi>Lucid Fountain</hi> of Good, 'tis to take hold of Essential Truth <hi>naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as it is in it self (as a very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Person expresses it) 'tis to fix the Eye of the Mind upon the <hi>Intellectual Sun,</hi>

                        </note> upon him who is Substantial Truth, and the Light of the World. Which must needs be the most ready way to be inlightned. For the more heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully we attend to the Ideal World, the more we shall see and discover of it; and not only so, but also more clearly <hi>distinguish</hi> what we do discover. For so a man that casts a short careless glance upon the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> sees only a <hi>Confused whiteness</hi> arising from the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mixture of little Splendors, but when the same Person fixes his Eye with steadiness and delay of Application, he begins to discern something more distinctly, a new Star ever and anon arises under his inspection, not discover'd before, and still the longer and harder he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95935:40"/>
looks, the more he discerns, till at length he has discover'd as much as he can well atttend to at once, and has satiated his Faculty with the <hi>Brightness</hi> and <hi>Multitude</hi> of Light. The Application is as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, as the Figure is Pertinent, and therefore I shall only remark this one thing more upon this part, that this was the <hi>Method</hi> of the first Inventors of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> who made their way into the Coasts of Learning by meer <hi>dint</hi> of <hi>Thinking</hi>; and further, that this is the very Method that has been used by the greatest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of them ever since, such as <hi>Bacon, Boyle, Descartes, Galileus, Harvey, Mersennus, Digby, Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche, Poiret,</hi> and (whom I name with particular Honour and Reverence) our Excellent Friend Dr. <hi>More.</hi> All these must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, and I think are to be great Improvers of Learning, and that 'twas by this Method they did it.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95935:41"/>

                     <p>But when the Relations of things to one another cannot be Known by immediately Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, then the Second Law is, <hi>that we should employ our thoughts to find out one or more Middle Ideas, which we may use as a Common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95935:41"/>
to Know by their help the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are between those things.</hi> And withal he advises that we should study to have those Ideas clear and distinct, proportionably to the Accuracy and Numerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Relations which we endeavour to deprehend.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95935:43"/>
of the Question: And the others are to be made Familiar, to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and to be orderly disposed in the Imagination, or express'd in Paper, and to be compared with each other, according to the Laws of Combination.

every step of this Intellectual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, we ought to have our eye perpetually fix'd upon the State of the Question.

the <hi>Method of Thinking.</hi> And I believe if an Angel had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the undertaking, he could not have given <hi>Better.</hi> They are all Natural, Clear, Distinct, Easie, and depending; <hi>Few</hi> enough not to <hi>burthen</hi> or <hi>Distract</hi> the Mind, and yet <hi>Many</hi> enough to <hi>inform it.</hi> And therefore I shall not be guilty of so much <hi>Presumption</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence</hi> as to prescribe any other, thinking it sufficient to consider and Practice these. And so much for the first way of Consulting the Ideal World, which is by Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <p>The second way is by Purity of Heart and Life. This I confess has a more immediate and special influence upon the Knowledge of <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Truths, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of our Saviour, <hi>If any Man will do his will,</hi>

                     <p>But to represent his more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, there are two ways whereby Purity of Heart serves to the acquirement of Knowledge. <hi>By Natural Efficacy,</hi> and by the <hi>Divine grace</hi> and <hi>Benediction.</hi> And first it does it by Natural Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either by <hi>Clarifying</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> or by <hi>assisting</hi> the <hi>faculty.</hi> The former I conceive and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent after this Manner. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95935:45"/>
in the first place that the Soul sees through a <hi>Medium</hi>; Secondly, that this Medium is our <hi>Terrestrical Vehicle</hi>; Thirdly, that the <hi>Grosness</hi> of this Medium <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> the <hi>Vision</hi> of the Soul. All which I ground upon those words of the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> 
                        <hi>Now we see through a Glass, darkly.</hi>

                     <p>This Supposed, it follows that whatsoever Clarifys this Medium does also help the Vision of the Soul. And this <hi>Purity</hi> does, especially that more Eminent part of it which consists in <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi> For first it Composes the <hi>Passions,</hi> especially that of <hi>Lust,</hi> by that the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits,</hi> and by that the <hi>Blood.</hi> For the Motion of the Passions Ferments the Spirits, and the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Spirits agitates the Blood, and by agitation raises all the feculent and drossy parts of it; and makes it like a troubled Fountain, thick and muddy. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95935:46"/>
this I take to be one true reason why Men in any Passion can't reason so clearly as when they are in more quiet and <hi>silence</hi> of Spirit. But now by Purity of Heart all this disturbance is allay'd and composed, the Passions are becalm'd, the Spirits fix'd, the Fountain of the Blood clears up, and so all the <hi>inner</hi> part of that <hi>Glass</hi> the Apostle speaks of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more bright and pellucid, more apt to transmit the <hi>Rays</hi> of the <hi>Ideal Light,</hi> and consequently we see more clearly through it.

                     <p>But this is not all; This Purity does also Clarifie the <hi>outward</hi> part of the <hi>Glass</hi> too. First <hi>by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> because the finer the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Blood are, the finer will be the Threds of the outward Veil also. Then more <hi>directly,</hi> because Temperance does refine
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95935:46"/>
and Subtilize the Texture of the Body, diminishes from its Bulk and Grossness, and unloads the Soul of a good part of that Burthen which not only presses down her <hi>Aspirations,</hi> but also hinders her <hi>Sight</hi>: And besides, it refines the the inner part too, by bringing in fresh supplies of fine Spirits.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.15</note> This was that Temperance which made the Faces of <hi>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> look <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Fair,</hi> and which made them <hi>Wise</hi> too, gave a quick and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate air to their Countenances, and let in the Light of the Ideal World upon their Souls.

the Faculty. And this it does by the same general way whereby it clarifies the Medium, that is, by composing the Passions. For the Passions not only trouble and thicken the Medium (as was noted and explain'd before) but al<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95935:52"/>
of arriving to the Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ideal Truth, your <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> cannot but know, and 'tis a sad as well as a true observation, that this is not only neglected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that part of Mankind that sit down contentedly in Ignorance, and aspire to no greater stock of Knowledge than what they brought with them into the world, but also among the generality of those few that addict themselves to the Cultivation and Improvement of their minds. Nay these in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Number seem more guilty of this neglect than the other, and nothing so common as to see men of Curious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive tempers and of <hi>famed</hi> Learning, who yet are very Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in the Moral state of their minds, and live very ill lives. Whence some have taken occasion to represent <hi>Learning,</hi> as an Enemy to <hi>Religion,</hi> and have cry'd up <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> as the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Devotion.</hi> And tho the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of these men
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95935:52"/>
be notoriously weak and absurd, yet it must be confest that the <hi>Ground</hi> upon which they build it, is too true. Men <hi>famed</hi> for <hi>Learning,</hi> are oftentimes as <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> for <hi>Living,</hi> and many that study hard to furnish their <hi>Heads,</hi> are yet very negligent in purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Hearts,</hi> not considering that there is a <hi>Moral,</hi> as well as a <hi>Natural</hi> Communication between one and the other, and that they are concern'd to be pure in Heart and Life not only upon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Account,</hi> in order to a happy state hereafter, but also in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their own particular way and end here.</p>

                     <p>Then again Lastly, whereas another Method of Wisdom is <hi>Prayer,</hi> I do not find that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Students do at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to this Method. Pray indeed ('tis to be hoped) they do for other things, which they think lye more out of their

                     <p>First I consider, that the utmost Pitch of Knowledge man by his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavours can arrive to in this world is very inconsiderable. God indeed has given us Reason enough to distinguish us from the <hi>Brute</hi> part of the Creation, and we may improve it so far as to distinguish our selves from <hi>One ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and so one man may deserve to be call'd Learned and Knowing in comparison of another that is either <hi>Naturally</hi> more ignorant, or more <hi>unimproved</hi>; but absolutely speaking, the most that any or all of us either know or can know here is of little or no Consideration. What we know of God is but <hi>little,</hi> for as the Apostle says, <hi>we see through a Glass, darkly</hi>; what we know of our selves perhaps is <hi>Less,</hi> and what we know of the world about us is <hi>not much. We have seen but a few of Gods works,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 43.</note> as the wise man observes, and we <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> yet <hi>fewer.</hi> There are almost
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95935:55"/>
an infinite number of things which we never so much as <hi>thought</hi> of, and of <hi>most</hi> things we conceive very <hi>darkly</hi> and <hi>uncertainly,</hi> and there is not <hi>one</hi> thing from the greatest to the <hi>least,</hi> which we do or can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>thoroughly.</hi> Those that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their whole study to any one thing, can never come to the End of that one thing, for not only every <hi>Science</hi> but every <hi>particular</hi> of it has its unmeasurable depths and recesses; and 'tis confess'd by a great inquirer into the Nature of <hi>Antimony</hi> (as 'tis related by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>) that <hi>'tis impossible for one man to understand throughly that one single Mineral only.</hi>

                     <p>'Twere an endless undertaking to represent at large the little that we know, or are capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor do I design to turn a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and entertain your Ladyship with a long Harangue about the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Humane Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> only give me leave to touch upon two notorious instances of our Ignorance, and in that very Science which is pretended to be at the very <hi>Vertical</hi> Point of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. 'Tis Concerning the the <hi>Maximum</hi> and the <hi>Minimum Naturale,</hi> the <hi>Greatest</hi> and the <hi>Least</hi> thing in Nature. As to the first, the Question is whether the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95935:56"/>
of the Universe be Finite or Infinite? If you say 'tis Positively Infinite, besides the difficulty of conceiving how any thing can be so extended, 'twill follow that God himself cannot add the least further Dimension to it. If you say 'tis Finite, suppose your self in the utmost extremities of it, and try whether it be possible for you to dis-imagin further Extension. Then as to the Second, the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is whether every, even the Least assignable Part of matter be infinitely Divisible or no? If you say yes, then 'twill unavoidably follow that the least Atom will have as many Parts as the whole World. If you say no, then you must say that Matter may be Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so long till at last you come to a Part that does not contain more other Parts, if so, then I enquire has this <hi>uncontaining</hi> Part Figure, or has it not? If not, then 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Figure being only the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Quantity. But if it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95935:57"/>
has, then it has more other Parts <hi>above, below</hi> and of <hi>each side,</hi> and consequently may again be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, contrary to what you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. So that you see here are <hi>Desperate</hi> Difficulties on both sides, say what you will you are equally baffled, and yet 'tis most certain that one only can be true, they being two opposite parts of a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but which is so, is beyond the Capacity of Humane understanding to determine.</p>

                     <p>The like Difficulties we meet with when we inquire concerning <hi>Time,</hi> whether it be <hi>Infinitely</hi> divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or only into <hi>Moments</hi>?

Neither of which can be defined without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Absurdity.

cast up, <hi>that</hi> will be found to be our <hi>best Knowledge.</hi> This only in General, our Life is so short, our Progress in Learning so slow, and Learning in it self so long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and what we do or can know so very little, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi> of <hi>Scepticism</hi> had much more reason to conclude from the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability</hi> of our <hi>Facculties</hi> and the <hi>slightness</hi> of our <hi>Attainments,</hi> than from the <hi>uncertainty</hi> and Instability of <hi>Truth,</hi> that there is <hi>no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I consider, that as we can here know but Little, so even that very little which we do, serves more to our Trouble and Disquiet, than to our Pleasure and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And here comes in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Reflection of the Wise Man,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>In much Wisdom is much Grief, and he that increases Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, increases Sorrow.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is not true, <hi>Absolutely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, Knowledge being the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95935:58"/>
of Human Nature, the <hi>Image of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Colos. 3.10.</note> and the Principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of our Future Happiness; but only with <hi>relation</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State and Posture of Man. And in this respect it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly true. First, because the more we know, the more we shall discover of our Ignorance, (that being the chiefest thing we learn by our study) which we shall find to be of an infinitely larger Sphere than our Knowledge, and consequently shall be more <hi>troubled</hi> for what we do <hi>not</hi> know, than <hi>pleas'd</hi> with what we <hi>do.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because the Prospect of what yet further remains to be known will inflame our Thirst after it. For Wisdom says of her self, <hi>They that Eat of me shall yet be Hungry, and they that Drink of me shall yet be Thirsty.</hi> Which tho it be a great Commendation of Wisdom, and an Argument of her Inexhaustible excellence, yet 'tis withal a great instrument of Punishment to those
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95935:58"/>
who can attain to so little of it, as cannot <hi>satisfie</hi> that <hi>thirst</hi> which it has <hi>inflamed.</hi> Thirdly, because the more a Man improves his thinking faculty, the more apt he will be to be disgusted and offended with the follies of Society; as the most delicate <hi>Touch</hi> is the soonest put to pain. There being a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand impertinencies that will strike very disagreeably upon a <hi>discerning</hi> mind which won't so much as affect a grosser understanding.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="8" type="part">
                     <head>VIII.</head>
                     <p>But the Principal Ground of this Assertion, and which, did not the quickness of your <hi>Ladyship</hi>'s Apprenhension oblige me to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, I could be <hi>Voluminous</hi> upon, is this. 'Tis most certain that Man is now placed in the Midst of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and unsatisfying Objects, and and that his True good is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his reach, and consequently whatever Pleasure he takes in those things that <hi>are,</hi> is purely owing to his <hi>Ignorance</hi> of their <hi>Vanity.</hi> Well,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95935:59"/>
if so, then Vae Sapienti, <hi>woe be to the Wise Man.</hi> This is not a Place to be <hi>Wise</hi> in. There is nothing here Solid enough to endure the <hi>Test</hi> of Wisdom. The <hi>Wise</hi> Man cannot find a <hi>Paradice</hi> here, tho the <hi>Fool</hi> can. The more he knows the more he discovers the Vanity of all pretended Enjoyments, and the more he does this, the more he streightens and retrenches his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and the more he does this, the more he retires and withdraws himself from all Worldly Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this sets him the more a Thinking and Musing, and this again presents to his mind a fresh and more lively Conviction of the Worlds Vanity, and this makes him again retrench his Delights, and so on in this returning Circle, till at length he finds nothing but his <hi>bare Wisdom</hi> to delight in. And a little more Thinking makes him see the Vanity of <hi>that too.</hi> And now all's gone. To dispatch this part in one word, this is the Fruit of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95935:59"/>
being Wise, to be able to taste no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that's <hi>Present,</hi> nor to flatter ones self with the <hi>Prospect</hi> of what is to <hi>come,</hi> which is a state of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Privation and Sterility. This is the <hi>thorough Wise</hi> Mans Lot, and every advance in Wisdom is a step towards this Condition So true is it, that <hi>he who increases Wisdom, increases Sorrow,</hi> while in the mean time the Fool Laughs, and is Merry.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I Consider, that if our Knowledge could yield us more Satisfaction than it occasions Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet our Life is so short, and so incumber'd, that we can <hi>make</hi> but <hi>little</hi> of the enjoyment, so little, that 'tis not answerable to the meer Labour we undergo in acquiring it. All the <hi>Morning</hi> of our days is spent in the <hi>Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> in Learning Words and Terms of Art, wherein there is nothing but toil and drudgery, and before we can taste any of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95935:60"/>
                        <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> before we can relish what is <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> in it, our Sun is got into the <hi>Meridian,</hi> and then it presently begins to <hi>decline</hi> and our Learning with it; our Light, our Strength, and our Time make haste to consume, nothing increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses now but the <hi>Shadows,</hi> that is our Ignorance and Darkness of mind, and while we consider and look about us, the Sun Sets, and all is concluded in the Darkness and Shadow of Death. But often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Sun is intercepted by a <hi>Cloud</hi> long before it Setts, and we live backward again, grow weak and Childish, Silly and forgetful, and unlearn faster than we learnt; or if it chance to shine bright to the last, then we improve <hi>too much,</hi> and grow too wise for our <hi>selves,</hi> and reject the greatest part of what we learnt before, as idle and insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. So that we are under a Necessity of unlearning in a short time most of what we have so <hi>dearly</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:95935:60"/>
learnt, either through <hi>forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or <hi>improvement</hi> of <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I Consider, that there is no <hi>Necessity</hi> of our being so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Learned and Knowing here. 'Tis neither Necessary as <hi>injoin'd</hi> by God, nor as a <hi>Means</hi> to any considerable End. We can be <hi>Good,</hi> and we can be <hi>Happy</hi> without it. And as to the Interest of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Public Societies, 'tis <hi>Civil Prudence</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> and not <hi>Learning</hi> which makes <hi>them</hi> Happy. And lest any advantage in our <hi>after State</hi> should be alledged for its Necessity, this makes it more unnecessary than any Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on besides. For tho we are never so unlearned now, provided we know enough to do our Duty, and live well, we shall in a short time arrive to such a degree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as is requisite to our Supream Perfection, to which our Present Learning <hi>cannot add,</hi> and from which our Present Ignorance <hi>will not Diminish.</hi> I do not say this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95935:61"/>
will be immediately upon our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the Body, there being some reasonable Controversie about that, (which would be too great a <hi>Digression</hi> at present to pursue) tho 'tis most certain that even <hi>then</hi> there must needs be great <hi>inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Understanding; However 'tis most unquestionable that this our <hi>Intellectual Accomplishment</hi> can be no further off than our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the <hi>Beatific Vision.</hi> We shall then commence instantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Wise and Learned, and be fully possess'd of the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> For then that <hi>Glass</hi> through which we now see <hi>Darkly</hi> shall be laid aside, and there shall be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the <hi>Speculum Deitatis,</hi> the Glass of the Divinty, which is no other than the <hi>Ideal</hi> World, which shall be now more intimately united to us, and more clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd before us. And tho even now there shall be Degrees of Knowledge according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95935:61"/>
Participiation of the Ideal Light, yet the variety of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation shall not proceed by the degree of our Knowledge in this Life, but by some other Measure. For,</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I Consider, that tho there is no necessity of our being so very <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Knowing,</hi> yet there is an Absolute Necessity of our being <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Vertuous.</hi> This is Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary both ways, as Commanded by God, and as a Means to our Final Perfection.

The <hi>Main</hi> opportunity for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is <hi>after</hi> this Life, but the <hi>only</hi> opportunity for being good is <hi>Now.</hi> And if we take care to improve this, we are sufficiently secure of the other, and of whatever else ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95935:62"/>
to the Perfection of our Natures. But if this be neglected all is lost. This therefore is indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably necessary, and 'tis the only thing that is so, and 'tis necessary <hi>Now,</hi> necessary not only to our <hi>Happiness</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> but also to that of our <hi>Intellectual</hi> Part in <hi>Particular.</hi> For,</p>

                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And lastly I Consider, that thus stands the Case between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> First, Man is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be made in a State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Perfection, in perfect Favour and Communion with God, his true Good, and in a Capacity so to Continue. From this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent state he is supposed to <hi>Fall,</hi> and by his Fall so to <hi>disable himself</hi> that he cannot by his own strength <hi>Repent</hi> and Live well, and so to <hi>provoke God,</hi> that tho he <hi>could</hi> and <hi>did Repent,</hi> yet he would not be Pardon'd and Accepted, without Satisfaction made to Divine Justice. This satisfaction Man is supposed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95935:62"/>
not able to make, nor any other Creature for him. Whereupon God in great Mercy and Pitty is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to ordain a <hi>Mediator,</hi> his own Son, God and Man, between <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Laps'd Creature,</hi> who by the Sacrifice of himself should Effect two things, answerable to the double Necessity of Man, first make Repentance available, which otherwise would not have been so; and secondly Merit Grace for him that he might be able to <hi>Repent.</hi> And this is what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the <hi>Restoration</hi> or <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Man, which thus far is <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> and <hi>Inconditionate.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <head>XIII.</head>
                     <p>But still notwithstanding all that this <hi>Mediator</hi> has done for him, Man is supposed only so far <hi>restored,</hi> as to be put in a Pardonable and Reconcilable State (for as for our being <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by the Death of Christ, that's a silly, fond, <hi>Antinomian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and no way consistent with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95935:63"/>
the <hi>Great Mystery</hi> of <hi>Godliness</hi>) I say Man is yet only in a <hi>Capacity</hi> or Possibility of Pardon and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which is then, and then only reduced to <hi>act,</hi> when he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performs the <hi>Conditions</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, when he Believes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and leads a good Life, <hi>with</hi> which he <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> which he <hi>shall not</hi> be Pardon'd and Saved, notwithstanding that Christ has Dy'd for him. The design of whose Death was not to make a good Life <hi>unnecessary,</hi> but only to render it <hi>Efficacious</hi> and Available, not to procure a Priviledge of being saved <hi>without</hi> it (as some fancy) but that we might be Saved <hi>with it.</hi> If this Qualification be wanting, we shall be so far from being any thing <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged</hi> from the Redemption pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd by our Mediator, that we shall be <hi>Accountable</hi> for it, to the great aggravation both of our Guilt and Misery. It therefore highly concerns Man to improve with all diligence this short and only oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95935:63"/>
of <hi>Making</hi> his <hi>Great Fortune,</hi> to adorn his mind with all Moral and Religious Perfections, and his Life with all good actions, since with this he <hi>may</hi> be Happy in all his capacities, and without it he shall not only fall into a state of unutterable Misery, but be also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the <hi>Possibility</hi> he had of <hi>escaping</hi> it, for neglecting so great Salvation, so great an <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> of being saved.</p>

                     <p>These things being Premised concerning the present <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or state of Man, First, that he can there know but very <hi>little,</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that even that little Knowledge which he can attain to serves more to his Trouble than Satisfaction, and so is not only <hi>Vanity,</hi> but also <hi>Vexation</hi> of Spirit. Thirdly, that supposing it as Pleasant as may be, yet such is the shortness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance of his Life, that the enjoyment of it is not answerable to the Labour of acquiring it.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95935:64"/>
Fourthly, that there is no Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such a deal of Learning and Knowledge, either as to this World, or to the next, and that e're long he shall have his fill of Knowledge in the Beatifick Vision of the <hi>Ideal World,</hi> one glance whereof shall instruct him more, than an Eternal poring upon all the Books in this, and <hi>undistinguish</hi> the greatest <hi>Doctor</hi> from the most ignorant Peasant.

And that Now is the only opportunity for it. Sixthly, and lastly, that the Attainment of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Intellectual Perfection upon this Condition was the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of his Saviours Death, who has also Merited <hi>Grace</hi> for his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in the Performance of it. Which if he neglect, he shall not only miss of Happiness, but be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95935:64"/>
also answerable for so <hi>Great</hi> and so <hi>Dear</hi> an opportunity of gaining it; From these Premises 'twill I think follow with no less than <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Evidence.</hi>

                     <p>First, that <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> is not the thing for which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd Man in this Station, nor consequently the <hi>End</hi> or Reason of his bestowing upon him those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and Rational Powers which he has. For had this been the End and Design of God he would have made it more <hi>Possible</hi> for him, and withal more his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> and <hi>Concern,</hi> to attain it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'twill follow that the End for which God intended Man here, and the Reason why he made him a Rational Creature, was that he might Live vertuously and well, <hi>so</hi> serve him here, that he might be rewarded with Happiness and <hi>perfect Knowledge</hi> hereafter; Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving furnish'd him with Intellectual abilities sufficient for <hi>this,</hi> tho not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95935:65"/>
for the <hi>other.</hi> Thirdly and lastly, 'twill follow that the Principal care and concern of Man both because of his <hi>own interest,</hi> and out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>Designs</hi> of God, ought to be to Live a good and regular Life, to accomplish the <hi>Moral</hi> part of his Nature, to subdue his Passions, to rectifie his Love, to study Purity of Heart and Life, in one word, to <hi>perfect Holiness in the fear of God,</hi> and (which is what we have been hitherto inquiring after) that he ought to busy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Study of Learning and Knowledge no further, than as 'tis conducive to the Interest of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>

                     <p>This therefore is the <hi>Measure</hi> to be observ'd in our prosecution of Learning and Knowledge. We are to <hi>Study</hi> only that we may be <hi>good,</hi> and consequently ought to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute such Knowledge only as has an aptness to make us so, that which the Apostle calls <hi>the Truth, which is after Godliness.</hi> For that's

the only business we have to do in this World.

                     <p>And this will be found (if well examin'd) to be nothing different from the censure of the Wise Preacher. <hi>And I gave my heart to to know Wisdom,</hi> says he, <hi>and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that this also is vanity and vexation of Sptrit.</hi> Not that he now first applied himself to the study of Wisdom. No, he had been inspired with that before, and and by the help of it had discover'd the vanity of all other things. But that Wisdom which saw through all other things, did not as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Vanity of it self. He
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95935:66"/>
therefore now gave his Heart to <hi>Know</hi> Wisdom, that is, to reflect upon it, and Consider whether this might be excepted from his general censure, and struck out of the Scroll of vanities. And upon deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection he found that it could not, and that even <hi>this</hi> also was as much a vanity as any of the rest. Now this Proposition of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s cannot be understood <hi>Absolutely</hi> (Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being an undoubted Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Human Nature) but only with respect to the present posture of Man in this World. Neither can it be understood of <hi>all</hi> kind of Knowledge even in <hi>this</hi> Life, some kind of Knowledge being necessary to qualifie him for Happiness in the next. It must therefore Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be understood of all <hi>that</hi> Knowledge which contributes not to that great End. So that from these two Necessary Limitations the sense of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Proposition (if it have any) must be this; that to Man in this present juncture all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95935:66"/>
Knowledge that does not Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the interest of his After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, is downright <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of Spirit.</p>

                     <p>For, to what purpose should we Study <hi>so much,</hi> considering that after all we are able to <hi>Know so little,</hi> considering that even that <hi>little</hi> is enough to trouble and disquiet us, considering that our Life is as much too short for the enjoying what Knowledge we <hi>have,</hi> as for compassing what we <hi>would</hi> have, and withal considering that there lies no manner of Obligation or Necessity upon us to do thus. But (which is what I would most of all inculcate) to what purpose ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable should we be so busy, and vehement in the pursuit of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of any Learning, but what is of use to the Moral Conduct of our Life, considering these two things, First, that 'tis but to stay a little while and we shall have all that Knowledge <hi>Gratis,</hi> from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications

of the <hi>Ideal World,</hi> which we so <hi>unsuccessfully drudge</hi> for here, to the neglect of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and concerning exercises.

Upon the <hi>former</hi> consideration this <hi>Studious, Bookish</hi> humour is like laying out a great Sum of Money to purchase an Estate which after one weak, <hi>drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> Life will of Course fall into hand. And I am sure he would be reckon'd <hi>Fool</hi> or <hi>Mad</hi> that should do so. And upon the <hi>latter,</hi> 'tis as if a Man that was Riding Post upon Business of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> should as he passes through a Wood, stand still to listen to the Singing of a <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and so forget the main and only business of his Journey.</p>

                     <p>'Tis most certain that the two Cases here supposed, are as great instances of Folly and Impertinence as can well be conceiv'd, and yet (however it comes to pass that we are not sensible of it) 'tis certain that they are very applicable to the Intellectual Conduct of Human Life as 'tis generally managed. And tho we are all ready enough to call such men Fools as shall do as in the two mention'd instances is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, yet 'tis most certain that we do the very same or worse, that we are too much concern'd in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of the <hi>Parable,</hi> and that of most of <hi>us</hi> it may be truly said, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi>

To make this distinctly appear, I shall proceed upon these two grounds: First, That the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Death is the most proper exercise that a wise man can be employ'd about. And Secondly, that this is the most compendious way of making him wise that is not so.</p>

                     <p>And First, it is the most proper exercise that a wise man can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himself about. For Wisdom consists in a due estimation of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95935:75"/>
things; and then things are duly estimated, when they are measured and rated, first as they are <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in <hi>themselves</hi>; and secondly, as they stand in <hi>Relation</hi> to <hi>us.</hi> If they are great and extraordinary then they deserve to be consider'd for <hi>their own</hi> sakes; and if they nearly relate to us, then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be consider'd for <hi>ours.</hi> And upon both these accounts, Death and its consequences are highly deserving a wise mans Thoughts and Reflections.</p>
                  </div>

                     <head>XXXV.</head>
                     <p>For first, they are great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Transactions, barely as in themselves consider'd, and as such would deservedly ingage the most attentive consideration, even of a stander by, of any other <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Being, suppose an <hi>Angel,</hi> that can be no otherwise concerned in it, than as tis a <hi>great Event,</hi> a <hi>Noble Scene</hi> of Providence, a matter of <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Curiosity.</hi> I say upon this single Account Death
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95935:76"/>
with its consequences is as fit a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the Contemplation of a Wise man as auy in <hi>Nature.</hi>

                     <p>Or if there be within the Sphere of <hi>Nature</hi> things of a greater and more <hi>Bulky</hi> appearance, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is nothing wherein man is so nearly concern'd, so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interessed as in Death. Since upon the manner of this depends his Eternal <hi>Happiness</hi> or <hi>Ruin.</hi> There is therefore nothing that so much deserves to be consider'd by him. Whether therefore we regard the Absolute greatness of the thing, or its Relative greatness with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to us, as we are interessed and concerned in it, but especially if we weigh <hi>both,</hi> the consideration of Death is as proper an Exercise as a Wise man can be imploy'd about.</p>

                     <p>And as 'tis so fit an imployment for him that is wise already, so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly is it the most compendious way of making him wise, truly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95935:76"/>
wise, that is not so. For all wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is in Order to <hi>Happiness,</hi> and to be truly wise, is to be <hi>Wise unto Salvation.</hi> Whatever Knowledge contributes not to this, is quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Mark, and is as the Apostle calls it, <hi>Science falsly so called.</hi> The Knowledge itself is <hi>vain,</hi> and the Study of it is <hi>impertinent.</hi>

                     <p>Now the only way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is a good life, and consequently all wisdom being in Order to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, that's the only wisdom that serves to the promoting of good life, according to that of <hi>Iob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited, <hi>And to man he said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fear of the Lord that is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to depart from evil is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> That therefore is the most compendious way of making a man <hi>wise,</hi> that soonest makes him <hi>good,</hi> and reduces his mind to a <hi>moral</hi> Regularity.

wise man, <hi>Remember Death and Corruption, and keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The shortest Compendium of Holy living that ever was given.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95935:79"/>
according to the Principles before laid down, we were as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently imploy'd all the while, as if we had been so long picking Straws in <hi>Bedlam.</hi> I say as <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,</hi> tho perhaps not so <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently.</hi> The Sum of all comes to this: The measure of prosecuting Learning and Knowledge is their usefullness to good Life. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all Prosecution of it beyond or beside this End is impertinent and immoderate. This has been fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by evident Principles. But now of this sort is the general prosecution of Learning and Knowledge, as is plain by appealing to the general Conduct of Study. The Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore unovoidably follows. That the Intellectual Conduct of Human Life is justly chargeable with an immoderate and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent pursuit of Knowledge. Which was the Proposition to be made out, and I am <hi>sorry</hi> to see it so <hi>well</hi> proved.</p>

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>ANd now (Madam) having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd my <hi>Threefold Reflection</hi> upon the Intellectual Conduct of Human Life, I have a double Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to make, one to your <hi>Ladyship,</hi> and another to <hi>my self.</hi> That to your Ladyship is this, that you would consider to what a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compass, by vertue of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Discourses, these three things are reduced, which before use to take up so large a room, <hi>viz. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self, the Method of Learning, and the Desire and Prosecution of Learning.</hi> The first of which is comprized within the Limits of <hi>Necessary Truth,</hi> the second within those of <hi>Thinking, Purity</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi>; the third within its <hi>usefulness</hi> to the <hi>furtherance</hi> of <hi>good life.</hi> These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are great <hi>retrenchments,</hi> but I think such as are just and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Regulation of our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95935:80"/>
Conduct, which I am glad to find so compendious and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd, that being a Mark of no small Probability to confirm me in the Truth of it, as the <hi>Rightest Line</hi> is also always the <hi>Shortest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And since both <hi>Learning</hi> it self, its <hi>Method,</hi> and limits of <hi>Prosecution</hi> are all so reduced, I would further commend to your <hi>Ladyships</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether from this great <hi>Abridgment</hi> you can forbear dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing these two <hi>Corollaries,</hi> first, that this <hi>Bookish</hi> Humour which every where so prevails, is one of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Dyscrasys,</hi> or <hi>Moral Diseases</hi> of Mankind, one of the most <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant</hi> Reliques of Original depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It carrying in it the very <hi>Stamp</hi> and <hi>Signature</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgression, which owed its birth to Curiosity, and inordinate desire of Knowledge. Secondly, that those who <hi>have Eyes,</hi> may in a great Measure <hi>spare</hi> them, and that those who <hi>have not,</hi> should not, upon the account of Learning,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95935:81"/>
much <hi>lament</hi> the <hi>want</hi> of them which is what particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your <hi>Ladyship</hi>'s case, and is now address'd to your <hi>Private</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderarion.</p>
                  <p>Now as to my own <hi>particular</hi> Concern, the Result of what I have written is this. I am so <hi>inwardly</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> convinc'd of the certainty of those Principles, I have here lay'd down, that I think I am not only under a particular <hi>Obligation,</hi> but almost under a <hi>Necessity</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting my studies according to the Measures proposed. The <hi>last</hi> of which has left such a strong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, such a deep impression upon me, that I think I shall now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Advice of the Heathen (<hi>M. Antonius</hi> as I remember) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>rid my self of the Thirst after Books,</hi> and study nothing but what serves to the advancement of Piety and good life.</p>
                  <p>I have now spent about Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years in the most celebrated
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95935:81"/>
University in the World, and, according to the ordinary Measures, perhaps not amiss, having accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd my self in a competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree both with such Learning as the <hi>Academical Standard</hi> requires, and with whatever else my own <hi>Private Genius</hi> inclined me to. But truly I cannot say that I have order'd my studies in <hi>that Theatre of Learning,</hi> so much to my <hi>own Satisfaction,</hi> as to my <hi>Reputation</hi> with <hi>others.</hi> To be free with you, I must declare, that when I reflect upon my past <hi>Intellectual Conduct,</hi> I am as little satisfy'd with it as I am with that of my <hi>Morals,</hi> and that I think I have nigh as much to answer for the <hi>Former,</hi> as I have for the <hi>Latter,</hi> being very Conscious that the greatest part of it has been imploy'd in <hi>Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Curiosities,</hi>, such as derive no moral influence upon the Soul that contemplates them.</p>
                  <p>But I have now (if I sufficiently understand my self) a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95935:82"/>
Taste and Apprehension of things, and intend to spend my <hi>uncertain remainder</hi> of time in studying only such things as make for the Moral improvement of my mind, and the Regulation of my Life, not being able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count upon any rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Principles, why I should study any thing else.</p>
                  <p>More <hi>particularly</hi> I think I shall cheifly apply my self to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Books as are rather <hi>Perswasive,</hi> than <hi>Instructive,</hi> such as are Sapid, Pathetic and Divinely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relishing, such as Warm, Kindle and inlarge the <hi>Interiour,</hi> and awaken the <hi>Divine Sense</hi> of the Soul, as considering with my self that I have now, after so much Reading and Speculation, more need of <hi>Heat</hi> than of <hi>Light.</hi> Tho if I were for more Light still, I think this would prove the best <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Illumination,</hi> and that when all's done, the <hi>Love</hi> of God is the best <hi>Light</hi> of the Soul. For I consider
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95935:82"/>
with the Excellent <hi>Cardinal Bona,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Via com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendii ad Deum. p. 172.</note> that <hi>a Man may have Knowledge without Love. But he that Loves, altho he wants Sciences humanely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, yet he will know more than Human Wisdom can teach him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has that Master within who teaches Man Knowledge.</hi> Purity of Heart and Life being one of the Methods of Consulting the <hi>Ideal World,</hi> as was shewn in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part.</p>
                  <p>And now (<hi>Madam</hi>) I cannot well presage how your <hi>Ladyship</hi> will relish this <hi>Renunciation</hi> of all studies <hi>Meerly Curious,</hi> from one whom you apprehended (perhaps upon too just grounds) to have been so naturally disposed to them, and so deeply ingaged in them. Perhaps you'll say I am already <hi>Countrify'd</hi> since I left the <hi>Vniversity.</hi> How far that <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> may seize upon me, I can't yet tell, if Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Retirement be enough to bring it, I am I confess in great Danger, being now got into a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95935:83"/>
                     <hi>little Corner</hi> of the World, where I must be more Company to my self than I have been ever yet. But the best on't is, I have not been so great a stranger to my own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <hi>all along,</hi> as to fear any great <hi>alteration</hi> by it now. Nor do I think the Management of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent undertaking a <hi>sign</hi> of any such <hi>change.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether I should have had the same Thoughts in the <hi>Vniversity</hi> or no, I can't say, I rather believe they are owing to my <hi>Country-Retirement</hi> (as I hinted in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) but however that be, sure I am they were entertain'd upon the deepest and severest Consideration, and I believe are so <hi>well grounded,</hi> that the more your <hi>Ladyship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders,</hi> the more you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd both of the <hi>Truth</hi> of what I have <hi>Discours'd,</hi> and of the <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi> of what I <hi>design</hi>; which is to devote my self wholly to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of my <hi>Moral</hi> part, and of my Intellectual, only so
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95935:83"/>
far as is Subservient to the other.</p>
                  <p>And now (<hi>Madam</hi>) having bid farewel to all <hi>unconcerning</hi> Studies, all the dry and unsavoury parts of Learning, 'tis high time to take my leave of your <hi>Ladyship</hi> too; which I do with this <hi>Hope,</hi> that one great ground of your Trouble for the Misfortune of your Eyes is by the foregoing Considerations removed: And with this <hi>Assurance,</hi> that if these Discourses be too <hi>Weak</hi> to bring you over to my <hi>present</hi> Opinion, they will however prove <hi>Strong</hi> enough to work you into a <hi>Better,</hi> which is to <hi>believe,</hi> that I still continue in all Reality,</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>John 21. v. 15.</bibl>
                     <q>So when they had Dined, Iesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon Son of Ionas, Lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, yea Lord; Thou knowest that I Love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my Lambs.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Words consist of Three considerable parts. First, of a Question put by our Lord to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Thirdly, of a Command by way of inference from it. The Question was whether St. <hi>Peter</hi> Loved him beyond the rest of his Disciples then present. This <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:95935:86"/>
of our Lord was not so high as were St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s former <hi>Professions</hi> and <hi>Pretensions.</hi> This warm and Zealous Apostle had always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd a more than ordinary Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his Lord and Master, and pretended to as great a <hi>Supremacy</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> as his Successours do of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> He seem'd to be among the <hi>Apostles</hi> what the <hi>Seraphim</hi> are among the <hi>Angels,</hi> to out-shine and out-burn not this or that vulgar Disciple only, but the whole Apostolical Order in Zeal, Courage, and Flames of <hi>Divine Love.</hi> For no less can that Eminent Profession of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Tho all Men should be offended because of thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.33.</note> 
                     <hi>yet will I never be offended.</hi> But not having made good his high Pretensions, our Lord now puts the Question to him in terms more moderate than those wherein he had before voluntarily boasted of his own Fidelity; and whereas he had before made shew of a <hi>Superlative</hi> Love beyond <hi>All</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:95935:86"/>
the Disciples, our Lord only asks him this Modest Question, <hi>Lovest thou me more than these</hi>?</p>
                  <p>The good Apostle having now partly from the late experiment of his own frailty, and partly from the manner of our Lords Question, learnt more Humility and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, returns such an Answer as was short not only of his <hi>former Professions,</hi> but even of the <hi>Question</hi> too. He does not reply, <hi>Lord thou knowest that I love thee more than these.</hi> No, he dares not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any more so much as to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> any thing concerning the <hi>Measure</hi> of his Love, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented barely to aver the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> of it. And for this he fears not to appeal at last to the <hi>Divine Omniscience, Lord thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord takes the Answer, and does not at all question the Truth and Sincerity of it, only he gives him a <hi>Test</hi> whereby it might
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95935:87"/>
be tried and justified, both before <hi>God, himself</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> by subjoining this Illative Command, <hi>feed my Lambs,</hi> as it is in the Text, or as in the two following verses, <hi>feed my sheep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This whole intercourse between our Lord and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> may I conceive, as to the full stress and scope of it, fitly be reduced to this short <hi>Hypothetical sceme</hi> of speech, <hi>If thou lovest me, feed my sheep.</hi> Like that of our Saviour, upon another occasion to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in common, <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</hi> This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a shorter view takes in the full force of the words, and I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly discourse upon them, as if they had stood in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
                  <p>Hence then I shall take occasion to consider these three things, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally arising from the words, and as no less pertinent to our present Concern.</p>
                  <p>First the great Love of our Lord
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95935:87"/>
Christ to his Church, which he here calls <hi>his Lambs,</hi> and <hi>his Sheep,</hi> which he here commands St. <hi>Peter</hi> as he loved him to feed, and which lastly he would not absolutely and finally commit to his Charge, till after <hi>three distinct Inquiries</hi> whether he truly loved him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I shall consider the <hi>Command</hi> here given, and shew the great obligation that lies upon all spiritual Pastors and Guides of Souls to feed this flock of Christ which is so dearly beloved by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I shall consider the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> and <hi>Dependence</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Practice</hi> of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ. <hi>If thou Lovst me feed my sheep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, I shall close all with an earnest exhortation to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Practice of the Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
                  <p>The first thing I shall consider is the great Love of Christ to his Church. And certainly if there be any <hi>Secret</hi> in Religion fit for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95935:88"/>
Angels to <hi>Contemplate,</hi> and too high for them to <hi>comprehend</hi>; if there be any Love that has <hi>Breadth</hi> and <hi>Length,</hi> and <hi>Depth,</hi> and <hi>Heighth,</hi> if there be any Love that <hi>passes Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> if there be any love that is <hi>stronger</hi> than <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>dearer</hi> than <hi>Life,</hi> if there be any, lastly, that is <hi>truly wonderful,</hi> and that passes love not only of <hi>Women,</hi> but of the whole <hi>Creation,</hi> 'tis this Love of our Lord to his Church. We have no line long enough to fathom so vast a Depth, nor can Mortality furnish us with Ideas to conceive, or with words to utter so deep a Mystery. If there be any words that can reach it, they must be such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> heard in his Rapture, strange words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> words that cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by an Human Tongue, and that would be meer <hi>Barbarism</hi> to a Mortal capacity.</p>
                  <p>But however, that we may take some Measure of that which really has none, and be able to frame
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95935:88"/>
some Notion of this Love of Christ, which as the Apostle tells us <hi>passes knowledge,</hi> we will exhibit a Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of it in a <hi>Double Light</hi>;<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.19.</note> First, in those verbal Representations which the Scripture gives of it, and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in those real and actual Proofs whereby Christ himself has exprest this his most excellent, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Incredible</hi> Love.</p>
                  <p>As to the First, the Scripture we know is full of great things, and those set forth with as great and magnificent Expressions. The Rhetoric and Stile of Scripture runs incomparably high, beyond that of any other writings in whatever it treats of. But there are <hi>three</hi> things more especially, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of which the Holy Spirit seems to <hi>Labour,</hi> and be at a <hi>Stand</hi> for <hi>Expression.</hi> And these are the <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Miseries</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Church.</hi> These the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents under all the variety of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, Figures and Images that can
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95935:89"/>
be supplied either from the <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi> or <hi>Material</hi> World; that so what is wanting in each single Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, might be made up from the Multitude and Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, that if one should miss, another might strike us, to make if possible some impression of so strange and so concerning Truths upon the minds of Men.</p>
                  <p>But the last of these, as 'tis most wonderful and Mysterious (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater wonder that God should Love Man, than that either there should be so much Happiness in the Enjoyment of God, or so much misery in the Loss of him) so is it more <hi>frequently inculcated,</hi> and more <hi>strongly represented.</hi> So frequently inculcated is it, that were it not for the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> and that there is no <hi>Tautology</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> the Scripture would seem Chargeable with <hi>vain Repetitions.</hi> Every Page almost in Holy writ breathes forth this Mystery of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> and besides that, there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95935:89"/>
is one whole Book particularly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the representation of it, by all the Flowers and Delicacies of the most exalted Poetry; it may be said of the whole Sacred Volumn that 'tis but one continued Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Love from Christ to his Church, one <hi>Larger Canticles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as 'tis thus frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, so is it no less strongly represented. 'Tis represented by that which is the most proper <hi>Effect,</hi> and the last <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment</hi> of all Love, by <hi>Vnion.</hi> For there are three most admirable Unions proposed to our Faith in the Christian Religion. The Unity of Essence in the Trinity, the Unity of Person in Jesus Christ, and the Union that is between Christ and his Church. The First of these is an Example and Prefiguration as it were to the Second, and the Second to the Third. For we cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter represent the Union of Christ with his Church, than by the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatic
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95935:90"/>
Vnion,</hi> or the Union of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> with Human Nature.</p>
                  <p>For First, as in this Mystery the Plurality of Nature is consistent with the Unity of Person, so does Love effect the same Miracle in the Union between Christ and his Church. For here also we meet with a new <hi>Theanthropy,</hi> a strange Composition of God and Man, two vastly different Substances, which without Confusion of either <hi>Natures</hi> or <hi>Properties,</hi> make up one and the same <hi>Body.</hi> For if Christ be <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, he is also one Body with it. And so St. <hi>Austin, Totus Christus secundam Ecclesiam &amp; Caput &amp; Corpus est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, as in the Mystery of the Hypostatic union there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Idioms or Properties whereby what primarily and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly belongs to one, may secondarily and concretely be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the other, as that God is man, and man is God, so has Love introduced the like Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95935:90"/>
between Christ and his Church, which may be said to be <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>glorified</hi> in Christ, as he is said to <hi>suffer</hi> in his Church.</p>
                  <p>Again, as in the Mystery of the Hypostatic union the <hi>Word</hi> uniting it self to Human Nature adorn'd and exalted it, not only by the Priviledge of so sacred a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, but also with many distinct Graces and Excellencies, whereby it was <hi>necessarily</hi> tho not <hi>forcibly</hi> determin'd to love the Divinity, and highly fitted to be loved by it, so is it also in this Union between Christ and his Church. He has not only innobled her by so sacred an Alliance, but is ever conferring upon her his Gifts and Graces, and will never cease to do so, till at length he present her to himself a <hi>Glorious Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.27.</note> without <hi>spot</hi> or <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,</hi> and make her in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure worthy of so great a <hi>Love,</hi> and so intimate an <hi>Vnion.</hi> For 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that in Scripture Jesus Christ is set out as the Author and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95935:91"/>
Dispencer of all Grace, to him is ascribed the Work of the <hi>Second</hi> as well as of the <hi>First</hi> Creation, from his fulness we all receive, and the Apostle says expresly, that <hi>to every one of us is given grace according to the Measure of the gift of Christ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to pursue this <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Parallel</hi> any further, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to consider this Union, as 'tis represented in Holy Scripture. Now there are but two sorts of Union in the World, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi> And the Holy Spirit has made Choice of the Closest of each, whereby to <hi>Figure</hi> out to us the Union between Christ and his Church. The closest of Natural Unions is that between the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi>; and the closest of all Moral Unions is that between the <hi>Husband</hi> and the <hi>Wife.</hi> And both these are by the Holy Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this Mystery.</p>
                  <p>Thus is Christ oftentimes call'd the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, and the Church the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ. Thus
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95935:91"/>
again is he stiled the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and the Church honour'd with the Name of his <hi>Spouse.</hi> And because this <hi>Latter</hi> Figure carries in it more of sensible endearment, therefore is it of more <hi>frequent use,</hi> and withal of more <hi>Antient Date.</hi> For besides that <hi>Adam</hi> first open'd this <hi>Mystery,</hi> and by his Miraculous Marriage typified to us that of Christ with his Church, which came out of the Wounded Side of our Lord, as <hi>Eve</hi> was taken out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have also given our Lord the title of <hi>Bridegroom</hi> in the Old Testament. The 45th <hi>Psalm</hi> is a plain Spiritual <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> and so is the whole Book of Canticles, and the Holy Baptist, in whom both Types and Prophesie expire, calls him expresly by the Name of <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Strange Miracle of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>! That ever God should come down to seek a Spouse upon Earth! was it not enough, O Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jesu, that thou wast one with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95935:92"/>
the Father and Holy Spirit, in the Eternal Trinity? was it not enough that thou hadst <hi>made</hi> thy self one with our Mortal Flesh by assuming our Nature, but that thou must yet heap Mystery upon Mystery, and as if thou wert not yet near enough allied to us, must also make thy self one with thy <hi>Church</hi>? But such is thy <hi>Love</hi> to man as not to be contented with <hi>one</hi> single union with him? And so great thy <hi>Condescention</hi> as if thou need'st a <hi>Partner,</hi> to compleat thy Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and as if it were no more good for the <hi>second,</hi> than 'twas for the <hi>first Adam</hi> to be <hi>alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are the two Principal <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> under which the Scripture Pictures out to us the Love of Christ to his Church, and his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it. Not that they rise up to the heighth of the Mystery, but because they come the nearest of any to it. For indeed they fall vastly short, and give but a faint shadowy resemblance of what they are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95935:92"/>
to represent. And therefore as we have hitherto represented the dearness between Christ and his Church, by that between the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Members,</hi> and the <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> so we may, and with better reason <hi>invert</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and propose the <hi>Former</hi> as an Example and Measure for both the <hi>Latter.</hi> And 'tis observable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does so;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.25.</note> For says he, <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands love your Wives, even as Christ loved the Church.</hi> And again, <hi>No Man ever yet hated his own Flesh, but Nourishes and Cherishes it even as the Lord the Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> Where you see the Love of Christ to his Church is not, as before, set out by that of Married Persons, and that of a Man to his own Flesh, but these are set out and illustrated by the other. So great and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all <hi>Love,</hi> yea even all <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> is this Love of Christ to his Church.</p>
                  <p>But 'twill appear yet greater, if we take a Prospect of it in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95935:93"/>
Second Light, namely in those Real and Actual Proofs whereby Christ himself has exprest this his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and otherwise incredible Love. And certainly they are such as never <hi>were, will,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be given by any other Lover. For (to make the Prospect as short as maybe) was it not an amazing instance of Love for the great and ever Blessed God, who could neither be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by our Happiness, nor dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by our Misery, to come down and assume our Nature in its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Circumstances, to live a needy and contemptible Life, and dye a painful aud execrable Death, and all this to reconcile a Rebel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store an Apostate? Indeed the work of Man's Redemption, if we deeply consider the whole Method and Contrivance of it, is such an Heroic instance of Love, and so much exceeding that of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that 'tis well Man was <hi>Created</hi> and <hi>Redeem'd</hi> by the <hi>same</hi> good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, since otherwise his obligations
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95935:93"/>
to his <hi>Redeemer</hi> being so much greater than those to his <hi>Creator,</hi> he would be very much divided and distracted in his returns of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us reflect a little upon the <hi>Life,</hi> before we further consider the <hi>Death</hi> of our Redeemer. It was one constant Argument, one continued Miracle of Love. He lived as one purely <hi>Devoted</hi> to the good of Mankind. All his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> all his <hi>Words,</hi> all his <hi>Actions</hi> were <hi>Love,</hi> His whole business was to <hi>Glorify</hi> his Father, and (which was his greatest Glory) to express his Love to Man, which tho at all times exceeding wonderful, yet toward the Evening of his Life it thicken'd and grew stronger, like Motion within the Neighbourhood of the Center, and as then he <hi>Prayed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 22.44.</note> so he <hi>Loved yet more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For 'twas then that he wept over Condemn'd <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and bedew'd with Tears the Grave of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:95935:94"/>
'Twas then that with desire he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to Eat the Passover with his Disciples, instituted a perpetual Monument of <hi>Love,</hi> his Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and left another of <hi>Humility</hi> by condescending to wash their Feet. 'Twas then that he comforted his Disciples with the variety of the Heavenly Mansions, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that he himself was the way, the Truth and the Life, with an assurance that their Prayers in his Name should be effectual, with a Promise of the Holy Spirit, and with a Legacy of his own <hi>Peace,</hi> to compensate for the Tribulation they should meet with in the <hi>World.</hi> 'Twas then, lastly, that he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the state of his Apostles, together with his own Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Jo. 17.</note> in one and the same Solemn Prayer to his Father, that he would preserve them in Unity and Truth, and at length Glorify them with the whole Body of true Believers with himself in Heaven. And all this at a time when one would have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95935:94"/>
thought his own concern should have been his only <hi>Meditation,</hi> and Fear his only <hi>Passion,</hi> for now was he within view of his ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing sufferings, and the <hi>shade</hi> was just ready to <hi>point</hi> at the dreadful hour, and yet even now his Love was truly stronger than Death, and the Care of his Disciples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the Horrors of his approaching Agony.</p>
                  <p>Which he further shewed by giving up himself to a cruel and shameful Death, for the Life and Salvation of the World. A Death (to say no more of it) of such strange Sorrow and Anguish, that the very <hi>Prospect</hi> of it put him into a <hi>Sweat</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> and the <hi>induring</hi> it made him <hi>complain</hi> of being <hi>deserted</hi> of his Father. And then that his Redemption might prove <hi>effectual,</hi> after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he gives Commission to his Disciples to go and publish it with its conditions throughout the world, and orders them all, as he does
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95935:95"/>
here St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>feed his Sheep.</hi> And lest the the Benefit of his Death should be <hi>again</hi> frustrated for want of Power to perform the conditions, presently after his Ascension he sent down the Spirit of consolation upon his Apostles, and does continually confer <hi>Grace</hi> upon, and make <hi>Intercession</hi> for his Church. So tenderly affected was he toward this his Spouse, that even the felicities of Heaven could not make him forget her, as he further shew'd by complaining in behalf of his Church, when from the midst of his Glory he said, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> Which words shew him as much concern'd for the wounds given to his <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> as for those he felt in his <hi>Natural</hi> Body.</p>
                  <p>And now since the Love of our Lord to his Church is so exceeding great, it certainly concerns all Christians, especially those whom he has intrusted with the Care of his Church to be alike minded.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95935:95"/>
Which leads me in the Second place to consider the command here given, and to shew the great Obligation that lies upon all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pastors, to feed this flock of Christ which is so nearly beloved by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> says our Lord to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to all the Pastors of the Christian Church, who are equally concerned both in the <hi>Command</hi> and in the <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that they are so is, already sufficiently concluded from what has been discoursed concerning the great Love of Christ to his Church. <q>To make you therefore more sensible of this Duty I need only propose to your Meditation, how affectionately our Lord loves his Church, and how dear her Interests are to him, that out of this his abundant Love, he has set apart a distinct Order of men on this very purpose, to promote and further her in the way of Salvation, that he has intrusted
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95935:96"/>
the care of her in their hands, and has made them his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents and Trustees; that 'tis a Charge worthy their greatest care, for which there needs no other Argument than that 'tis committed to them, by him who knows the worth. of Souls; that he strictly commands them, as they have any Love or Regard for him, to feed his Sheep; that 'twas the very last Command that he gave them, when he was just leaving the world, and upon the very confines of Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that lastly as this is the greatest Trust that was ever by God reposed in Men, so there will be the severest account taken of it at the last day, at the Great <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the <hi>Bishop of Souls.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is enough, if duely weighed, to shew the Obligation of this command, and to conclude this part, were it not necessary to add something concerning the manner of discharging it. <hi>Feed my Sheep</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:95935:96"/>
is the Command given by Christ to the Pastors of his Church, and we have seen the obligation of it: But <hi>how</hi> are they to Feed them? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, First by <hi>Prayer</hi> for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective charges both in Public and in Private. This is the First thing belonging to the Pastoral Office, and accordingly with this St. <hi>Paul</hi> begins his Admonition to his Son <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>I exhort therefore that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions and giving Thanks be made for all Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly by <hi>Preaching,</hi> with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Instruction and Admonition as occasion shall serve and require. And here their first care should be to Preach nothing but what is <hi>True.</hi> Secondly, to confine their Discourses to <hi>Vseful Truths,</hi> such as tend to the promotion of good Life, that which the Apostle calls <hi>the Truth which is after Godliness.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Titus.</note> Thirdly, to deliver only <hi>Plain Truths.</hi> For there are many Truths which are highly useful and have a very Practical aspect when
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95935:97"/>
they are once understood, which are not so easie and obvious to be so. These therefore ought as much to be waved as those which are not useful, because tho useful, <hi>simply</hi> speaking, yet <hi>respectively</hi> they are not. And upon these two latter accounts we should not trouble our Unlearned Auditories, either with Thorny Questions and Knotty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies which in themselves have no Practical use, or with more refined Theories and School Niceties, which to them are as useless and unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as the other. To Feed them with the <hi>Former</hi> would be to give them <hi>Stones</hi> instead of <hi>Bread</hi>; And to Feed them with the <hi>Latter</hi> would be like placing a Man in the Region of <hi>pure Ether</hi>; why, he can't <hi>breath</hi> in it, and will starve by reason of the <hi>over-fineness</hi> of his Diet.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it enough that the Truths we Preach be <hi>Vseful</hi> and <hi>Plain,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in the Fourth place they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in a Plain and Intelligible <hi>Manner.</hi> For what signifies it that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95935:97"/>
the things are in <hi>themselves</hi> Plain, if we make them obscure in our <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> them; we are all ready enough to laugh at the Poor <hi>Frier</hi> for going about to Preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> and are not they alike ridiculous that order Discourses so as not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by those that hear them? Don't these also Preach to <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi>? We ought therefore to consult the <hi>Capacity</hi> of our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and consider to <hi>whom,</hi> as well as <hi>what</hi> we speak.</p>
                  <p>And to this Plainness of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion we would do well to join some degrees of <hi>Warmth</hi> and <hi>Concerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And this I rather recommend because there are some that affect a Cold, Dead, careless and heartless way of Delivery. But certainly this has as little <hi>Decorum</hi> in it as it has of <hi>Devotion.</hi> For since the things we speak are supposed not only to be <hi>Truths,</hi> but <hi>Concerning</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi> Truths, what can be more absurd than to see a Man deliver
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95935:98"/>
a Sermon as drily and indifferently, as one would Read a <hi>Mathematical Lecture</hi>? 'Tis said of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, that he was a <hi>Burning,</hi> as well as a <hi>Shining</hi> Light.<note place="margin">John 5.35.</note> And truly we have need of such in this Cold Frozen Age. Plain Sermons, Preach'd with Warmth and Affection do more than the Best, Coldly deliver'd. You know the Story in <hi>Eusebius</hi> of the Heathen Philosopher coming into the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> who was baffled into Christianity by the meer <hi>Warmth</hi> and <hi>Heartiness</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the good Old Man address'd him. He could have resisted his Arguments, but not the Spirit and Zeal wherewith he spake. And this is all I shall think proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to you upon the Preaching part.</p>
                  <p>The next way whereby the Pastors of the Church are to Feed the Sheep of Christ, is by duely Administring to them the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> which is their true Spiritual Food, the <hi>Manna</hi> that must sustain them in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95935:98"/>
this <hi>Wilderness.</hi> This is the most proper way of Feeding them, for the Body of Christ is Meat indeed, and his Blood is Drink indeed.</p>
                  <p>There remains yet one way more of Feeding the Flock of Christ, without which the rest will signifie but little, and that is by a <hi>good Example.</hi> Among the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a good Shepherd, our Saviour reckons this as one, that <hi>he goes before his Sheep,</hi> and leads them by his <hi>Steps,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 10.4</note> as well as with his <hi>Voice.</hi> There ought to be a Connexion between <hi>Hear</hi> and <hi>Do,</hi> but much more between <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Do.</hi> And he that is not careful of this, as he cannot expect to do much good to others, so he will certainly <hi>Condemn</hi> himself. To be short (for I hope I need not inlarge, speaking to Wise Men) a good Preacher who is an ill Liver is such a <hi>Monster</hi> as cannot be Match'd in all <hi>Affrica.</hi> And for his State hereafter, I may leave it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd how great a Condemnation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95935:99"/>
awaits him, whom not only the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Conscience,</hi> but even his <hi>own Sermons</hi> shall Judge at the last Day.</p>
                  <p>These are the several ways of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this Precept, <hi>Feed my Sheep</hi>; to which however I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to add one thing more, and that is that we Feed them <hi>our selves,</hi> and not by <hi>Proxy,</hi> or <hi>Deputation.</hi> For out Lord does not say to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> do thou get some body to Feed my Sheep, but do thou Feed them thy self.</p>
                  <p>For however St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Shadow</hi> might do Cures upon the <hi>Body,</hi> it must be his <hi>Person</hi> that must do good upon the <hi>Souls</hi> of his Charge. To speak out plainly what I intend, <hi>Non-residency</hi> is one of the greatest scandals of the <hi>Reform'd,</hi> yea of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, contrary to all Reason and Justice, as well as Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Practice. And whoever are guilty of it, plainly shew that they are Lovers of Ease, Honour or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more than Lovers of Christ.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95935:99"/>
For certainly he that Loves Christ as he ought will not think himself too good to Feed his Sheep. Which leads me in the Third and Last place to consider the <hi>Connexion</hi> and <hi>Dependance</hi> that is between the <hi>Practice</hi> of this Command and the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ. Now this I briefly make out upon a double ground.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First Ground</hi> is, because the Love of Christ will naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to Love whatever he Loves, and consequently since his Church is so exceeding dear to him, 'twill ingage us to Love his Church, and if to Love it, then consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diligent in Feeding it, that being the most proper instance of shewing our Love to it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Ground</hi> is, because the Person of Jesus Christ consisting of a Double Nature, God and Man, the Love of him must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Love of his <hi>Humanity</hi>; as well as of his <hi>Divinity.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Love Christ, we Love the Human Nature as well as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95935:100"/>
and if so, then we Love Man as Man, consequently all Men, and if we Love all Men, we shall desire and endeavour their Salvation, and accordingly take care to Feed them with the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon these two Grounds it plainly appears that there is a strong Connexion between the <hi>Loving</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Feeding</hi> of his <hi>Sheep,</hi> and that such Pastors as do not well discharge the <hi>Latter,</hi> have no right of pretending to the <hi>Former.</hi> This is the <hi>Test</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s and every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pastor's affection to our Lord must be tried, <hi>If you Love me, Feed my Sheep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me therefore exhort you all, as you Love our Lord Jesus Christ, and as you desire to be Loved and approv'd of by him, to a sincere and Conscientious Discharge of your <hi>Pastoral Duty,</hi> to <hi>take heed unto your selves and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghost has made
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95935:100"/>

                     <hi>which he has purchased with his own Blood.</hi> Let me beseech you to consider what you <hi>are,</hi> and what you <hi>should be.</hi> What you are by your <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Profession,</hi> and what you should be in the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take heed to <hi>your selves,</hi> to <hi>your Doctrine,</hi> and above all to your <hi>Publick Life and Conversation.</hi> For certainly it cannot be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Measure of Religion that will serve our turn, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd not only to be <hi>Good,</hi> but <hi>Exemplary,</hi> and must Live well for <hi>others</hi> as well as for <hi>our selves,</hi> what therefore is <hi>Perfection</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will be but strict <hi>Duty</hi> in us. The Devotion of our <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> days, ought to exceed that of their <hi>Festivals,</hi> and we should <hi>Live</hi> in as much Warmth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as they <hi>Dye.</hi>

to be Patterns and Examples of a Holy and refined Conversation. Let your Lamps therefore be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways trimm'd, and your Lights always Burning, and that with such <hi>Brightness,</hi> as to <hi>shame</hi> those that will not be <hi>allured</hi> by the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Flame.</p>
                  <p>And that you may the better do all this, let me desire you all fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and seriously to Meditate upon the Excellent <hi>Example</hi> of the great and good Shepherd Christ Jesus, whose Life was wholly <hi>imploy'd,</hi> and at last <hi>laid down</hi> for the good of his Sheep. I pray you (My Reverend Brethren) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this and all that has been said, that so when this great Shepherd shall return to visit his Flock, you may all give up the same Account to him, that he did to his Father, <hi>Those that thou gavest me I have kept,</hi>
