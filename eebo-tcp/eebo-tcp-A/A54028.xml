            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CONCERNING The SUM or SUBSTANCE OF OUR RELIGION, Who are called QUAKERS, And the Exerciſes and Travels of our Spirits therein.</head>
            <p>THis is the Sum or Subſtance of our Religion, to wit, to feel and diſcern the two Seeds: the Seed of Enmity, the Seed of Love; the Seed of the Fleſh, the Seed of the Spirit; the Seed of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Sarah</hi>; the Seed of the Egyptian womb, the holy Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi>: and to feel the Judgments of God adminiſtred to the one of theſe, till it be brought into bondage and death; and the other raiſed up in the Love and Mercy of the Lord to live in us, and our Souls gathered into it, to live to God in it.</p>
            <p>Now when the Light of Gods holy Spirit breaketh in upon man, and his quickning vertue is felt; then life enters into that which was ſlain, and there is a deſire begotten in the heart to travel out of the Egyptian ſtate, into the good Land; that the Soul which came from God, might return back again to him (out of the ſinfull, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, miſerable, loſt eſtate) and might live and walk with him, in the purity, vertue and power of his own Life and Spirit.</p>
            <p>But then the other birth ſtrives for its life, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>) takes part with his Egyptians againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and there is no help to the poor ſoul, but as God pour out his Judgments upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96898:2"/>
that hard nature and ſpirit in man, which is of the Birth of the Fleſh, and receives the influences and ſtrength of its father, which harden it againſt the true Seed. And now what a condition is this poor Soul in! The Light of Gods Spirit giveth it the ſence of its ſtate, and the quicknings of Life make it ſenſible of its bondage, there are alſo ſome deſires and longings after deliverance: but this doth but provoke the Enemy, and the Soul being yet in his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and under his power, he dealeth the more hardly with it, increaſing its burdens and oppreſſions daily. And O the out-cries of the Soul in this ſtate! how is its ſpirit pained, anguiſhed and vexed within it, ſo that it could almoſt many times chuſe rather to lie ſtill in <hi>Egypt</hi> then undergo the heavy burdens, oppreſſions, fears and dangers, that it daily meets with in this ſtate.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a Secret hope, ſpringing up in the heart from the true Seed, which often encourageth it to truſt him, and wait upon him who hath viſited, in his pure miniſtration of Judgment. For this is felt many times (as the Soul is made truly ſenſible by the Lord) that the Judgment is not to the Seed, not to <hi>Iſrael</hi>; but to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians</hi>: and by every ſtroke of Gods Wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the Seed is eaſed, and its deliverance working out.</p>
            <p>And ſo at laſt when the Judgment is finiſhed in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians</hi> broken, their firſt-born ſlain, out comes <hi>Iſrael,</hi> out of the Dark Land, out of the Houſe of Bondage, to travel towards its reſting place. Then the Paſchal Lamb is known and fed on; yea, it is becauſe of the Blood of the Lamb, ſprinkled upon the Door-poſts, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is paſſed over and ſaved, in the day of <hi>Egypts</hi> viſitation, O who can read this truly, that hath not felt and been a living Witneſs thereof!</p>
            <p>But now, when the ſeed is come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there is not the end, but rather the beginning of its Travels. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> (with their Horſes and Chariots) may purſue again and even overtake; and there may ſeem no way of eſcape or help to the Soul, but only to ſtand ſtill, hope in the Lord and wait to ſee his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Then ſhall the Sea be divided, which ſtopped <hi>Iſraels</hi> courſe, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his <hi>Egyptians</hi> (the Enemies of the Soul in this appearance of dreadfull oppreſſing power) be deſtroyed and ſeen no more.</p>
            <p>Yet in the Wilderneſs in the paſſage through the entanglements
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96898:2"/>
to the holy Land, there are many ſtraits, trials and ſore Enemies to be met with, who will ſtrive by open force and alſo with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments to betray <hi>Iſrael</hi>: yea there is a part yet unbrought down, yet unwrought out, at which they will be ſtriving to enter the mind. And as <hi>Iſrael</hi> forgets his God, walking out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, hearkning to that which his ear ſhould be ſhut againſt, and ſo joyning to the contrary Seed; the Plagues, the Judgments, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Wo will be felt by him, and many Carkaſes may fall there. So that there may be a great outcry in the heart, <hi>Who can ſtand before this holy Lord God? ſhall we be conſuming with dying?</hi> yes, there is ſomewhat muſt be conſumed with dying. Yea, if a man came ſo far, as to witneſs dominion and victory over his Souls Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the evil Seed brought into death in him, &amp; a poſſeſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the pure reſt of Life: yet if that part be not kept in the death, if there be not a praying and watching to the Preſerver of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in the pure fear and humility) the Enemy will be ſowing to the Fleſh again; he will be getting ſome of his corrupt Seeds into the heart again (if the Soul do but ſleep and become negligent) and ſo corruption will take root again, and the contrary Birth grow up again, and the Foxes break into the Vineyard and ſpoil the tender grapes.</p>
            <p>So that this is our Religion, to witneſs the two Seeds, with the Power of the Lord bringing down the one, and bringing up the other: and then to witneſs and experience daily the ſame Power, keeping the one in Death and the other in Life, by the holy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gods pure living Covenant. And ſo, to know God in this Covenant (in this Covenant which lives, gives Life and keeps in Life) and to walk with God and worſhip and ſerve him therein, even in his Son, in the Light of his Son, in the Life of his Son, in the vertue and ability which flows from his Son into our Spirits, This is our Religion, which the Lord our God in his tender mercy hath beſtowed upon us: And indeed we find this to be a pure, living and undefiled Religion before God, daily witneſſing his acceptance of it in and through his Son, whoſe Name is here known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, worſhipped and honoured, according to the very heart of the Father.</p>
            <p>This may be further illuſtrated, and perhaps made more manifeſt to ſome, by a Scripture or two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96898:3"/>
               <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p>Here are the two Seeds (the Seed of the Serpent, the Seed of the woman) whoſe ſtriving and fight is in man, when God awakens the Soul, the one whereof hath a nature, a deſire or luſt contrary to the other. Now as the one of theſe prevails in any heart; ſo the other goes down. As the one gains Life and Power: ſo the other is brought into Death and Captivity. So that this is it every one is to wait for, after they once come to the ſenſible knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of theſe two, to feel the Fleſh brought down, the luſts of it denied, the Judgments of the Lord adminiſtred to it; that ſo the other may come up to live, thrive and prevail in the Soul, and ſo the Soul witneſs Salvation and Redemption under its ſhadow. Thus <hi>Sion</hi> is <hi>Redeemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Iſa. 1.27. What is <hi>Sion</hi>? Is it not the holy hill of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Son is ſet King to reign, whereon the holy City is to be built, and God to be worſhipped in Spirit: what condition is <hi>Sion</hi> in, when God viſits her to redeem her? Is ſhe not laid waſt, deſolate, lying in the duſt: (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13, 14.) Well: how will God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem her? <hi>Zion ſhall be redeemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteouſneſs.</hi> By bringing Judgments upon that which keeps her under, upon her Enemies, the contrary Seed, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems her: and by bringing forth Righteouſneſs (the righteous Life and Spirit of his own Son) in thoſe whoſe minds are turned to her, whoſe faces are ſet <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, thus God redeems her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. Yes, yes; it is truly felt and witneſſed, The living Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, revealed in the heart and having power there, ſets free from all the unrighteouſneſs which was there before. And then, when the unrighteous one is caſt out, and the righteous one revealed, and the Soul united to him and receives vertue and power from him; then he becomes a Servant of righteouſneſs, and doth not commit ſin, but doth righteouſneſs: <hi>and he that doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is righteous, even as he is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7. For how can it be otherwiſe, when the righteous Life is revealed and brought up into dominion in him? How can the ſame righteous Spirit and Life (revealed in the members, as was in the head) bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> live and act after the ſame manner in the members, as it did in the head? (O that men were turned to that, which would give them the certain knowledge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96898:3"/>
and ſenſible experience of this!) Now this is exceeding comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and precious to them that are in the true travel towards it: much more to them that enjoy it.</p>
            <p>This is the ſum of all, even to know and experience what is to be brought down into death, and kept in death, what to be brought up out of the grave, to live to God and reign in his dominion, and what to be kept in ſubjection and obedience to him who is to reign. Now to experience it thus done in the heart; the Fleſh brought down, the Seed of Life raiſed, and the Soul ſubject to the pure heavenly Power, whoſe right it is to reign in the heart in and by the Seed, this is a bleſſed ſtate indeed. For here the work is done: here the Throne of God is exalted, and his King reigns in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace, and all his Enemies are under his feet; and this Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> this redeemed one may wear the white Robe, and ſerve God in righteouſneſs and holineſs without fear of his Enemies (keeping in and to the Covenant, which miniſters Life and Power abundantly) all the dayes of his life. For that was to be the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate of the outward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> keeping to God in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant: and it is to be the inward ſtate of the inward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> keeping to God in the inward Covenant, which is a pure Covenant of Life and Peace, of all inward and ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigs and mercies in Chriſt, wherewith the Souls are bleſſed that are obedient to God, and walk humbly with him in this Covenant. And I beſeech you to conſider (O tender people, who are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved becauſe of ſin and corruption in your hearts, and would fain witneſs victory and dominion over it, in the Name and Strength of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) Whom did that Propheſie of <hi>Zachary (Luke</hi> 1.71, 72, 74, 75.) concern? What was that holy Covenant? who were to be ſo redeemed? who were the <hi>Iſrael</hi> that was to inherit this promiſe? All the Promiſes are yea and amen in Chriſt to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Why ſhould not the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God hope to enjoy this? even ſo to be acquainted with Gods holy Spirit and to wait upon him, that they may witneſs it granted to them, that they being delivered out of the hands of their Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him (whoſe eyes are piercing, and can behold no iniquity) all the dayes of their lives? Surely they who witneſs that promiſe (mentioned <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8) fulfilled to them, cannot fall ſhort of this. And truly, the Children
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96898:4"/>
of the new Covenant can never come throughly to live to God, till they witneſs the inward circumciſion of the heart, ſo as to love the Lord with all the heart and ſoul, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. Now, where it is ſo, the Devil or Luſt can find no place of entrance: and how then ſhould they be able to ſow their Seed and bring forth ſin? Out of the evil heart proceeds all evil: but out of that heart which is throughly circumciſed, to love the Lord God wholly, evil cannot proceed. If Luſt be not conceived, it cannot bring forth Sin: and where the womb, which conceived it, is kept dry and barren, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive again. And is not this the Promiſe of the Goſpel, that the womb, which was once barren, ſhall be very fruitfull and bear abundantly; but the other grow feeble, and be able to bear no more? O that people had experience of Gods power, and did believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in! what ſhould ſtand in the way of it? It was <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin of old, when they looked at their Enemies, and ſaw their footing and ſtrength in the Land which God had promiſed to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed for an Inheritance, they could not believe that they could be overcome. O take heed of the ſame unbelief now.</p>

He muſt not reſt in the deſcription of things; but feel and know, receive and walk in the <hi>thing,</hi> which by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord hath been often formerly and is ſtill deſcribed, in what words and by what means the Spirit pleaſeth. But to receive all the deſcriptions of him that were formerly given forth, or all the deſcriptions that are now given forth, that will not do: but the ſoul that will live by him, muſt receive him and feel the ingrafting into him, the holy Root, the living Word of Gods eternal Power, and muſt feel this Word ingrafted into his heart, ſo that there be a real becoming one in nature and ſpirit with him. And then he is truly in the Vine, in the Olive-tree, and partakes of the vertue and ſap thereof, he abiding therein and walking in the Spirit, Life and Power thereof.</p>
               <p>Now here a man walks not, nor cannot walk in the oldneſs of the Letter; but in the newneſs of the Spirit only. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his knowledge of the Scriptures, walked but in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Letter, before Chriſt was revealed in him. And thoſe in the Apoſtles dayes, who had got the form of godlineſs, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from and denied the power, they walked but in the oldneſs of the Letter. Yea, the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> (for the moſt part) and the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who had received the right order and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the true deſcriptions of things, and thought they were full and rich and wanted nothing, they walked but according to the oldneſs of the Letter, and not in the newneſs and power of the Spirit of Life. But alas, how far are many (who pretend to Chriſt in this day) from this ſtate! who never came ſo far as to walk in the oldneſs of the Letter, from a true underſtanding thereof; but have only learned and continued to walk in the oldneſs of their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and conceivings upon the Letter.</p>
               <p>Can theſe, in this ſtate, poſſibly underſtand Truth, or know the inward ſpiritual, precious appearances thereof, either in their own hearts or others? Surely no. Why ſo? Why this is the reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the meaſure the appearances of Truth (either in themſelves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96898:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or others) by their own old apprehenſions and conceivings upon Scriptures concerning Truth, which is not the proper meaſure of it. Now all ſuch are yet in darkneſs, let them pretend what they will, and grow never ſo high in knowledg, exerciſes and experiences after this manner: and ſo the beſt, zealouſeſt and moſt knowing of them in this ſtate, are but blind leaders of the blind, and (thus going on) ſhall moſt certainly fall into the Ditch of perdition. O that men could feel that which makes rightly ſenſible, and might lay it to heart! For no man can confeſs Chriſt (how then can he receive him and walk in him?) but by the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>And he that knoweth not the Spirit rightly, knoweth not Chriſt rightly: and he that doth not know him rightly, doth not confeſs him rightly: and none can know him rightly, but by the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father inwardly. The myſtery muſt be opened within, or there is no true knowing. The myſtery of deceit is diſcovered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and the myſtery of Life is diſcovered within alſo. And though the heart of man (in the unregenerate eſtate) is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked, and no man of himſelf can ſearch or know it: yet that is not the ſtate of the true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> whom God hath cleanſed, and taught to deny themſelves daily; but they have boldneſs before that God who hath ſearched them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from them the iniquities which he found therein. Yea, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever witneſſeth Chriſt revealed within, ſhall find him revealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for this very end, to deſtroy the works of the Devil there: and he is a powerfull Saviour of the Soul from ſin, and a powerfull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of the works of the Devil within.</p>
               <p>Now concerning reading the Scriptures, mind this. It is ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when they read <hi>Moſes</hi> (or in reading the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the vail was upon their heart, which vail is done away in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14, 15. O conſider ſeriouſly, is the vail done away from thee? Doſt thou read the Scriptures with the unvailed eye? doſt thou read in the Anointing, in Chriſts Spirit, in the pure hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom of the divine Birth? It was promiſed of old, that God would take away the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail ſpread over all Nations. Doſt thou witneſs this Promiſe fulfilled to thee? Doſt thou know the difference between reading the Scriptures with the vail on thee, and with the vail off? Are the Scriptures opened and unlocked to thee by the Key of <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96898:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo that thou readeſt and underſtandeſt them in the Light and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Gods holy Spirit; or is thy own underſtanding and will at work of it ſelf, in ſearching into the Scriptures? If the wrong birth, the wrong wiſdom, the wrong underſtanding be at work; it can gather but that which will feed and ſtrengthen it ſelf: and if thou beeſt not in Chriſt, and doſt not read in Chriſt, the vail is not taken away from thee: (for the vail is only done away in him:) but thou readeſt and walkeſt in the oldneſs of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions upon the Letter, and not in the newneſs of the Spirit; and ſo knoweſt neither the Scriptures nor the Power of God, what ever thou profeſſeſt to men, or dreameſt concernning thy ſelf. For it is no other indeed: Thy knowledge, thy apprehenſions, thy faith, thy hope, thy peace, thy joy (being out of the compaſs of the pure living Truth, in which the Subſtance, the vertue, the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of all is compriſed and comprehended for ever) are but as ſo many dreams.</p>
               <p>O that men that are any whit tender, and have any ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in them towards the Lord, could read that one Scripture (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 43.3, 4.) ſenſibly and experimentally. <hi>O ſend out thy Light and thy Truth; let them lead me, let them bring we unto thy holy Hill and to thy Tabernacles.</hi> (what, did not <hi>David</hi> know how to go to the Hill and Tabernacles of God, without a particular ſending forth of Light and Truth from God to lead him thither?) Then may men go unto the Altar of God, unto God their exceeding joy, and witneſs his Hill and Houſe their dwelling-place, when God by his Light and Truth, ſend forth from him into them, leads them thither.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures are words, whoſe chief end, drift and ſervice is, to bring men to the Word from which the Scriptures came. And when men are there; then they are in the Life of the Scriptures, and witneſs the fulfilling of the Scriptures, even the executing of the righteous judgments of God upon that ſpirit, mind and nature in them, which is contrary to his image; and the fulfilling of the Promiſes and ſure Mercies, which belong to Chriſt the Seed, and to them who are gathered into, and abide in Chriſt the Seed. Here's the Covenant, the new Covenant. That which is ſaid, or thoſe things which are ſaid concerning the Covenant in the Scriptures, are but deſcriptions of the new Covenant:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96898:6"/>
but Chriſt within, the Hope of glory, the Spirit within, the Fear within, the Power of Life within, breaking down and reigning over the power of ſin and death (ſo that the Lord is ſerved in the dominion and power of his own Life, in righteouſneſs and holineſs before him, out of the fear of ſin and death, all the dayes of our lives; ſo that captivity can lead captive nor break the Souls peace no more, nay not ſo much as make afraid thoſe, that keep their Habitation on Gods holy Mountain) Here is the Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: the ſtrength and vertue whereof is witneſſed in the Soul, as the Soul feels the power of Life revealed in it, and is made ſubject by the power to Chriſt who reigns in righteouſneſs, love, mercy and peace, in the hearts of thoſe whom he redeems out of the earthly nature and ſpirit, up to the Mind and Spirit of his Father. And here the Pſalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, the pure Songs, (the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Song of the Lamb) are ſung to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, to the Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which never were ſung, nor can be ſung in any part of <hi>Babylon:</hi> but all thoſe Songs are but Dreams of the night, which will be turned into howling and bitter lamentation, when the Whore (that which hath whored from God, and is not in the Wiſdom of his Spirit, what ever ſhe may pretend) is ſtripped, and the nakedneſs of her Profeſſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (with all her Duties and Ordinances, as ſhe calls them) made manifeſt.</p>

               <p>IF the Goſpel be not a Miniſtration of Words or Letter; but of Spirit, Life and Power; and if it was the intent of God, that men ſhould not ſtick in Words or Teſtimonies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing, but come to the thing it ſelf, and live in the Sons Life and Power, and feel the Son living in them: Then they are greatly miſtaken, who think to gather a Rule to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the Teſtimonies and Declarations of things in the Scriptures, and do not wait upon the Lord to receive the Spirit it ſelf to become their Rule, Guide and Way. For theſe are all, one. The Truth is the Way. The Truth, which lives and abides in the heart (where it is received and entertained) is the Way: the Rule
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96898:6"/>
is the Guide. For God is <hi>one.</hi> There are many names, but the thing is <hi>one.</hi> The Life, the Power, the Wiſdom in the Father, Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>is all one</hi>: yea they themſelves are <hi>one,</hi> perfectly <hi>one,</hi> not at all divided or ſeparated; but where the Father is, the Son is; and where the Son is, the Spirit is; and where the Spirit is, there is both the Father and the Son, who tabernacle in man in the day of the Goſpel. And where theſe are, <hi>there</hi> that is which is to be preferred before all words, which was afore them, and is in Nature, Spirit and Glory above them. He that hath the Son, hath Life, even the Life Eternal, which the words teſtifie of. He that hath the Son, hath him which is true: and he that is in the Son, is in him that is true; and abiding there, cannot be deceived: but he that is not there, is deceived, let him apprehend and gather out of the Scriptures what he can. O how is God glorified, and how is Redemption and real Salvation of the Soul witneſſed in this diſpiſed Diſpenſation of Truth, which God hath held forth in theſe latter dayes! Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, who hath hid this pure Diſpenſation of Life from the eye of the prudent, worldly wiſe part in every man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it only to the babiſh ſimplicity which is of his Son, and which lives in him and by him.</p>

               <head>Concerning Chriſts being manifeſted without, and his being alſo manifeſted within, and how both are owned by them that know the Truth.</head>
               <p>IT is objected againſt us, who are called <hi>Quakers, That we deny Chriſt (and look not to be ſaved by him) as he was manifeſted without us, but look only to be ſaved by a Chriſt in us.</hi> To which this is in my heart to anſwer to ſuch as ſingly deſire ſatisfaction therein.</p>
               <p>We do indeed expect to be ſaved (yea and not only ſo, but do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in our ſeveral meaſures witneſs Salvation) by the revelation and operation of the Life of Chriſt within us; yet not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to what he did without us. For all that he did in that Body of Fleſh, was of the Father, and had its place and ſervice in the Will and according to the Counſel of the Father. But the knowledg and belief of that, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, hath been very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96898:7"/>
much held in the unrighteouſneſs, and in the ſeparation from the inward work of the Power and Life of Chriſt in the heart: which, as ſo held, cannot ſave any. But whoever feels the Light and Life of Chriſt revealed in him, and comes into union with God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through; he feels the work of Regeneration, of Sanctification, of Juſtification, of Life and Redemption; and ſo comes to reap bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit inwardly, and to partake of the bleſſed fruits of all that Chriſt did outwardly. Yea, he that is thus one with Chriſt in the Spirit, cannot exclude himſelf, nor is excluded by God from the advantage of any thing, nor every thing Chriſt did in that Body of Fleſh.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the main thing, to witneſs Salvation wrought out in the heart: to witneſs the eternal Power and Arm of the Lord, laying hold on the Soul to ſave it; and not only laying hold on it to ſave it, but to witneſs the working out and the effecting of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as really in the Subſtance, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did in the ſhadow. For as they witneſſed <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> outwardly: ſo the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> (the inward <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> the ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelite</hi>) is to witneſs that which is the Subſtance of theſe, even the Son of God revealed inwardly. Now they were not ſaved outwardly by a bare outward believing, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were ſent of God to ſave them: but by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them, in faith and obedience to what from God they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So to the inward <hi>Iſrael</hi> Chriſt is given for a Leader and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who appears to the diſtreſſed, embondaged Soul in <hi>Egypt,</hi> brings out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo leads on towards the good Land and into it. Now, as the Soul follows; as the Soul believes in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and obeys his voice in the holy pure Covenant of Life; ſo he works out the Redemption thereof. But as unbelief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience gets up, and the heart is heardened at any time againſt his Voice and Counſel, and the ear open to the temptations of the Enemy; the Redemption thereby goes backward, and the diſtreſs and captivity returns again. This is witneſſed, known and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by every true Traveller towards <hi>Sion.</hi> therefore the main thing requiſite, is to abide in the ſence of the Redeemers Power, as alſo in waiting for his motions and appearances, and in the Faith and Obedience thereof. For ſin gathers ſtrength and is brought forth, by letting in and giving way to the motions thereof: and ſo alſo Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is brought forth and getteth ground in the mind, by hearkening and giving
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96898:7"/>
up to the ſtirrings and movings of Gods holy Spirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of great neceſſity to every true Traveller, to come to a right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> underſtanding and diſtinguiſhing of theſe: and then that the heart be kept with all diligence, becauſe out of it are the iſſues both of life and death. And moſt happy is he, who knows the iſſues of death ſtopped, and the iſſues of Life opened, and whoſe ſpirit is naked and open before the Lord, for Life to ſpring up in him and iſſue forth through him at its pleaſure. O it is a precious ſtate to witneſs Captivity let Captive by Life, and the power of Life reigning over it. And truly, there is as real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance witneſſed inwardly, by thoſe that wait upon the Lord and are faithfull to the leadings of his holy Spirit, as ever there was by the <hi>Jews</hi> outwardly, in their faithfull following <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>: and Chriſt is as truly an Healer of his People, in this miniſtration of Life to them by his holy Spirit, as ever he was an Healer of Perſons outwardly in the dayes of his Fleſh. That (with the other Miracles which he wrought then) was but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of what he would work and perform inwardly in the day of his Spirit and holy Power: and ſhall he or can he (to thoſe that faithfully wait upon him) fall ſhort in the one, of what he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out in the other? Nay ſurely, it was the intent of his heart, and he will not fail to perform it, to ſave to the very utmoſt all that come to God by him and abide in his holy, pure, righteous, living Covenant. Here is the skill of Chriſtianity, to abide in him: and here the living Vertue and pure Power is felt, which overcometh all, but nothing can overcome it; but Victory, Dominion, Glory, Majeſty and Power is ſung unto him, who is King of Saints, who reigns in righteouſneſs, and who eſtabliſheth Peace and Truth within his Borders.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How may the Principle of Truth be diſcerned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By its piercing, quickning nature, which diſcovereth it ſelf in its appearances and operations. For it appears and works, not like mans reaſon, or like motions of his mind which he takes into his underſtanding part: but it appears and works livingly, powerfully and effectually in the heart.</p>
               <p>Mans reaſon is corrupt, dark, impure, ſince the fall; and in the hand and under the power of the wicked one. Its nature is to hide and cover ſin, not to diſcover it. Now the Light of the Law, which diſcovers ſin, ariſeth not hence. Who can bring the clean, pure Light of the Law, out of the unclean, impure reaſon of man? The Light indeed may ſhine in the Darkneſs: but it is no part of it, but of another nature and deſcent. It is from Gods Spirit, and given to man in his love unto him, to lead him out of his dark wayes and ſpirit, into the pure Spirit and Way of Holineſs. For the Light which diſcovers ſin, is all holy and pure, like the Fountain from whence it comes. Now a man that is acquainted both with reaſon and with this Light, he can diſtinguiſh the nature and operations of both. For there is a great difference between Truth held in the reaſoning part, and Truth held in its own Principle. It is very powerfull in the one: it effecteth little in the other. In the pure quicknings of Life this diſtinction is perceived and alſo held. Therefore our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is to all men, to retire from all mortality, that they may come to feel the Spring of Life in themſelves (and ſomething ſpringing therefrom into them to quicken them) and to wait to have their underſtandings opened and kept open by that; that ſo they may receive, retain, and not again loſe the capacity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the things of Gods King<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96898:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſtands in the alienation from God. It croſſeth his ſpirit, his thoughts, his deſires, his knowledge, his reaſon, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; even all that is of himſelf. He muſt therefore conſult with none of theſe, but prefer the little, pure Demonſtration of the Light of Chriſts Spirit above all theſe, and ſtand in the parting with and loſs of them all for ever. O this is an hard ſaying, who can bear it? Surely none but thoſe that are taught and learn of the Father, can thus come to give up to and follow the Light of the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting</hi> (or reſtoring) <hi>the Soul (Pſal.</hi> 19.7.) What Law was this, or what Law is this? Was it the Law of works in the hand of <hi>Moſes?</hi> or is it the Law of Faith in the hand of Chriſt? Doth not Chriſt enlighten eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that cometh into the World? Would not God have all men to be ſaved? and doth he not give to all, a proportion of the true Light whereby they may be ſaved? And is it not the property of this Light to convert to God? Can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this and be united to this, and it not change his nature? ſo that he muſt needs have a new nature, and from that new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do that naturally, which the <hi>Jews</hi> by all their endeavours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, could never do.</p>
               <p>Can any thing convert fallen man to God, but Chriſt? hath any thing power to convert to God, but his pure Law of Life? Can Chriſt and his Light be ſeparated? Can any man receive his Light and be united thereto, and not receive him? O that mens hearts and underſtandings were opened by the Spirit and Power of the Lord! For this is a direct riddle to all men, who have not Gods Heifer to Plow with, to underſtand it by. And ſo for want of a true underſtanding, it is deſpiſed and rejected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Builders: but with us it is elect and precious, choſen of God, and precious in the eye of our Souls.</p>
               <p>Now this doth not exclude or make void any thing, that Chriſt did in his Body of Fleſh here on Earth, or that he doth in Heaven for his: but this brings unto a Right, and into a Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of his Purchaſe. For all that are in the Darkneſs, and walk in the Darkneſs, have nothing to do with Chriſt in truth and reallity, what ever they may profeſs, and what hopes ſoever they may feed themſelves with: but all that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96898:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are in any meaſure of his Light, and walk therein; they are ſo far of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have a right to and ſhare in all that he did in and from the ſame Light and Spirit.</p>
               <p>And this I dare poſitively hold forth as a ſtanding Truth, which hath been ſealed unto me by conſtant experience; That no man can fall in with and obey the Light wherewith he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, but he muſt deny himſelf, and take up a croſs to his own wiſdom and will, which Croſs is the Croſs of Chriſt, which is the Power of God to the Salvation of the Soul. And he that takes it up daily and waits upon the Lord therein, ſhall witneſs the Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the redeemption of his Soul: yea then he ſhall be able in true underſtanding to ſay, This is Light indeed, Life indeed, Power indeed. That powerfull Arm which hath ſaved me from Sin, and breaks the Snares, Devices and Strength of the Enemy before me (delivering me daily when none elſe can, and when my own ſtrength and wiſdom is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) I cannot but call Chriſt, the living Power and Wiſdom of God revealed in me, who will not give his glory to another. For he is the Lord God of pure Power and Life for evermore; and beſide him there is no ſuch Saviour. Yea, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord for ever, the dayes of mourning after Salvation are over with many, and the dayes of reaping and enjoying Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are come, which ſhall endure with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God for evermore, Amen</p>
