            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur importunities have at last prevail'd, and since abler Pens have
hitherto declin'd to espouse the quarrel, I will for once force my
own inclination to silence and reservedness, and briefly give you
my thoughts on that unlucky <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> call'd, <hi>A Defence of the</hi>
Charter <hi>and Municipal Rights of</hi> London.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author,</hi> I find, is a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the <hi>long Robe,</hi> a person so well known
of late for his unweary'd diligence, and extraordinary faculty in scribling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that I need not give you any other <hi>Character</hi> of him, but that some three
years ago he writ a <hi>Book</hi> in vindication of <hi>the Bishops Right of Judicature in
Parliament;</hi> and for this piece of service expected no less than to be made
<hi>Lord-Chief-Baron</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But missing of that Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he grows peevish and angry with the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> and to be even
with both, and perhaps to appease his angry <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Separation</hi> for
his former <hi>Mercenary</hi> undertaking, he adds a <hi>Baboons Tail</hi> to his <hi>Picture,</hi> a
<hi>Postscript</hi> to his <hi>Book,</hi> the most virulent and malicious, that has yet escap'd
the hands of <hi>Justice.</hi> Ever since, he has continu'd firm to the <hi>Cause,</hi> laid
aside his useless <hi>Law,</hi> and zealously imploy'd his <hi>better Talent</hi> against the
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Faction;</hi> and this about the <hi>Charter</hi> is the
last effort of that wise <hi>Head-piece,</hi> which he has stuff'd with such a miscellany
of wild <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> interwoven with some impertinent <hi>Truths,</hi> that 'tis far
more difficult to digest them into method, than to answer and confute them.</p>
            <p>First, to lay a solid foundation for his great design, he tells us, <hi>That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
as well as Republicks, have often erected Municipal Cities, and by their</hi>
Charters <hi>bestow'd upon them several</hi> Franchises <hi>and</hi> Priviledges, <hi>as to choose
their own</hi> Magistrates, <hi>and governby their own</hi> Laws, <hi>while subservient to the</hi>
publick Laws <hi>of the</hi> Sovereign Authority, pag. 1. This is certainly very true;
but how far it makes for the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> against the <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi>
is a <hi>Mystery</hi> not to be comprehended by every vulgar capacity: for 'tis no
less plain in <hi>History,</hi> that not only <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> as he mentions, but
just and lawful <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> have divers times suppress'd such <hi>Municipal Cities,</hi>
for good and necessary causes, as for being disloyal to their <hi>Prince,</hi> or factious
and seditious against the <hi>Government;</hi> and then the main <hi>Question</hi> will be,
How far the City of <hi>London</hi> has of late been guilty of such Crimes, as by
Law deserve the like Punishment?</p>
            <p>This, in short, is the plain state of the <hi>Question;</hi> for 'tis most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to think, that any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Republick</hi> ever gave their <hi>Municipal Cities</hi> any
such <hi>Liberties</hi> or <hi>Immunities,</hi> as were not forfeitable upon their abusing the
Power they receiv'd; when otherwise, neither <hi>Prince</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> cou'd be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42140:3"/>
secure from the insolence of such <hi>uncontroulable Citizens,</hi> without a standing
Army to keep them in awe. But our <hi>Gentleman,</hi> it seems, is unwilling to
touch upon this <hi>critical point</hi> of speculation; and as the <hi>Defence of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
is the least part of his <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> so now he runs quite from the purpose,
to tell the <hi>King</hi> like a dutiful Subject, He may, if He please, take His <hi>Quietus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>est,</hi>
and let His people govern themselves; <hi>For it is impossible</hi> (saith he) <hi>that
mankind should miscarry in their own hands,</hi> pag. 2. Now, since they have
often miscarry'd in the hands of <hi>Princes,</hi> is it not more expedient for the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good,</hi> if this <hi>Maxim</hi> will hold, that the <hi>Prince</hi> shou'd mind his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
business, and not trouble himself with the <hi>Government,</hi> which the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
can do better without Him?</p>
            <p>This is Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s new <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> who out of pure love and
kindness to the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> chalks out a ready way for his <hi>Sovereign</hi> to ease
Himself of all the thorns and prickles of His <hi>Crown,</hi> and become a <hi>glorious
King</hi> like His Father; And therefore seems very angry, that the <hi>Court, (i. e.</hi>
the <hi>King)</hi> should be troubl'd with the <hi>Power</hi> of appointing <hi>Officers</hi> in any
<hi>City</hi> or <hi>Corporation</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> tho' it be found of absolute necessity
for the keeping His <hi>Crown</hi> upon His Head, and protecting His best Subjects
from a Band of <hi>Associators</hi> and <hi>Ignoramus-Juries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! <hi>But by this new form of Corporations, it will be in the power of a</hi> Popish
Successor <hi>to put the Government of all Corporated Towns in</hi> England <hi>into the
hands of</hi> Papists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p 5. And without it, I say, it will be no less in the <hi>power</hi> of
the <hi>Faction,</hi> to put the same <hi>Government</hi> into the hands of <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> What
a <hi>Bugbear</hi> is this <hi>Popish Successor!</hi> whose very Name turns the brains of a
<hi>Whig</hi> into a <hi>Magnifying-glass,</hi> that will transform <hi>Ants</hi> into <hi>Gyants,</hi> and <hi>Mole-hills</hi>
into <hi>Mountains!</hi> We have as good Laws as the wit of man can devise,
to secure us from the encroachments of <hi>Popery,</hi> and to disable <hi>Papists</hi> from
bearing any <hi>Office, Civil</hi> or <hi>Military,</hi> either in or out of <hi>Corporations:</hi> and
yet this <hi>Popish Successor,</hi> who possibly may never succeed, this great <hi>Goliah,</hi>
can break through all those Laws, and will certainly do it, to curry favour
with a <hi>handful</hi> of <hi>Papists,</hi> and make himself a <hi>Slave</hi> to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not all; <hi>For this mode</hi> (saith he) <hi>of incorporating Cities and Towns, doth</hi>
ipso facto <hi>change the Government; for that</hi> One <hi>of the</hi> Three States, <hi>an essential
part of the</hi> Government, <hi>which is made up of the</hi> Representatives of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>and ought to be chosen by the</hi> People, <hi>will by this means have five sixth
parts of such</hi> Representatives, <hi>upon the matter, of the</hi> Courts <hi>nomination, and
not of the</hi> Peoples <hi>choice;—and at the next turn we shall have a</hi> Parliament
<hi>of</hi> Papists <hi>and</hi> Red-coats, pag. 6. O <hi>profound Politician!</hi> has not our <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
been <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Monarchical</hi> from the beginning? how then can the
<hi>House of Commons,</hi> in comparison but a late Institution, necessary not for the
<hi>Being,</hi> but for the <hi>Well-being</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> be an <hi>Essential part</hi> of it? Or
how can any <hi>Rul<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> be term'd a <hi>Monarch,</hi> that has 500 <hi>Demagogues</hi> Joynt-Governours
with Him? These, and such other <hi>Republican Maxims,</hi> have
been in a great measure the main foundation of all the miseries and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42140:3"/>
we suffer'd under the late <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Rump-Parliament;</hi> and after
our sad experience of those <hi>Tragical</hi> times, surely we have reason to think,
that none but such as wou'd bring us back to the same calamities, and sing
the second part to the same Tune, would now endeavour to assert or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them: yet they are so very familiar to our <hi>Irish Chief-Baron,</hi> that there
is hardly a page in most of his <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> but has a strong tincture of them.
In his <hi>great and weighty Considerations considered,</hi> he says, <hi>The Parliament derive
Their Authority from the same Original the King derives His<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The</hi> King <hi>hath
not His Power from</hi> Them, <hi>nor</hi> They <hi>theirs from the</hi> King: <hi>They</hi> Both <hi>derive
their Authority from the</hi> consent of the People, <hi>either</hi> tacit <hi>or</hi> express, <hi>in
the first institution of the</hi> Government, <hi>or in the subsequent alterations of it,</hi>
pag. 16. Is not this a rare <hi>Assertor</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that makes <hi>both Houses</hi>
thus <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with the <hi>Prince,</hi> and all the Three <hi>subordinate</hi> to the <hi>People;</hi>
turns the <hi>Governed</hi> into <hi>Govornours,</hi> and leaves to the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> only,
but to His Subjects the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion?</hi> The Law tells us, <hi>That all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Jurisdiction, Spiritual and Temporal, is derived from the</hi> King,
1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. c. 2. §. 3. And <hi>Plowden,</hi> as great a <hi>Lawyer</hi> perhaps as Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi>
says, <hi>That the</hi> King <hi>has the</hi> sole Government <hi>of His Subjects,</hi> fol. 234, <hi>a.</hi>
How then can Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> make the <hi>People</hi> the Original of Power, since all
is derived from the <hi>Prince?</hi> or how can <hi>either</hi> or <hi>both Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>
pretend of themselves to have any share in the <hi>Government,</hi> which is wholly
in the <hi>King?</hi> or claim any <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> over the <hi>People,</hi> but as
deriv'd from the <hi>Sovereign?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore explode these <hi>Republican Notions,</hi> that have cost us so
dear, and cannot in the least avail either <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> but will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
make the <hi>Prince</hi> jealous of their proceedings, who can better hear the
<hi>complaints</hi> and <hi>humble Petitions</hi> of his <hi>dutiful Subjects,</hi> the
constant<note n="*" place="margin">In making our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws, <hi>(saith the great Antiquary Mr</hi> Selden) the <hi>Commons</hi> did <hi>petere,</hi> the <hi>Lords assentire,</hi> &amp; the <hi>King concludere:</hi> in his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in Parliament,</hi> pag. 132.</note> stile of our ancient <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> than the
<hi>Imperious</hi> dictates of his <hi>fellow-Governours;</hi> for, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
confirms what <hi>Lucan</hi> long since has told us,
<q>Nulla fides Regni sociis, omnis<expan>

            </p>
            <p>But how shou'd this new form of <hi>Corporations</hi> make their
<hi>Representatives</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> not of the Peoples choice,
but of the Courts nomination, is not very intellig<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble
in my apprehension: since every <hi>Cobler</hi> can tell, the <hi>Free-men</hi> of <hi>Corporations,</hi>
and not their <hi>Officers,</hi> have the sole power of electing their <hi>Representatives.</hi>
Where then is the danger of a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Red-coats,</hi> (tho'
there had been no Law to disable the former from sitting in the House,
till they forswear themselves, or abjure their principles) unless the
major part of the <hi>Free-men</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which I hope shall never happen,
be suppos'd to embrace the <hi>Popish Religion?</hi> We have seen, to our cost and to
our shame, a <hi>pretended Parliament</hi> of <hi>Red-coats</hi> and <hi>Round-heads,</hi> which like
the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Locusts devour'd all the fruit of the Land, and turn'd <hi>Europes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42140:4"/>
Paradise</hi> into a <hi>Field of Blood;</hi> and this blessing we owe to Mr. <hi>Hunt's</hi>
poor harmless <hi>Dissenters;</hi> which I hope will make us so wise for the future,
as never to give them the like opportunities.</p>
            <p>It were endless to follow this <hi>lawless Scribler</hi> through every page and
paragraph, or severally to take notice of all his incoherences, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
digressions. To come therefore close to the business of the <hi>Charter,</hi> we
must turn over many pages, and step from the beginning almost to the end of
his <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> to find out something that may seem to the purpose. Three
points he offers at last in defence of the <hi>Charter,</hi> which he says to the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,
he comes to defend against theirs,</hi> and he might add as well, his own,
<hi>reason and understanding,</hi> p. 31. For if he has a <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> or sense left,
he knows that of these points the first is impertinent to what he undertakes,
and the rest but <hi>fallacious cavillings,</hi> to impose upon the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and make
them obstinate to their cost.</p>
            <p>First, he says, <hi>That the</hi> Dissenters, <hi>tho' Excommunicate, have a vote in the
Election of their Officers.</hi> 2ly. <hi>That the</hi> Common-Council <hi>cannot destroy or
surrender the</hi> Charter. 3ly. <hi>That the Sherivalties of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Middlesex
<hi>are in the</hi> City <hi>by</hi> Common <hi>or</hi> Statute-Law; <hi>and consequently not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd,
but by</hi> Act of Parliament, <hi>tho' with the consent of every individual</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen,
p. 32. For the first, he takes a world of pains to prove, that the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi>
of <hi>Dissenters</hi> does not render them uncapable of giving their
<hi>Vote</hi> in the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>City-Officers.</hi> And what then? Is the <hi>Charter</hi> never
to be forfeited, while the <hi>Dissenters</hi> have a <hi>Vote</hi> or <hi>Suffrage</hi> in such <hi>Elections?</hi>
or are they so numerous in the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> as to out-vote the <hi>Members</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> are their tender consciences still so plyable, as
to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in their <hi>Parish-Church</hi> to serve a turn, and run to a
<hi>Conventicle</hi> all the year after? to take <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Oaths</hi> to get into <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,</hi>
and break all with a breath to promote the <hi>Good Old Cause?</hi> nay,
venture to forfeit their <hi>Ears</hi> to the <hi>Pillory,</hi> and their <hi>Souls</hi> to the <hi>Devil,</hi> to
help off an active <hi>Brother</hi> catch'd by the <hi>Tongue?</hi> These are the <hi>harmless
Clients</hi> of our <hi>Irish-Chief-Baron,</hi> of whom we may well say with the <hi>Poet,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Mille adde catenas,</l>
                  <l>Effugiet tamen hac sceleratus vincula <hi>Proteus.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>These, I mean, not the mis-led or seduc'd, but the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Ring-leaders</hi>
of the <hi>Faction,</hi> who always <hi>hold with the Hare, and run with the Hound,</hi> and
make <hi>conscience</hi> of nothing but <hi>Conformity,</hi> and yet <hi>conform</hi> for <hi>Preferment.</hi>
To these their deluded followers owe all the <hi>severities</hi> of late used against
them, and the <hi>City</hi> this so-much-talk'd-of <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> with all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
consequences, which Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> says are like to attend it: there being no
other way to rescue the <hi>Government</hi> out of their hands, or secure <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Crown and Dignity,</hi> and the <hi>Lives</hi> of his <hi>good Subjects,</hi> from <hi>pack'd Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and <hi>perjur'd Ignoramus's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>they have</hi> (says our Lawyer) <hi>an utter abhorrence against</hi> Popery <hi>and
the</hi> Plot, <hi>and joyn forwardly and zealously against it,</hi> p. 16. 'Tis true, they make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42140:4"/>
a great noise and bussle about that <hi>horrid Conspiracy,</hi> but in reality they have
done more than the <hi>Papists</hi> were able to do, to stifle and confound it.
They attaqu'd the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whilst in the heat of prosecuting the
<hi>Conspirators,</hi> and labour'd under the <hi>Umbrage</hi> of the <hi>Popish-Plot,</hi> to carry on
another of their own, to subvert the establish'd <hi>Government,</hi> and insensibly to
decoy us into <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and their darling <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> as the <hi>Tryal</hi> and
<hi>Condemnation</hi> of their <hi>Proto-Martyr Colledge;</hi> their <hi>Green-ribbon-Clubs,</hi> and
<hi>Ignoramus-Juries;</hi> their <hi>Vox Patriae's,</hi> and <hi>Vox Populi's;</hi> their <hi>Appeal from the
Countrey to the City;</hi> the <hi>Speech</hi> of their <hi>Noble Peer;</hi> and in short, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of all their <hi>Seditious Libels,</hi> back'd with the <hi>Depositions</hi> of several
<hi>Witnesses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> do as plainly demonstrate, as <hi>Coleman's Letters</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> prove
the wicked designs of the <hi>Papists.</hi> They inveigl'd some of the principal
<hi>Discoverers</hi> of the <hi>Popish-Plot</hi> to espouse their <hi>Party,</hi> and vilifie the <hi>Church;</hi>
which frightn'd many a <hi>Loyal Gentleman,</hi> that cou'd not forget the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the late times, where <hi>Popery</hi> was the <hi>First,</hi> but <hi>Monarchy</hi> the <hi>Last
Act</hi> of the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and made them suspect these same persons, now their
hand was in, might at last be wrought upon, to turn against the obedient
Sons of the Church, whom they had already stigmatiz'd with the ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Names of <hi>Tories, Masqueraders,</hi> and <hi>Church-Papists.</hi> In short, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
so many shams and silly stories, as made the very truth questionable;
and when they saw the <hi>English Plot</hi> was not like to embroil the Nation,
they invited a number of profligate wretches out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> gave them
<hi>Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> in abundance, and took so much pains to set up these <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manageable
Tools,</hi> that in fine they dash'd both <hi>Plots</hi> to pieces, one against
the other.</p>
            <p>Are we not then beholding to our <hi>true-blew-Protestants,</hi> after all these
fine exploits, for their abhorrence against <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>Plot,</hi> and to Mr;
<hi>Hunt,</hi> for his <hi>zealous vindication</hi> of their Proceedings? He was formerly
suspected to be a man of <hi>no Religion;</hi> but now, like a generous <hi>Soul,</hi> he owns
his Party in their greatest distress, and openly declares against the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Betrayers</hi> of <hi>God's Cause,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples Liberties. Some of
little understanding among you</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thus behave your selves, are
excusable, as misguided by some of your</hi> Ministers, <hi>who are in good earnest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Preferments, Dignities and Benefices for themselves, by offering and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our</hi> Church <hi>to a voluntary</hi> Martyrdom, p. 12. I need not comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this scurrilous <hi>Reflection,</hi> 'tis enough to say, 'tis the product of Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s
own Brains, who, according to his Fee, tho' against his conscience, spoke for
his Clyents; for <hi>Lawyers,</hi> he tells us, (and who more fit to know?) <hi>have</hi>
Opinions <hi>to sell at any time, tho' they have not the least colour of</hi> Reason <hi>to
support them,</hi> p. 19. If this <hi>Confounder</hi> both of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> be thus for
fouling his own Nest, we need not wonder at his frequent snarlings at the
<hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Resolutions of our <hi>Reverend Clergy,</hi> or expect better u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from a man that openly sides with the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to his <hi>second</hi> point, which is so wild and so extravagant a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42140:5"/>
as deserves rather to be laugh'd at by men of sense, than to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
or confuted: since, besides several that have done it within these
two years past, there are not many <hi>Corporations</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> whose <hi>Charters</hi>
have not been surrendred by their <hi>Common-Council,</hi> without so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
their <hi>Common-halls;</hi> and yet were never question'd for it, as <hi>Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of their Trust, or of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he drives home the Nail in his <hi>3d.</hi> assertion, where he says, that the
<hi>Sherivalties</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> or the right of choosing their <hi>Sheriffs,</hi>
(the main point now in dispute, and what most concerns the <hi>King,</hi> after our
late experience, to have in His own disposal) cannot be parted with, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> tho' with the consent of every individual <hi>Citizen.</hi>
But sure the <hi>Gentleman</hi> is not in earnest; for I hope he will allow us, that
tho' alone they cannot, yet with the consent and approbation of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-hall,</hi>
or of every <hi>Citizen,</hi> the <hi>Common-Council</hi> may surrender the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
who then, the <hi>Charter</hi> being thus surrendred, has the power of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> when the <hi>Corporation,</hi> the <hi>City</hi> and the County is dissolv'd,
neither <hi>Mayor</hi> nor <hi>Alderman, Citizen</hi> nor <hi>Free man</hi> to found? The <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>
in general cannot choose them, for they have no right now to do it,
neither do they receive any new power by the <hi>surrender</hi> of the <hi>Charter;</hi>
and yet the <hi>Free-men</hi> cannot, when there is no such thing in being, no
more in <hi>London</hi> than in <hi>Westminster,</hi> or any other Dissolv'd Corporation.</p>
            <p>But to be short in a Case so plain, since the Gentleman requires an <hi>Act of
Parliament</hi> for displacing the <hi>Citizens</hi> Right of choosing their <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> here
is One ready to his hand, for taking away, upon their <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>misgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
all their <hi>Franchises</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and consequently this power of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Magistrates;</hi> an Act found by the prudence of
our Ancestors, so necessary for to maintain the publick Peace, and keep that
<hi>over-grown City</hi> within the bounds of duty, that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. tho' he sought
occasions to ingratiate himself with the People of <hi>London,</hi> the better to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Usurpation, yet cou'd not be wrought upon by their intreaties to
have any material part of it alter'd, much less annull'd or repeal'd. The

               <q>BEcause that the Errors, Defaults and Misprisions, which
be notoriously used in the City of <hi>London,</hi> for default of good
Governance of the Mayor, of the Sheriffs, and the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
cannot be enquired nor found by people of the same City:
it is ordained and established, That the said Mayor, Sheriffs and
Aldermen, which have the Governance of the same City, shall
cause to be redressed and correated the Defaults, Errors, and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisions
above-named, and the same duly punish from time to
time upon a certain pain; that is to say, at the first Default a
Thousand Marks to the King, and at the second Default two
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42140:5"/>
Thousand Marks, and at the third default, that the Franchise and
Liberty of the City be taken into the King's hand. And be it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to enquire upon them at St. <hi>Michael</hi> next coming, so that if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they do not cause to be made due redress, as afore is said, it shall
be enquired of their Defaults by Enquests of people of Foreign.
Counties; that is to say, of <hi>Kent, Essex, Sussex, Hertford, Buckingham,</hi>
and <hi>Berk,</hi> as well at the King's Suit, as others that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And if the Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen, be by such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
thereto assigned, Indiaed, they shall be caused to come by
due Process before the King's Justices, which shall be to the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
assigned out of the said City, before whom they shall have their.
Answer, as well to the King as to the Party. And if they put
them in Enquests, such Enquests shall be taken by Foreign
People, as afore is said. And if they be Attainsed, the said pain
shall incurr and be levied of the said Mayor, Sheriffs and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
for default of their Governance. And nevertheless, the
Plaintiffs shall recover the treble Damages against the said
Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen. And because that the Sheriffs
of <hi>London</hi> be Parties to this business, the Constable of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
or his Lieutenant, shall serve in the place of the Sheriffs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Writs, as well Originals of the <hi>Chancery</hi> as Judicials,
under the Seal of the Justices, to do thereof execution in the said
City. And Process shall be made by Attachment, and Distress,
and by Exigent, if need be: so that at the King's Suit the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
shall be awarded after the first <hi>Capias</hi> returned, and at the
third <hi>Capias</hi> returned at the Suit of the Party. And if the Mayor,
Sheriffs and Aldermen have Lands or Tenements out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Process shall be made against them by Attachments and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
in the same Counties where the Lands or Tenements be.
And that every of the said Mayors, Sheriffs and Aldermen,
which do appear before the said Justices, shall answer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for himself, as well at the peril of other which be absent, as
of himself. And this Ordinance shall be holden firm and stable,
notwithstanding any manner Franchise, Priviledges or Customs.
And this Ordinance shall extend to all Cities and Boroughs of
the Realm, where such Defaults or Misprisions be used, and not
duly corrected nor redressed: saving that the Enquests shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by Foreign people of the same County where such Cities or
Boroughs be. And that the pain of those of the said Boroughs
and Tolws, which shall be thereof Attainted, shall be judged by
the Discretion of the Justices, which shall be thereto assigned.</q>

This Act was a great Curb to the people of <hi>London,</hi> and kept them for
many years after, very <hi>obsequious</hi> and dutiful to their <hi>Sovereign;</hi> but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time, finding it was not duly put in execution, they began to forget
it at last, and wou'd now and then break out into some <hi>extravagance,</hi> which
afterwards cost them very dear. Finding therefore themselves very
uneasie under this restraint, tho' neither in <hi>Edward III.</hi> nor his Successor's
Reign they durst motion to have that Statute repeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, yet when the <hi>Vsurper
Henry IV.</hi> came to the Crown, they labour'd hard to get themselves rid of
it, but cou'd gain no more than the following Clause; which many in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who always think ill of the <hi>King</hi> and His Ministers, will think of no
great <hi>advantage</hi> to the <hi>Defence of the</hi> Charter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OUR Lord the king considering the good and lawful Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

Commonalty of the same City of <hi>London</hi> towards him,
and therefore willing to ease and mitigate the Penalty aforesaid,
by the assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the
Commons aforesaid, hath Ordained and Established, That the
Penalty aforesaid, as well of the Thousand Marks, and of the
two Thousand Marks, and of the seizure of the Franchise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in the said Statute, shall not be limited in a certainty, but
that the Penalties in this case be by the advice and discretion of
the Justices thereto assigned, as other Cities and Boroughs be
within the Realm; And that the Remnant of the same Statute,

            </p>
            <p>Now, I appeal to Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s own Judgment, provided he has so much
<hi>moral</hi> honesty, to speak nothing of his skill in the Laws, as will qualifie him
for an <hi>Irish Chief-Baron,</hi> Whether or no these two <hi>Statutes</hi> be not as plain
against the <hi>Charter,</hi> supposing the <hi>Mayor, Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> to have
been negligent in their duty, and <hi>a fortiori</hi> if they and the <hi>Common-Council</hi>
be found guilty of the Crimes laid to their charge, as <hi>Magna Charta</hi> or the
<hi>Petition of Right</hi> is for the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> of the Subject; For, that
'tis neither <hi>Treason</hi> nor <hi>Felony,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Subversion of the Government,</hi> but
Crimes of a far inferiour nature, that are meant by the Errors and Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors
mentioned in the said <hi>Acts,</hi> is apparent by another <hi>Statute</hi> made
some three years after, by the same King <hi>Edward III.</hi> where it is Enacted,
<q>
                  <hi>That the Mayor and Aldermen of</hi> London <hi>shall rule and redress the defaults
of Fishers, Butchers, and Poulters, and put the same in execution, upon
the pain late ordained touching the City of</hi> London, 31 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 10.</q> Now,
if the whole <hi>City,</hi> for a bare neglect of duty in their <hi>Officers,</hi> as for omitting
to punish the Misdemeanors of silly <hi>Trades-men,</hi> were by these <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III.</hi>

            <p>As for the aforesaid <hi>Clause</hi> of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. tho' intended for (as really it was)
a great favour to the <hi>City,</hi> that they shou'd not for every trisling fault be

than that sum now; yet if their Crimes had been found of a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
nature, striking at the very <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> we
may be sure the <hi>Justices,</hi> by vertue of this very <hi>Clause,</hi> wou'd have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
seiz'd their <hi>Charter,</hi> without bringing them to any further Tryal. So
that this <hi>Clause,</hi> tho' in small inferiour misdemeanors it be a great advantage
to the <hi>City,</hi> yet in Crimes of <hi>State,</hi> where the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Monarchy</hi> are
concern'd, 'tis no less an advantage to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> you have seen how well Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> has defended the <hi>Charter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the Power both of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and you will find him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as happy in the rest of his undertakings. I omit his impertinence on the

and his framing of <hi>Parallels</hi> where little or no similitude can be

him with such <hi>chymerical</hi> hopes of a <hi>Crown,</hi> as made him forget his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to his <hi>Princes</hi> will, and the positive command of his <hi>Natural</hi> Father;
<hi>Natural,</hi> I say, because in our <hi>Laws</hi> the <hi>Maxim</hi> is, <hi>Qui ex damnato coitu

him to aspire to <hi>Three Hereditary Kingdoms,</hi> or think to carry them tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Popular Applause,</hi> when nothing but the <hi>Sword</hi> can establish a crack'd
Title?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the best people of</hi> England (says this non-sensical <hi>Scribler) have no
other way left to shew their Loyalty to the</hi> King, <hi>and love to their</hi> Religion <hi>and</hi>
Government, <hi>in the long intervals of</hi> Parliament, <hi>than by</hi> Prosecuting <hi>His</hi>
Son, <hi>for the sake of the</hi> King, <hi>and</hi> his own Merit, <hi>with all the demonstrations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42140:7"/>
of the highest esteem,</hi> p. 28. They are certainly very hard put to it, if this
(not to PROSECUTE his silly <hi>Latinism)</hi> be the only shift they can make
to express their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> when Children can tell, they might, if they had any,
better shew it, by prostrating themselves at <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s feet, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their readiness to venture their Lives and Fortunes in defence of His
<hi>Sacred Person,</hi> and the <hi>Rights</hi> of His <hi>Crown,</hi> against all the attempts of the
<hi>Popish Plotters</hi> and <hi>Whiggish Associators.</hi> 'Tis true, some of the best Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>England</hi> have had, for the King's sake, and in some measure for his
own Merits, sufficient kindness for his <hi>Grace,</hi> and still wish him more <hi>Grace</hi>
and consideration, than to continue obstinately disobedient, contrary to
common <hi>Prudence,</hi> and to all the ties and obligations of <hi>Nature,</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi>
and of <hi>Gratitude:</hi> But as for Mr. <hi>Hunt's best People of</hi> England, tho' preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his <hi>only Friends,</hi> they have been upon all occasions his real <hi>Enemies,</hi>
made a <hi>Property</hi> and a <hi>Tool</hi> of him, to set him up, like another <hi>Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi>
in opposition to the <hi>Royal Line;</hi> and if that succeeded, to kick him
down again, as they did <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> to make room for Themselves
and their darling <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return from this digression, and examine what is left yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answer'd
of this idle <hi>Pamphlet:</hi> I find our <hi>Chief-Baron wou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d-be</hi> has stumbl'd
at last on those two famous <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Edward III</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">4 Ed. 3. 14. 36 Ed. 3. 10.</note> to prove,
that <hi>Parliaments must be held once every year; which</hi> (saith he)
<hi>is confirm'd by an Act of this King, call'd,</hi> the Trienial Act, p. 21.
But by his <hi>Lordships</hi> good leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these <hi>Statutes,</hi> if well consider'd, will be
found to have been made rather to oblige the <hi>Commons</hi> (who then grumbl'd
no less at the frequent calling, than the <hi>Factious</hi> do now at the long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Parliaments)</hi> to send their <hi>Representatives</hi> to the <hi>King's Great
Councel,</hi> than to bind the <hi>King</hi> to summon them when there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for their meeting; and therefore, to make the case more plain, the
conditional Clause, <hi>If need be,</hi> which may aptly refer to the whole period,
is expresly provided in the said <hi>Statutes.</hi> For to affirm, it was absolutely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
that a <hi>Parliament</hi> shou'd be held once every year, whether there was
any, or no need of their meeting, when the choosing of Members was so
troublesom, and their expences <hi>eundo morando &amp; ad propria redeundo</hi> so
chargeable to the people, besides the great Taxes they usually granted, is
altogether unreasonable. As for the <hi>Triennial Act</hi> of this
<note n="*" place="margin">16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Car. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>King,</hi> it makes more against than for his <hi>Lordships</hi> design;
since it requires but to have <hi>a Parliament once in three years,</hi> and not soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
without some extraordinary occasion; which, I doubt not, but <hi>His
Majesty,</hi> according to His late most Gracious <hi>Declaration,</hi> will see punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
observ'd, as He has been pleas'd to do in the whole course of His Reign.</p>
            <p>And the Statute of Provisors, 25 <hi>Ed</hi> 3. is no less impertinent to his
purpose; for tho' <hi>it be the Right of the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and that the Law
of the said Realm is such, that upon the mischiefs and damages which happen to
His Realm, the King ought, and is bound by Oath, with the accord of His
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42140:7"/>
People in Parliament, to make remedy and Law, in removing the mischiefs and
damages which thereof ensue:</hi> Yet if His People in <hi>Parliament</hi> prove peevish
and obstinate, and will not accept of <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s gracious <hi>Condescensions,</hi>
nor of the expedients by Him propos'd; who then is to be blam'd, the <hi>King</hi>
or His <hi>People?</hi> How many Proposals and Overtures of accomodation have
been made by His Majesty to His last <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Westminster?</hi> and how
undutifully they were rejected by some <hi>Leading-Members</hi> in the <hi>House of
Commons?</hi> How often did he offer to consent to any reasonable expedient
they cou'd find out, for securing the establish'd <hi>Religion,</hi> in case of a <hi>Popish
Successor?</hi> But all was slighted, as if nothing but the Subversion of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>
was able to secure some <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in their <hi>Religion,</hi> that were shrewdly
suspected to have none to lose:</p>
            <p>This discourse, I know, will not relish with our <hi>Irish Chief-Baron,</hi> who
seems already very angry, that a <hi>Cabal</hi> (as he calls the <hi>Loyal Addressers</hi>
of the Nation) <hi>shou'd take upon themselves to arraign the Proceedings of our
latest Parliaments,</hi> p. 8. And yet his unmannerly Worship, because he
thinks 'tis a <hi>Priviledge</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Godly</hi> to <hi>speak evil of Dignities,</hi> scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
not to rail at the best <hi>Parliament</hi> that ever met in his time, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was (what he scoffingly calls it) <hi>a Parliament of famous Loyalty;</hi> tho' in
their latter days, when by the <hi>Death</hi> of several good <hi>Members,</hi> too many of
the <hi>old Leaven</hi> had crept in, that vigor was much abated, which they always
express'd in their former resolutions; and for which this <hi>Factious Lawyer</hi>
presumes to say, that <hi>obliquely they gave the Papists many assistances,</hi> p. 14.
and in plain terms calls them, <hi>the corrupt Villains of the late Long-Parliament.
Considerations consider'd.</hi> p. 19. But to clear this point, without insisting upon
retortions and recriminations; I say, to arraign the Proceedings of the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> in its true and legal sense, that is, of <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
is a very great and a very hainous Crime, not to be conniv'd at, or
endur'd in any Subject whatsoever; because it tends to the vilifying, and
consequently to the subverting the <hi>Government;</hi> for as <hi>Seneca</hi> well observ'd,
<hi>Nihil valet Regum potestas, nisi prius valeat authorit as:</hi> If <hi>Princes</hi> lose their
Authority, the awe and reverence due to them from the People, they have
lost their Power and Command, and are in effect more than half Depos'd.
But to arraign the Proceedings of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> when this Name is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
appropriated to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> to whom this lawless Scribler
attributes <hi>a high and uncontroulable Power,</hi> (p. 9.) as if the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi>
were only <hi>Cyphers,</hi> the Crime is not near so unpardonable as some people
wou'd have us believe. I am sure Mr. Justice <hi>Hutton</hi> in his Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Ship-money, (which so pleas'd even that <hi>Rebellious Conventicle</hi> of
<hi>Forty-One,</hi> who swallow'd up the King's <hi>Prerogative</hi> and the Peoples <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in their <hi>Parliament-Priviledges,</hi> that they gave express Orders to get it
printed) thought it no such Crime to say, <hi>I know not whether the last meeting
in Parliament, either by ill choice of the Members of the House, or by the great
encrease of the number, or by the ambitious humour of some Members of that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42140:8"/>
House, who aim'd more at their own ends and designs, than the good of the</hi>
Commonwealth, <hi>things were so carry'd, not as was us'd in ancient times, but
so disastrously that it hath wrought such a distast of this course of Parliaments,
as we and all that love the</hi> Commonwealth <hi>have just cause to be sorry for it.</hi>
p. 33. Nevertheless, I must confess, that even in this sense 'tis not beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
every private Pen to censure or condemn them, upon every slight
occasion; and the motives must be very extraordinary, when such practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are allowable. Yet when we consider, that matters have been so carry'd
on for some years past, that of necessity we must e<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Wisdom and <hi>Councils,</hi> for Proroguing and Dissolving so many <hi>Parliaments;</hi>
or conclude, as undoubtedly we must, that the unseasonable heat of the
<hi>Leading-Members</hi> in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> necessitated <hi>His Majesty</hi> to
take such unwelcom resolutions: And withal, when we find, not only the
<hi>King,</hi> but the generality of the <hi>Nation</hi> in their repeated <hi>Addresses,</hi> express
their dislike to the Proceedings of a <hi>prevailing Party</hi> in that <hi>House;</hi> all <hi>Loyal
Subjects,</hi> I think, concern'd in the election of such <hi>Members,</hi> ought to be so
just to Themselves and the Publick as to declare their own Integrity, and
their constant affection to the <hi>King,</hi> that the world may see they are no
<hi>Abettors</hi> of the unwarrantable resolutions of their <hi>Representatives;</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ran into such unusual extravagancies, in hopes to be seconded by their
<hi>Principals.</hi> But tho' the occasion be never so extraordinary, it must never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
be granted for an undeniable <hi>Maxim,</hi> that whatsoever misdemeanors
any <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Honourable House</hi> happen to commit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ought not to
reflection the <hi>House</hi> in general, nor yet the errors of the whole <hi>House</hi> at
any time, put either <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>People</hi> out of love with that wholsom and
excellent Constitution. For such is the instability of <hi>Mundan</hi> affairs, that
(as the Poet said) <hi>Nihil est ab omni parte beatum;</hi> there is nothing upon
Earth but hath its failings, and even the best of <hi>Governments</hi> has sometimes
its own inconveniences: Thus <hi>Princes</hi> are now and then apt to give too
much credit to their flattering <hi>Favourites,</hi> and be led for a while by their
evil Counsels till time and experience convince them of their error; and

the <hi>Parliament</hi> to sit, which they might model and influence, as they pleas'd;
or at least know the strength of their party by the number of <hi>Subscribers,</hi>
and lessen His Majesty's credit in the hearts of his People. To this end
<hi>Agents</hi> are sent about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Petition</hi> is sign'd by many <hi>Legions</hi> of the

<hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Quakers, Brownists,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> all in a

to all sober and understanding men, that <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> who always but in
<hi>Forty-One</hi> dreaded the face of that <hi>August Assembly,</hi> shou'd now be more
<hi>zealous</hi> for their sitting, than the <hi>True-Protestants</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
It was certainly an <hi>Omen</hi> that cou'd portend no good either to <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>State;</hi> and therefore, as the <hi>King</hi> had reason to mistrust there lay a <hi>Snake</hi>
in the <hi>Grass,</hi> the <hi>Brethrens</hi> zealous petitioning to that purpose, did rather
hinder than forward their meeting.</p>
            <p>At last, when it could not be thought the effect of the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,

               </hi> 1680, and the King having solemnly renew'd them His former
promises of complying with any thing they cou'd in reason propose, desir'd
them to wave all unseasonable disputes, and hasten to settle the affairs of the
Nation, and bring their meeting to a happy conclusion. The <hi>People</hi> were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42140:9"/>
generally big with expectation, to see the issue of this famous <hi>Session,</hi> and
doubted not but all their jealousies and distractions wou'd now be fully remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the Three Nations settl'd and compos'd, and the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> speedily shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the bottom. <hi>Parturiunt montes.</hi> They sate almost for three entire months
without any lett or interruption: and what have they done all this while
towards the effecting these weighty matters that lay before them? what
great progress have they made towards the suppressing of <hi>Popery,</hi> or putting
a period to that <hi>hellish Conspiracy?</hi> They spent nine or ten days about my
Lord <hi>Stafford's</hi> Tryal; and when all expected the other <hi>Lords</hi> shou'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follow, our charitable <hi>Patriots,</hi> tender it seems of shedding
more <hi>Popish-Blood,</hi> sate down to breath themselves, and not a word more of
the <hi>Papists</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the <hi>Leading-Members,</hi> that govern'd all in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
had other fish to fry. They were ferreting out <hi>Papists in Masquerade,</hi>
or <hi>half-reform'd Protestants,</hi> now thought more dangerous than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
<hi>Romanists.</hi> A <hi>Reformation</hi> they intended both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and
God knows where it shou'd have ended It was enough they fix'd the <hi>Popish-Plot</hi>
by the conviction of my Lord <hi>Stafford;</hi> but it seems it was their interest
to keep it on foot for other purposes, perhaps in imitation of the wise <hi>Romans;</hi>
who thought it impolitick to demolish their great Rival <hi>Carthage,</hi> which,
while standing, might serve to keep them from idleness and exercise their
Valour. The <hi>Papists</hi> therefore must have a time to breath, and the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
are the great favourites of the <hi>House,</hi> while known <hi>Protestants</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the odious names of <hi>Abhorrers,</hi> are forc'd to
bear the brunt, and suffer as <hi>Betrayers of the peoples Rights and Liberties,</hi> for
obeying their <hi>Sovereigns</hi> Proclamation, tho' not repugnant to any known
Law or Statute, but approv'd of by the <hi>Judges,</hi> and other <hi>Sages</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi>

but are further liable to be try'd by that <hi>mysterious Riddle, Lex &amp;,
consuetudo Parliamenti;</hi> which neither our Fathers, nor We, were able to
understand.</p>
            <p>'Tis an undoubted <hi>Maxim</hi> both in Law and Reason, that promulgation is
absolutely necessary to the obligation of all positive constitutions, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the immediate Laws even of the Almighty, are not obligatory,
where they were never preach'd, or made known. How then comes it to
pass, that so many Loyal Subjects and good Protestants have been troubl'd
upon the account of those mystical Riddles, <hi>Lex &amp; consuetudo Parliamenti,</hi>
and the <hi>Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> which were never publish'd or made
known to the people, but lie dormant in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> till started
up as occasion requires? It were to be wish'd, that <hi>Honourable Senate</hi> wou'd
so far oblige the Nation, as to give them a true description of this Law and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42140:10"/>
Custom of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and an exact account of their <hi>Priviledges;</hi> that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might in some measure for the future be able to shun those dangerous
rocks, and not be surpriz'd or shipwrack'd on such hidden shelves. Till
then all those loud pretences of securing the Subject from <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Government,</hi> must seem very ridiculous to the sober and judicious,
who as they cannot be easily impos'd upon by outward appearances, to
believe peoples words not suitable to their actions, will be apt to mistrust,
that what these Gentlemen so stifly oppose in others, they design wholly
for themselves.</p>
            <p>But to come closer to the purpose, let us suppose the <hi>Parliament</hi> has this
Arbitrary <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to turn our most innocent actions into misdemeanors,
and make what they please a breach of Priviledge: yet by what Authority
can the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> alone pretend to execute that Power; or take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to be sole <hi>Judges,</hi> that cannot act as <hi>Justices</hi> of the <hi>Peace?</hi> Our
<hi>Ancestors,</hi> it seems, have brought their Hogs to a fair Market, who
have struggled for many Ages to preserve themselves and Posterity from the
unbounded rule of <hi>Arbitrary</hi> pleasure, and having wrested that Power
from their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> like wise <hi>Politicians,</hi> have left it in the hands of their
<hi>Fellow-Subjects,</hi> nay, of their <hi>Attorneys</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> to whom as such,
they always allow'd their daily wages for their attendance in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
'Tis certainly an odd kind of <hi>Liberty,</hi> that the people can neither be Fin'd nor
Imprison'd by their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> unless for transgressing some known penal
<hi>Law</hi> of the Land; but their <hi>Deputies</hi> and <hi>Trustees</hi> may uncontroulably pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them for any thing they are pleas'd to call <hi>Criminal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this the great happiness of <hi>Freeborn</hi> Subjects, instead of one to have
five hundred <hi>Masters,</hi> and see the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the Nation, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Charta,</hi> and all the good <hi>Statutes</hi> confirming and explaining the same,
thus eluded and made useless by a pretended <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>Parliament?</hi> What
are we the better at this rate, that by the <hi>Great Charter</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of
<hi>England, c.</hi> 29 'tis declar'd, <hi>That no Freeman shall be taken or Imprison'd, or
be disseiz'd of his Freehold or Liberties, or his Free Customs, or be Outlaw'd,
or Exil'd, or in any manner destroy'd, but by the lawful Judgement of his Peers,
or by the Law of the Land?</hi> Or that 28 Edw. 3. c 3. 'tis enacted, <hi>That no
man of what estate or condition he be, shall be put out of his Land or Tenements,
nor taken, nor Imprison'd, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without being
brought to Answer by due Process of Law.</hi> Or, to omit many others, that
42 Ed. 3. c. 3. <hi>It is assented and accorded for the good governance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that no man be put to answer without Presentment before Justices, or
matter of Record, or by due Process and Writ Original, according to the Old
Law of the Land; and if any thing be done to the contrary, it shall be void in
Law, and holden for error.</hi> What are we the better, I say, to have these and
several other <hi>Statutes</hi> to the same purpose, if they are not of force
to secure us on all sides from the <hi>slavish yoke</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power? If a breach
be once made in these great <hi>Bulwarks</hi> of our <hi>Liberties,</hi> and that even by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42140:10"/>
those <hi>Sentinels</hi> appointed to guard us from all Illegal <hi>Incroachments,</hi> where
is our <hi>Security?</hi> What will it avail the flock, that they are safe from <hi>Wolves,</hi>
if they are in danger to be devour'd by the very <hi>Dogs</hi> that shou'd defend
them? Or to what purpose shou'd people struggle to avoid <hi>Scylla,</hi> if at the
same time they suffer themselves to be swallow'd up in <hi>Charybdis?</hi> 'Tis an
old saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and we have found this too true by a dear-bought experience. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
us from receiving any further confirmations of it from those <hi>State-Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyricks,</hi>
that labour to make us exchange the reality for the name, and the
substance for the shadow, or <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain by the foregoing <hi>Statutes,</hi> that no man ought to be taken or
Imprison'd, without being brought to Answer by due course of Law; and
that none can be brought thus to answer, without Presen<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ment before
Justices, or matter of <hi>Record,</hi> or by due Process and <hi>Writ Original,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the old <hi>Law</hi> of the Land. What pretence then have the <hi>House</hi> of
<hi>Commons,</hi> who can bring none to Answer in this manner, to any right or
legal power to take or Imprison any <hi>Criminal</hi> whatsoever? 'Tis true, the
<hi>Common,</hi> and generally all men in Authority, are inclin'd to enlarge their
own Jurisdiction, and stretch it as far as possible; but sure a bare Vote of
that <hi>House</hi> in favour of themselves, or a late practice never heard of in
former Ages, shall not be of force enough in any <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> to elude
the solemn <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides these <hi>Statutes,</hi> too plain to admit of any comment, even by the
Common Law of this Realm no Subject can Imprison another, but our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Record,</hi> and such as have the <hi>Kings</hi> express <hi>Commission</hi> for
so doing. I say <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Record,</hi> because (as appears by divers adjudg'd
Cases in our Law Reports) no other <hi>Court</hi> can Fine or Imprison the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<hi>Courts</hi> (saith <hi>Coke) which are not of Record, cannot impose a Fine, or
commit any to Prison,</hi> lib. 8. f. 38. And again, <hi>Nulla Curia, quae Recordum
non habet, potest imponere finem, neque aliquem mandare carceri; quia

               <hi>Recordo.</hi> Now our
best <hi>Lawyers</hi> will tell us, that the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> is no
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Record,</hi> nay properly speaking is no <hi>Court</hi>
at all. 1. Because there is no <hi>Court,</hi> but what is
establish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d by the <hi>Kings Patent,</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or by the <hi>Common-Law, i.e.</hi> the constant
immemorial custom of former Ages. <hi>Plowdens</hi> Comment. fol. 319. and
<hi>Coke</hi> 1 Instit. f. 260. But the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> cannot pretend to have any
<hi>Patent</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to be a <hi>Court,</hi> and yet the <hi>Common-Law</hi> makes
nothing for their purpose: For they were never own'd as such, nor ever
had as much as a <hi>Journal-Book,</hi> much less <hi>Records,</hi> till <hi>Ed.</hi> 6's. time:
And moreover, it was never heard before Sir <hi>Edward Cokes</hi> fancy, there
were two distinct <hi>Courts</hi> in the same <hi>Parliament;</hi> since therefore the <hi>House</hi>
of <hi>Lords</hi> is undoubtedly the <hi>Supream Court</hi> of all <hi>England,</hi> they are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42140:11"/>
the <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and consequently the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi>
is no Court in Law. Secondly, There is no <hi>Court</hi> without a power of
Tryal; but the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> have no power to try any Crime or
Offence; for they cannot; nor ever pretended to examine upon Oath: And
therefore since there can be no legal tryal without Witnesses, nor are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of any force in Law, unless examin'd upon Oath, the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
not claiming the power to administer Oaths, cannot bring any matter
to a Tryal, and consequently can be no <hi>Court.</hi> I must confess Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> (who in his latter days thinking himself disoblig'd, was no friend to
the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and therefore took a great deal of pains to extol the <hi>Power</hi>
of the <hi>Commons,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> and the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi>
of the <hi>Lords)</hi> is, or at least pretends to be, of another opinion. In the <hi>4th.</hi>
part of his <hi>Institutes</hi> he tells us, <hi>That the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Commons <hi>is to many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
a distinct Court,</hi> p 28. which he very Learnedly proves by this rare
<hi>Demonstration, That upon signification of the Kings pleasure to the Speaker,
they do and may Prorogue or Adjourn themselves, and are not Prorogu'd or
Adjourned by the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Lords, ib. Whereas (to say nothing of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi>
for examining Witnesses, or regulating any publick business, of
<hi>Arbitrators, Referees</hi> and the like) every <hi>Committee</hi> of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
tho never so few in number, must upon this account be a distinct
<hi>Court,</hi> because they may thus Adjourn and Prorogue themselves, without
their respective Houses. But he goes on, and to prove the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
is not only a Court, but a Court of Judicature and Record, he says
p. 23. <hi>That the Clerks Book of the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Commons <hi>is a Record, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by Act of Parliament,</hi> 6 H. 8. <hi>c.</hi> 16. Whereas that <hi>House,</hi> as I have
already hinted, had no such Book as a <hi>Journal,</hi> much less any <hi>Authentick
Record,</hi> before the first year of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth; all their material Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
till then being drawn in Minutes by a <hi>Clerk</hi> appointed to attend
them for that purpose, and by him entr'd of <hi>Record</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords:</hi>
And therefore the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> are, <hi>That the Speakers License for
Members going into the Country, be entred of Record in the Book of the Clerk of
the Parliament, appointed for the Commons House:</hi> Which undoubtedly must be
meant, not of the Commons, tho order'd now and then to wait upon them,
but of the Lords <hi>Clerk,</hi> who alone is stil'd <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> I omit,
that altho the <hi>Act</hi> had expresly call'd the <hi>Commons Book,</hi> a <hi>Record,</hi> yet this
cou'd no more make it so, than the words of the <hi>Common-Law, Recordari
facias loquelam in Curia Comitatus</hi> vel <hi>Baronis tui—&amp; Recordum illud

out of the <hi>Court-Baron,</hi> or <hi>County-Court</hi> to the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> can prove
the <hi>County-Court</hi> and <hi>Court-Baron;</hi> to be <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Record;</hi> which yet
<hi>Coke</hi> himself denyes in several places of his <hi>Institutes.</hi> See 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> f. 117.
and 260. and <hi>Rolls</hi> in his <hi>Abridg.</hi> f. 527.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is not all, the</hi> Lords <hi>and</hi> Commons <hi>must be made all Fellows at Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,
and of equal Authority, in point of</hi> Judicature: The Lords <hi>(saith he)</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42140:11"/>
in their House have Power of Judicature, and the Commons in their House
have Power of Judicature, and both together have Power of Judicature, <hi>p 23:
But I wish, since the</hi> Lords Judicial <hi>Power, as well with as without the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<hi>is beyond all dispute, this great</hi> Lawyer <hi>had so far oblig'd Posterity,
as to have left us some convincing Argument to make the World believe
the like of the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Commons; <hi>or at least given us some</hi> Instances <hi>of
their using this Power in former Ages, as the</hi> Lords <hi>have done time out of
mind. In the mean time, 'tis a shrewd Argument against his Assertion,
that in</hi> H. 4. <hi>time the</hi> Commons <hi>themselves in their</hi> Petition <hi>to the</hi> King,
<hi>declar'd,</hi> That the Judgments of Parliament appertained only to the King and
Lords, and not to the Commons; and therefore they prayed the King out of his
special Grace to shew unto them the said Judgments and the cause of them; that
so no Record might be made in Parliament against the said Commons, without
their privity. <hi>To which the Bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>answer'd by the Kings
command,</hi> That the Commons are Petitioners and Demanders, and that the
King and Lords always had, and of right shall have the Judgments in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even as the Commons themselves have shewed; saving that in Statutes
to be made, or Grants and Subsidies, or such things as are to be done for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
profit of the Realm, the King will have especially their advice and assent,
1 <hi>H. 4. Rol. Parl n. 79. Who now is to be believ'd, Sir</hi> Edward Coke <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to the</hi> Commons, <hi>or the</hi> Commons <hi>themselves wholly disclaiming all
Power of</hi> Judicature? <hi>Or shall a single</hi> Lawyers Ipse dixit, <hi>or proofless
assertion, be of greater weight, than so solemn a</hi> Declaration <hi>upon</hi> Record, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
off by</hi> King, Lords, <hi>and</hi> Commons?</p>
            <p>But to be short, and to argue <hi>ad hominem</hi> against our late <hi>Demagogues</hi>
at <hi>Wesminster,</hi> if they thought themselves a Court of <hi>Judicature</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> is pleas'd to make them, 'tis strange what cou'd
be their motive (unless to shew their Arbitrary Power to the World) to
Imprison so many of His Majesties <hi>Loyal</hi> Subjects, and after a long and
chargeable Confinement, release them, without offering to bring them to
any legal Tryal: For if these Gentlemen were reputed Criminal, they
ought to have been try'd according to Law; if Innocent, they shou'd not
have been Imprison'd. And to say their Confinement was by the <hi>House</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for a punishment of their suppos'd Misdemeanors, 'tis contrary to
common sense and to all Laws both humane and divine. For at this rate,
people will be condemn<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d before they are heard, and punish'd before they
are convicted; nay, which is worse than <hi>Abington-Law,</hi> to hang a man
first, and try him after, they shall be punish'd at will, and never brought to
a tryal. What can be safe, if this be admitted? or who can be secure either
of Life or Liberty, if a prevailing Faction in the <hi>House of Commons</hi> may
toss him thus in a <hi>Blanket</hi> without any Rhime or Reason, contrary to the
undoubted <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the <hi>Nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are told, the <hi>Commons</hi> have often Imprison'd people for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors,
and releas'd them again at their own Discretion. I wish they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42140:12"/>
had shew'd us withal by what <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> they committed them;
for a <hi>facto ad jus</hi> is no good argument with any man of sense or judgment.
How many <hi>Appeals</hi> have been made to <hi>Rome,</hi> and provisions of Benefices
procur'd from thence, during the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpation? Yet these being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Law, the Authors were still punishable, and it was no excuse for
any, that others had done the like before. The <hi>Commons</hi> have been a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
part of the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> either since the <hi>16th.</hi> of
<hi>Henry I.</hi> as some <hi>Historians</hi> write, or since the <hi>49th.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 3. in the year
1364. as most Authors agree; and yet all this while we cannot find, that by
their own <hi>Authority</hi> they imprison'd any <hi>Criminal,</hi> till in the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.
about the year 1550 they committed <hi>Criketost</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> when the
<hi>King</hi> was an Infant, and all govern'd by the ambitious <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset:</hi>
who to be sure wou'd not expostulate with the <hi>House of Commons</hi> about
such a trifle, as he thought it, whilst they forbore to question him for his
more illegal and arbitrary Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Now, if there be no other argument to justifie the <hi>Commons</hi> imprisoning
Delinquents, but the practice of their House since the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 'tis
plain, the commitment of <hi>Criketost</hi> was illegal, because not justifiable by
any former practice of that <hi>House;</hi> and consequently, cou'd be no fit Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to be imitated in succeeding Parliaments. And if their first <hi>Essays</hi> of
this kind were unwarrantable by Law, their subsequent Commitments
cou'd be no better; for, <hi>Quod ab initio non valuit, tractu temporis non conva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescit.</hi>
To what purpose then are such unwarrantable Examples alledg'd to
justifie the late proceedings of the <hi>Commons,</hi> if not to prove one absurdity
by another? since they can hardly think of any thing, how wild and
unreasonable soever; but they may find one instance or another, to offer as
a Precedent, in some of our former <hi>Parliaments.</hi> For experience tells us,
this <hi>Great Council,</hi> much less the<note n="*" place="margin">Dyer <hi>f. 60. a. says,</hi> the Parliament consists of three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the KING, as <hi>chief Head;</hi> the LORDS, the <hi>chief and principal Members of the Body;</hi> and the COMMONS, the <hi>inferiour Members.</hi>
               </note> meanest of the three
Estates, (tho' our modern <hi>Republicans</hi> wou'd fain snatch

and place it in the <hi>Speakers Chair)</hi> has not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

from Justice, Truth, and Loyalty. We must

                  </gap>itur, sed qua eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
not what is, but what ought to be done; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that 'tis not the example of frail men, impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
through ignorance, or led by passion, or private interest, but the approv'd
Laws of the Land, ought to be the <hi>Rule</hi> both of the <hi>Magistrates</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of the <hi>Subjects</hi> Obedience.</p>
            <p>What! says a factious <hi>Petitioner,</hi> cannot the House of <hi>Commons</hi> imprison
any Criminal? Have they no authority to chastise their own <hi>Members,</hi> or
punish the <hi>Invaders</hi> of their <hi>Priviledges?</hi> Have they not often exerciz'd
this Power; and is it possible the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> wou'd have so long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd
at their proceedings, had they been illegal or unjust? Does not the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42140:12"/>
House of <hi>Peers</hi> punish the <hi>Breakers</hi> of their <hi>Priviledges;</hi> why then may
not the House of <hi>Commons</hi> be allow'd to do the like?</p>
            <p>These are the mighty arguments our great <hi>Champions</hi> for the House of
<hi>Commons</hi> always insist upon; but how weak and insignificant they are, is
very obvious to any, tho' but meanly vers'd in our <hi>Laws,</hi> and the constitution
of our <hi>Government.</hi> For my part, I have always been, and still am, as much
for maintaining the just <hi>Priviledges</hi> of that <hi>House,</hi> as any man whatsoever;
'tis my interest to do it, and nothing but Truth and Loyalty shall ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
me to speak against any of their <hi>Pretensions:</hi> yet I must say, the power
they claim now-a-days, to punish all sorts of misdemeanors, and what they
please to term a <hi>breach of Priviledge,</hi> is not to be endur'd by any free-born
Subject; For, besides that 'tis needless, because such offences may, and by
Law ought to be try'd in the ordinary <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> 'tis very dangerous
to the <hi>Publick,</hi> least the <hi>Grand Inquest</hi> of the Nation, appointed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Peoples <hi>Grievances,</hi> and pray redress, shou'd upon this account be
diverted from pursuing those weighty affairs, by every sawcy Footman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the meanest <hi>Burgess</hi> in their House.</p>
            <p>I confess, it were somewhat tolerable in the <hi>Commons</hi> to imprison and
punish their own <hi>Members,</hi> for words by them spoken, or misdemeanors
committed in the House: 1. Because by 4 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 8. they are not punishable
elsewhere for any rashness in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that does not amount to Treason
Felony, or breach of the Peace, which the <hi>Commons</hi> neither
<note n="*" place="margin">Coke 4. <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 25. &amp; 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. n. 26, 27.</note> can, nor I hope will, as in <hi>Forty-One,</hi> endeavour to protect.
<hi>2ly.</hi> Because 'tis suppos'd, the Members upon their entring into
that Assembly, unanimously agreed the lesser number shou'd always submit
to the greater, and the <hi>major Vote</hi> be observ'd as the Act and Sense of the
whole House; if therefore by consent and original compact every single
<hi>Member</hi> submits himself to the rest, he cannot complain, tho' otherwise they
had no authority, if they imprison him for his misdemeanors, because
<hi>scienti &amp; volenti non fit injuria,</hi> provided always they exceed not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rules of <hi>Justice,</hi> nor the bounds of our establish'd Laws; for then no
private Act can bind a Subject, tho' made with his own free consent; as
appears by <hi>Clark's</hi> Case against the Mayor and Burgesses of St. <hi>Albans;
Coke</hi> lib. 5. p. 64. I cannot therefore but think the power assum'd of late
years by the House of <hi>Commons</hi> over their <hi>fellow-Members,</hi> to expel them the
House, when and for what they please, without any legal Tryal, (which the
<hi>Lords</hi> never practic'd against any of their <hi>Peers)</hi> is in it self most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and of very dangerous consequence; as Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> tho' otherwise a
great <hi>Champion</hi> for the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> proves at large in divers of
his Treatises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The practice</hi> (saith he) <hi>of sequestring and expelling</hi> Commons
<hi>by their</hi> fellow-Commons <hi>only, is a late, dangerous,</hi> unparliamentary Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
<hi>unknown to our Ancestors, destructive to the</hi> Priviledges <hi>and</hi> Freedom
<hi>of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>and injurious to those</hi> Counties, Cities, <hi>and</hi> Boroughs, <hi>whose</hi>
Trustees <hi>are secluded: the</hi> House of Commons <hi>being no</hi> Court of Justice, <hi>to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42140:13"/>
give either</hi> Oath <hi>or</hi> final Sentence, <hi>and having no more authority to dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their</hi> fellow-Members, <hi>than any</hi> Judges, Justices of the Peace, <hi>or</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,

<hi>and</hi> recal, expel <hi>and</hi> restore <hi>their</hi> fellow-Members <hi>at their pleasure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the practice and resolution of former Ages, to patch up a</hi> Factious

            <p>But whatever Power the <hi>Commons</hi> can pretend to have over their own
<hi>Members,</hi> to say they can lawfully punish others, tho for a breach of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,</hi>
much less for any other Crime, seems to me a very groundless
Assertion, not warrantable by the <hi>Ancient Law</hi> and <hi>Custom of Parliament,</hi>
but rather contrary to the <hi>Fundamental Constitutions</hi> of our <hi>Government:</hi>
First, because 'tis impossible to make out from whom this Power is deriv'd;
From the <hi>King?</hi> The <hi>Factious</hi> will not own it, and none can prove it: For
they have neither <hi>Patent</hi> nor <hi>Statute</hi> to shew for't, nor yet any <hi>Legal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi>
which is a constant immemorial Custom, such as the <hi>Lords</hi> have
in point of <hi>Judicature,</hi> to warrant it; the Ancientest President they can
alledge, being that of 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. or the Case of <hi>Ferrers</hi> referr'd to them by
the <hi>Lords</hi> in the 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8 about sevenscore years ago. Do they deri<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it
then from the <hi>People,</hi> from the <hi>Freeholders</hi> and <hi>Freemen,</hi> their <hi>Electors?</hi>
These have no such Power of themselves, they can Imprison none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
His <hi>Majesties Commission;</hi> and what they have not, sure they cannot
give: <hi>Nemo dat, quod non habet.</hi> As for the Power given by the <hi>Electors</hi>
to their chosen <hi>Members,</hi> who are order'd by the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi> to have
from the persons they represent, <hi>Plenam &amp; sufficientem potestatem,</hi> 'tis no
<hi>Judicial</hi> Power, nor <hi>Political</hi> Jurisdiction, which the People have not, and
consequently cannot give, but only a Power of consenting as well for their
<hi>Principals,</hi> as for themselves, to the <hi>Kings Laws and Ordinances.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if the <hi>King be the Suprem, and the only Suprem Governour of this
Realm,</hi> as we affirm in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy;</hi> and if <hi>all Authority and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
Spiritual and Temporal be derived and deducted from the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
as 'tis expresly declar<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d 1 <hi>Ed. 6. c. 2. §</hi> 3. Or as Old <hi>Bracton</hi> saith, <hi>Ea
quae sunt Jurisdictionis &amp; pacis, ad nullum pertinent nisi ad regiam dignitatem.
lib. 3. c.</hi> 24. Unless the <hi>Commons</hi> can make out they have their Power from
the <hi>King,</hi> they can have no manner of Jurisdiction, and by consequence
cannot lawfully Punish or Imprison any Criminal, if not perchance their
own <hi>Members</hi> in the Cases aforesaid: Besides, in the first <hi>Parliament</hi> of
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> 'tis declar'd, <hi>That the most Ancient Statutes of this Kingdom
do give, assign, and appoint the correction and punishment of all Offenders against
the Regality and Dignity of the Crown, and the Laws of this Realm, unto the
King</hi> 1 Mar. Sess. 3. c. What then are the breakers of the <hi>Commons Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42140:13"/>
are they <hi>Offenders</hi> against the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> or the Laws of
the <hi>Realm?</hi> If so, they ought according to this Act to be punish'd by the
<hi>King;</hi> if not, they are not punishable at all: for to trouble any, that does
not offend against the <hi>Crown,</hi> or the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land, is very <hi>Illegal and
Arbitrary, and a high breach of the Liberty of the Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, because the</hi> Law <hi>has expresly provided where and how breaches
of</hi> Priviledge <hi>ought to be punish'd, and gives the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Commons <hi>no power
to take any cognizance of them; for by several</hi> Statutes <hi>it appears, that
if</hi> a Parliament-man, or his Menial-servant, be Assaulted, Beaten or Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in Parliament-time, Proclamation shall be made where the deed is done,
that the Offendor shall render himself to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> within half a year
after, there to be tryed; and if the Offendor will not appear, he shall be Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Deed, and pay to the Party griev'd his double Damages, to be tax'd
by the discretion of the Judges of the said Bench for the time being, or by Inquest,
if need be, and also make Fine and Ransom at the Kings will. Moreover, it is
accorded in the same Parliamenti, that likewise it be done in time to come in like
Case, 5 <hi>H. 4. c. 6. and 11 H. 6. c.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Commons</hi> freedom from <hi>Arrests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 'tis certainly a very Ancient
<hi>Priviledge,</hi> granted by our <hi>Kings</hi> to that <hi>House,</hi> the better to enable them
to attend the <hi>publick</hi> service, to which they were summon'd; as appears by
<hi>Edward</hi> the first's Answer to the <hi>Templars,</hi> who having some <hi>Tenants</hi> in the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> that were behind with their Rents, Petition'd the <hi>King</hi> to have
leave to Distrain for the said Arrears in <hi>Parliament-time;</hi> which he utterly
refus'd, saying, <hi>Non videtur honestum quod Rex concedat quod illi de Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
suo distring antur tempore Parliament.</hi> 18 Ed. 1. Rot. 7. in Thesaur. Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris
Scaccar. Yet that it was not formerly held so sacred, nor did extend
near so far, as some people now imagine, is plain from the Case of <hi>Thorpe
31 H.</hi> 6. Who, tho <hi>Speaker</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> at that time, was Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
in the <hi>Fleet</hi> during the Prorogation of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> for a 1000. Marks
Damages given against him for a Trespass done to the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> And
the <hi>Parliament</hi> being Re-assembled, the <hi>Commons</hi> earnestly desir'd to have
their <hi>Speaker</hi> discharg'd, but it was adjudg'd by the <hi>Lords,</hi> that he shou'd
remain in Prison according to his Sentence, and they choose another <hi>Speaker:</hi>
whereupon they elected Sir <hi>Thomas Charlton,</hi> and made no further cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
as some now wou'd do, that their <hi>Priviledges</hi> were invaded, 31 <hi>H.
6 Rot. Parliam. n. 25, 26, &amp;c. Seldens Baronage fol.</hi> 115.</p>
            <p>Now for the Tryal of a breach of this <hi>Priviledge,</hi> tho I find no positive
or express <hi>Statute,</hi> that orders it to be decided in the ordinary <hi>Courts</hi> of
<hi>Justice,</hi> yet that they may lawfully do it, is a plain consequence of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> For to argue a <hi>majori ad minus,</hi> since <hi>Assaults</hi>
upon <hi>Parliament-men</hi> are far more Criminal than <hi>Arrests,</hi> if the ordinary
<hi>Courts</hi> of Justice can try the greater, they may certainly try the lesser
Crime. And accordingly they have often taken cognizance as well of this
as other Priviledges of Parliament; as appears in the Case of <hi>Done</hi> against
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42140:14"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mich. 12. Ed. 4. Rot. 20. <hi>in the</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</note>

               <hi>Skewish</hi> against <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynnard,</hi>
and many others. But the most usual practice
of former times was, to make application to the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Lords</hi> for redress in this particular, for as Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> himself confesses, <hi>The determination and knowledge
of this Priviledge belongs to the Lords of Parliament,</hi> in his <hi>select Cases</hi> 63. And
therefore the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> upon the restraint of any of their Members
or Menial Servants, of which themselves took no cognizance till of very
late days, always made their humble request to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.
Thus when <hi>William Lake</hi> Servant to <hi>William Milred,</hi> a <hi>Member</hi>

            <p>The famous Case of <hi>Ferrers, Burgess</hi> of <hi>Plimouth 34 H.</hi> 8. tho often
alleadg'd in favour of the <hi>Commons,</hi> is so far from making any thing for
their purpose, that it plainly shews they never offer'd till then to punish
any breach of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> for altho they found, not only that the <hi>Sheriffs</hi>
of <hi>London</hi> deny'd to deliver their <hi>Burgess,</hi> but that the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
beat their <hi>Serjeant</hi> and broke his <hi>Mace;</hi> yet knowing they had no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
Power of themselves, they were forc'd to repair to the upper <hi>House,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42140:14"/>
(which they wou'd never have done, had their own Authority been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient)
and complain to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the injury they receiv'd; who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>contempt</hi> to be very high, for the <hi>Commons</hi> greater satisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
the punishment thereof wholly to themselves: which condescension,
it seems, gave such encouragement to that <hi>House,</hi> in succeeding <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
who have been always sure never to loose, but still to gain ground upon
the <hi>Prerogative</hi> and the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> that now and then they made bold,
even without any Warrant or direction from the <hi>Lords,</hi> to punish some
breaches of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and at last other misdemeanors. For King <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth, because of his Minority, and his two Sisters by reason of their
Sex, being not so active, nor so fit for business, as their Predecessors, the
<hi>Commons</hi> took hold on this opportunity to get themselves into Power, and
endeavour'd by punishing Offenders to render themselves the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to the People.</p>
            <p>From hence they proceeded to regulate <hi>Elections,</hi> and tho the <hi>Law</hi> is
very plain and positive in this Case also; yet the <hi>Commons</hi> have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them of late days, not only to decide who is duely chosen, and who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
return'd; but have further assum'd the Power to punish the <hi>Offenders,</hi>
contrary to divers <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in that Case provided: For by several
<hi>Statutes</hi> it appears, <hi>That if the</hi> Sheriff <hi>makes an undue Return, his punishment
is</hi> 200 l. <hi>one to the King, and the other to the party duely Elected; besides a
years Imprisonment without Bail or Mainprise: And the person unduely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
is to continue a Member of the House, but at his own Charges, without
any allowance from the place, for which he serves.</hi> As for the return, if any
makes complaint thereof, <hi>It ought to be tryed, not by a Committee of Elections,
but before the Justices of Assizes in the proper County, or by Action of Debt in any
Court of Record;</hi> as appears 11 <hi>H. 4. c.</hi> 1. and 8 <hi>H. 6. c.</hi> 7. and 23 <hi>H. 6. c.</hi> 15.
These are the <hi>Laws</hi> for regulating <hi>Elections,</hi> and pursuant to them Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whose time the <hi>Commons</hi> busi'd themselves too much in that
matter, sent a notable check to the <hi>House</hi> in the 28 year of her <hi>Reign,</hi> for
their medling with choosing and returning <hi>Knights</hi> of the Shire for <hi>Norfolk;
a thing</hi> (said she) <hi>impertinent for the House to deal withall, and only belonging
to the Office and charge of the Lord Chancellor, from whom the Writs Issue and
are return'd,</hi> D'ewes Journal, <hi>p.</hi> 393. Which <hi>Message</hi> wrought then so
far upon the <hi>House,</hi> that for some years after they forbore to medle much
in any thing of that nature, but apply'd themselves, when occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
to the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> or <hi>Keeper,</hi> who proceeded therein as the
<hi>Law</hi> directed, without taking any great notice of the <hi>Commons Votes</hi> or
<hi>Resolves;</hi> as we find by a remarkable Instance in the 35 of this <hi>Queen,</hi> when
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> then <hi>Speaker,</hi> was order'd by the <hi>House</hi> to attend upon
my <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> to move his <hi>Lordship</hi> to direct a New <hi>Writ</hi> for choosing
a <hi>Burgess</hi> for <hi>Southwark</hi> instead of <hi>Richard Hutton,</hi> suppos'd to have been
unduly elected; and another for allowing Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> who was duely
elected, but not return'd, to be <hi>Burgess</hi> for <hi>Camelsford</hi> in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> and a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42140:15"/>
third for changing the name of <hi>John Dudley,</hi> return'd <hi>Burgess</hi> for <hi>New-Town</hi>
in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Southampton,</hi> into the Name of <hi>Thomas Dudley,</hi>
alleadg'd to be the same person, but his Name mistaken. <hi>My Lord Keeper</hi>
answer'd, that the <hi>Returns</hi> for <hi>Southwark</hi> and <hi>Camelsford</hi> shou'd stand
good, but as for the said <hi>John Dudley,</hi> he wou'd direct a new <hi>Writ</hi> for
choosing another <hi>Burgess</hi> in his stead for <hi>Newtown, D'ewes</hi> Journals, <hi>p.</hi> 494.
Now if this was the legal way of Proceeding in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Reign,</hi>
warranted by the <hi>Statutes</hi> lately quoted, and allow'd by the great <hi>Lawyer</hi>
Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> and the whole <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> at that time, by what
<hi>Authority</hi> cou'd it be alter'd in succeeding <hi>Parliaments?</hi> or is it just that
the Ancient <hi>Precedents</hi> of former Ages shou'd be avoided by unwarrantable
new-ones of later times? Without question, had the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi>
then known, they had any Power to mend the said <hi>Returns,</hi> or punish the
<hi>Offendors,</hi> they wou'd never have sent their <hi>Speaker</hi> to wait on the <hi>Lord
Keeper</hi>'s pleasure about it; and if that House had no such <hi>Authority,</hi> 'tis
strange how can their <hi>Successors</hi> pretend to have any.</p>
            <p>Thus we see the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> was not in former times allow'd to
regulate the <hi>Election</hi> of their own <hi>Members,</hi> nor to Imprison any for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Elections or Returns, nor yet for a breach of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> much less
for any other Crime or Misdemeanor. Nothing was heard in those better
days of that terrible Sentence, <hi>Take him</hi> Topham; not a word of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Imprisonment <hi>during the Will and Pleasure of the House of Commons.</hi> The
sitting of <hi>Parliaments</hi> then was<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Prynn's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on <hi>Coke</hi>'s 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 42.</note> short and sweet, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
more business in three days, than of late they
have done in so many months. Their Study was, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
not Create Grievances, and preserve or procure
a good understanding betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>People;</hi> and not like <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury-Tinkers,</hi>
instead of mending one hole, make a great many.</p>
            <p>Oh! but (say some) the <hi>Connivance</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> is a strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that the <hi>Commons</hi> have done nothing herein contrary to Law. I
Answer, 'tis rather a very weak and frivolous Plea; first, because tho the
<hi>King</hi> be oblig'd by His <hi>Coronation-Oath</hi> to govern by Law, yet all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men will allow He has a <hi>Prudential</hi> Power to suspend the <hi>Execution</hi> of
such <hi>Laws,</hi> as he thinks prejudicial to the <hi>publick</hi> Interest; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may, when he sees occasion, wink at some illegal attempts of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to avoid a great Inconvenience. If thefore of late times the <hi>King,</hi>
and if you will, the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> did connive at some unwarrantable
resolutions of the <hi>Commons,</hi> rather than exasperate the whole <hi>House,</hi> too
Jealous of their own <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and thereby frustrate the chief end of
Calling His <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Security of the <hi>Publick;</hi> it was Policy and
great Prudence to wave it at that time, tho now 'tis the height of Folly to
make this a warrant for doing the like again, contrary to so many legal
<hi>Presidents,</hi> and express <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Secondly, because the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of <hi>Peter-pence</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> has been conniv'd at by <hi>King,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42140:15"/>
Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> for divers <hi>Centuries</hi> of years; yet it was an <hi>Illegal Tax</hi>
upon the Subject, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of
the <hi>Nation, 25 H. 8. c.</hi> 21. Likewise the <hi>Clergy</hi> made divers <hi>Canons</hi> and
<hi>Constitutions,</hi> which have been conniv'd at for several Ages both by <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet are declar'd by 25 <hi>H. 8. c. 19 To be much prejudicial
to the Kings Prerogative Royal, and repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm.</hi> The same may be said of the Ancient Custom of <hi>Archbishops</hi> and
<hi>Bishops,</hi> declar'd by 1 <hi>Ed. 6. c.</hi> 2. to be contrary to the Common-Law of
of the Land, tho practic'd and conniv'd at, time out of mind. And to
omit several other Instances, Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> for exercising his <hi>Legantine</hi>
Power, and the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> for receiving it, tho conniv'd at for many years
as well in as out of <hi>Parliament,</hi> were nevertheless found guilty in a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi>
in His Majesties Court of <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> Connivance therefore is no good
<hi>Argument</hi> of any things being legal, and the tolerating of a <hi>Custom,</hi> tho never
so long, cannot warrant its continuance, while the <hi>Law</hi> is against it. Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
indeed of former Ages, when legal and just from the beginning, are of
great force in <hi>Judicial</hi> Proceedings; but no new <hi>President</hi> of late days can
have that weight in any Court of Justice, and to be sure will never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
if contrary to <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Authentick</hi> Records of <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> (say they) use to punish the <hi>Breaches</hi> of their
<hi>Priviledges,</hi> and several other <hi>Misdemeanors;</hi> why then may not the <hi>House</hi>
of <hi>Commons</hi> do the like? A most ridiculous parity; for they might argue
as well, the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Fines and Imprisons Delinquents, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> may do the like when they please. For the <hi>Commons</hi>
in <hi>Parliament</hi> are really the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> of the Nation, appointed to enquire
after Briberyes, Extortions, Monopolies, and other publick Oppressions,
and complain thereof to the King and Lords, and humbly pray redress;
yet they are no <hi>Judges</hi> in any Case themselves, but are
<note n="*" place="margin">None can be Judge and Party, <hi>Coke</hi>'s 8 Reports, Dr. <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Case. <hi>f. 118. b.</hi>
               </note> Parties, as being the <hi>Attorneys</hi> and <hi>Representatives</hi> of
those that are injur'd. So far they are from having any
<hi>Judicial</hi> Power, that they cannot as much as administer
an Oath upon any occasion whatsoever; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the <hi>Law</hi> wou'd not have deny'd them, but that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
design'd for<note n="*" place="margin">The constant Custom of the <hi>Commons,</hi> even to this day, to stand bare with their Hats in their hands, while the <hi>Lords</hi> sit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, at all Conferences and Tryals, is a plain Argument they are not Fellows or Colleagues in Judgment.</note> 
               <hi>Judges</hi> or punishers of any Criminal;
because <hi>qui negat Medium, negat &amp; finem.</hi> But the
<hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> is not only a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> but
the <hi>Supream Court</hi> of the whole <hi>Kingdom;</hi> they are
look'd upon by our Laws as persons of no less Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than Honour, in the distribution of Justice; and
besides, are assisted by all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by the
12 <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> by the <hi>Kings</hi> Learned <hi>Council,</hi>
and by His <hi>Attorney</hi> and <hi>Solicitor General;</hi> in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof the same <hi>Laws</hi> have repos'd that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
trust in this <hi>August Assembly,</hi> that to them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42140:16"/>
alone it belongs to redress delays, and reform the erroneous <hi>Judgments</hi> of
other Courts of Justice, and give a final decision to all manner of Appeals.
Now by the <hi>Laws</hi> of other <hi>Nations,</hi> as well as ours, 'tis the nature of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<hi>Courts,</hi> that they may determine matters tryable by an Inferior; and
therefore it must be allow'd, that tho the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> cannot, because
no <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> yet the House of Lords, the <hi>dernier resort</hi> of all Suits
and Actions, may, if they please, punish the Invaders of their <hi>Priviledges,</hi>
notwithstanding that the Law directs them to be try'd in Inferiour Courts.</p>
            <p>Having thus sufficiently demonstrated, that the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> have
neither Common nor Statute-Law, nor yet any legal <hi>Precedents</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
their Fining or Imprisoning the meanest of their Fellow-subjects, 'tis
high time, I think, tho a great deal more might be said on this subject
very useful to be known, to give you a brief account of other Particulars,
and examine whether the <hi>Remedies</hi> propos'd in <hi>Parliament</hi> by our late
<hi>Mountebanks</hi> of State be not equally dangerous, if not really worse, than
our Disease. But to expose the designs of some ill men there, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Resolves</hi> they got pass'd in the <hi>Lower House,</hi> is a task
no less tedious than difficult for me to undertake. I will therefore tell you
in short, that notwithstanding all the noise and clamour they made about
the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> the Nation had too
much reason to believe, they minded more their own ends, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good of the People. The <hi>Kings</hi> best Subjects, who having so many
years experience of His <hi>Majesties</hi> most happy <hi>Government,</hi> declar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
satisfi'd with His prudent management of Affairs, and in <hi>Obedience</hi>
to His <hi>Royal Proclamation,</hi> express'd their aversion to all <hi>Tumultuous Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
were no more run down on the one side, than the <hi>Factious Fanaticks,</hi>
even such as signaliz'd themselves in the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi> were countenanc'd
and favour'd on the other; insomuch that many were of opinion, people
had no surer way to ingratiate themselves with some of the <hi>Leading Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berr,</hi>
than openly to asperse the <hi>Government,</hi> and reflect upon the <hi>King</hi> and
His <hi>Ministers</hi> as <hi>Favorers</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Designers</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi>
'Tis almost incredible what pains they took to get the Notorious <hi>Anabaptist
Ben. Harris</hi> discharg'd out of Prison, for no other reason that I find, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> who with a great deal of favour was condemn'd only to
the <hi>Pillory</hi> instead of <hi>Tyburn,</hi> for publishing that <hi>Treasonable Pamphlet, The
Appeal.</hi> Neither is this all; the main <hi>Bulwark</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> must be
broke down, the Penal <hi>Laws</hi> against the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> Repeal'd, to let
in a <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> the scandal of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> who have nothing
of Christianity but the Name, to Profane the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And because
this <hi>Project</hi> luckily miscarry'd, their Friends in the <hi>House</hi> endeavour'd to
leave them a new kind of <hi>Dispensation,</hi> and the very last
<note n="*" place="margin">10 Jan. 1681/80;.</note> day of their sitting, that with their dying breath they
might testify to the World their great <hi>zeal</hi> for the
Dissenters in general, of what sect or perswasion soever, to the admiration of
most men, they pass'd the following Vote.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42140:16"/>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> That it is the Opinion of this House, that the Prosecution of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Dissenters</hi> upon the Penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
a weakening of the Protestant Interest, an encouragement to <hi>Popery,</hi>
and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I need not comment upon this <hi>unwarrantable Resolve,</hi> by which our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Patriots,</hi> even without the <hi>King</hi> and House of <hi>Lords,</hi> once more were
pleas'd to assume to themselves a Power of suspending, and consequently
of making, <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The encouragement this gave to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans</hi>
to pursue their wicked Designs against the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi>
like to have prov'd fatal to both, is enough to convince the World, they
cou'd hardly do the <hi>Nation</hi> a greater mischief; and that their confining se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> tho contrary to Law and Reason, was not near so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the <hi>Government,</hi> as their breaking down the <hi>Rails</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
to let a swarm of <hi>Sectaries</hi> creep in at the <hi>Windows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was observ'd with some admiration, how during this <hi>Session</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
there was not one <hi>Fanatick</hi> Imprison'd, nor so much as question'd
by the <hi>Commons</hi> for any Crime or Insolence whatsoever, very few <hi>Papists</hi>
molested; but the true Sons of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> daily Prosecuted in
vast numbers, to their great loss and vexation, tho it prov'd at last the
eternal shame and confusion of the <hi>Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cou'd not but smile to see the <hi>perplexity</hi> they were in, when one of the
<hi>Judges,</hi> to his never-dying fame, for giving the first <hi>Precedent</hi> of that kind,
made application to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> about the <hi>Execution</hi> of his
<hi>Trust,</hi> and desir'd their <hi>Opinion</hi> whether he shou'd do <hi>Justice</hi> to one of their
<hi>Prisoners,</hi> by granting the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> then in
the Custody of Serjeant <hi>Topham.</hi> Three several days the Case was stifly
debated in the <hi>House,</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> read twice or thrice over, and yet no reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
taken. The <hi>Warrant</hi> of <hi>Committment,</hi> which order'd the <hi>Gentleman</hi>
to be confin'd, without any Cause shown, <hi>During the Will and Pleasure of
the</hi> House of Commons, was look'd upon so <hi>Illegal</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
even by several <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> that Serjeant <hi>M.</hi> till he
heard it was already made publick, wou'd have them immediately recal
the Old, and grant a New <hi>Warrant</hi> more conformable to Law. Besides,
the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> were so full, as admitted of no Comment, and
so plain for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Subject, as made it undenyable, that
<hi>Prisoners,</hi> unless for <hi>Treason</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> were still Bailable, by what Person
or Persons soever Committed, not excepting the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> much
less the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> who had no <hi>Legal</hi> Power to Commit any Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.
But still the point was very nice, and the <hi>Leading Members</hi> no less
uncertain what resolution to take; for if they openly declar'd against the
<hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> wou'd be much alarm'd, and suspect these
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> instead of securing, intended to invade, the Subjects <hi>Liberty;</hi>
but if they allow'd the <hi>Writ,</hi> the delicious power of Imprisoning such as
they had a picque to, was utterly lost, and all persons referr'd to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42140:17"/>
               <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> or upon their failure, to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> the
suprem <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> At last Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> like an <hi>Imperious
Dictator,</hi> starts up to decide the matter, and having made a bawling <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue</hi>
concerning the Power of the <hi>House,</hi> and their Intention of not bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves by that <hi>Act,</hi> which yet must bind the <hi>King,</hi> tho it might
as well be alleadg'd He did not intend it, he boldly concludes with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and daring the <hi>Judges</hi> to do their duty; <hi>Precibusque minas regaliter
addit:</hi> 
               <q>The same reasons <hi>(says he)</hi> which may be given for discharging
such as are not Committed for breach of Priviledge, if it be grounded on
the Act for the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> will hold as strong for discharging of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Committed for breach of Priviledge; and so consequently deprive
this House of all its Power and Dignity, and make it insignificant. This
is so plain and obvious, that all the Judges ought to know it; and I think
it below you to make any Resolve therein, but rather leave the Judges to
do otherwise at their Peril; and let the Debate fall without any question,</q>
See the Debates of the House, <hi>pag.</hi> 217. Was not this a rare <hi>Assertor</hi> of
our <hi>Liberties,</hi> who instead of allowing us the benefit of the <hi>Laws,</hi> wou'd
have us all made <hi>Beasts</hi> of burden to maintain the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Demagogues</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons;</hi> and be content to turn <hi>Gally-Slaves,</hi>
rather than their Power shou'd become useless or insignificant? But
I find this daring Speech did not frighten all the <hi>Judges;</hi> for Baron <hi>Weston,</hi>
to his immortal Renown, had still the courage to grant the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi>
and rather expose himself to the malice of the <hi>Faction,</hi> than deny or delay
Justice, contrary to his Oath.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> being thus secur'd, have we not reason to be
fond of these <hi>worthy Patriots,</hi> who tugg'd so hard against <hi>Popery,</hi> the better
to bring in <hi>Presbytery;</hi> and to make sure that the <hi>Prince</hi> shou'd not use <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power,</hi> took all possible care to keep it in their own possession. It
was the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> in the days of yore to have the Power of making
War and Peace, and declaring who shou'd be counted Friends, and who
reputed <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But now the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> are
willing to ease him of that trouble, and take upon themselves by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<note n="*" place="margin">7 Jan. 1680.</note> Vote, to declare some of His <hi>Majesties</hi> best Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and most Faithful Friends, <hi>Enemies to the King and
Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> That all persons who advis'd His Majesty in His last Message to
this House, to insist upon an Opinion against the Bill for excluding the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> have given pernicious Councel to His Majesty, and are promoters of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
and Enemies to the King and Kingdom:</p>
            <p>And this extravagant <hi>Vote</hi> they are pleas'd particularly to apply to four
<hi>Noble Peers</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> exposing them to the <hi>Rable,</hi> without the least
colour of proof, for Promoters of <hi>Popery,</hi> and Enemies to their <hi>Soveraign;</hi>
for no other reason, but because they were truly <hi>Loyal,</hi> and free from the
contagious leaven of the <hi>Faction.</hi> What a happiness it is, to live within
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42140:17"/>
the <hi>Walls</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> where the Knave becomes Honest, and
the Fool a Politician? where People are sure never to be in the wrong, but
always impeccable, and may freely rail and reflect upon their Betters,
which without doors wou'd cost them very dear. Yet I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
why these <hi>Noblemen</hi> (unless they, as well as many others, took that
<hi>Character</hi> for a mark of <hi>Honour</hi> from the givers) have taken no course, at
least with the <hi>Printer</hi> and <hi>Bookseller,</hi> if not with the then <hi>Speaker,</hi> for
ordering such <hi>Scandalous</hi> Votes to be publish'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to express<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>R. 2. 5. 11 R.</hi> 2. 11. &amp;c. de Scandalis Magnatum.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For if the <hi>Kings</hi>
immediate Command cannot be allow'd as a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
in <hi>Law</hi> for any Illegal Act, so that altho the <hi>Prince</hi>
be unaccountable, yet the <hi>Minister</hi> is to suffer for his Obedience; sure a
<hi>Vote</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> shall not be thought of force, at least out of
<hi>Parliament-time,</hi> to Protect any Offender from Justice; because whatever
Title the <hi>Members,</hi> within the sacred <hi>Walls</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> may claim in some
Cases to impunity, their <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> who execute their <hi>Illegal</hi>
Commands abroad, cannot in the least pretend to have any.</p>
            <p>But how shou'd these <hi>Noblemen</hi> be enemies to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
for their advising His <hi>Majesty</hi> against the Bill of <hi>Exclusion,</hi> when the whole
<hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> (few discontented <hi>Lords</hi> Dissenting, who by their Lives
and Conversation never shew'd themselves the truest <hi>Protestants,</hi> nor the
best <hi>Subjects)</hi> openly declar'd against it, and upon the first reading threw
it out of doors, is a <hi>Mystery</hi> not easily to be understood. His <hi>Majesty</hi> in
His <hi>Message</hi> to the <hi>Commons,</hi> declar'd, <hi>He was confirm'd in His Opinion
against that Bill by the Judgment of the House of Lords, who rejected it;</hi> why
then are four <hi>Lords</hi> singl'd out, and not the whole <hi>House</hi> declar'd <hi>Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Popery, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom?</hi> The reason some will
guess, that the <hi>Leading Members</hi> saw matters were not yet ripe, to shew
themselves bare-fac'd, or discover the bottom of their Designs, and once
more to <hi>Vote</hi> the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords dangerous and useless, and therefore to be
laid aside.</hi> But why the <hi>Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exclusion enemies</hi> to the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom?</hi> When 'tis made plain even to <hi>Demonstration</hi> in several
Treatises publish'd these four years past about the <hi>Succession,</hi> that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters</hi>
of that <hi>Bill,</hi> tho some perhaps meant otherwise, were in fact <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
to the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and no Friends to the <hi>King</hi> nor to the True <hi>Protestant
Religion.</hi> 'Tis strange that such as loudly exclaim against <hi>Popery,</hi> shou'd
have the face at the same time to practice the worst of <hi>Popish,</hi> or rather <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical</hi>
Principles, and endeavour to force their <hi>Soveraign</hi> to disinherit His
only <hi>Brother,</hi> upon a bare suspicion of his being of another <hi>Religion;</hi> which
<hi>Henry</hi> the 3. of <hi>France,</hi> being tender of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and of the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary</hi>
Right of <hi>Succession,</hi> was so far from offering to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
tho a known <hi>Protestant</hi> and but a remote <hi>Kinsman,</hi> that he cou'd never be
perswaded to give the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to the Bill, which the powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Factious Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> got pass'd by the three <hi>Estates,</hi> for his
Exclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:42140:18"/>
Oh! but (say they) <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> will break in upon us, if the
<hi>Duke</hi> succeeds. And I am sure, <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and an Intestine
<hi>Civil</hi> War, will undoubtedly follow, if he be excluded, the <hi>King</hi> expos'd
to danger, and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to ruine. How fatal it prov'd to <hi>Henry</hi> 6. that
he suffer'd the good <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Gloucester</hi> to be made away by his Prosecutors,
which made way for his own Deposition, and consequently for his untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
end, <hi>Historians</hi> do abundantly testify; and <hi>Baker</hi> tells us, how the great
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset,</hi> then <hi>Protector,</hi> by Sacrificing his <hi>Brother</hi> the <hi>Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi>
to the malice of his Enemies, in hopes to stop their mouths by yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their demands, clear'd the way for himself to the Scaffold. <q>A
Warrant <hi>(saith this</hi> Historian) was sent, under the hand of his Brother
the Protector, to cut off his Head; wherein (as afterwards it prov'd) he
did as much, as if he had laid his own Head upon the Block: For whilst
these Brothers lived and held together, they were as a strong Fortress one
to the other; the Admirals Courage supporting the Protectors Authority,
and the Protectors Authority maintaining the Admirals Stoutness; but the
Admiral once gone, the Protectors Authority as wanting support, began
to totter, and fell at last to utter ruine. Besides, there was at this time,
amongst the Nobility, a kind of Faction; <hi>Protestants,</hi> who favour'd the
Protector for his own sake; and other of the <hi>Papal</hi> inclination, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
him for his Brothers sake: But his Brother being gone, both sides
forsook him; even his own side, as thinking they could expect little
assistance from him, who gave no more assistance to his own Brother,

            </p>
            <p>What a noise they make about these terrible <hi>Bugbears, Popery</hi> and <hi>Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
as if both were inseparable, and actually breaking in upon the <hi>Nation,</hi>
or rather come as far as the <hi>Lobby</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons?</hi> For my part,
tho I have no reason to be fond of either, the one being no less contrary
to my <hi>Nature,</hi> than the other to my <hi>Principles,</hi> yet I cannot be startl'd at
every <hi>shadow,</hi> nor believe that the <hi>Duke,</hi> having already spent the Prime of
his days, let him succeed never so soon, will be able to introduce amongst
us any new, much less the <hi>Popish Religion.</hi> Neither can I be perswaded,
contrary to common sense and the experience of so many Ages, but that
the <hi>Papists</hi> are as fond of their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and consequently as
great enemies to <hi>Slavery,</hi> as any <hi>Protestant</hi> whatsoever. For, to them we
owe the <hi>unparallel'd Common-Law</hi> of this <hi>Realm, Magna Charta</hi> and all those
wholesom <hi>Statutes</hi> grounded thereupon; to them we are oblig'd for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Frame</hi> of our well-temper'd <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which affords very much
to the Industry and Happiness of the Subject, yet preserves enough for the
Majesty and Prerogative of any King, that will own his People as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and not as Slaves or Villains. Who then but a Fool or a Mad-man,
wou'd think <hi>Slavery</hi> the unavoidable consequence of that <hi>Religion,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
whereof, even in the time of their blindest zeal and greatest dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
(for since then they are much refin'd) made such impregnable <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42140:18"/>
against it, and provided such wholesome <hi>Laws</hi> to defend themselves
from all the encroachments of <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power: Insomuch that the <hi>high</hi>
and <hi>mighty Pope</hi> himself, who often endeavour'd to enslave this <hi>Kingdom,</hi>

to that purpose, judg'd it a very hainous Crime in any Subject of <hi>England</hi> to

            <p>The <hi>King</hi> presented to a <hi>Benefice,</hi> and his <hi>Presentee</hi> was disturb'd by one

            <p>One <hi>Morris</hi> being elected <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Waltham,</hi> sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for a <hi>Bull</hi> of

the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and that the <hi>Abbot,</hi> for obtaining the same,
was fallen into the King's mercy; whereupon all his Possessions were seiz'd

            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. the <hi>Pope</hi> granted to the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Johns</hi> to have
<hi>Sanctuary</hi> within his <hi>Priory;</hi> But it was resolved by the Judges, that the <hi>Pope</hi>

            <p>In the same <hi>King</hi>'s Reign, a <hi>Legate</hi> from the <hi>Pope</hi> came to <hi>Callis,</hi> to have
come into <hi>England;</hi> But the King and his Councel would not suffer him to

            <p>And in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 7. the <hi>Pope</hi> had excommunicated all such persons
whatsoever as had bought Allom of the <hi>Florentines;</hi> But it was resolved by
all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Popes Excommunication</hi> ought not to be
obeyed, or to be put in execution within the <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>England, 1 H. 7. f.</hi> 10.
These, and many other such Cases, you may see in the first part of <hi>Coke</hi>'s

            <p>Now, if not only the <hi>Judges,</hi> but the Representative-wisdom of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
even <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> in the thickest mist of <hi>Popish</hi> ignorance,
were so resolute against the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so careful to preserve their
own <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> inviolable: who can be so silly, as to believe, that
a <hi>Popish Prince</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and at this time of the day, when <hi>Popery</hi> it
self is much refin'd, and the whole <hi>Nation</hi> irreconcilably bent against it, will
ever submit to any <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpation, much less make himself or his People

            </p>
            <p>Alas! says one, but our sweet <hi>Abbey-Lands</hi> are in danger to be lost, and
reassum'd by the <hi>Popish Clergy,</hi> what course then shall we take to secure them?
Believe me, if the Law will not do it, I know no other way, but a <hi>project</hi> I
hear shortly to be set on foot for <hi>Insuring</hi> all the <hi>Church-Lands</hi> in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
these 40 years to come. The parties concern'd will propose very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

them in the <hi>Religion</hi> they have not, but what will unavoidably shake
the very foundation of the <hi>Government?</hi> 'Tis true, our <hi>State-Mountebanks</hi> in

to their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> as humbly to threaten, this may possibly happen, if the

great Wisdom to consider, whether, in case the Imperial Crown of this Protestant
Kingdom should descend to the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>the opposition, which may possibly
be made to his possessing it, may not only endanger the farther descent in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Line, but even Monarchy it self,</hi> 21 Dec. 1680. But that season, I hope,
is over, and the Nation now thorowly sensible of the fatal consequences of
such resolutions, and can never forget the unparallell'd <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Rump,</hi>
nor the doleful <hi>Tragedies</hi> that ensu'd the <hi>Quarrel</hi> between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
which made <hi>England</hi> a Field of Blood.</p>
            <p>But what has this great <hi>Prince,</hi> once the peoples darling, done to deserve
so severe a treatment, or be thought so dangerous a person to the Publick?
Has he defrauded any of an Ox or an Ass; or was he ever found worse than
his word, or unjust in his dealings? If he has chang'd his opinion, which
yet is improbable, about the modes and circumstances of Religion, 'tis plain
he has not chang'd his moral Principles, nor his natural affection to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
I need not instance how often he expos'd his Person to danger, like
a common Sea-man, to fight our Battles; nor how zealously he always
studied the true Interest of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, in opposition to <hi>French</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
a truth too well known even to his most inveterate Enemies, but ill
rewarded with ingratitude. 'Tis prodigious, what tricks and arts have been
us'd of late to incense the unthinking multitude against His Highness, and
set them a-madding with the apprehension of Stakes and Faggots, and all
the <hi>Chymoera</hi>'s of a crack-brain'd fancy: when 'tis palpably evident, it is not
in the power of any <hi>Prince,</hi> tho' the greatest Bigot of <hi>Papists,</hi> to force this
Nation in point of Conscience, or alter the establish'd Religion; since
the Laws <hi>de Haeretico comb<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

in force, and warranted the Cruelties then committed upon the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
as the Statutes made by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> do the executing of <hi>Priests</hi>
and <hi>Jesuits</hi> as <hi>Traytors,</hi> both uncharitable and ill-becoming a Christian-Magistrate)
are now happily repeal'd and abolish'd. Why then shou'd
people be bugbear'd out of their senses, with imaginary fears of <hi>Smithfield</hi>-Faggots;
or think that the <hi>Duke,</hi> who never advis'd his own Children to
become <hi>Papists,</hi> wou'd offer, tho' able, to compel any other to renounce
his Religion? If He has express'd some kindness for such <hi>Romanists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as
had signaliz'd their Loyalty to His FATHER here, or to His BROTHER
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42140:21"/>
Abroad, when those that now call themselves true <hi>Protestants,</hi> openly absur'd his Title,
'tis an instance of his gratitude and good nature, but no Argument of his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Opinions of that Party. And yet we have no better proof, than such groundless
whispers and surmises, unless we believe the ridiculous <hi>Salamunca</hi> Doctor's peeping through
the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> of his being a <hi>Papist,</hi> or any way inclin'd to the <hi>Popish Communion.</hi> How false
then is the Preamble (and therefore justly rejected, had there been no other reason, by

known to have been perverted from the</hi> Protestant <hi>to the</hi> Popish <hi>Religion?</hi> Or the extravagant

            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s being a <hi>Papist,</hi> and the hopes of his coming such to the

to whom, besides the prospect of destroying their enemies, it was a great temptation to
commit the villany, that they cou'd safely leave it at anothers door.</p>
