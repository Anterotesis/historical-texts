            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And having received the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this learned Piece, from divers persons of judgement and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I was upon these and other like considerations, moved for the general good, to publish it thus abroad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, beleeving that it will be a delight to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and a great benefit to

the unlearned in the Latin Tongue, who may in their own Language read the sage wisedome of former times, and see how the infirmities of age are recompensed with more rare perfections of minde, and that it doth not so much destroy, as change the delights of youth for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and so be prepared to bid that welcome which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards them.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am often wont (good M. <hi>Cato</hi>) with this my friend <hi>Laelius,</hi> to admire among other things, your excellent and perfect wisedome; but especially that we never perceived, that your old age was troublesome, which is so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to most old men, that they say they bare a burden more grievous then [1] <hi>Aetna.</hi>

                     <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi> you seem to wonder at a thing not very hard: For that age is only grievous to those that have no taste of wisdome and learning in themselves to make

them live happily: but to them which see all perfection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation from their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nothing can seem heavy which the necessity of nature bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: of which sort old age is chief, which all desire to obtain, and blame being obtained; such is their unconstancy, foolishnesse and perversity, they say that it creepeth upon them ere they are <note n="*" place="bottom">Turpe est dicere non putaram.</note> aware. First let me aske, who bade them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reckon themselves? for how much sooner doth age creep on youth, then youth on child-hood? then, how much more grievous would their age be to them, if they should as well live to the eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred year, as to the eighty year? for the former age (though long,) when it is past, can asswage a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish old age, with no comfort Wherfore if you were wont to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57078:11"/>
my wisedome (which I wish were worthy of your opinion or our sirname) in this I am wise that I follow nature as a god, and her I do obey, by whom it is not like that when the other parts of our age are well set down, that the last part as it were by a carelesse Poet, should be neglected. And it is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that there may be some end of our bodies, like the fruits of trees, and of the earth, which wither and fall away, with a timely ripenesse, which ought of a wise man to be patiently borne; for what other thing is meant by the [2] battell of the Giants against the Gods, but the resisting of nature?</p>

                  <p>Surely <hi>Cato</hi> unlesse it be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to you, we would learne what it is; as if you had gone some long journey, wherein we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to follow you.</p>

                  <p>I will do it as I may <hi>Scipio,</hi> for I have often been at the complaints of men of my sort, (for as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pares cum paribus facillime congregantur.</note> birds of a feather flie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.) which [1] <hi>Caius Salinator,</hi> and [2] <hi>Spurius Albinus,</hi> men that have been Consuls, and almost my equals in years, were wont to make, as well for that they wanted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57078:12"/>
as that they were despised of them that were wont to worship them, which men seemed to me to accuse that which was not to be accused. For if that should fall out by the meanes of age, the same by use would happen to me and to all other old men, many of whose ages I know without complaint, which are no whit greived that they are released from the bonds of lusts, neither are they despised of their friends; but the fault of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, is in the manners not in the age. For moderate, courteous and gentle old men do lead an easie life, but inhumanity and importunity is hatefull in all ages.</p>

                  <p>It is as yon say <hi>Cato;</hi> but it may be that some wil object that to you by reason of your riches, plenty and dignity, your age seems tolerable; but that cannot happen to all men.</p>

                  <p>Truly <hi>Laelius,</hi> that is somewhat, but in no wise are all things under that predicament; for as [3] <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> is reported to have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a certain [4] Seriphian in a braul, when he told him that he had gotten renoun not by his own, but by his countreys glory, neither (answered <hi>Themistocles</hi>) should I be unrenouned, were I a Seriphian, nor thou renouned, wert thou an Athenian: so it may be said of age, for it cannot be pleasant (no not to a wise man) in extreme poverty, nor grievous to a fool in great plenty.</p>

when you have lived long, bring forth wonderfull fruit, not only because they will never fail you, no not in the extreemest part of your age, (which is much) but because the confidence of a life heretofore well led, and the remembrance of many good deeds, is exceeding pleasant. I being a young man, so loved [1] <hi>Quintus Maximus</hi> the old man, (he which took [2] <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>) as if he had been my equall in years. For there was in that man, gravity seasoned with courtesie, neither had age changed his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet when I first began to love him, he was not very old, but well stricken in years. For the year that he was first Consul, I was borne, and in his fourth Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, I being a young stripling, went with him to [3] <hi>Capua;</hi> in the fifth yeare, I went [4] <hi>Questor,</hi> to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> then [5] <hi>Aedile;</hi> foure
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57078:14"/>
years after I was made [6] <hi>Praetor,</hi> which office I bear, <note n="*" place="bottom">Consul. 550 yeeres, ab urbe cond.</note> 
                  <hi>Tutidanus</hi> and <hi>Cethegus,</hi> being <note n="*" place="bottom">Coss. breifly for Consul.</note> 
                  <hi>Coss.</hi> and at that time he being a very old man, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the [7] Cincian lawes; He not only waged warre stoutly when he was very old, but by delaylng bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, overthrew youthfull [8] <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> of whom our friend [9] <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> thus writeth.</p>

                  <l>He never lov'd vain glory more then he esteem'd our health.</l>
                  <l>The glory of the man therefore</l>
                  <l>Shall still remain and flourish more.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But with what vigilancy did he take <hi>Tarentum,</hi> when in my hearing he answered [10] <hi>Salinator,</hi> who having lost the town, fled into the Castle, and bragging said, O <hi>Quintus</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57078:15"/>
                  <hi>Fabius,</hi> by my means thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Tarentum;</hi> very true, (said he smiling) for if thou hadst not lost it, I had not wonne it; neither was he more excellent in warre, then in peace, who being the second time [11] Consul, [12] <hi>Spurius Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villius</hi> his colleague in office, not assisting him, he of himselfe resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with all his might [13] <hi>Caius Flaminius</hi> the [14] Tribune of the people, who against the whole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate, went about to divide the Picean [15] and Galicane fields, to each particular man; when he was [16] augur, he durst boldly affirme, that that was done with the best aspects, which was done for the safety of the Common-wealth. I know many excellent things of the man, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more admirable, then how he bore the death of his sonne [17] <hi>Marcus,</hi> a singular man, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57078:15"/>
I have in my hands the praise of the man, which when we read, what Philosopher do we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn? yet was he not more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent abroad, and in the eyes of the people, then at home, and in his private house; what speeches, what precepts, what knowledge of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy? and (for a Roman,) very learned; he kept all things in memory, not only civill but exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall warrs; whose conference when I did greedily enjoy, I did divine (as it hath sithence hapned) that he being dead, there should be none of whom I might learne. But wherefore speak I so much of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus?</hi> because you may see that it was detestable to be spoken, that such an old age was miserable.</p>

For that office consisteth not onely of wit, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of strength of body, strong sides and voyce; yet that shrilnesse of voyce doth altogether shew it self, I know not by what meanes in old age, which I my selfe have not yet lost, and yet you see my yeares; notwithstanding the speech of an old man, is comely, quiet, &amp; remisse; and the gentle and decked Oration of an eloquent old man, makes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it selfe, which singularity if you cannot obtaine, yet may you give precepts to youth; for what can be more pleasant, then old age, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the studies of youth? Shal
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57078:36"/>
we not then leave that strength at least to age, that it may teach youth, bring them up, and instruct them in all good duties? then which what can be more necessary, or more excellent? So that to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding [1] <hi>Cnaeus</hi> and <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> and your two grand fathers, <hi>Lucius Aemylius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Affrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> seemed happy in the company of noble young men. Neither are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny masters of good Arts, to be thought unhappy though through their paines in teaching their strength wax old, and decay; for that defection and failing of strength, is oftener caused by the faults of youth, then of age; for an intemperate and lustfull youth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth a corrupt and decrepit bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to age. Yet (2) <hi>Cyrus</hi> (in (3) <hi>X<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57078:36"/>
I remember (4) <hi>Lucius Metellus,</hi> when I was a boy, who foure yeers after his second Consulship, was made High-Priest, and served in that office 22 yeeres, he was of so good strength and health in his last age, that he required not youth. I need not speak much of my selfe, though it be a thing that belongs to old men, and it is granted to our age for doe you not see how often (5) <hi>Nestor</hi> doth brag in <hi>Homer,</hi> of his own virtues? for he had then lived three ages of man. So that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not feare least that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of himselfe, he should be counted in solent or talkative; for as <hi>Homer</hi> saith, out of his mouth flowed words more sweet then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which made that [6] Captaine of <hi>Greece,</hi> never wish that he had ten such as strong [7] <hi>Ajax,</hi> but ten such as wise <hi>Nestor,</hi> which if he might obtaine, he doubted not but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57078:37"/>
that [8] <hi>Troy</hi> should soon be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. But I returne to my self, I am now in the fourescore and fourth yeere of mine age, I cannot truly say as <hi>Cyrus</hi> did, but I would I could; yet this I can say, that though I am not of so great strength as I was being a souldier in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> warre, or Questor in the same warre, or Consul in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or foure yeeres after, when being Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the soul diers, I fought at [9] <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> (<hi>Marcus A<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tillius Glabrio</hi> being Consul) yet as you see old age hath not altogether weakned me, it hath not overthrown me. The Courts want not my strength, nor the pleading places, nor my friends, nor my Glyents, nor my ghests. Neither did I ever assent to that old and lauded proverb, that warns a man to be old quickly if he will be an old man long; but I had rather be an old man man lesse
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57078:37"/>
while, then make my selfe an old man before I were. So that as yet no man could come and find me idle at home, yet have I lesse strength then either of you; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have you the strength of [10] <hi>Titus Pontius</hi> the Centurion; is he therefore better then you? But let him make much of it, it will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long. <hi>Milo</hi> is said to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Listes of <hi>Olympus</hi> with a live Oxe on his shoulders; whether had you rather now have this mans strength of body, or <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> his strength of wit, to be given you? To conclude, use that strength which you have while you have it; but when it is gone, require it not, unlesse you thinke it a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing of young men, to require their child-hood againe, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men their youth; There is but one course of age, and one way of nature, and the same simple, and to
<pb facs="tcp:57078:38"/>
every part of age its own timelines is given; for as infirmity belongs to child-hood, fiercenesse to youth, and gravity to age, so the true ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of age hath a certaine natural gravity in it, which ought to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it own time. I thinke you have heard <hi>Scipio,</hi> of King [11] <hi>Massinissa,</hi> what he doth at this day being a man of ninety yeeres old, when he goes any whether on foot, he will never ride in that journey how far soever it be; likewise, when he rides a journey he will never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, neither could any storm, make him weare his hat; surely there is great drynesse of body in him, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may well execute all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and duties of a King. Thus you see exercise and temperance, way preserve some of the former strength even in old age.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Trength is not in old age; neither indeed is strength required of age; therefore both by the laws and statutes, our age is free from those offices which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised without strength; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not compelled to do those things which we cannot; no, nor so much as we can; but some men are so weak, that they can scarcely execute any office or duty of life at all; yet that is not the proper fault of age, but most commonly of sicknesse; how
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57078:40"/>
weak was (<hi>Scipio</hi>) the sonne of <hi>Publius Africanus,</hi> he which adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you <hi>Scipio?</hi> of how small or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of no health? which had it not been so, he had shined like another light in the city; for to his fathers magnanimity of mind, in him was added most plentifull learning; what wonder is there then in old men, if they be sometimes weak, since youth it selfe cannot avoid it? Age is to be resisted, <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> and his faults are to be ruled with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; we must strive against age as against a disease; we must have a care of our health; we must use moderate exercises; so much meat and drinke must be taken, that the strength may be refreshed, not oppressed, neither must we only feed the body, but the minde and understanding much more, for they also are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57078:41"/>
with age, unlesse you alwayes adde to them by study, and instill as it were oyle into a lampe. For though mens bodies grow heavy, and weary with much exercise, yet the minde is made more light, and ready by exercising it selfe. They whom <hi>Caecilius</hi> cals foolish old men, are such as are credulous, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dissolute, whith are not generally the faults of all age, but of a sluggish, drowsie and slothfull age. For as wantonnesse and lust is more in young men then in old, and yet not in all young men, but in the dishonest; so that folly of age which is wont to be called doating, is in light-headed old men, but not in all; <hi>Appius</hi> being both an old man, and a blind man, governed foure valiant sonnes, and five beautifull daughters, a great houshold, and many retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57078:41"/>
for he had his mind ready bent as a bow, neither fainting did he yeild to age. He held not only authority, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over his own, his servants feared him, his children reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, he was dear to all, the ancient manners and discipline of the countrey flourished in that house. For age is so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if it keep its authority, if it be bound to no man, that even to the last gaspe, it beareth rule over its own. And as I like a youth in whom there is some gravity, so I like an old man in whom there is some youthfulnesse, which who so observeth, may be an old man in body, but in minde he never shall be. I am now writing my seventh book of [1] <hi>Originales,</hi> and of excellent causes, whatsoever I have heretofore defended, now es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially I compile oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I handle

the sooth-sayers, the Priests, and the Civil law. I also use the Greek tongue much. And after the manner of the Pythagoreans, for to exercise my memory, I call to mind in the evening, what I have spake, heard, or done all that day. These are indeed the cases of the minde; these the exercises of the wit, in which studies while I busie my selfe, I do not greatly desire the strength of body; I am present with my friends, I come into the senate often, and of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, I bring discourses, long and well thought upon, which I there defend not by stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of body, but of mind, which if I could not do, yet lying on my bed, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the good I have done, would much delight me.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here followeth the third Objection to age; they say that it wanteth pleasures. Oh excellent gift of age, if it take away that which makes our youth vitious; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear now, O yee excellent young men, the old oration of [1] <hi>Architas</hi> the Tarentine, a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and worthy man, which was delivered me when I was a young man with <hi>Q. Maximus</hi> at <hi>Tarentum.</hi> He said that there was no dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier plague given by nature tomen, then the pleasure of the body, the greedy lusts whereof are rash and unbrideledly, stirred up to get and gain. From hence are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57078:43"/>
treasons, from hence arise the overthrowes of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and the privy conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and whisperings with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. That to conclude, there was no wickednesse, nor no evill deed, to the undertaking of which, the lust of pleasure did not incite a man; and that whoredome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and all such evill was stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by no other bait then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And forasmuch as nature, or some God, hath given nothing more excellent to a man, then his minde; to this divine gift, there is no greater enemy then pleasure. For lust bearing rule, there is no place for temperance, neither in the Kingdome of pleasure can virtue consist. To the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding whereof, he bade one imagine in his minde some one nusled in as great pleasure as could be, he thought that no man would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57078:44"/>
doubt, but that while he was thus delighted, he could deeply consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nothing in his minde, nor performe any thing by his reason; therefore nothing is so detestable as pleasure, especially if it be great, and of long continnance, for then it cleane extinguisheth the light of the mind. These things [2] <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi> the Tarentine, our friend, who was in the league of <hi>Rome,</hi> said, that <hi>Architas</hi> spake to [3] <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pontius,</hi> the Samnite, his father of whom <note n="*" place="bottom">Cons. An. 333.</note> 
                  <hi>Spurius Posthumus,</hi> and <hi>T. Viturius,</hi> the Consuls were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, in the [4] <hi>Caudine</hi> war, and that he had heard it of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, when there was present at that speech <hi>Plato</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> whom I find to have come to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi>

                  <hi>Lucius Camillus</hi> &amp; <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> being Consuls. But to what end is all this? that you may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57078:44"/>
understand that if we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise pleasure by wisedome and reason, we ought to give great thanks to old age, which brings to passe, that we shall not lust to do that which we ought not to do. For pleasure the enemy of reason hindereth counsell, and as I may so say it blindeth the eyes of the minde, that it cannot have fellowship with vertue. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my will, that I cast [5] <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Flaminius,</hi> the brother to that valiant man <hi>Titus Flaminius,</hi> out of the senate, seven yeers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been Consul; but I thought his lust was noted; for he when he was Consul in <hi>France,</hi> was intreated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head one of his prisoners for sport, by a Harlot in a banquet, which he did; he, his brother <hi>Titus</hi> being Censor, (who was next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me) escaped; but to me

and <note n="*" place="bottom">Censor with Cato.</note> 
                  <hi>Flaccus,</hi> such hainous and wicked lust could not be in any wise allowed, which with his own private shame, might joyn a blot to the Empire. I have often heard it of my Elders, who said that they have heard it of old men, that <hi>Caius Fabritius</hi> was wont to marvell, that when he was Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sad or with King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> he heard [6] <hi>Cinaeas</hi> the Thessalonian say, that there was <note n="*" place="bottom">An Epicure of the sect of Aristippus.</note> one at <hi>Athens,</hi> who professed himselfe a wise man, and affirmed that all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be referred to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and that <hi>M. Curius</hi> and <hi>T. Coruncanus</hi> were wont to wish that he could perswade that thing to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and the Samnits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be the easilier over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when they had given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to pleasure. <hi>Marcus Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57078:45"/>
lived with [7] <hi>Publius Decius,</hi> who in his fourth Consulship, five years before <hi>Curius</hi> was Consul, bequeathed himself to death for the Common-wealth. <hi>Fabritius &amp; Coruncanus</hi> knew him wel, who as wel by the life, as by the deeds of this <hi>Publius Decius</hi> of whom I speak, did judge, that there was some other thing more excellent in its own nature, then pleasure to be followed, which every good man, pleasure being contemned, ought to seek after. But to what end speak we so much of pleasure? because that you may see that no blame, but much praise is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to age, because it doth not lust after pleasure, which is so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut there is not so great a tickling as it were of pleasure in old age, no nor so much as a desire for nothing that is not wanted is desired. <hi>Sophocles</hi> answered well to one that was well in yeares, who demanded of him if he sometimes used not <note n="*" place="bottom">rebus Venereis</note> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lience, nay God forbid quoth he; but I have willingly fled from them as from a cruel and furious master. For to those who do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, it it is grievous to want it; but to them that be satisfied, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57078:50"/>
to be without, so that they want not, that desire not. Therefore I say that it is better not to desire then to injoy. But if youth do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy these pleasures in greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Age also doth not altogether want them. For as in the Play of the [1] Poet <hi>Turpius Ambinius,</hi> he that sitteth in the neerest gallery is more delighted, yet is he also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted that sits in the furthest. So youth beholding pleasures more neere, is peradventure more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but age beholding them afar off, is delighted as much as is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. But how great is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of age, when the mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leafed from the slavery of lusts, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, contention, emnity, and all other such like concupiscence, may be secure, and as they say, live at home with it selfe at rest? But if it have supply, &amp; as I may call it, food of learning and study, there is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57078:50"/>
nothing more pleasant then a quiet old age; we have known that [2] <hi>Caius Gallus</hi> your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers familiar friend <hi>Scipio,</hi> dyed when he had been studious in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology, and Cosmography; how often did he write both night and day? and how much did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to tell us long before, of the Eclipses of the Sunne and of the Moone? Yet is age delighted in more light yet notwithstanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous studies. How did <hi>Nevius</hi> rejoyce in his <hi>Bellum Punicum?</hi> How did [3] <hi>Plautus</hi> delight in his <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culentus?</hi> How in his <hi>Pseudalus?</hi> I have seen also the old man <note n="*" place="bottom">L.

                  <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> who set forth a book six yeeres before I was borne, <hi>Centonus</hi> and <hi>Tutidanus</hi> being Consuls, and he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till my youth; what shall I speak of <hi>Licinius Crassus,</hi> or of the

But these are the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of learning, which surely with the wise and well nurtred, will grow up and increase together with their age? as the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable verse of <hi>Solon</hi> doth import <note n="*" place="bottom">Assidue discens plurima fio senex.</note> that he grew old, learning every day something; then which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of mind, what can be greater?</p>

The countrey-mans businesse lieth on the earth, which never refuseth to be delved, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever doth it render what it hath received, without usury, though some time with lesse, yet for the most part with greater gain. Yet am not I only delighted with the fruit, but also with the nature, and force of the earth it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57078:52"/>
selfe, which after it hath received the seeds into its softened and wrought bosome, first it keeps it in, being harrowed, of whence this word <note n="*" place="bottom">occatio.</note> Harrowing which doth this, is named; afterward being heat with its vapor and embracement, it spreads abroad, and brings forth an herby greennesse, which fastened with the little strings of the root, by little and little increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and being erected upon a knotty stalke, is at the last as it were included in a sheath, out of which when it growes, it yeeldeth fruit like grains, and it is fortified from the biting of the lesser birds, with the defence of the beards. What should I now rehearse the setting, springing, and increase of vines? I must needs say, (that you may know the pleasure and quietnesse of mine age) I cannot be satisfied
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57078:53"/>
with delight. I omit the force of all things nourished by the earth, which of a little graine of a fig, or Grape, bringeth forth such great Trunked bodies, and boughs of Trees; twigs, plants, grafts, sets, roots, do they not so spring as may delight any man with admiration? The vine which by nature is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and growes downwards, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be under-propped, to the end she may erect her selfe, catcheth hold with her windings as with hands, on whatsoever it meets, which as it creeps with manifold turnings, the art O husbandry cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects with a grafting knife, least it should become wilde and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown; therefore in the spring in those branches which be left, it bringeth forth as it were at the joints of the twigs, the buds, of which after commeth the grape, which increasing by the moisture
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57078:53"/>
of the earth, and the heat of the sun, is at the first but bitter, but after growing ripe, it becomes sweet, &amp; being clothed with the broad leavs, it is defended from the scorching of the sun, yet wants it not moderate heat, then which what can be more pleasant to the tast, or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to the eye? the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse whereof doth not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me, as I have said, but also the dressing, and nature of it. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the props, the joyning of the tops, the setting and the tying of the vines, and the cutting of some, and the sparing of others, doth much delight me; what shall I say of the watering, digging, and deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the field, by the which the earth is made much more fruitfull? what shall I say of dunging, and of the profit thereof? I have spoken sufficiently in that book which <hi>I</hi> wrote of countrey businesses, of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57078:54"/>
which learned <hi>Hesiod</hi> made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when he wrote of husbandry. But <hi>Homer</hi> who as it seemeth to me, lived many years before, bringeth in [1] <hi>Laertes</hi> tilling and digging the earth, to lessen and forget the care and grief he had taken for the want of his sonne, who was gone to <hi>Troy;</hi> but countrey-affairs are not only pleasant for corne, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, medows, and groves, but also for gardens, orchards, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of cattle, swarmes of Bees, and all manner of variety of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant flowers; neither doth planting only delight me, but also grafting, then which the art of husbandry hath found out nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57078:55"/>
I am provoked by the delight which I take therein; and indeed old age, (that I may not seem par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, to free it from all faults) is somewhat talkative. But <hi>Marcus Curius</hi> when he had triumphed over the Samnites, the Sabins, and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> spent the last part of his age in that kinde of life; whose farme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house when I behold, (for it is not farre from mine) I cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admire, both the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the man, and his manner of life. The Samnits once brought a a great summe of gold to this <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as he was sitting in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-house by the fire, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it, saying that it was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing in his mind to have gold, but to command them which have gold. Could not such a minde make age pleasant? But I returne to Countrey-men, least I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57078:55"/>
should depart from my self. In those dayes there lived old men and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators in that countrey, so that it was told [1] <hi>Lucius Quintus Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnatus,</hi> that he was created [2] <hi>Dictator,</hi> when he was a plowing in the field; even he at whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand [3] <hi>C. Servilius Hala</hi> slew <hi>Spurius Melius,</hi> who aspired to the Kingdome; <hi>Curius</hi> and others were called out of their farme-houses to the senat, wherof they that weresent for them, were called Viatores; was therefore their age to be called mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, who were thus delighted with husbandry? truly in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, no life is more happy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the tilling it selfe, (which is very healthfull to a mans body) or as I have said in the pleasure, plenty, and abundance of all things, which either appertain to the service of man, or the worship of God. And because some do
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57078:56"/>
much desire this pleasure, let us now close again with pleasure. The Country-cellar of a frugall and diligent master, is alwayes full of wine, and oyl, and his house is replenished with all things needful; it aboundeth with porke, kid, lamb, poultrey, milk, honey, &amp;c. also his garden is to the husbandman another storer, and then hunting and hawking makes his life the sweeter. What should I speake of the greennesse of the meddowes, of the order &amp; fashion of the vines, and olive trees? I will soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there can be nothing more profitable for use, or more pleasant in show, then a well tilled field: To the enjoying of which age doth not hinder, but rather intice and allure us. For where may a man be better warmed in the winter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the sun or the fire, then there, and where better cooled in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57078:56"/>
the summer, either by the shadow of trees, or the rivers of water, then there? therefore young men have their weapons, their horses, their speares, their swimming, the ball, the club, and their races, and they leave to us old men the cards and the tables which we sometimes use when we list; for age may be right happy without them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut you must remember that in all this speech, I have praised only that age, which is built on the foundation of youth, from whence it happened that that speech of mine, wherein I affirmed that age to be miserable, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended it selfe by speech, was so generally applauded of all men; for neither gray haires, nor wrinckles, get authority suddainly, but the honest and vertuous deeds

of the age before spent, obtain the chiefest fruits of authority. For these things are honourable, which do seem but of small account. <hi>v.z.</hi> to be saluted, to be sought unto, to have place given to them, to be risen unto, to be brought in, to be conducted out, and to give counsel, which both among us, and in other well mannerd cities is observed diligently. Tis said that <hi>Lisander</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> of whom I spake even now, was wont to say, that <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was a most fit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest habitation for old age; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where was that age more reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or honoured then there. It comes now to my mind that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain old man at <hi>Athens,</hi> at the plays comming in among the people, no man would give him room; but when he came among the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, (who when they come of an embassage, sit all in one
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57078:61"/>
place) they all rose up to him, and received the old man to sit with them: to whom when great praise was given for the courteous deed, one of them said, that the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans knew good manners, but would not use them. Many excellent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are observed in our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Auguries,</hi> whereof this which we speak of is one, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in their consultations, gives his opinion according to his age, the oldest first, and so down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for Augurs are not only preferred before some that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, but also before many which besides their years and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity are in office; what are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pleasures of the body, to be compared to the rewards of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which whosoever make th use of, seemes to me to have gone well through the enterlude of his life, and not like an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut the young man hopes to live long, which the old man cannot. He hopes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly; sor what is greater folly, then to account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain things for certain, false for true? the old man hath nothing to hope for more; therefore he is in better state then the former, seeing that what the other wisheth for, he hath obtained already; the young man would live long, the old man hath lived long. O you immortall gods, what is there in mans life, that is of any long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57078:65"/>
for let us live long, and we expect the years of the King of the <note n="*" place="bottom">A place neer the sea-shore of Gades.</note> Taresians; for I have seen it written, that there was one <hi>Argan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius</hi> at <hi>Gades,</hi> which reigned eighty years, and lived an hundred and twenty; but to me nothing see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of long continuance, of which there is any end; for when that end shall come, then that which is past flies away like smoak, and that only will remaine, which you have obtained by vertue and good deeds; the houres you see runs on, and the dayes, and the moneths, and the years; neither doth the time past ever return, nor can any tell what will follow. That time which a man hath given him to live, he ought to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it; for a good actor is not applauded in the midst of a Scene, so a wise mans praise comes not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57078:65"/>
till the end. The time of our age is short indeed; but long enough to live well and honestly. But if your age seem longer then your youth, you ought to grieve no more then the husbandman doth, when the sweetnesse of the spring is past, that the summer and the winter are come. For the spring doth as it were signifie youth, and shows what fruit will come; the other seasons of plucking and gathering the fruit, are compared to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times of our age. For the fruit of age as I have said, is the memory of the abundance of good deeds heretofore done; all things which are done by the rules of God, and nature, are to be accounted good; but it is a rule of nature that old men must die, which also hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to young men though they resist it. Therefore a young man seemeth to me to die like
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57078:66"/>
fire put out with water, but old men like fire which being put out by no force, is quietly consumed of it selfe; and as apples on trees being not ripe, are plucked of by violence, but being ripe they fal of themselves: so force taketh away the life of young men, but ripenesse of age the life of old men: which consideration is so pleasant to me, that I seem to behold the eatth, as a quiet port, whether after a long and troublesome navigation I shall arrive. The end of all ages is certain, but the end of old age is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain (which is death,) and a man may live therin uprightly, and contemne death; hence it comes that old men are more bold and hearty then young men, which made that <hi>Solon</hi> answered to [1] <hi>Pysistratus</hi> the Tyrant, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him what made him so bold, he answered, old age. But the end
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57078:66"/>
he answered, old age. But the end of life is then best when nature, (the minde being well, and all the sences perfect) doth dissolve the same work, which she her selfe hath made. For as that workeman which hath made a ship or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, knowes best how to unjoyn it: so the same nature which hath made a man, best dissolves him; that which is newly joyned, is hardly sodered, but old work is easily taken in pieces. Now that little time of life which we have, is not to be greedily desired of old men, nor without cause to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> forbids that unlesse the Emperour (which is God) command; we ought not to depart from our station and guard of life, it is the [2] speech of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the wise, when he wisheth his death to be lamented of his friends. I beleeve he would be dear to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57078:67"/>
them. But I know not if <hi>Ennius</hi> wrote better or no.</p>

               </q>
               <p>It seemes he thinketh not that death to be lamented, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth immortality. Now for the sense or pain of dying, if there be any, it remaineth but a small time, especially in old men. But this ought to be considered of in youth, that wee might learne before to neglect death, without which meditation no man can be of <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

Shall therfore wise and learned old men, feare that which young men, rude, and unletterd have contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Truly me thinks that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety of all things makes also a satiety of life.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57078:68"/>
and there be studies in the last age: therefore as the studies of former ages fail, so do the studies of old age, so that when the satiety or fulnesse of life commeth, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also a fit time for death.</p>

For while we are shut up in the fetters of this body,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57078:70"/>
we performe a certain grievous burden, and duty of necessity. For the soule is divine, and is thrust down from a most heavenly dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and is as it were drowned in the earth, a place contrary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and eternall nature; and surely I thinke that the immortall gods have put soules into men for this cause, that beholding the earth, and the order of the heavens, they should imitate them in the order and constancie of their life; neither doth reason and disputation only drive me to thinke so, but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and opinion of the best Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers. I have heard that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> and the Pythagoreans, that were almost our neighbours, who were called [1] Italian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, never doubted, but that we had our soules chosen out of the most divine essence.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57078:71"/>
men know many things before they are borne, because when they are boyes and learne hard arts, they so swiftly conceive innumerable things, that they seem not then to learne them, but as it were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them again. These are almost the very words of <hi>Plato.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut if you please, let us see a little of our later times; no man shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me <hi>Scipio,</hi> that either your two grandfathers <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> or the Uncle of <hi>Africanus,</hi> or many other excellent men whom it is not now necessary to name; would have indeavoured so much in great affaires, unlesse they had known that in their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity their memory should live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their praise. Do you
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57078:74"/>
thinke (that after the manner of old men, I may boast something of my selfe) that I would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken such paines in the City, and in the Campe, if I should have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my fame together with my life? Were it not better to lead a quiet and peaceable old age, without labour and contention? but I know not by what meanes, the soule lifting it selfe up doth so behold the memory that shall be left to posterity, as if it should then live when it had once died. Which unlesse it were so, that memory remained, and the soule were immortal, scarce would any excellent minde indevour to get renown and glory. But suppose that every wise man dieth with a good soule, and every foole with a bad: doth it not seem to you, that that soule which knoweth more, and is of deeper understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57078:75"/>
doth see that it shall go to a better place then that soule whose intellect is more dull and mortall? Truely I am verry desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to fee your fathers whom I love so well, and I not onely wish to see them whom I have known, but also them of whom I have heard and read; therefore from the place whether I am going, shall no man withhold me, nor from thence as a ball strike mee back; and if any god would grant me to be now a child in my cradle againe, and to be young, I would refuse it. Neither would I, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving runne my full course, be called back again. For what profit hath life, or rather what trouble? but say it have some commodity, yet when it hath a fulnesse and satiety, it ought to have an end. I will not deplore my life forespent, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57078:75"/>
learned men have done; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I repent that I have lived, because I have so lived that I think I was not borne in vaine; and I depart out of this life, as from an Inne, not as from a continuall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; for nature hath given us a place to rest in, not to dwell in. O happy shall that day be, when I shall come into the company and counsell of those men, of whom I spake before, and not onely to them, but to my deare sonne <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> then whom no man was better, or more excellent in piety, whose body was by me interred, which thought to dye before him; but his soule not forgetting me, but continually beholding me, is gone thither, where he perceived that I should come; whose death I did the better beare (not that I take it very patiently) but I comforted
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57078:76"/>
my selfe with this hope, that I should not live long after him. And in these things <hi>Scipio</hi> (for you say that you and <hi>Loelius</hi> were wont to marvell at it) is mine age light, and not onely not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, but also pleasant. But if I do erre that the soules of men bee immortall, I do erre willingly, neither will I while I live be wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from mine opinion wherein I am delighted; but if when I am dead (as some small Philosophers say,) I shall feel nothing, I fear not least the dead Philosophers should laugh at this my error. But if we were not immortall, yet it were to be wished that a man die in his due time; for of nature as of all things else, there is an end. But old age is the last act of our life as of a play, of which there ought to be an end, especially when there
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57078:76"/>
is satiety and fulnesse of time joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it. Thus much I had to say concerning old age, which I wish you may obtain, that those things which you have heard me speak of, you might know by experience.</p>
