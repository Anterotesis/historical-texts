            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Profeſſe with the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the ſame doctrine of Faith and Sacraments eſtabliſhed in the firſt yeare of the raigne of the renowned Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; of which doctrine according to the meaſure of the grace of God I have been Preacher fifty and five yeares, though unworthy of ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord God and Saviour bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Touching the Diſcipline of the Church, to hold that Doctors, Paſtors, ruling Elders and Deacons which is reſtored by the moſt reformed Charches, is to be held Apoſtolicall, univerſall, and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that the Churches of England doe ſinne againſt their Head and only Monarch, in violent oppoſition thereof for the upholding ambitious pompes and worldly Prelacy, which being a humane preſumption at the firſt, being pretended for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Schiſme (a cure more dangerous than the diſeaſe it ſelfe) made way for <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the head of Papacy, with power, and now ſerveth with us to hinder the Churches edification, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a ſhamefull Schiſme againſt all the reformed Churches of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Touching ceremonies, I beleeve the Church hath no authority to ordaine any for pompe or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but only for order and comlineſſe, and that Eccleſiaſticall decrees therein doe binde onely in
<pb facs="tcp:100634:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
caſe of ſcandall and contempt. But decrees for cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the other kindes are ſo far from binding, that in defence of Chriſtiall liberty they ought to be broken; I therefore profeſſe the Ceremonies in queſtion with us unlawfull, for that they be teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes which in Gods worſhip he only may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute; or for that originally they are ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the ſame deviſed by Heretikes and Antichriſt in his Idolatry to captive ſoules, and ſo preſcribed it to be uſed in Gods worſhip; or for that they doe grace Popery and ſcandalize the weake, who for their ſakes conceive the better of Popery; or for that they give Papiſts occaſion to ſcorne our religion and profeſſion who borrow their Ceremonies, and grieve zealous Chriſtians to ſee the Spouſe of Chriſt forced to conforme to the ſtrumpet of Rome, and to weare the tokens of her captivity, which no true Zeale can diſgeſt with patience, neither can it ſtand with hearty repentance for former ſtraying from God; or for that they breake the unity of brethren, ſpoile the Church of faithfull Paſtors, ſtay many from the worke of the Miniſtery, and give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to prophane perſons, and Papiſts, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute true Profeſſors, and make the State guilty of the blood of the righteous, by wearing out their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by many indignities not to be looked for at the hands of brethren; and I doe lament the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bondage of our Church, wherein Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is inthralled with humane preſumptions, which are exalted and inforced with more Zeale than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinances of God, and the ragges of the whore of Babylon injoyned the Spouſe of Chriſt, to the
<pb facs="tcp:100634:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſcorne of all her ſiſters, the Reformed Churches; who together with the doctrine of the man of ſinne have caſt out the Image of the Beaſt his Hierarchy, Archbiſhops, Suffragans, Deanes, Biſhops, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Archdeacons, Commiſſaries, Officials, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, with the Canon Law, Spirituall Courts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations for non-reſidents, that odious ſin reſtraint of marriage, without their diſpenſation (not much differing from the doctrine of devils) with their oathes <hi>ex Officio,</hi> compurgatory cenſures, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of pennance, abſolutions, conſecrations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations, together with all their contrived cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to be the filthy remainder of uncleane Beaſts, ſo doe I humbly deſire the Lord to purge and cleanſe his Church thereof at the length; and as I my ſelfe for the ſpace of fifty five yeares, according to my weake ability, oppoſed thoſe corruptions, and by prayer, ſupplication, conference and ſuffering, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in a Chriſtian peaceable manner the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reformation thereof, ſo doe I earneſtly exhort by the like Chriſtian meanes, all that feare God, love the peace of Jeruſalem, and deſire the crowne of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers, according to your calling, to doe the like; and as theſe times doe require of thoſe that love the Lord Jeſus, an open profeſſion of this cauſe, wherein Chriſt is perſecuted in many of his members, ſo they would not be wanting in this duty at this time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in through the defection of many, others thinke the cauſe forſaken; yet doe I not hold it lawfull for theſe corruptions to ſeparate from the communion of the Church of England, if therein a Chriſtian may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy true doctrine with the Sacraments, from a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb facs="tcp:100634:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
able to teach the truth, and where in the worſhip of God he is not forced by a perſonall act to approve of thoſe corruptions.</p>
            <p>Touching the civill Mageſtrate, I acknowledge our dread ſoveraigne King <hi>Charles</hi> is ſupreame gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor over all perſons in his Dominions, by civill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſuppreſſe all falſe worſhip, to compell all to the meanes of faith and knowledge of the truth which is according to godlineſſe, to force all Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters to a faithfull execution of the duties of their place injoyned by our bleſſed Saviour, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the remaining corruptions in the diſcipline, ſervice and ceremonies of the Church, according to the order of Gods word; and though I hold him ſubject to all the ordinances of Chriſt in his Church, ſerving to the ſalvation of men, yet doe I deny him to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any perſon, forraigne or domeſticall touching his life, liberty, crowne or dignity, or to any other forraigne or domeſticall cenſure by whomſoever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>
            <p>This confeſſion I ſet downe under mine hand, as my laſt act in this kind, as a fruit of mine age, which is eighty ſeven yeares, and brought out in a ſerious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of my appearing ſhortly before the judge of all fleſh, who only knoweth my heart, and to whom only I ſhall ſtand or fall; his judgements I feare, and doe humbly crave pardon for all mine infirmities in this profeſſion, as for all my other ſins, but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance of this profeſſion, as I know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo I appeale to his all ſeeing ſpirit, whether I have in hypociſie, contrary to the full perſwaſion of my heart, lived ſo long therein, indeavoured ſo much for
<pb facs="tcp:100634:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, and now am ready to dy therein; Let this ſuffice to ſtop the mouthes of ſlanderers, who incroaching upon the office of God, cry out of mens hypocriſie, who being (as they ſay) convinced in their conſciences, doe yet for ſiniſter reſpects, continue the profeſſion of the cauſe, as an Archprelate openly traduced as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a man as himſelfe, in the High Commiſſion Court, not long ſince, whereas alſo he caſt out many unſavory ſpeeches and reproaches, unbeſeeming a man of God and chiefe Father of Paſtors (as forſooth he would be taken to be) and unworthy ſo many well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Preachers of the Goſpel, whoſe right hand of Fellowſhip himſelfe would not have ſcorned while King <hi>Iames</hi> ſtood indifferent in the cauſe; be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that King <hi>Iames</hi> have forſaken this cauſe, which had his firſt love under his hand, witneſſed by many workes, and namely by interceding for Mr. <hi>Thomas Cartwright,</hi> and others, impriſoned for this cauſe through the falſe ſuggeſtions of ambitious men, who (fearing to loſe the fat morſels of their large rewards) abuſed the ſtate by untrue ſurmiſes, which they were never able to make good; And be it ſince that ſhew of a diſpute in the cauſe at Hampton Court, wherein men were purpoſely choſen to undertake our cauſe, who (excepting one reverend Father) never tooke the cauſe to heart, as men that peſent themſelves in an act upon a Stage; be it (I ſay) rhat ever ſince that time our cauſe hath loſt many lovers by death, many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Miniſters and others by defection, yet the cauſe is the ſame it was, when it was eſteemed holy by the beſt profeſſors that were; when it was embraced by ſo many reformed Churches, and as it was in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:100634:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſo many reverend men which ever have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, for all the violent and unkinde oppoſition made thereto; and as the cauſe remaines the ſame it was, ſo I thanke my God that by his grace I affect it no whit the leſſe, but am aſſured it is a truth of God, wherein after fifty five yeares labour in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpell, after much reading what hath been written on both ſides, after many conferences with worthy brethren of indifferent judgement, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers to the Father of lights; laſtly, upon advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deliberation and conſideration of the effects that have enſued the perſecutions, I gladly end my daies, and with joy doe beare it in my boſome into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and doe hope, and in my beſt prayers doe beſeech him to raiſe up daily faithfull men to contend for the truth of God againſt all gain-ſayers.</p>
