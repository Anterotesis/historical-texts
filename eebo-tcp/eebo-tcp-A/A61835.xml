            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>But let your Communication be yea yea, and nay nay; for whatsoever is more then these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of Evill.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the Order of a Common wealth, so in that of the Universe, the Priority of Duty belongs to the Supreame Head, then a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate proportion to our Fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> this is the great Command; <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy selfe,</hi> this is but like unto it: the first Table exceedes the second as well in weight as in words; because the higher Object gives it the heavier scale. And in duties of the first Table, Aw of Gods holy Name is not the least: these three, <hi>Fidelity, Reverence,</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> doe summe up the whole draft of divine worship; the first hath reference to his <hi>sole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> the second to his <hi>holy Name,</hi> the third to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of his <hi>Publick worship:</hi> next to his <hi>Nature</hi> is his <hi>Name,</hi> which followes it as the shadow waites on the Body. Wherefore the <hi>Order,</hi> in which the Reverence of his Name is rank'd, declares the weight of the <hi>Duty.</hi> And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100697:3"/>
this I premise to raise a more awfull attention to the words of my Text; as directly ayming at the observance thereof. <hi>Let your Communication be yea yea, and nay nay; for whatsoever is more then these commeth of Evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein I propose to your Consideration three notions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A silent toleration of an Oath in case of necessity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the case here put is not <hi>necessary</hi> but <hi>common.</hi> 2. An expresse Limitation of our words in Communication or common Talke, <hi>Let your Communication be yea yea, nay nay, no more.</hi> 3. A reason of such Limitation, because <hi>whatsoever is more then these commeth of Evill.</hi> Briefly thus; how an Oath may be used, how not, and why not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these are the Parts.</p>
            <p>First, in cases of necessity an Oath is tolerable; for what is an Oath, but <hi>the calling of God to witnesse, for decision of doubtfull matters which otherwise cannot be made evident</hi>; so <hi>Philo</hi> defines it, to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Testimony of God in a matter doubtfull. <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiall Propositions</hi> are confirm'd by <hi>Reason, particular Contingents</hi> meerly by <hi>Testimony</hi>: as it is ridiculous to prove a generall Proposition by an Oath, so it is vaine to prove a particular Fact by Reason. Now humane Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is oftentimes so thin and weake, that it cannot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Truth; both because on the Speakers part there is <hi>aptnesse of Lying,</hi> and also on the Hearers a <hi>hardnesse of Beliefe</hi>; a weake Eye cannot penetrate a deceitfull heart. Therefore to supply these defects, slippery <hi>Mendacity</hi> and ignorant <hi>Incredulity,</hi> man in weighty matters knowes not whither to flye, but onely to <hi>divine testimony</hi>; and so by an Oath calls him to witnesse, whose Knowledge is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall, whose Truth infallible; whereby he can neither be deceived, nor deceive others. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100697:3"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (according to <hi>Procopius</hi>) the last and most certaine pawne of Credit.</p>
            <p>In case of Exigence we may use this Pawne under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers formes, an Oath <hi>Assertory</hi> of things past or present, an Oath <hi>Promissory</hi> of things to come; And each of them may be utter'd either by <hi>simple Attestation</hi> seeming to call God only as a <hi>witnesse</hi>; or by <hi>Execration and Cursing</hi> conditionally added upon our selves, when he is call'd as <hi>a Judge</hi> too: and so againe either by citing Gods <hi>owne</hi> Name, or his <hi>Creatures</hi> wherein His Majesty and Truth appeares; as the principall parts of Nature, the meanes of Redemption, instruments of Grace, Gospells, Sacraments, and the like. Our Saviour in the words before my Text hath reduc'd all Oathes by what creature soever, high or low, great or small, Naturall or Artificiall, without or within us, to God their Author and Ruler, present and powerfull in them; wherefore being so refer'd in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ption, they ought to be so refer'd in our Intention and use; that in Swearing we neither make too little of them by Falshood or Levity, as if God were not in them; nor too much by Idolatry, as if they were Gods themselves. Some holier things, wherein the Divine Truth is more clearly manifested, if expresly terminated on God, (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul terminates the Rejoycing, by which he Sweares, in Christ Jesus,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31.) may be used in a secondary way of Attestation; that God by Them may make the Truth appeare: but these, as well as other Creatures, are more properly cited in Cursing; and an Oath by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Name, in the safest sense, is an <hi>Imprecation,</hi> that divine Judgement may be exercis'd on Falshood, through the things which we love and use. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in another place, joynes an <hi>Attestation</hi> and <hi>Execration</hi> under one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100697:4"/>
               <hi>mixt</hi> forme, <hi>I call God for a Record upon my Soule,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.<hi>v.</hi> I call God for a Record, there's the <hi>Attestative</hi> part, upon my Soule, there's the <hi>Execrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These wayes of assevering and establishing the Truth, though some of them be more liable to danger and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of abuse, (for which cause the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> punish'd a Clerke Swearing by the Creature) yet all, if rightly order'd, are allowable: but a right Oath by Gods owne Name, is not onely Lawfull, but Laudable and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; Laudable in the Judgement of holy <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 63.12.<hi>v. All they that sweare by him shall be commended</hi>; Religious in the most generall esteeme of the Schoole: both because it proceedes from a good <hi>Ground,</hi> Faith in Gods <hi>Omniscience</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and because it tends to a good <hi>End</hi> mentioned by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.<hi>v.</hi> namely the <hi>End of Strife</hi>; as in the making of Leagues, Promise of Allegiance, Trialls of Law, Compurgation of Fame, and the like. The Act it selfe, unlesse it want these necessary Relations, or miscarry in the manner, is Pious and Reverent. Wherefore the Scripture measures out the due Conditions, <hi>Thou shalt sweare the Lord liveth, in Judgement, in Truth, and in Righteousnesse. Jer.</hi> 4.2. In Judgement <hi>Discreetly,</hi> when the cause is found weighty, the doubt difficult, and an Oath necessary, That belongs to the <hi>Person</hi>; In Truth <hi>Sincerely,</hi> when the Matter is well knowne to be so, That belongs to the <hi>Matter</hi>; in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse <hi>Honestly,</hi> that Justice may be fulfilled, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>End.</hi> The <hi>Rash</hi> Swearer through want of <hi>Judgement</hi> vilifies the Majesty of God, the <hi>Perjurd</hi> through want of <hi>Truth</hi> calls him to witnesse a Lye, the <hi>Wicked</hi> through want of <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> useth him as a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Iniquity. And therefore where these are supposed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100697:4"/>
to be wanting, as in Children not come to Discretion, and in Perjur'd men past Truth and Honesty, an Oath is by no meanes allowable. If onely the principall Condition be deficient, if an Oath <hi>Assertory</hi> be found to want <hi>Truth,</hi> or an Oath <hi>Promissory</hi> to want <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> the one is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,</hi> the other not <hi>Obligatory</hi>; Law shewes the first, and Conscience tells us concerning the second, that one Sinne cannot oblige us to commit another, nor a sinne in word to second it with a sinne in worke, for sinne ought to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off as soone as possibly it may. Wherefore <hi>David</hi> without scruple blesseth God and <hi>Abigail,</hi> for staying him in the prosecution of a rash and bloody Oath. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. <hi>cap.</hi> To whom should an injust Oath oblige us? to <hi>God,</hi> or to <hi>Man</hi>? whether it were taken Rashly in Error or Passion, whether it were taken violently by Coaction, or willingly with Deliberation, or mixtly betwixt Will and Force for Deliverance out of present trouble, yet if the Matter or End be unrighteous, or impedient to Charity, certainly it obliges not to God, because it was contrary to Gods will; which ought to take place of our owne, upon second and better Thoughts. Much lesse can it oblige to Man; especially when it is impos'd Fraudulently, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsively, or without just Authority, because the Imposer deserves to be deceiv'd, and to beare the Imputation of that perjury which he obtruded on others. I grant, that since every Oath is of a binding Nature, it cannot but some way bind the Person in himselfe, either with a True Intention, or with Guilt of Perjurd collusion. For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to Gods Name requires Truth of Intention; but when the Matter is unrighteous, Gods word forbids Execution; and when by <hi>Satans</hi> device, Gods Name is set up against Gods Word, and Truth against Rigteousnesse,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100697:5"/>
no wonder if intention and execution agree not; for as Truth carries the one, so the other is to be swayed by Righteousnesse. In this absur'd opposition, which ought to be prevented by not Swearing, the Swearer is so intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that which way soever he turne, he is actually Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, by Swearing either what he intends not, or what he ought not to performe, but to falsifie, though he intended. And therefore since in this Case <hi>Juramentum ligat non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligat,</hi> since the unlawfull Oath binds the Conscience with Guilt of a bad Promise, though truly made, but not to more guilt of wicked Performance, it remaines that the Oath past be recalled by Repentance; hearty Repentance for shrinking under Gods Triall, for taking his Sacred Name in Vaine, and incurring a Denyall of him before Men. Now at length since a firme Oath must be joyntly held up with these holy Conditions, appointed by God, it selfe so upheld must needs be Holy. If rightly taken, 'tis a peice of <hi>Religious worship</hi>: and not without faire ground from other Scripture, <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serve him, and Sweare by his Name. Deut.</hi> 6.13. there Swearing is commanded, and plac'd as the next Neighbour to divine Service. For to give God the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to end all Strife at the sound of his Name, as duely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing to him, all Power, Knowledge, and Truth, is to yeeld him Honour and Reverence. <hi>For verily a Man sweareth by the Greater.</hi> Heb. 6.16. <hi>per quem veneratur aut diligit,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100697:6"/>It is Remarkeable, that none are absolutely averse from all Swearing but the reputed Enemies of Obedience, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers of Order, Friends to Lying and Hypocrisie; who having now gotten some power into their hands are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greatest Exacters of Swearing. Whereby it is the more evident, that Judiciall Swearing is of necessary use.</p>
            <p>The chiefest Objection against all Oathes is drawne from the words before my Text, <hi>ye have heard it said, Thou shalt not for sweare, but shalt performe</hi> (or <hi>render</hi>) <hi>to the Lord thine Oathes; but I say unto you, Sweare not at all; neither by Heaven for it is Gods Throne, nor by</hi> that which followes. To answer this, the Scope of the Context must be exactly weighed. The Jewes, by Pharisaicall Tradition, or wicked practice, understood the places of <note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 19.12. Deut. 6.13. Num. 30.2.</note> Scripture summ'd up by our Saviour, to be first a Prohibition of Swearing <hi>falsly,</hi> by Gods Name <hi>onely,</hi> secondly an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Swearing by Gods Name <hi>Truely</hi>: False Swearing by the name of Creatures they did not esteeme Perjury; True Swearing by the Name of God, though needlesse, they did not esteeme unlawfull; whereas the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which forbids <hi>to sweare by his Name Falsly,</hi> forbids also <hi>to Prophane his Name. Lev.</hi> 19.12. <hi>v.</hi> according to the sense of the third Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in Vaine</hi>; for <hi>Vaine</hi> includes both False and needlesse: and againe the same Scripture which allows Swearing by his great Name, interdicts the Name of others. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13.<hi>v. Thou shalt sweare by his Name, and ye shall not goe after other Gods.</hi> Wherefore that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Interpretation Christ clearly purges, and in one word perfects the Law, <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi> As he that speakes not at all cannot Lye, so he that sweares not at all cannot For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare,<note place="margin">

Wherefore <hi>Caietan</hi> grants the generall substance to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prohibited, as it stands <hi>Naked,</hi> for so it becomes irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; but as it stands <hi>invested with due Circumstance,</hi> whereby it becomes necessary, so he construes it lawfull. <hi>Luther</hi> hath well endeavour'd to clear this point, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Christs Sermon together with his Auditors; here he instructs not the <hi>Maegistrate,</hi> but the <hi>People,</hi> and divers things are unfit for them in their owne Persons, which may become fit under the Magistrates command: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Prohibition of Swearing is to be understood like that of Anger and Killing: neither of them is permitted to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100697:7"/>
the Communalty, nor to the Magistrate himselfe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon businesse, but to them that are called, and when they are called to the work of Justice: so that ordinarily the safe way is here prescribed; be not Angry at all, Sweare not at all; not of your owne wills, not in your triviall affaires, but onely when you are not your selves, when God through the Power of the Magistrate, or the necessity of the Cause, according to Justice or Charity, shall call you. For then your anger is Gods anger not yours, and likewise your Oath not yours but Gods. As killing without Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance is forbidden, so Swearing with Circumstance is commanded; but as there the conditionall Negative is reduceable to a Positive, so here the conditionall Positive is reduced to a Negative; yet both these Acts with due Condition are serviceable unto God. So then the use of an Oath is not forbidden, but the Vanity wherein consists the abuse.</p>
            <p>If it be utterly unlawfull to pronounce the Name of the Almighty, why hath he then a Name? how shall we praise him, or pray unto him? If it be objected that an Oath is not <hi>absolutely</hi> directed to <hi>Gods worship,</hi> but <hi>respectively,</hi> as ayming at the clearing of Truth for <hi>humane benefit,</hi> the like may be said of <hi>Prayer,</hi> that it aymes at our owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Well-fare, yet the Benefit expected abates not the Religious Reverence performed in either. For the Beneficiall Result of Divine Attestation,<note place="margin">

Q.</hi> 89. <hi>Ar.</hi> 5.</note> (which <hi>Caietan</hi> disdaines to call the End as being lesse Noble then the meanes) is but Extrinsecall and Appendant to the Essence of Swearing, which rather consists in the Religious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Divine Attestation; and the dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so elevates the Induction of his Testimony, that we ought to be more taken up with performance of due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100697:7"/>
thereto belonging, then with expectation of the benefit ensuing; as also in Prayer, whatsoever our desires are, we submit them to the overruling will of God. Doth Prayer referre all things to his Glory? So likewise the last and principall fruit of an Oath, to which it may be Piously ordein'd, is the Glory of God, arising from the ending of humane Controversie. And then what hinders but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Benefit may subordinatly consist with Gods glory, as well in the act of man as in the Act of God? God sent his Son a Ransome for Man, a Price infinitely beyond the Purchase, and a means immeasurably beyond the End; yet not unfitly or Ingloriously, because the Salvation of Man tends lastly to the glory of God. So when divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is rightly called to be the meanes of Concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Men, 'tis not called Irreligiously, or but Carnally, because this Citation of Gods Name, both begins with Reverence, and concludes with his Glory.</p>
            <p>So much for this Point; wherein you have heard, that by reason of humane Infirmities, mendacity and Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, an Oath in weighty cases not otherwise to be clear'd, is allowable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of what kind soever it be; whether Asserto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Promissory, simply Attestating or Execrating, by the proper Name of God, or by his Might in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; because an Oath having a good Ground, Faith in Gods Excellence, and a good end, decision of doubtfull Strife, being also accompanied with requisite Conditions, Judgement, Truth, and Righteousnesse, without which it cannot stand firme, redounds to Gods Honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; by attributing unto him undeniable Authority, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of Knowledge, and Infallibility of Truth. That God hath in divers Cases both allowed and commanded Swearing; and that his Saints, his Apostle, his Angell,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100697:8"/>
and himselfe have practised the same: that the absolute Rejecters of Swearing, who now for advantage are turn'd Exactors thereof, are men of more then suspected integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that the generall prohibition of all Oathes, before my Text, extends not to the substance of Swearing but the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent manner, or not to the substance invested with due Circumstance, but as it stands naked, and so forbids it not in all Cases before a Magistrate, but under all Formes in Communication: that an Oath taken with exact care or Reverence, and all attending Conditions, doth not onely serve ourselves, but God in chiefe. So from establishing the use of an Oath, I proceed to cut off the abuse, by the Limitation of your Talke in my next poynt. <hi>Let your Communication be yea yea, and nay nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not your Deposition, your Sanction or Confirmation, not your Evidence or Testimony, but your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies Speech or Discourse; and so the sense is, <hi>Let your Talke or mutuall Communication be no more then barely Affirmative or Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the doubling of <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> many Conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures may be yeelded: It may beare a Relation to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons conferring, let such Limitation of Talke be mutuall; or a Relation to the matter spoken of, <hi>quod affirmandum affirma, quod negandum nega,</hi> (saith <hi>Cajetan</hi>) if the matter be so, so say, if otherwise, say no: or since Truth hath a threefold Residence, Objectively in the matter, Formally in the mind, Representatively in words, and since Truth of words should carry a double Conformity, with mind and matter, therefore yea is doubled; yea yea for Heart and Tongue, for Word and Deed; and so there will be no need of an Oath. Or rather the second yea is added to stint the former, and to exclude Swearing, let your Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100697:8"/>
be meerly Affirmative, <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay,</hi> according to S. <hi>James. c.</hi> 5.12. <hi>v.</hi> or lastly, to strengthen the Asseveration, as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Dreame was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by doubling it, and as the practice of our Saviour shewes, <hi>Amen Amen, Verily Verily I say unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pure Affirmation and Negation without the staring Embroydery of Oathes is sufficient for Common dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; because things familiarly spoken are either credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else have no absolute necessity of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Where nothing more then Affirmation is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, why should more be strain'd. To lift a Feather with both hands and with strong Engines, to hoot alowd where a whisper is better heard, is it not ridiculous?</p>
            <p>If frequent Lying had not begot a just Incredulity, I see not why an hearty Asseveration might not supply the place of an Oath, even in the weightiest matters; and then the Lyar might be esteemed and censured no otherwise then now the Perjur'd: the same Figure put in a higher place carries ten times more Value: so we find that the bare word of an approved honest man passeth for an Oath; so should the word of a Priest by the Credit of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and the word of a Peere by the vertuous Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Honour. The <hi>Essens</hi> (saith <hi>Josephus</hi>) <hi>accounted him a Convict Liar, whose word would not passe without the Suretiship of God.</hi> We never find that our Saviour swore at all, though he uttered things of greatest consequence: for indeed his works did sufficiently confirme his words: Mans voyce passeth through the Eare onely, but Gods through the Eye also;<note place="margin">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100697:9"/>
of the Lord.</hi> Grant me therefore a Heart transparent in word, Reall Truth conformable to the Divine Patterne, let these grow habituall amongst us, then me thinkes all our businesse may well be transacted without such strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Credit. Or if a <hi>single</hi> Affirmation will not sufface, let it be <hi>doubled,</hi> as here in my Text; two yeas may stand for an Oath, two nayes for an Execration: especially when the Forme hath beene recommended by our Saviour. Doubtlesse this is the way of Perfection, pointed out by his Instruction, to them that desire it: Christ would have his so simple, as not to <hi>Deceive,</hi> so Candid, as not to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Jerome</hi> is bold to affirme <hi>that Swearing by Gods Name was allowed to the Jewes as to Children, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the use of Sacrifice, to prevent Idolatry; that the Stature of Evangelicall Truth will not owne it, since every word of the Faithfull ought to weigh with an Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howsoever, though the malignity of the world require, that in arduous affaires of inextricable doubt, an Oath be still indulg'd; yet let us use this our Priviledge modestly; let us honour God in this our weaknesse; let not the use of his Name descend to obvious and familiar Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there a double yea is superabundant: no Colour, no Pretext for more there: an Oath there taken destroyes the End for which it is allowed, and instead of Credence begets more Incredulity, more suspition: because the <hi>Bond of Confirmation</hi> is so cheaply esteemed.</p>
            <p>Swearing was never commanded <hi>Absolutely,</hi> but either <hi>Comparatively</hi> that men might rather sweare by the <hi>True</hi> God then by a <hi>False,</hi> or <hi>Respectively</hi> out of urgent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or <hi>Circumstantially</hi> with due Conditions: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it may be good <hi>in it selfe,</hi> 'tis not good <hi>for it selfe,</hi> not good like <hi>Health</hi> but like <hi>Physick</hi>; which may

be used for <hi>Necessity,</hi> but ought not to be desired and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented because of the <hi>Danger.</hi> If an Oath be but Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for Incredulity, take heed to thy selfe; for Physick swallowed without a Cause breedes sicknesse. <hi>Above all things Sweare not</hi> (saith S. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>least ye fall into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>

Though Danger be not considerable in case of necessity, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware least the past Act of necessity dispose thee to habit. Things not Absolutely, but Occasionally good, ought to be used <hi>Rarely,</hi> and with ponder'd Circumstance. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute an Offender is Lawfull, but not to kill on particular pleasure, or in Passion: Though an Oath may be taken Religiously and safely, as occasion shall require, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to hurle it forth, is most <hi>Irreligious,</hi> and therefore most <hi>Banefull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is most Irreligious, will some appeare. Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity betwixt unequalls takes of respect, whensoever it is challeng'd; and things most glorious are soyld by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary use; so is the name of the Almighty; it looses its due Reverence by obvious usurpation, insomuch that it failes of its binding vertue in matters of weight.</p>

            <p>'Tis easily observable, that we scarce name our friends or earthly superiours without a formall respect; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we move the Hat, and sometimes we put it off, then to use the name of God unnecessarily and Irreverently is as much as to say, God is neither our <hi>Friend</hi> nor <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> O wretched disrespect, where the Proportion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due is infinitely greater? would the Swearing Lord, or forswearing Gallant, take it well himselfe, to be lightly talk'd of, to be call'd <hi>Dick</hi> or <hi>Tom</hi> by a rude pesant? if such language be sawcy and rustick concerning himselfe, how presumptuous and prophane is his owne touching the Lord of Lords?</p>
            <p>But an Oath is more then the bare <hi>Naming</hi> of God; it calls him to <hi>witnesse,</hi> a businesse not light, howsoever vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified through Custome, but of dreadfull weight. The Supreme Judge of all Gods and People is called from his Throne to become a witnesse; he is summoned by his Providence to declare the Truth; if not presently, yet:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100697:10"/>
(as surely he will) to doe it hereafter, and to execute <hi>Judgement</hi> on the Falsifier.</p>
            <p>To cite an ordinary honest man, or call him into <hi>publick</hi> for proof of a frivolous matter, perhaps a false one, is very discourteous and unfriendly: What is it then to cite thy God for nothing but an empty phrase, a noyse of no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, a thing more worthy to be false then true, some foolish vanity or filthy Act. Reduce an Oath to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of its meaning; and then consider how absonous it would sound, though God were thy Vassall or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Goe to thy Slave, and say thus unto him; Lend me thy hand in this Folly, or in this mischiefe; for my sake doe this piece of Injustice, and break a brace of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, the third by Swearing, and the ninth by false witnesse: will not thy Slave start back as from a Fiend or Monster? yet thus in effect thou invokest thy God; Lord strengthen my words with false witnesse, cover my shame by colouring my Falshood; thou, my God, steward my Cosenage, and hide it under the shadow of thy Name, from thine owne Eye, and the Eye of man; serve the way of thy worme thou that art infinite, and of thy goodnesse further my sinne. Art thou ashamed thus to bespeake thy Vassall, and hast thou no Regard of thy Heavenly Lord and Father? what thinkest thou? doest thou beleeve he heares thee, and is every where present? if so, how <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent</hi> is thy Brow? if not, how <hi>Atheisticall</hi> is thy mind? Stay stay, thou needest not call him, he is too neare alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so neare that he stands betwixt the Lips which thou openest and shuttest with an Oath.</p>
            <p>O shamelesse practice, that God should be mentioned more in <hi>Oathes</hi> then in <hi>Prayers,</hi> or in those immediately after these; that the <hi>Creed</hi> should be runne over in such
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100697:11"/>
               <hi>horrible Confession</hi>; that our <hi>Religion</hi> should most appeare in our <hi>Sinne,</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> in the worke of <hi>Infidelity.</hi> No soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we come from Church, where we bow at the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> but we may heare a mouth fling it out with lesse heed then spittle, carelesse how it goes, or where it lights; we may heare him torne and rack'd againe in every part, worse then Jewishly; because to no End at all; his wounds are ript up, his heart melts, his blood runnes out, his feet are nailed, all his Passion is repeated; and for no mans good, but the Speakers meere Condemnation.</p>
            <p>To bridle the mouth, and keep it from such rude sinne, first ponder your words before you garnish them with Oathes; weigh them like Gold in the Ballance; consider whereto they tend; understand your owne meaning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you lash out with your Tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a Birth deliver'd before it is Conceiv'd must needs be monstrous; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be dumbe, then speake that which ought to be recall'd. By thus brideling the mouth in the <hi>matter</hi> of Speech, your heat and folly will be throughly quell'd in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; when you take care to speake <hi>Wisely, Truely,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,</hi> you will be quite taken off from speaking <hi>Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi> If Opposition tempt thee to Sweare, doe not onely examine how great the matter is, how true, how well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; but in what case and temper you are; how pure in Body, how pure in Soule; before what Company, at what Time, in what Place, with what Reverence, to what End you Sweare. If still the Name of God run hastily on thy Tongue, marke how an Oath becomes <hi>another,</hi> (for some learne better by Example of Vice then by the Rule of Vertue, because it is easier to observe the Faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then their owne Duties) mark how there it sounds, and then reflect on <hi>thy selfe.</hi> Remember also, that He by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100697:11"/>
whom thou Swearest, as he is <hi>ever present,</hi> so he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> able to turne thee instantly into the Curse which thou utterest, or into the Ayre which thou breathest in Swearing.</p>
            <p>To summe up this Poynt, you have heard that a bare Assertion or at least a double one, where there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Credence, as in common talke, is full sufficient; that if Lying were laid aside, the weightiest matters would need no Swearing, and that such singlenesse of Speech would come nearest to Christian Perfection; that albeit some Cases may require a Toleration, yet in slight dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, an Oath is without colour, not without great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: that being not absolutely but respectively good, like medicinall help reserv'd for necessity, it proves dangerous and pernicious, if used wantonly: that also it looseth its Majesty and Vertue by unseasonable use, and that nothing is Sacred unlesse it be secluded; that S. <hi>Paul</hi> is no patterne for common Swearers; that to reverence the Name of a Friend, and yet to prophane the Name of God, is great Inequality; that God is not onely named in vayne by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Oathes, but cited as a witnesse and Judge; and most Injuriously to no purpose, yea worse then none; never man so used: that Swearing is strangely turned to a Map of Religion; that for a restrayning Remedy, suspension of words, Consideration of Circumstance, observation of others, Remembrance of Divine Presence and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ought to be interposed. To pull the reignes yet stricter, let me passe to my last Poynt, the Reason here given of this Restriction, because <hi>whatsoever is more then yea and nay is of Evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not whatsoever is more by Addition of any <hi>pure Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative,</hi> such as our Saviour used, but whatsoever is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100697:12"/>
more by Superaddition of <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> is of Evill.</p>
            <p>Not alwayes Evill <hi>it selfe</hi> (unlesse in Communication) but <hi>of Evill</hi> howsoever, (as divers observe:) the same Reason which insinuates that an Oath is tolerable in some Cases, shewes that in all Cases 'tis occasioned from Evill. <hi>Dum jurare cogeris, scies ex Infirmitate eorum venire qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aliquid suades, quae uti<expan>
                     <am>

                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Infirmitas malum est,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin</hi>; Indeed the aptitude of Lying in the Speaker as well as hardnesse of Beliefe in the hearer, which must needs call for an Oath to reconcile them, are both Evills of humane Infirmity, the one is <hi>malum Culpae</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>malum Poenae.</hi> Now though it follow not, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is occasioned from Evill is Evill too, since good medicines are occasioned from bad Diseases, and Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is most tolerable when it is most urged by Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet this will follow, that because Swearing is but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally good, and upon bad occasion too, therefore it is not to be affected nor used without necessity.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is more, more then yea yea in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is of the <hi>Evill One,</hi> so <hi>Theophylact</hi> understands it, and not unfitly: for we read not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which word, with the Article prefixt, is an usuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of the <hi>Divell</hi>; and the Devill, rightly denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>De Evill,</hi> is the subtile suggester of all Spirituall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; especially of common Swearing. Would you know where his Cunning is most <hi>evidently Operative?</hi> First, where is no <hi>Inclination by Nature,</hi> where neither <hi>Pleasure</hi> nor <hi>Profit,</hi> the baytes of the <hi>Flesh</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> invite us to a Sin, as neither inviteth us to common Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that Sin plainly proceedes from the <hi>Devill.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where from things <hi>usefull</hi> Evill is contracted, or from <hi>unconsidered beginnings</hi> not apparently dangerous, not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100697:12"/>
presently banefull, <hi>horrible Consequents</hi> grow in the End, as from <hi>rare</hi> Swearing by God, or <hi>petty</hi> but <hi>common</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by Creatures, there he is busie. Thirdly, where the Consequents are most suitable to the Devills maine <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the <hi>Dishonour of God</hi> and the <hi>Breach of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> there he hath been shrewdly working: now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearing serves him in both these, by making the Name of God familiar, and the Bond of Truth disestee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and suspected: by such worke, you may soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the worker. Now God deliver the wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who under the sacred sound of Gods Name, hath the Devill so strong on his Tongue.</p>
            <p>When the Tempter hath once entered his Disciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veine of swearing, it flowes from their own <hi>Evill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> too, most grosly and variously.</p>
            <p>First, from <hi>Irreverence</hi> of God, whose Excellence and infinite Majesty we doe not seriously consider. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of his greatnesse seldome sinkes into our hearts, and therefore his Name is so familiar on our <hi>Tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also from <hi>Inadvertence</hi>; we call on God with lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention then we call a Boy; we name him heedlesly, as we touch the face or stirre our hayre, not mindeing what we doe. Or in a nearer similitude, we sweare by him as we Pray unto him, with one knee, or a knee halfe bowd, with one Elbow, a sleepy Head and a wandring Thought, least regarding that only thing which we are about. Thus through custome our sinnes passe by Vs, like house-hold people, without observance.</p>
            <p>Also it comes from <hi>much Idle talking</hi>; the Torrent of speech carries Oathes along with it, as a violent streame teares downe Trees and Trash.</p>
            <p>Especially, where is <hi>want of Literature</hi>: he that loves
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100697:13"/>
to heare his owne sound, through barrennes of cleanly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is forced to fill the gap of his speech with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation, and to swell his phrase with lofty Oathes, a peice of Rhetorick learnt from the Divell.</p>
            <p>Also it much prevailes through <hi>want of breeding:</hi> for they who are brought up to speak with Reverence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in their youth, will not be so rash of Tongue in their Age. If swearing Roysters had ever duly regarded their Parents (unlesse their Parents were as bad) they would shew more Reverence to their heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>Also it flowes from <hi>Lying,</hi> which seekes to deceive by the sacred bond of <hi>Credit, Swearing</hi> and <hi>Lying</hi> are joyned together by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> c. 4. v. 2. Therefore I wonder how valiant <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who most detest the <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Lying,</hi> should give such suspicion thereof by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Swearing.</hi> When the Lord of Hosts led forth his people to War, the Camp was not onely the schoole of holinesse,<note place="margin">Deut. 23.9.</note> (<hi>When the Host goeth forth against thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies then keep thee from every wicked thing</hi>) but also the Schoole of Cleanlinesse, <hi>Thou shalt have a Paddle upon thy Weapon; when thou wilt ease thy selfe abroad, thou shalt digge therewith, and shalt turne back and cover that which commeth from thee, for the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy Camp to deliver thee, therefore shall thy Camp be holy that he see no uncleane thing in thee,</hi> Deut. 23.9. Shall there now be lesse care of keeping the <hi>mouth</hi> cleane, then once of covering <hi>Excrements,</hi> lesse respect now of <hi>God himselfe,</hi> then once of the <hi>Ground</hi> under foot? consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the foulenesse of the <hi>Sin,</hi> how I pitty the poore <hi>Sinner,</hi> who being likely to come to a present account of <hi>idle words,</hi> cares not though his last breath be spent in <hi>Swearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100697:13"/>But there are more Causes of Swearing, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Souldiers then Lying: for it comes also from <hi>Vaine Glory</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some thinke it a gallant grace to send out a Voly of Oathes roundly, loudly, and boldly; as if they durst crack against the Thunderer, and brave God to his face. O simple! this is Mettle.</p>
            <p>Also from <hi>untamed Passion</hi>; as a Dogge being struck bites a Stone, or any thing that is next; so a man that gives scope to his Fury, wrecks it on the highest, and barkes against his Maker.</p>
            <p>But most of all, it comes of <hi>ill habit</hi>; through which mens Tongues are not their owne, but the Tongues of Custome, and have gotten words which will have vent in spite of the mind.</p>
            <p>Now if Swearing proceed from so much Evill, how Evill must it be in <hi>it selfe?</hi> be not deceived; the greatnesse of a sin is not to be measured by the present <hi>Punishment,</hi> but by the <hi>Object</hi> against which it strikes, and by the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of violation. <hi>Theft</hi> is more punished then <hi>Adultery,</hi> yet the latter is the greater sin, because it offends a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in a greater matter, and more nearly; for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is more and nearer then Goods; but the Name of God is more then both. I know, the Adulterer cries out against the poore Filcher; and the greater Thiefe, whilst he glories in his owne shame, condemnes the lesse: why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the one is hanged, the other onely mulct; so the Swearer feeling little or no present punishment, is insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of his Crime: but to speake Truth, the sin in it selfe is worse then any Sin whatsoever against our Neighbour, because it highly offends God himselfe. Worse and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is in a <hi>generall Respect of the Person offended,</hi> though lesse perhaps in the <hi>speciall manner of offending,</hi> because it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100697:14"/>
proceeds from lesse Atrocity of mind, and with lesse da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Party, then Murder and some other sin. But if Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, were as capable of killing, as of hearing his Passion repeated, Swearing would prove a <hi>Murder worse then Murder:</hi> if the Spouse of Christ could as easily be corrupted as scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal'd with bad example, Swearing would prove an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery worse then Adultery</hi>: if God could be as soon robbed of his Heavenly Glory as of his Honour before men, Swearing would prove a <hi>Robbery worse then the utmost Plunder.</hi> As it is, it stands parallell in the same degree of Opposition against <hi>God,</hi> as False witnesse or Calumny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Man,</hi> because it calls God to <hi>witnesse a Falshood,</hi> and <hi>Calumniates</hi> his Name. Let me proceed further; since the Name of God is nearer unto him then the Day or Place of his worship, (for the Place is appointed for the Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and both for the Honour of his Name) therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Swearing is worse then either <hi>Sacriledge</hi> or <hi>Breach of the Sabboth.</hi> In a word, 'tis next to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I may call it for nearnesse sake <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for as Idolatry makes an <hi>Idoll God,</hi> so this makes <hi>God an Idoll,</hi> one that hath Eares and heares not. And I may adde this concerning the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> that it is acted with more <hi>Impudence</hi> then any other sin whatsoever, and is most properly a <hi>Loud and Crying</hi> sin, because it provokes God, not <hi>secretly</hi> and <hi>obliquely,</hi> but <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>directly,</hi> with loud Prophanation to his Face. Then how many great offences are committed in this one, yet how often is this committed in one Day, by divers Persons, in one City? It is meerly from Gods <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passibility,</hi> that he receaves not such <hi>hurt</hi> by sin as man doth; it is therefore his <hi>Mercy</hi> not our <hi>Innocence,</hi> that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine <hi>Vengeance</hi> doth not follow, that we are not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100697:14"/>
up quick in a moment. Lesser faults then This, picking of Sticks on the Sabboth, touching of the Arke with unwarrantable hands, sacrificing with unhallowed fire, have been punished with present death, so may this be too. What meanes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, Sweare not.</hi> Above all respect of <hi>Creatures?</hi> or above all things mentioned <hi>in his Epistle?</hi> or above all things contained in that <hi>Paragraph of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi> whatsoever he meanes, he certainly shewes thereby the <hi>heinousnesse</hi> of the sin, which is growne so common amongst us.</p>
            <p>Yet as great and as common as the sin is, it hath lesse Temptation then any other. Profit or Pleasure hires or allures men to other Transgressions; if one dram of either be found in thy whole Phrasebooke of Swearing, Sweare continually. What hath bewitch'd, who hath bedevil'd you? <hi>Nemo malus gratis,</hi> no man does the worke of sin without some wages; this elsewhere is a true saying; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Swearer it failes; which highly aggravates the sinfullnesse, the madnesse, of this baitelesse bootelesse sin, so vainely bent.</p>
            <p>This sore Evill, which comes from much Evill, is also fruitfull <hi>in begetting more Evill</hi>: for things produce as they are produced; Every Bird layes an Egge, like that, of which she was hatched: I can but name those Evills, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

            <p>After all this, we are not sure that the anger of God will be turned away; his hand may be stretched out still: for since <hi>publick dishonour</hi> is done to his Name by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearing, scarce or not scarce punished, how shall he rest satisfied with <hi>private Vengeance?</hi> As the whole <hi>Body</hi> doth often smart for the <hi>Tongue,</hi> so may a generall <hi>Society</hi> for some <hi>Evill Speakers</hi>; especially if their Speech sound <hi>Treason</hi>; but if Treason against <hi>the King of Kings,</hi> how great Vengeance may justly be feared by the whole <hi>State?</hi> one prophane <hi>Achan</hi> indangered a whole Army; <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Swearing the Land mourneth. Jer.</hi> 23.10. <hi>v.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, since Punishment followeth in that wherein we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, <hi>Voluntary Swearing</hi> is now turned to a <hi>Compulsive Forswearing,</hi> to a blind Covenant against knowne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Duty, against Conscience and Publick Safety, quite contrary to former Oathes of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, uncapable of keeping Faith on either side with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith-breaking, as farre from Truth and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as from all liberty and use of Judgement: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I have formerly shewed in generall) neither Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory to God, nor man; not through Excuse of Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, weaknesse, Ignorance, Compulsion, not through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Equivocation, mentall Reservation, private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, inward Gainsaying, (for none can be bettered by his fault) but through the monstrous Irregularity and horrid viciousnesse of it selfe; null by Nature; advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to none but <hi>Satan,</hi> no way usefull to any End, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100697:16"/>
meerly to destruction of Soules by taking it, or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to a Crowne of Martyrdome by refusing it. They that being unequall to so high a pitch of Sanctity, have submitted themselves to take it, I inquire not through what deficience, are howsoever no more bound to keep it, then <hi>Peter</hi> was bound to deny his Master for ever, because he had once denied him with an Oath. Indeed it obliges them to that which the Imposer least desires, to <hi>Peter like Teares of Repentance,</hi> to abundance of bitter sorrow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the great absurdity of the Crime admitted, and particularly to this kind of amendment, never to sweare againe without urgent necessity in a just Cause: least all the Evill, which God hath threatned, be powred out upon them, and on all guilty Families, and for their sakes on the whole State.</p>
            <p>You have heard how Swearing comes not onely from some Evill Infirmities, but from the Devill, and from abundance of Evill Vices, how Evill it is in it selfe, how much Evill it produces, and with what Evill it shall be punished. Now for Conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath likened an <hi>Oath</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2d. 2d. Q. 89, Ar: 2.</note> (for <hi>Sacramentum</hi> signifies both) I wish we tooke the one more seldome, and the other more often: the likenesse consists in this, that both are intended for our good, but being ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled they become Engines of Destruction. See the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the Sacrament, <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.27. <hi>Whosoever shall eate this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord: but let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup: for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himselfe, not discerning the Lords Body.</hi> The same will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100697:16"/>
serve for an Oath. Whosoever shall take this Name in Vaine shall be guilty of the Majesty of the Lord; but let a man examine himselfe and the Cause, and so let him take this Name; for he that taketh it in Vaine or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, pronounceth his owne Damnation, not discerning the Majesty and Presence of the Lord. The Apostle for his part had good successe; for by writing these words, he quite rooted out a grievous Sin, never heard of since, namely <hi>Feasting at the time of Communion in the Church:</hi> Swearing at the time of merriment in the house is much like it: how hath holinesse been mixt with madnesse in both! Grant me then (O Lord) the like successe by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the same words, that the Custome of Swearing be never more prevalent amongst us. Grant it ô mighty Lord, that through Reverence of thy Name, we may grow up to Feare of thy greatnesse, and through Feare of thy greatnesse we may proceed to Love of thy goodnesse; and then through Love of Thee we may come to Joy and Rest in Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be all Honour, Praise, and Glory, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
