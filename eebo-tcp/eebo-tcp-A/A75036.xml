            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>In Nomine Crucifixi, ſecundum illud primae ad Corinth. cap. ſecundo, verſ. ſecundo.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis addreſſe may ſeem very ſtrange; and yet if you ſhall conſider the occaſion, it will appeare that I could not prudently do other; for you being accompted a light in that very Houſe in which I ſtand eclips'd, I could not imagine by any other mean then your ſplendor, how to obtain the diſſipation of this Cloud.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſo it is, that that Worſhipfull and worthy <hi>Knight</hi> Sir <hi>John Trevor</hi> is one to whom I owe very much, for it was his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and his influence that firſt guided and planted me to, and in the Schoole of the Prophets; It was reſpect to him that gained me a tutor, and it is now my reſpect to him, which gaines you this trouble.</p>
            <p>For, when about the beginning of Michaelmas Terme I was at London, meeting him in the Palace yard, I thanked him for a late courteſie; his reply was, I had diſabled my ſelfe from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a Courteſie; I took leave to anſwer, it was my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the tenderneſſe thereof that hath thus ſtreightned me; He told me againe in words (as I conceive) to theſe aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that I was more byaſſed by <hi>conceit,</hi> then <hi>conſcience;</hi> and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rather by <hi>will</hi> then <hi>Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſo little left, that I can demonſtrate to the world I have not made gaine my godlyneſſe; and I ſhall now deſire to make it as evident unto you, that 'tis not <hi>fancy,</hi> but <hi>ſcruple,</hi> and <hi>ſcruple</hi> onely, for which my ſelfe, and in me a wife and five chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren very deeply ſuffer; ſo that I here, with all reſpect implore your aſſiſtance, either to ſatisfie my weakneſſe and ſet me right, or (which perchance may be the ſhorter work) be pleaſed to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116117:3"/>
him whom I do ſo highly honor, that you conceive my grounds and reaſons are ſuch as may conclude me a Rational and conſcientious, though weak Brother.</p>
            <p>The Miſdemeanors (for ſo they are called) for which my conviction (bearing date May 5. 1646.) teſtifieth, I am ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, they are theſe; 1. Adoration or worſhiping God by Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my body Eaſtward, or towards the Holy Table. 2. For the exterior acknowledgement of the Diety of my Saviour, when ſummon'd to it by his bleſſed name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> 3. For deſerting my cure two whole yeares. 4. For officiating by the Common Prayer Book, with refuſall of the Directory: To which is added a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſurmiſe of Malignancy againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Firſt as of leaſt concernment, I ſhall give you this briefe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the third charge, to which I negatively anſwer: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at all did deſert my Cure. For, being, as <hi>Juſtinian, derelictum dicitur quod Dominus eâ mente abjecit, ut id in numero rerum ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſſe nolit,</hi> that only is deſerted which is throwne off with a mind to be no more poſſeſt: I cannot poſſibly be ſaid to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted my Cure, when by Petition upon Petition, by Letter upon Letter, and all the waies I could imagine, I implor'd my quiet at home, or to have leave to know why; and our Committee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would, or did give way to either; ſo that what is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led deſertion, is no more then what thoſe words of Scripture will well warrant, <hi>when you are perſecuted in one City, fly unto another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Every abſenting more then two years, in theſe daies of triall, hath not been accounted ſequeſtrable, and therefore under favor I ſuppoſe, though this by way of cumulation is put in, this is not the <hi>gravamen;</hi> for there is not in the conviction any charge for flying to, or being in any forbidden Quarters.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I was ſo far from deſerting my Cure, that I kept at my proper coſt (though ſequeſtred) a Curate, all my abſence; one who kept my people freer from diſtractions and averſions from the waies of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> then ſince they have been. But <hi>haec obiter.</hi> That which my conviction declares me to ſuffer for, it is a pretence of ſuperſtition, expreſt by bowing to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and at the <hi>Name of Jeſus.</hi> 2. For not laying aſide and relinquiſhing the <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you with patience peruſe this my defence, in which I ſhall endeavour to cleare firſt my acts of commiſſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116117:3"/>
from being ſuperſtitious, and then 2. give my reaſons why I take it to be a ſin of omiſſion to renounce the Liturgy.</p>
            <p>Firſt bowing to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Altar,</hi> are not onely falſe accuſations, but falſe in ſuch a degree, that (without my confeſſion) are impoſſible to be proved; for being the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely can ſpecificate the terme, it is not in the power of any man living, to ſay to what I bow, or to what I kneele; for I am confident your ſelfe bends your knees toward many a thing, to which you abhor to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bow at his Footſtoole;</hi> that is, at the Ark and Mercy-ſeat, for <note place="margin">Reformed Catholike 707.</note> there he hath made a promiſe of his preſence, the words ſay not <hi>Bow to the Ark but to God at the Ark.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi> And thus and no otherwiſe did your Chriſtian Brother bow either toward the <hi>East</hi> or toward the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> Now as the Jewes (in Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> charitable Divinity) did not bow to the Ark, but to God at the Ark: Even ſo, when occaſionally your Chriſtian Brother bowed at the Holy Table, it was not to the Table, or to the Altar, but to his God he made his Adoration, and that for the ſame reaſon which M. <hi>Perkins</hi> uſeth; For there he hath <hi>made a promiſe of his preſence.</hi> There hath he enabled us <hi>(vi promiſſi)</hi> to ſay, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that it is an act of ſuperſtition to worſhip God by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body, is a ſcruple in which I cannot be ſatisfied: for <note place="margin">pag. 855. ibid.</note> as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> ſo think I<hi>—The worſhip of the Body is called Aderation, which ſtands in bowing of the knee, bending or proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the body, the lifting up of the hands or eys—</hi>A duty which the ſame reverend author proveth to be, as himſelfe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>altogether neceſſary,</hi> and that for three irrefragable reaſons. 1. Becauſe Love muſt not be conceived in the mind onely, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teſtified in the actions of the body. 2. Chriſt redeemed both, and therefore muſt be glorified with both. And laſtly Chriſt being an Head to the whoſe man, for this cauſe not onely ſoule but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alſo muſt ſtand in ſubjection to Chriſt. Many others might be added, but it ſeemes to me vain to add a beam unto the ſun. Now if to worſhip by bowing of the knee, proſtrating the body, and lifting up of hands or eyes by a duty lawfull, yea altogether neceſſary, no matter which way ſoever it be done, ſtill it is as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> fully, an act not of Superſtition, but Adoration. For as it was no ſuperſtition in the Jew to worſhip God by bowing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116117:4"/>
before the <hi>Ark</hi> or <hi>Weſtward,</hi> ſo ſuperſtition it is not, to worſhip God by bowing before his <hi>Holy Table,</hi> that is in the phraſe of antiquity, <hi>Eaſtward.</hi> As for bowing to the Eaſt or to the Altar, I am able to produce a Letter writ by me 5. or 6. yeares ago, <hi>ex Diametro</hi> againſt it, and am ſtill ready to ratifie that Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The ſecond act of ſuperſtition, it is <hi>bowing at the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> and to cleare that I ſhall thus argue. No act directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and intended, for the Advance of the glory of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> can be ſuperſtitious, but to bow at the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the ſence of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is an act both tending and intended for the advance of his glory, and therefore cannot be ſuperſtitious. For the proofe of the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, I appeale to the 18. Canon of the <hi>Church of England</hi> where the end and intention of that geſture is clearly thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When in time of Divine Service the Lord Jeſus ſhall be mentioned, due and lowly reverence ſhall be done by all perſons preſent, as it hath been accnſtomed, teſtifying by theſe outward Ceremonies and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures</hi> [obſerve what] <hi>their inward humility, Christian reſolution and due acknowledgement, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the true and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Son of God, is the onely Saviour of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon this ground I thus argue; for as much as both words and geſtures have their individuation and ſpecification meerly by uſe Law or cuſtome, what this geſture of bowing at the Name of Jeſus is to ſignifie and import in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; this the Repreſentative part thereof having clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, we are to take it in that ſence and in that ſignification, in which and for which it cometh from them propoſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us.</p>
            <p>For as in Languages we receive and uſe words, in and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that power and meaning which the firſt authors and contrivers delivered them unto poſterity; even ſo that I might ever avoid the being contentious, look what ſpirituall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall duties my Mother the Church of England profeſſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and ſignifie by ſuch and ſuch exterior geſtures, ſuch I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they did import, and in ſuch ſence and ſignification I did uſe and communicate them unto others.</p>
            <p>Whereas then (as the Canon clearly) the due and lowly Reverence exacted at the Name of Jeſus is only to teſtifie our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humility, Chriſtian reſolution,</hi> and due <hi>acknowledgement that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the true and Eternall Son of God.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116117:4"/>
the knowne and declared end and meaning of this geſture; Bowing at the Name of Jeſus can no more in my weak appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion be accounted Superſtition, then is inward humility, Chriſtian reſolution, or the due acknowledgement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be the true and Eternall Son of God; for being <hi>Actus exterior &amp; interior candem conſtituunt virtutem;</hi> being the outward expreſſion and the inward meaning do make but one compleat act; if the inward be vertuous the outward can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vicious; if the inward be religious the outward cannot be ſuperſtitious; ſo that ſince bowing at the Name of Jeſus is by the Church and uſe of England determined to ſignifie an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of inward humility, Chriſtian reſolution, and a due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Deity of the Son of God; I cannot yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how, to him who ſo underſtandeth and ſo uſeth it, bowing at the Name of Jeſus can be counted ſuperſtitious.</p>
            <p>Nor doth only the Canon of the Church of England, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Canon of holy Scripture warrant mee ſufficiently that ſuperſtitious it cannot be; for <hi>Dato ſed non conceſſo,</hi> ſuppoſe it no duty of that knowne Text, yet there is congruity enough to avoid the Superſtition of it; for if by thoſe knees the Apoſtle meaneth the ſpirituall and inward knees of the heart, then, as he, without thought of Superſtition expreſſed that inward duty by bodily incurvation; why may not I or any other (by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) expreſſe my inward profeſſion of the Deity, as he, by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall'expreſſion, by bowing at his Name? But my intention is not to write a volume, or indeed to ſay ought more then may conclude my deſign mentioned, to prove that I have not been, nor yet am ſcrupulous without cauſe, nor a ſufferer without reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now my firſt ſcruple is, whether a Miniſter may with a good conſcience renounce or leave off any act, Rite, or geſture, under the brand and notion of ſuperſtitious, which he believes is not ſo?</p>
            <p>I dare not do it for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhould bely mine owne ſoule, in calling good evill, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhould confirme a ſcandall laid upon many godly Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divines, that they in thus doing have been ſuperſtitious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhould do an irreparable violation to thoſe holy geſtures which I do verily believe are advancers of Gods glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I dare not omit that as ſuperſtitious which I believe not to be ſo, for fear in ſo doing, to this undetermined notion, I might add ſuch latitude, that under the colour of Superſtition, even Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116117:5"/>
it ſelf may be violated. In a word for my particular, whether I look upon adoration in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> as the meer expreſſion of that ſubjection and diſtance which duſt and aſhes oweth to his maker, or whether I looke upon it in <hi>concreto,</hi> as joyned with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty, as ſaying our prayers, receiving the Sacrament or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Saviours Deity; in neither reſpect (it ſeemeth to me) more guilty of Superſtition or troubling the waters, then was the Lamb in the fable when the Wolf charged him: ſo that if by ſome greater light, or latitude of underſtanding, your clearer judgement ſhall diſcern otherwiſe, I ſhall with all reſpect and thanks yeeld up my ſoule to further illumination, which till it ſhall pleaſe God to give me, I dare not in coole blood call an honeſt woman whore; or what I conceive religious ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, for more then yet I am, or hope for to be worth. And this may ſuffice for the firſt ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> That my judgement conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding otherwiſe, I dare not acknowledge or relinquiſh Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under the notion of ſuperſtitious innovation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I have to do, is to give my reaſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceived it a ſin of omiſſion to lay aſide, much more to renounce the Liturgie, and that I may do it methodically,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall give my reaſons why I dare not countenance the worſhipping of God without a form; ſecondly, why I dare not <hi>in ſpecie</hi> omit this form.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I dare not countenance the worſhipping of God without a form; for being the Scripture chargeth not onely to hold the faith, but to hold faſt the <hi>very form of ſound words,</hi> I conceive ſet forme of prayer a neceſſary expedient to this end; for being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience both ancient and modern hath taught us this ſad truth, that Errors, Hereſies, and Innovations in Doctrine are inſtilled and infuſed by the conceived prayers of ſuch who are either Authors or abettors of ſuch opinions, therefore (and eſpecially in theſe times) I dare not but endeavour a ſet forme. A ſet form ſeeming now as neceſſary as an antidote in time of peſtilence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to worſhip without a prepared and ſet forme (it ſeemes to me) to ſerve the living God with leſſe care then Pagans did their Idolls. For witneſſe <hi>Plato,</hi> a Law there was whatever <note place="margin">lib. 7. de leg.</note> Prayers or Hymnes the Poets compoſed to the gods, they ſhould firſt ſhew them their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> And <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth <note place="margin">lib. 4. c. 17.</note> the Gentiles read their prayers out of a book before their ſacrifice, and that for this reaſon, <hi>Ne quid prepoſterè dicatur,</hi> &amp;c. Or for feare ſome thing raſhly or prepoſterouſly might paſſe the lips,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116117:5"/>
as if ſtollen from that of <hi>Solomon, be not raſh with thy mouth, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5. Eccleſ.</note> 
               <hi>let not thine heart be haſty,</hi> an argument to me, that even an heart may be over haſty, and therefore my weakneſſe deſires a ſet forme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſerving and worſhipping God by a ſet forme ſeems to be approved by God in all ages, before the Law, under the Law, under the Goſpell. Before the Law we read thus, <hi>Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord, Eo tempore ritus certos</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. Gen. 26. Ioan. Dr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſius in difficilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſeôs.</note> 
               <hi>colendi Deum inſtitutos fuiſſe quos obſervarent filii Dei.</hi> From that time forward ſay Expoſitors, certain rites or ſet forms were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up for the publike worſhip of God, yea <hi>forſitan propter idb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latriam inſurgentem,</hi> perchance for the prevention of incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Idolatry, ſaith a learned Neoterick: therefore was <hi>Enoch</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Barradius, Tom. 4. l. 10. c. 12.</note> ſedulous to preſcribe and deliver a ſet forme. But whether <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> were or no, ſure we are, God Almighty under under the Law, to prevent Idolatry had his ſet Rites; and in particular to the point in hand, a preſcribed and ſet form of prayer,<hi>—on this</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6. Numb. 23.</note> 
               <hi>wiſe ſhall ye bleſſe the children of Iſrael, ſaying,</hi> (as it followeth) <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee and keep thee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Goſpell both <hi>S. John</hi> the fore-runner, and our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Maſter, for ſubſtance, both we know taught to pray; and it is ſtrange teaching without a forme; as the corner and firſt ſtone in the building the Lord left us a prayer, and this prayer proved the baſis and fundamentall of all future Liturgies: This through the devotion and piety of the Church increaſed and grew into a forme, and in this I ſuppoſe M. <hi>Beza</hi> may be my advocate, who tells me, and all the world, <hi>Quae ad ordinem ſpectant ut pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum formulae dispoſuit Apoſtolus,</hi> thoſe things which appertain to <note place="margin">In 1 Cor. 11 ver. ultim.</note> order as do forms of prayer, the Apoſtle himſelfe appointed and diſpoſed, ſo that ſet forms in the judgement of M. <hi>Beza</hi> are Apoſtolicall, the Engliſh Tranſlation reads it thus, ſuch things as appertaine to order, and forme of prayers, and other ſuch like the Apoſtle took order for, in the congregation according to the conſideration of times, places, perſons, 1 Cor 11. 39.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the want of ſet form prevents that which I am bound for to indeavour, the <hi>converſion and communion</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party; for either I muſt perſwade them to worſhip God according to my diſcretion, and relie-upon the implicit faith of my prudence, or elſe I muſt produce a <hi>forme</hi> in which I deſire their communion, and to which I muſt indeavour their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116117:6"/>
Now I believe all thoſe who renounoe an implicite faith in the whole Church, or in the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of it, all ſuch (I ſay) at leaſt will abhor ſo far to reſigne themſelves unto a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Miniſter, as to worſhip God all daies of their lives, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mutable dictate. I am ſure the Papiſts will ſay this is worſe then what we call Popiſh ſervitude, for they are bound onely to believe and ſerve God as the Church orders: but where all is left to the will of the Miniſter, people are bound to worſhip and ſerve God as his private ſpirit leads them, and I wiſh I could not feelingly ſay (even from follies vented in my owne Pulpit) what an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> that is.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to avoid prolixity, for my owne particular, ſhould I renounce a ſet forme, I muſt needs profeſſe my ſelf guilty either of <hi>Superſtitious Innovation,</hi> or (which <hi>in materia Religionis</hi> is bad enough) popular <hi>inſinuation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that to worſhip God without a forme is <hi>Innovation,</hi> this the whole Chriſtian world will atteſt unto me, the Eaſterne and Weſterne Churches, Wittinberg where <hi>Luther,</hi> Geneva where <hi>Calvin,</hi> Scotland where <hi>Knox</hi> flouriſhed; and to innovate and act againſt a Catholike Cuſtome of Chriſtendome, of the whole Chriſtian world, may breed a ſcruple in a wiſe, much more in a weak Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as Innovation, ſo it would ſeem to me unavoidable ſuperſtition, and that whether ſuperſtition be <hi>poſitively</hi> or <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> conſidered? for ſuperſtition being poſitively conſidered, being the iſſue of <hi>miſgrounded zeale,</hi> this ſuperſtition is active in the production of ſuperſtitious performances, whereof this is one, <hi>to conceive that God will be pleaſed with no prayer from me, unleſſe of my own conception,</hi> nor no devotion unleſſe it be of our owne invention; this I ſay is the ſuperſtitious iſſue of a miſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded zeale. Againe, as miſguided zeale is the mother of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious performances, even ſo <hi>ignorant feare</hi> is the motive and cauſe of <hi>ſuperstitious forbearances,</hi> as when one vainly feares, and in that feare refrains ſuch an act, as diſpleaſing, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is rather pleaſing to Almighty God, <hi>touch not, tast not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not,</hi> theſe are negative ſuperſtitions, iſſues of ignorant fear: And ſo far as I can conceive, ſcrupulouſly to reject or lay aſide ſet forms, as <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> is out of ignorant feare really and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to commit (pardon the phraſe) a negative ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, ſhould I not ſuperſtitiouſly (which as drawing nigher
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116117:6"/>
Religion is more honeſt of the two) ſay aſide a ſet forme, I cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine any other principle but <hi>popular inſinuation</hi> to move me to it, and to make that a motive in Religion ſcarce appeares to me religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Omnia ponenda poſt Religionem noſtra Civitas duxit.</hi> If the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan had ſo much Divinity, as to ſay, it was a Law in their City, that <note place="margin">Val. Max. lib. 1. cap. de Religio.</note> all things whatſoever muſt give way unto Religion, certainely it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me, who am a Chriſtian in matter and point of Religion, to look upon nothing through a carnall or ſecular perſpective. Now to me (and with me runs the whole current of Antiquity) ſet forms of Prayer and Worſhip, they are the moſt religious and aſſured meanes either to preſerve or advance Religion. The ſcruple then is, whether any of my judgement and perſwaſion may for any popular or ſecular end in the world (and for that end meerly) lay aſide a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and aſſume in Gods Worſhip a worſe way? whether this be not having <hi>a male in my flocke, to offer unto God a female,</hi> judge you.</p>
            <p>That bleſſed ſpeech of Sir <hi>Benj. Ruddierd</hi> to M. <hi>Pym, he that thinks</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Printed 1628.</note> 
               <hi>to ſave any thing by his Religion but his ſoul, will be a terrible loſer in the end;</hi> it is worthy to be written in letters of gold, yea worthy to be ingraven in the heart of every Parliament-man that ſits; it is indeed a ſaying that hath ſo farre prevailed on me, that I begin extremely to queſtion the truth of that vulgar opinion, that the <hi>Worſhip</hi> aud <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of the Church of Chriſt are ſo left as to be accommodated to the proportionable <hi>exigences</hi> of States and Kingdomes: For my particular I conceive the glory of God attended, municipall Lawes ought rather to ſtoop then they to ſtrain; for Religion is ſo tender a Virgin, that ſhe may not admit the leaſt proſtitution, and I am ſure a conſcientious breaſt feareth to pumple her very ornaments.</p>
            <p>Whereas then to worſhip God without a ſet forme ſeemes to me deſtructive of the form of ſound words, which charily muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, a Worſhip more careleſſe then what Pagans uſed, an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which takes away the very ground and baſis of converſion and communion with an adverſe party; whereas it would be in me either ſuperſtition or popularity to deſert a ſet forme; I muſt crave leave to follow theſe Dictates, till I have better premiſes given me, from which I may conclude otherwiſe. And ſo I ſhall deſire your patience to accompany me to my laſt endeavour, which is to ſhew, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with a good conſcience renounce, or as yet lay aſide this our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall Liturgie, and that for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It maketh our Religion to be ill ſpoken of by the greateſt part of Chriſtendome, and ſo preventeth the converſion of Papiſts, who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116117:7"/>
accuſe us of unſetledneſſe and changes; yea, it furniſheth them, with an unanſwerable exception, viz. That we have theſe many yeares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, puniſhed, and impriſoned them for what our ſelves now ſo far diſtaſt, that at Seſſions we give a charge againſt it, traduce it under the brand of the old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> and indite it, and puniſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it; this I profeſſe my weakneſſe cannot ſatisfie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If better it were a Milſtone were hanged about my neck, then that I ſhould be a ſcandall to my weak brother, the omiſſion of the Liturgie, being at this time a ſcandall not only to the weak, but to the ſtrong, being the cries and tears of both require it, how ſhould I dare to look my God in the face when I ſhall wilfully become <hi>ſcandalous</hi> both to the learned and unlearned, both to the ſtrong and to the weak Chriſtian? yea, of this ſad experience hath made me very confident, ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch a ſtumbling block as is this, the ſuppreſſion of the Liturgie was never ſince Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies amongſt us; for the want of this hath hindred thouſands from their accuſtomed piety and devotion, the weak, becauſe they have no other; the ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no better way, and whatever prevents piety cannot but be rather <hi>ſcandalum datum,</hi> then <hi>acceptum,</hi> a reall and true ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, ſo that till a better form be actually eſtabliſhed in lieu of this, my conſcience tells me I may not leave it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What by oath and ſubſcription I am bound unto, that without relaxation from the ſame authority to whom I ſware, and before whom I ſubſcribed, I may not relinquiſh. But I have ſworne to my Dioeceſan, and ſubſcribed to maintain the ſervice of God, not only in <hi>genere,</hi> but in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> according to the particular forme and way of the Church of England. And therefore to ſay no more, as an honeſt man I am bound to make that good which I have ſworn, ſubſcribed, and negatively promiſed to maintain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is againſt my Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to acknowledge a power Eccleſiaſticall Independent upon the only Supreme, and this cannot (in my apprehenſion) be avoided, if the King forbidding I receive the Directory, and the King commanding to uſe it, I reject the Liturgie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Beneficium ſupponit Officium.</hi> The duty which every parochiall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is bound unto, is <hi>a daily recitall of his Office;</hi> for being Pariſhes are of humane inſtitution, founded and endowed by the piety and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of devout Patrons, look what they conditioned for, (ſo far as juſt and pious) that I conceive I am bound unto. Foraſmuch then as in the Church of England, <hi>prayer, daily prayer,</hi> yea (and ever ſince the Reformation) this <hi>very form of prayer</hi> is the condition of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116117:7"/>
though preaching be multiplied, I cannot conſcionably o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that, without which, yea, and for which I had inſtitution and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to my living; ſo that in my weake judgement it is a very conſiderable ſcruple,—whether what is given for a publike and <hi>daily duty,</hi> may conſcionably be taken by him who doth it but once a week, much leſſe by him who doth it not at all?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is very conſiderable to me, whether thoſe words in my Proteſtation <hi>(The true reformed Proteſtant Religion expreſſed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of England, againſt all Popery and Popiſh Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)</hi> do not bind me, ſo far as lawfully I may with life, power, and eſtate, to maintaine either this, or ſome other ſetforme, and that for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, This word or Notion, <hi>Religion,</hi> neceſſarily includes all the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all muniments therof, be it what religion it may be, for if as <hi>Auſtin</hi> out of <hi>Cicero, Religio eſt virtus quae ſuperioris cujuſdam naturae, quam divina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And if as M. <hi>Calvin, in profeſſione religionis homines non poſſe ceremoniis carere,</hi> Men cannot profeſſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Ceremony, be it what Religion it may be: Then (ſo far as my capacity reacheth) I cannot vow, promiſe and profeſſe, to maintain and defend a Religion, but under this <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>terme Religion,</hi> I binde my ſelf to defend and maintain what ever congruouſly is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in the defence, and ſupport of it: for as he that is bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>houſe,</hi> muſt preſerve the thatch as well as the <hi>grunſell:</hi> and as he who is bound to maintain a cloſe, muſt have a care of the hedg (though it be but a dead one) as well as the crop; even ſo, when I did promiſe, vow, and proteſt to defend and maintaine the true Religion, in which I was baptized and bred, I know not how I could hope to make good this, unleſſe the neceſſary muniments, whereof the <hi>Liturgie</hi> is a maine one, were preſerved in it: And that in this I was not ſingular, I may appeale unto a <hi>Vote</hi> afterward annexed to the Proteſtation, in which it is declared, <hi>that ſeverall perſons had raiſed the ſame doubt,</hi> an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the deduction was very obvious, and very naturall. Now foraſmuch as I had vowed before I ſaw the limitation, after the Vow I durſt not inquire; a Vow and an Oath (as I conceive) in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, an Oath it muſt be taken in the ſence of the giver; a Vow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe voluntary, in the ſence of the taker onely: ſo I took it, and the obligation is ſtill upon me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas Religion in the Proteſtation hath this reſtrictive difference, <hi>Reformed;</hi> and not onely ſo, but ſo <hi>Reformed,</hi> as in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116117:8"/>
               <hi>Church of England againſt all Popary, and Popiſh Innovations;</hi> I cannot ſee how I could proteſt to maintaine a Religion ſo reformed, but that I muſt neceſſarily imply that <hi>ſervice</hi> which the firſt Reformers, and all ſucceeding Parliaments have made the <hi>Characteriſticall</hi> note, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall difference betwixt us and them; and this (we all know) hath been the <hi>Liturgie;</hi> for from his denying <hi>Communion</hi> in this, the <hi>Papist</hi> was called <hi>Recuſant,</hi> and by his joyning with us in this, he was ſaid and held as reconciled to our <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in caſe the Proteſtation had run thus; I promiſe, vow, and proteſt to maintain the <hi>true Religion establiſhed in the Church of Rome againſt</hi> (as they call them) <hi>hereticall innovations;</hi> would any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Miſſall were here excluded, which is the very <hi>formality</hi> of their profeſſions? Or in caſe it had run thus, I promiſe, vow, and proteſt to maintaine that Reformed Religion, whoſe character and <hi>diſtinctive formality</hi> is the <hi>Directory,</hi> would any doubt I vowed to maintain the Directory? and can I hope to perform my Vow, can I hope to maintaine the Religion of the Church of England, and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that which is the practicall character of my profeſſion?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if this notion <hi>Reformed Religion in the Church of England</hi> includes not <hi>Liturgie,</hi> then they are not ſufferers for the <hi>true reformed Religion of England,</hi> who ſuffer meerly for the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> but they who ſo ſuffer, cannot imagine elſe what they ſuffer for.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it is very probable to me, the compilers and chiefe manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this Proteſtation, by Religion mainly meant the <hi>forme</hi> of Gods Worſhip, for in the firſt 19. humble Propoſitions, the <hi>eighth</hi> runs thus: <hi>That your Majesty will be pleaſed to conſent that ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation be made of the Church-Government and Liturgie, as both Houſes of Parliament ſhall adviſe.—</hi>To the people in the ſame yeare the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> declare thus, April 9. 1642. they intend a due and <hi>neceſſary Reformation of the Government and Liturgie of the Church.</hi> A plaine and evident demonſtration to my capacity, that both Lords and Commons did then declare, this notion or terme Religion, it includes both <hi>Church-Government,</hi> and <hi>Liturgie,</hi> otherwiſe what ever is of late attempted or done concerning theſe, cannot be ſaid to be a religious, but a politike Reformation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how could I promiſe, vow, and proteſt to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a Religion which is ſaid to be true, and <hi>actually reformed,</hi> unleſſe there be ſome forme actually in being, which my judgment and my conſcience muſt looke upon; for to ſwear the maintenance of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Worſhip, or Diſcipline not fixed, and digeſted into a forme,

ſeems to me like that formidable <hi>et caetera,</hi> to ſweare and vow to maintain I know not what; and upon this ground thouſands there are who have ſtumbled at the very threſhold of the Covenant, not daring to ſweare to defend a Reformation where they cannot come to ſee the form.</p>
            <p>Whereas then beſide Statute-ſubſcription, and thoſe many obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contracted under Epiſcopacy, I conceive even by the <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and from the very ſenſe of the Houſe that made it, <hi>Liturgie</hi> is a very conſiderable ingredient in the compound of Religion, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Liturgie</hi> in this the <hi>reformed Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> As then in Muſick, though there are many rare and exquiſite <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> yet ſolemne and ſet Muſick is not therefore to be rejected, even ſo though there are, and may be in the Church of England ſuch who can expreſſe as readily as conceive, and conceive as devoutly as can be imagined, yet for all that, this is no <hi>Superſedeas</hi> or bar againſt ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, penn'd, and ſet formes of prayer; and more then this, as I read, was heard, and ordered to be printed by the honorable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in a Sermon called, <hi>Babilons downfall,</hi> in theſe words,—Curſed ſhall he be that removeth the ancient Land-marke, &amp;c. what is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Land-mark of England, but our Lawes and Religion? (which containes as well <hi>facienda</hi> as <hi>credenda,</hi> and hath as well the <hi>Liturgie</hi> as the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi> for her Boundaries) and therefore if any man ſhall remove this Land-marke, curſed ſhall he be of the Lord, and let all the people ſay, Amen. Certainely they who ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to this imprecation, and thoſe who ordered there ſhould be an impreſſion of it, they were then no viſible enemies to Liturgie, no not this Liturgie. All then that I ſhall now trouble you withall, ſhall be a ſlight propoſall of this one Scruple.</p>
            <p>Whether a Miniſter is not as much bound to ſuffer in defence of the ſpirituall Muniments of Religion, as any Subject for the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Muniments and Priviledges of State or Kingdome?</p>
            <p>For Chriſtian Religion, or the Muniments thereof, I am apt to think with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Sword is no good advocate, <hi>Lex nova non ſe vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat ultore gladio,</hi> the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, not the arme of fleſh, <note place="margin">As Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius cites him de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re belli.</note> muſt and did eſtabliſh theſe: And therefore I propoſe the ſcruple on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in point of <hi>ſuffering;</hi> for if we looke unto the author and finiſher of our faith, I conceive with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that by his example we are called upon to ſuffer, and in this caſe to ſuffer only.</p>
            <p>Now in theſe times of loſſe and ſuffering, I have oft conſidered with my ſelfe for what, either as Subject, or as Chriſtian, eſpecially
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116117:9"/>
as a Chriſtian Miniſter I ſtand bound to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Now whileſt I look upon my ſelf as a ſubject having nothing at all before me but ſome ſecular or temporall advantage: my next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is, what ſecular or temporall commodity is deareſt to me; for I ſuppoſe no man will loſe gold to ſave chaffe, nor expoſe his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to preſerve his vaſſall. Now foraſmuch as all temporall or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar goods are reducible to theſe three heads, <hi>jucundum, utile, honeſtum,</hi> either pleaſant, profitable or honeſt; that which of theſe three is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that which of theſe is abſolutely the beſt, that (I conceive, though I ſuffer the loſſe of the other two) I am bound to preſerve.</p>
            <p>Job 2. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life:</hi> though the Devill ſpake it, both God and man approve it. Skin for skin, whatever is pleaſant, or whatever is profitable, a man will rather ſuffer in, then in his life; for of all things, pleaſant or profitable, life is the deareſt. Now albeit among things pleaſant or profitable, life is the jewel; yet <hi>bonum honestum,</hi> that good which doth conſiſt in honor or honeſty, this, it is oft even dearer then life it ſelf: ſo that for defence of reputation &amp; a good name, for the advance &amp; benefit of poſterity, for the vindication of a friend, for the preſervation of a truſt; for theſe and ſuch like, there is many an one who will dare to die: but meerly for what is pleaſant, or what is profitable, I think no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: So that indeed 'tis onely <hi>bonum boneſtum,</hi> it is onely for what is honeſt, or what is honorable, a man as a man, a man as rationall, is bound to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Now if it be ſo, that honor and honeſty hath ſo ſtrong an influence upon a reaſonable ſoule, that Reaſon will perſwade even the naturall man to prefer <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> before life; if property, liberty, and the Lawes of the Land are ſo deare to Subjects, that even<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for them, thouſands have laid down their lives; my great and grand ſcruple is, whether <hi>bonum religioſum,</hi> whether a religious good, whether that which I verily believe tends to the good of Religion, ought not to me, a Chriſtian, and a Miniſter, to be full as deare as any <hi>bonum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtum,</hi> as any honeſt or mere ſecular good to me, or any ſubject in the world: And (I profeſſe to you upon the faith of a Chriſtian) be it ſound, or be it weak, this is the principall ground and motive of all my loſſes, and to ſupport me I have theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Corinth. 9. <hi>If we have ſowen unto you ſpirituall things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnall things?</hi> Between ſpirituall and carnall things the Apoſtle ſeems to make ſo deſpicable a difference, that the one is not to be compared with the other: carnall things,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116117:9"/>
ſecular and worldly intereſts they are not conſiderable, if compared with things ſpirituall. A cleare argument to me, that no ſpirituall, or religious performance ought to give way to any carnall end. And ſuch I conceive are all the muniments of Chriſtian Religion, ſuch in particular a blameleſſe Liturgie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a rule amongſt Caſuiſts, that man that ſuffers either for doing this, or for bearing that in relation unto Chriſt and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that perſon is a ſufferer in the cauſe of Chriſt; as he that will not lie upon this ground, becauſe diſhonourable to the Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if he ſhould be perſecuted, becauſe he will not lie; ſuch an one though not <hi>in materia fidei,</hi> yet becauſe his reſtraint is for Chriſt and his glory, he were perſecuted for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
            <p>Whereas then in my poore judgement I am convinced there is no means generally more expedient for the advance of the glory of Chriſt and the preſervation of the faith, then a well compoſed and ſet form of Liturgie; what ever I ſhall ſuffer for not rejecting this, I ſhall confidently lay upon the ſcore of my Saviour: for as much as I therefore onely by ſuffering endeavour the defence of of this, becauſe I do verily beleeve, Liturgy is the advance of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So that if a temporall good (whoſe reward and encouragement cannot be but temporall) can move a man to ſuffer; much more a ſpirituall, whoſe reward (through the mercy of a gracious accepter) may prove eternall. For he who will not ſee a cup of cold water gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his ſake loſt: neither will he forget the leaſt of ſufferings which relate to his glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In ſuffering for ſpirituall muniments, and for that only which relates to Chriſt onely, and his glory, there is no intereſt but God Almighties conſidered or concern'd; But in ſuffering for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, though publique good, we have private ends and perſonall advantages of our owne; ſo that it muſt be much more acceptable to God Almighty to ſuffer for ſpirituall, that is <hi>his intereſt,</hi> then for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that is our own.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If that Citizen be held an unworthy Member, who will not ſpend his purſe and paines for the priviledge of his Corporation: and if that Country-clowne be held no good Towneſman, who will not ſtiffly maintain the <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> The cuſtome of h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Towne; certainly then that Miniſter hath a very low and poore eſtimate of that Liturgy which he ſubſcrib'd unto, a very unworthy eſteem of the Catholique cuſtome of the reformed Church of Chriſt, that will without ſuffering betray his truſt; making leſſe account of what Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116117:10"/>
ſealed with their blood, then will a Citizen or a Countryman of a trifling priviledge or cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſidering and inquiring after the elder times, when ſuch was the purity of intention, that nothing but Chriſts glory was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; I cannot find that any thing in Religion was moulded unto State ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Si eccleſiaſticum negotium ſit, nullam Communionem habento civiles Magiſtratus cum câ diſceptatione, ſed Religioſiſſimi Epiſcopi ſecundum ſacros Canones negotio fine imponuntom, in Authentica Con.</hi> 123.</p>
            <p>Not to the civill Magiſtrate, but to the Religious Biſhops, <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> (no leſſe then an Emperour) attributes and decrees the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and determination of Eccleſiaſticall affaires; and certainly if there be any Eccleſiaſticall Government, as the Law ſpeakes<hi>—Cui juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio data eſt, ea quoque conceſſa eſſe intelliguntur ſine quibus juriſdictio expleri non potuit.—</hi>To whom juriſdiction is committed all that muſt be granted without which he cannot exerciſe juriſdiction; and that muſt needs be a directive and a coactive power.</p>
            <p>Now impoſſible (it ſeemes to me) that thoſe who have, (be they Prelates, be they Presbyters, or be they of what name or title ſoever, our next <hi>new light</hi> ſhall call them) I ſay it ſeems to me impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that thoſe who have this ſpirituall power ſhould ever diſcharge their truſt, unleſſe they reſolve to ſuffer, and to ſuffer preciſely, for the muniments and defence of the Church of Chriſt, and the power of him committed to them; for the impartiall and thorough executing of this charge, cannot but diſpleaſe great ones: and fleſh and blood is a bitter adverſary; ſo that indeed it will evidently appeare, the decay of <hi>Diſcipline, Liturgy</hi> and all the <hi>muniments</hi> of the Church, they have therfore ſuffered becauſe thoſe who ſhould have ſuffered for them, would not. And I beſeech God this ſin be not laid to our charge; for my own particular, I beſeech God give me grace to ſay heartily as did ſome of the Martyrs, <hi>though I cannot diſpute, I can ſuffer for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, For me to omit any act, geſture or forme of worſhip, which I beleeve or feel to be an advance to piety, meerly from ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or private intereſt, this in my judgement is to prefer a <hi>carnall</hi> thing before a <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> &amp; to endeavour rather to pleaſe man then my God. And indeed I could here with a great deale of truth and ſadneſſe relate unto you, the ſerious and ſharp complaints of ſuch Miniſters, who profeſſe their ſouls long after the Liturgy, grieved at heart, and (as they pretend) troubled at ſoule, becauſe they dare not uſe what they conceive much the better way. A lamentable condition is the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116117:10"/>
Church in, when Miniſters worſhip God with reluctancie, and onely to ſave their ſtakes, comply and do as the State would have them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Foraſmuch as the muniments of Religion are preſervers of the deareſt thing imaginable, Gods glory, and our ſoules welfare, I do not know what I ſhould ſuffer in defence of, if not of theſe.</p>
            <p>I lately reading (as it fell proper to the day) the fifth of <hi>Eſay,</hi> when I came to thoſe dreadfull words<hi>—I will take away thy hedge, and it ſhall be eaten up, break downe the wall, and it ſhall be trodden downe,</hi> it made my heart even ake, to think how applicable this methodicall deſtruction is to our ungratefull vineyard. <hi>I will take away the hedge, I will break downe the wall.</hi> Take the hedge and the wall away cut up the fence, and the Vinyard will ſoon be waſt; The Government, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, the Liturgy which as a hedge or a wall ever ſince our reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſerved the Vineyard; ſince I ſee it hath pleaſed God to ſuffer <hi>this hedge</hi> and the wall to be trodden downe, I can but feare confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſolation to be the ſequeſt. For ſince the worldly wiſeman verily believes, where the fence is wanting, ſpoile and waſt inevitably followeth; and therefore his maine care is to tend it: Even ſo where the muniments of any proſeſſion or Religion are ſlighted and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; where Liturgy (this 13. hundred years without controverſie, held the hedge and mound of faith, and Gods worſhip in Natiohall Church) where (I ſay) this is pull'd downe and taken away, there is iminent and evident feare; a gap is opened to let in what ever will come. Be it the beaſt of the field, be it the little foxes be it the wild bore of the forreſt, come what will there is no muniment, no proviſion, no fence againſt it; ſo that in my poor conceptions the hedge, the fence, the muniment of the Church they are matters of ſuch neceſſary conſequence, that Miniſters I conceive, had better lay themſelves, and all their fortunes in the gap, then for want of fence to ſuffer the deſtroyer to come in.</p>
            <p>Indeed I have been told by ſome who wiſh very well unto me, that <hi>humane inventions</hi> and things meerly <hi>circumſtantiall</hi> ought not to be thus ſtood upon: I thank them heartily for their affection, and bleſſe them for their good will, but our judgments yet muſt differ. For if no ſuffering for humane invention, if life it ſelfe may not be expoſed to hazzard in defence of humane conſtitutions, certainly then no fighting for the Lawes of Land, nor no taking up arms for Priviledge of Parliament, for theſe ſure are humane and politicall inſtitutions; and as theſe are neceſſary for the preſervation of a State, even ſome ſuch are alſo neceſſary for the preſervation of a Church, and of ſuch <hi>Church-men</hi> cannot be too chary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:116117:11"/>
Againe, whereas Liturgie <hi>in genere,</hi> or ours <hi>in ſpecie</hi> is counted but a circumſtantiall buſineſſe, I believe I may find out ſuch circumſtantialls in a Chriſtian Church, as will hazard the whole if they periſh.</p>
            <p>In the tenth perſecution under the Tyranny of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſt, <hi>ut Templa &amp; libri delerentur,</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould deliver <note place="margin">Chron. Chario. Diocleſ.</note> up their books and deſtroy (or at leaſt permit the deſtruction of) their Churches. Books and Churches I conceive are but circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls to Religion; for the world was more then 2400. yeers old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any <hi>Scripture</hi> in it; yea, the Chriſtian Church it was from the birth of Chriſt more then 90. years before the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was compleated, yea after the death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our <hi>Saviour</hi> there is (ſuppoſing his paſſion at 31.) ten years <note place="margin">Mat. 41.

               </gap>s before the laſt; a plaine argument that bookes and writings are but circumſtantiall to Religion; for one may live and die a very good Chriſtian, and know never a letter on the booke.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe now the Pope and Popery ſhould ſo far prevaile, as to have under the notion of books hereticall (for ſo they will ſticke to call our Bibles) to call in, and under paine of death to deliver up our Bibles even to the <hi>fire,</hi> could any conſcientious Proteſtant ſatisfie his ſoule with this poore evaſion, alas the Bible is but circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, the Doctrine and Religion of it I can preſerve though the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be gone? without all peradventure it is moſt true, a learned and well grounded Chriſtian, he may preſerve the faith, he may deliver and hold faſt the forme of ſound words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though among <hi>Turks,</hi> where a Bible is not to be looked upon: and yet for my particular I ſhould ſcarce looke upon that man as Chriſtian, who to ſave his purſe, yea his body ſhould deliver up his Bible to the fire.</p>
            <p>In the Roman Martyrologie there is a commemoration made of many holy Martyrs, who deſpiſing the ſacrilegious Edict of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ian. 2</note> 7. <hi>quo tradi Sacros codices jubebantur, potiùs corpora carnificibus quàm ſanctadare canibus maluerunt]</hi> choſe rather to deliver their bodies to the executioner then holy things to dogs, or holy books unto the fire. And truly I ſhould rather honour theſe as Martyrs, then thoſe for good Chriſtians, who under pretence of things circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, ſhould deliver thoſe to ſave themſelves; ſo highly (I conceive) God would be diſhonoured in the betraying of ſo great a preſerver, and muniment of his Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:116117:11"/>
Again, as Books, even ſo (to ſome much more clearly) <hi>Churches, Oratories, Temples,</hi> they are meer circumſtantialls. Now ſuppoſe the <hi>Independent</hi> and Congregationall Brother-hood ſhould ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, as to command the demolition (as they call them) of our <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> the deſtruction and levelling of our Churches, I would very fain know whether in point of conſcience I were not rather bound to ſuffer, then in any meaſure to appeare willing to ſo high a ſacriledge? I who am fleſh and blood as well as other men, could find <hi>pretty</hi> evaſions and gloſſes to foole my ſoule withall; I could ſay (as I hear) is not a Sermon as well in a <hi>Parlour</hi> as in a <hi>Church.</hi> Did not Chriſt preach in a <hi>Ship, Paul</hi> pray upon the ſands, and ſhall I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in defence of ſo unneceſſary a triſle as an heap of ſtones, a <hi>Popiſh Relique,</hi> a ſorry meeting houſe? For my particular, I am afraid many things are daily called circumſtantiall, not with conſideration whether ſo or no, but becauſe theſe are the things in queſtion, theſe the points which I muſt either diſſemble, deſert or ſuffer for. I pray let me as a cloſe to this preſent you with the example of one, who though a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was ever reverenced as a Saint, &amp; a good man; I mean that great Doctor S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who being once tempted and provoked even in this very point, and that by no leſſe then the Emperour, to deliver up <note place="margin">Epiſt. 33.</note> his Church, though it pleaſed the Emperour in a faire way to ſend Earles and Tribunes to him,<hi>—ut Baſilicae fieret matura traditio,</hi> that there might be a ſeaſonable del<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ea quae Divina Imperatoriae poteſtatinon ſubjecta.</hi> The things of God are not ſubject to imperiall power, was the peremptory poſition of this Biſhop; and then proceeds.<hi>—Si patrimonium petitur, invadite; ſi corpus, occurram: vultis in vincula rapere, vultis in mortem? volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiest mihi.—</hi>If you who are ſent, demand my patrimony, invade it, take it! if my body, here it is; if to bonds or death you deſire to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me, it ſhall be a pleaſure to me;<hi>—pro altaribus gratiùs immolabor,—</hi>I will gladly be a ſacrifice to preſerve my Altar.

            <p>

            <p>In theſe ſad times of triall, I conceive one main end of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (eſpecially upon his Clergy) is to diſcern who thoſe are who have hitherto meerly related to him for <hi>their bellies;</hi> and who for his <hi>glory</hi> mainly? who have been <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and who <hi>carnall</hi> profeſſors of the Miniſtry? For thoſe who ſerved him chiefly? for their bellies, and carnall ends, to them the invaſion of nothing is conſiderable, in which their intereſt and their ends are not involved; but ſuch who with purity of intention have mainly ſtudied and ſought the advance of Gods ſervice, to them as to S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the muniments of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the abridgement or abatement of any thing that was adjuvant to this end, is more conſiderable then all <hi>their ſecular</hi> intereſt, or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall advantages of this world; inſomuch as I can knowingly ſay it for ſome: Threeſcore pound a yeare, and our old way, will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before 300. in a worſe Moddell. It is to me a conſideration not unworthy my pen, to ſee how the judgement of God hath followed ſuch who have meaſured and ſtuck to his intereſts, meerly as they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with their owne. In the 21, year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. in a Parliament <note place="margin">p. 118. in Bridewell.</note> which began the 3. of Novemb. the Commons ſent up to the Houſe of Lords a Bill againſt the exaction of unconſcionable Mortuaries; To which Bill it is obſerved the ſpirituall Lords made a <hi>faire face</hi> and were well content a reaſonable Order ſhould paſſe againſt them; But this was (ſaith my author) <hi>Becauſe it touched them little</hi> for when within two daies after a Bill concerning probates of Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (in which there had been incrediale extortion) was ſent up to the Lords, then the Biſhops in generall (ſaith the Hiſtorian) frown'd and grunted, <hi>for that touched their profit;</hi> then ſaid the Biſhop of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> now with the Commons is nothing but downe with the Church. When the Biſhops perſonall profits were toucht upon, then (as if the very Church were falling, <hi>Fiſher</hi> crieth out, the Commons lack faith, the Commons think of nothing but down with the Church. Yea in the progreſſe of this reformation are not Biſhops found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving and abetting the demoliſhing of religious houſes; and was

not this probably with an eye to the preſervation of their own; as if they ſaid, let Monaſteries go, ſo long as Biſhopricks bee preſerv'd: well, they are dead and gone; But hath not vengeance followed upon Epiſcopacy?

An evident argument, that <hi>juſt and righteous art thou O God in all shy waies.</hi> An argument that makes me verily believe, thoſe who for <hi>private interest,</hi> and meerly either for praiſe or profit throw off the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, forbeare their duties, and betray the muniments of Religion and the Church of Chriſt; God will in his due time reward ſuch into their owne boſomes, blaſting that private intereſt for which they have betrayed his.</p>
            <p>Whereas then I muſt profeſſe before God, and the world, I can apprehend no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or inducement ſo prevalent as to perſwade me, that the Liturgie of the Church of England is any way a <hi>hinderer</hi> of Gods holy Worſhip, or an <hi>obſtacle</hi> to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and ſufficient Miniſtration of the Word agreeable to Orthodox Antiquity, and an approved promoter of Gods glory in the Church I live in: being (I ſay) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the abolition of Liturgie, I find in my ſoule no moving motive, but either the hope of more, or the holding of what I have; I dare not, (finding within me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but carnall intereſt) put a <hi>ſpecious</hi> ſhew of Religion upon it, and tell the world that I lay aſide the truly Divine Service of the Church, becauſe Prelates overvalued it, the ignorant doted of it, the Papiſts nos'd with it, and an idle and unedifying Miniſtery maintained by it.</p>
            <p>Theſe I profeſſe, to me are neither true nor weighty conſiderations; for if I ſhould now (as I am) forbear or lay it aſide, it is not any, or all theſe, but only in mine own defence, only for mine own ends I ſhould do it: Now whether any man may <hi>ſalvâ conſcientiâ</hi> prefer what he conceives in Gods ſervice a worſe way, meerly for the boot of private intereſt, I leave it to your prudent conſideration; concluding with that of <hi>Chryſtoſt.—Qui hominem timet ab co ipſo quem timet deridebitur, ſin vero Deum,</hi>

            <p>And here I had thought to have put a period both to your trouble, and my owne; but I muſt needs crave-leave, that you would thus far be an advocate both for me, and all in my condition, as to procure a beliefe that ſuch who are conſtant to their faith, and principles, according to the eſtabliſhed and old way of England, may be held if weak, yet <hi>conſcientious Chriſtians;</hi> for it's none of the leſt preſſures of the Croſſe upon us, that we of all men are thought to have no foundation; whereas we in our judgements believe verily, if what we hold and ſuffer for be not that very Religion which the Divines of England unanimouſly ſubſcribed, and profeſſed to ratifie; there is not any in England that is above ſeven yeares old, and to innovate in Religion

            <p>In a word, I beſeech you (good Sir) by that conſcientious ſubſcription in which we both viſibly agreed; by that canonicall obedience which we both deliberately ſware; by that Doctrine which at cur Inductions in the face of our Congregations, and the preſence of Almighty God, we did profeſſe to ratiſie; by that ſolemne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation which ſince this Parliament began we hoth took; by theſe, and by all thoſe duties, in which (I ſuppoſe without ſcruple) we did both within ſeven years laſt paſt practiſe and communicate;</p>
