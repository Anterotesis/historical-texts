            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ther entrance I need not make vnto my speech at this time, then that which the Apostle himselfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth vnto mee in the verse next but one going before my Text: <hi>I speake to wise men.</hi> The more <hi>vnwise</hi> might I deeme my selfe to be, who being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious vnto my selfe of my great weakenesse, durst aduenture to discouer the same before so graue and iudicious an Auditory; but that this consideration doth somewhat support me, that no great blame can light herein vpon mee, but some aspersion thereof must reflect vpon your selues, who happened to make so euill a choyce; the more facile I expect you to bee in a cause, wherein you your selues are some wayes intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:20635:4"/>
The speciall cause of your assembling at this time, is, first, that you who professe the same truth, may ioyne in one body, and partake together of the same blessed Communion: and then, that such as adhere vnto false worship, may bee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and auoyded: You in your wisedome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this holy Sacrament to bee, as it were, <hi>ignis probationis,</hi> which would both <hi>congregare ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenea,</hi> and <hi>segregare heterogenea,</hi> (as in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie wee vse to speake) both conioyne those that be of the same, and dis-ioyne such as bee of a differing kinde and disposition. And to this purpose haue I made choyce of this present Text: wherein the Apostle maketh our partaking of the Lords Table to bee a testimony, not onely of the vnion and communion which wee haue betwixt our selues, and with our Head, (which he doth in the expresse words, which I haue read) but also of our dis-vnion and separation from all idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship: as appeareth by the application hereof vnto his maine drift and intendment, laid downe in the 14. and 21. verses.</p>
            <p>The effect therfore of that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in expresse termes heere deliuereth, is the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints:</hi> which consisteth of two parts; the fellowship which they haue with the <hi>Body,</hi> laid downe in the beginning; and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which they haue with the <hi>Head,</hi> laid downe in the end of the verse: both which are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by Saint <hi>Iohn: That which wee haue seene and heard, declare we vnto you, that ye also may haue fellowship with vs; and truly our fellowship is with


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20635:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Father, and with his Sonne Iesus Christ,</hi> 1. Ioh. 1.3. Let them therefore that walke in darknesse, brag as much as they list of their good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: this blessed Apostle assureth vs, that such onely as doe walke in the light,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>haue fellowship one with another</hi>; euen as they haue fellowship with God, and Iesus Christ his Sonne, whose blood shall cleanse them from all sinne. And to what better company can a man come,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.23, 24.</note> than <hi>to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly, and Church of the first-borne which are inrolled in heauen, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the spirits of iust men made perfect, and to Iesus the Mediator of the new Couenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaketh better things then that of Abel?</hi> No fellowship (doubtlesse) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin therefore with the first part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as the Apostle in the third to the Galatians maketh our being <hi>baptized into Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.27, 28.</note> to bee a testimony that wee <hi>are all one in Christ:</hi> so doth hee heere make our <hi>partaking of that one bread,</hi> to be an euidence that we also are all <hi>one bread, and one body</hi> in him. And to the same purpose, in the twelfth Chapter following, he propoundeth both our Baptisme and our drinking of the Lords Cup, as seales of the spirituall coniunction of vs all into one mysticall body. <hi>For as the body is one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.12, 13.</note> (saith he) <hi>and hath many members, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that one body, being many, are one body: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether wee bee Iewes or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free: and haue been all made to drinke


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20635:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into one Spirit.</hi> Afterwards hee addeth, that wee <hi>are the body of Christ, and members in particular:</hi> and in another place also,<note place="margin">Ibid. vers. 27.</note> that <hi>We being many, are one body in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.5.</note> 
               <hi>and euery one members one of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the vse which hee teacheth vs to make of this wonderfull coniunction (whereby wee are made members of Christ, and members one of another) is two-fold: 1. <hi>That there should be no schisme in the body.</hi> 2. <hi>That the members should haue the same care one for another,</hi> 1. Cor. 12.25. For preuenting of Schisme, hee exhorteth vs in the fourth to the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.3-6.</note> 
               <hi>to keepe the vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> and to make this bond the firmer, hee putteth vs in minde of <hi>one Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God and Father of all, who is aboue all, and through all, and in vs all:</hi> by this multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of vnities declaring vnto vs, that the knots whereby wee are tyed together, are both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more, and of farre greater moment, then that matters of smaller consequence should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer vs: and therefore that wee should <hi>stand fast in one spirit, with one minde, striuing together for the faith of the Gospell, and in nothing terrified by our aduersaries,</hi> Philip. chap. 1. vers. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer God hath thus marshalled his Church in a goodly order,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.4.</note> 
               <hi>terrible as an army with banners:</hi> yet, such is the disorder of our nature, that many for all this breake ranke, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my laboureth to breed diuision in Gods House,

It is a lamentable thing to behold, how this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, which was ordained by Christ to be a bond whereby wee should be knit together in vnity, is by Satans malice, and the corruption of mans disposition, so strangely peruerted the contrary way; that it is made the principall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of that wofull distraction which wee see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians at this day, and the very fuell of endlesse strifes, and implacable contentions. And for as much as these mischiefes haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the inconsiderate confounding of those things which in their owne nature are as different as may be: for the cleerer distinguishing of matters, we are in the first place to consider, that a Sacrament taken in his full extent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth two things in it: that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and visible, which the Schooles call pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> (in a more strict acception of the word:) and that which is inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible, which they tearme <hi>rem Sacramenti,</hi> the principall thing exhibited in the Sacrament. Thus in the Lords Supper, the outward thing which we see with our eyes, is <hi>bread and wine,</hi> the inward thing which wee apprehend by faith is, <hi>the body and blood of Christ:</hi> in the outward part of this mysticall action, which reacheth to that which is <hi>Sacramentum</hi> onely, we receiue this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood but sacramentally; in the inward, which containeth <hi>rem,</hi> the thing it selfe in it, wee receiue them really: and consequently the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of these in the one is <hi>relatiue and symbolicall</hi>; in the other, <hi>reall and substantiall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:20635:10"/>
To begin then with that which is symbolicall and relatiue: we may obserue out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> that <hi>Abraham receiued the signe of Circumcision, a seale of the righteousnesse of the faith which hee had being vncircumcised</hi>; that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments haue a twofold relation to the things whereof they be Sacraments: the one of a <hi>signe,</hi> the other of a <hi>seale.</hi> Signes, wee knovv, are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely vnited vnto the things which they doe sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie; and in this respect ate so neerly conioyned together, that the name of the one is vsually communicated vnto the other. <hi>This cup is the new Testament,</hi> or, the new Couenant, saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the institution of the holy Supper, Luk. 22.20. <hi>This is my Couenant,</hi> saith God in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Circumcision in the old Testament, Gen. 17.10. but how it was his Couenant, hee explaneth in the verse immediatly following: <hi>Ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskinne; and it shall be a</hi> SIGNE <hi>of the Couenant betwixt me and you.</hi> So words being the signes of things, no sooner is the sound of the word conueyed to our cares, but the notion of the thing signified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is presented vnto our minde: and thereupon in the speech of the Scripture nothing is more ordinary, then by the terme of <note n="*" place="margin">So the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ten words,</hi> Exod. 34.28. <hi>With God no word shall be vnpossible,</hi> that is, no thing.

               </gap>aire, and other ensignes of State are placed, is called <hi>the Chamber of presence,</hi> although the King himselfe bee not there personally present: and as the rude and vndutifull beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of any in that place, or the offering of any dis-respect to the Kings pourtraicture, or to the Armes Royall, or to any other thing that hath relation to his Maiesty, is taken as a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done vnto the King himselfe: so heere, hee that eateth the bread, and drinketh the cup of the Lord vnworthily,<note place="margin">1.

            </p>
            <p>In this sort wee acknowledge Sacraments to be <hi>signes</hi>; but bare signes we denie them to bee: <hi>seales</hi> they are, as vvell as signes of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. As it vvas therefore said of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> that he vvas <hi>a Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 11.9.</note> 
               <hi>and more then a Prophet:</hi> so must vve say of Sacraments, that they be signes, and more then signes; euen pledges and assurances of the interest vvhich vvee haue in the heauenly things that are represented by them. He that hath in his chamber y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> picture of the French King, hath but a bare signe; vvhich possibly may make him thinke of that King vvhen hee looketh on it, but shevveth not that hee hath any manner of interest in him. It is othervvise vvith him that hath the Kings great Seale for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the title that hee hath vnto all the


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20635:11"/>
lands and liuelihood which he doth inioy. And as heere, the waxe that is affixed to those letters Patents, howsoeuer for substance it bee the very same with that which is to be found euery where, yet being applyed to this vse, is of more worth to the Patentee, then all the waxe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try beside: so standeth it with the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the matter of the Sacrament. The bread and wine are not changed in substance from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with that which is serued at ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tables: but in respect of the sacred vse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are consecrated, such a change is made, that now they differ as much from common bread and wine, as heauen from earth. Neither are they to be accounted barely <hi>significatiue,</hi> but truly <hi>exhibitiue</hi> also of those heauenly things whereto they haue relation: as being appoynted by God to bee a meanes of conueying the same vnto vs, and putting vs in actuall possession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So that in the vse of this holy ordinance, as verily as a man with his bodily hand and mouth receiueth the earthly creatures; so verily doth he with his spirituall hand and mouth (if any such he haue) receiue the body and blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>And this is that <hi>reall and substantiall</hi> presence, which wee affirmed to be in the inward part of this sacred action. For the better conceiuing of which mystery, we are to inquire, first, what the thing is which wee doe heere receiue; secondly, how and in what manner we are made partakers of it. Touching the first, the truth which must be held, is this: that wee doe not here receiue onely


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20635:11"/>
the benefits that flow from Christ; but the very <hi>body and blood of Christ,</hi> that is, Christ himselfe crucified. For as none can bee made partaker of the vertue of the bread and wine to his bodily su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance, vnlesse he first doe receiue the substance of those creatures: so neither can any participate in the benefits arising from Christ to his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reliefe, except he first haue communion with Christ himselfe.

               <hi>vnto vs a Sonne is giuen</hi>;) so there must bee a receiuing of him on our part: for <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note>

               <hi>partakers of Christ.</hi> This is that <hi>great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (for so the Apostle termeth it) of our vnion with Christ, whereby we are made <hi>members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.30, 32.</note> and this is that <hi>eating of the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinking of his blood,</hi> which our Sauiour insisteth so much vpon, in the sixth of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where if any man shall demand, (that I may now come vnto the second poynt of our inquiry) <hi>How can this man giue vs his flesh to eate?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.52.</note> He must beware that he come not pre-occupied with such dull conceits as they were possessed withall, who


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20635:12"/>
moued that question there; hee must not thinke that we cannot truly feed on Christ, vnlesse we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him within our iawes: (for that is as grosse an imagination as that of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who could not conceiue how a man could bee <hi>borne againe,</hi> vnlesse he should <hi>enter the second time into his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe</hi>:)<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.4.</note> but must consider that the <hi>eating and drinking</hi> which our Sauiour speaketh of, must be answerable to the <hi>hungring and thirsting,</hi> for the quenching whereof this heauenly Banquet is prouided. Marke well the words which he vseth, toward the beginning of his discourse concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this argument.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.35, 36.</note> 
               <hi>I am the bread of life, hee that commeth to me, shall neuer hunger; and hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth on me, shall neuer thirst. But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.</hi> And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with those in the end:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.63, 64.</note> 
               <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speake vnto you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are some of you that beleeue not.</hi> Now obserue, that such as our hungring is, such is our eating. But euery one will confesse, that the hunger heere spoken of, is not corporall, but spirituall: Why then should any man dreame heere of a corporall eating? Againe, the corporall eating, if a man might haue it, would not auaile any thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> slaking of this hunger; nay, we are expressely told, that <hi>the flesh</hi> thus taken (for so we must vnderstand it) <hi>profiteth nothing,</hi> a man should neuer be the better, nor one iot the holier, nor any whit further from the second death, if he had filled his belly with it. But that


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20635:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
manner of feeding on this flesh, which Christ himselfe commendeth vnto vs, is of such profit, that it preserueth the eater from death,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.50, 51, 50, 58.</note> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him to liue for euer. It is not therefore such an eating, that euery man who bringeth a bodily mouth with him may attaine vnto: but it is of a farre higher nature; namely, a spirituall vniting of vs vnto Christ, whereby he dwelleth in vs, and we liue by him.</p>
            <p>If any doe further inquire, how it is possible that any such vnion should be, seeing the body of Christ is in heauen, and wee are vpon earth? I answere, that if the manner of this coniunction were carnall and corporall, it would bee indeed necessary that the things conioyned should bee admitted to bee in the same place: but it being altogether spirituall and supernaturall, no locall presence, no physicall nor mathematicall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity or contiguity is any way requisite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. It is sufficient for the making of a reall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this kinde, that Christ and we (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so farre distant in place each from other) bee knit together by those spirituall ligatures, which are intimated vnto vs in the words alledged out of the sixth of <hi>Iohn:</hi> to wit, the <hi>quickening Spirit</hi> descending downeward from the Head, to be in vs a fountaine of supernaturall life; and a <hi>liuely faith</hi> (wrought by the same Spirit) ascending from vs vpward, to lay fast hold vpon him, who <hi>hauing by himselfe purged our sinnes, sitteth on the right hand of the Maiesty on high.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First therefore, for the communion of the


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20635:13"/>
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the ground and foundation of this spirituall vnion; let vs call to minde what we haue read in Gods Booke: that Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> was made <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.45.</note> 
               <hi>a quickening spirit:</hi> and that he <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 5.21.</note> 
               <hi>quickeneth whom he will:</hi> that vnto him <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 3.34.</note> 
               <hi>God hath giuen the Spirit without measure:</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 1.16.</note> 
               <hi>of his fulnesse haue all we receiued:</hi> that <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>he that is ioyned vnto the Lord, is one Spirit:</hi> and that <note n="f" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.24. 4.13.</note> 
               <hi>heereby wee know that we dwell in him, and he in vs, because hee hath giuen vs his Spirit.</hi> By all which it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the mystery of our vnion with Christ consisteth mainly in this: that the selfe-same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is in him, as in the Head, is so deriued from him into euery one of his true members, that thereby they are animated and quickened to a spirituall life. We reade in the first of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> of foure liuing creatures, and of foure wheeles standing by them. <hi>When those went,</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>these went; and when those stood, these stood: and when those were lifted vp from the earth, the wheeles were lifted vp ouer against them.</hi> Hee that should behold such a vision as this, would easily conclude by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he saw, that some inuisible bands there were by which these wheeles and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures were ioyned together, howsoeuer none did outwardly appeare vnto the eye: and the holy Ghost, to giue vs satisfaction heerein, discouereth the secret, by yeelding this for the reason of this strange connexion; that <hi>the spirit of the liuing creature was in the wheeles,</hi> Ezek. 1.21. From whence wee may inferre, that things may truly be conioyned together, though the manner


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20635:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the coniunction bee not corporall: and that things distant in place may be vnited together, by hauing the spirit of the one communicated vnto the other.</p>
            <p>Nay, if we marke it well, we shall finde it to be thus in euery of our owne bodies: that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall reason of the vnion of the members con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in the continuity of the parts (though that also be requisite to the vnity of a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:) but in the animation thereof by one and the same spirit. If we should suppose a body to be as high as the heauens, that the head thereof should be where Christ our Head is, and the feet where we his members are: no sooner could that head thinke of mouing one of the toes, but instantly the thing would be done, without any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen by that huge distance of the one from the other. And why? because the same soule that is in the head, as in the fountaine of sence and motion, is present likewise in the lowest member of the body. But if it should so fall out, that this, or any other member proued to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, it presently would cease to bee a member of that body; the corporall coniunction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity with the other parts notwithstanding. And euen thus is it in Christ; although in regard of his corporall presence,<note place="margin">Act. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>the heauen must receiue him, vntill the times of the restitution of all things:</hi> yet is he here <hi>with vs alway, euen vnto the end of the world,</hi> in respect of the presence of his Spirit;<note place="margin">Math. 28.20.</note> by the vitall influence whereof from him, as from the Head, <hi>the whole body is fitly ioyned together,</hi>

            <p>Neither must we heere with a fleshly eye looke vpon the meanenesse of the outward elements, and haue this faithlesse thought in our hearts, that there is no likelihood, a bit of bread, and a draught of wine should be able to produce such heauenly effects as these.

            <p>True it is indeed, these outward creatures haue

            </p>
            <p>Whereby vve may collect thus much, that as the Lords Supper is a seale of our coniunction one vvith another, and vvith Christ our Head; so is it an euidence of our dis-iunction from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, binding vs to dis-auovv all communion vvith them in their false vvorship. And indeed, the one must necessarily follovv vpon the other:


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20635:16"/>
considering the nature of this hainous sinne of Idolatry is such, that it can no wayes stand with the fellowship which a Christian man ought to haue, both with the Head, and with the body of the Church.

               <hi>The Idols of the Heathen are siluer and gold, the worke of mens hands,</hi> saith the Psalmist: and so the <hi>Idols</hi> (of Christians, in all likelihood) mentioned in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">Reuel. 9.20.</note> are said to bee <hi>of gold, and siluer, and brasse, and stone, and of wood; which neither can see, nor heare, nor walke.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of these Idols (wee see) agreeth in all poynts with Popish Images: where is any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?</p>
            <p>The Heathen, say they, held the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be gods, which is far from our thought.

               <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne God,</hi> Act. 17.23. if, as the common vse of Idolaters was, they added an Image to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:) I will content my selfe with these two places of Scripture; the one whereof concerneth the Iewes, the other the Heathen. That which toucheth the Heathen, is in the first Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans: where the Apostle hauing said, that God had shewed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which might be knowne of him; and that <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible things of him,</hi> that is, <hi>his eternall power and God-head,</hi> was manifested vnto them by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and the contemplation of the creatures: hee addeth presently, that God was sorely displeased with them, and therefore gaue them vp vnto vile affections, because <hi>they changed the glory of that vncorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible men, and to birds, and foure-footed beasts, and creeping things.</hi> Whereby it is euident, that the Idolatry condemned in the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of the Heathen, was the adoring of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible God, whom they acknowledged to be the Creator of all things, in visible Images fashioned to the similitude of men and beasts.</p>
            <p>The other place of Scripture, is the 4. of Deuteronomy: where <hi>Moses</hi> vseth this speech vnto the children of Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:20635:20"/>
               <hi>The Lord spake vnto you out of the midst of the fire: yee heard the voyce of the Words, but saw no similitude, onely yee heard a voyce,</hi> verse 12. And what doth he inferre vpon this? <hi>Take yee therefore good heed vnto your selues,</hi> (saith he in the 15. vers.) <hi>for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake vnto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire. Left yee corrupt your selues, and make you a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen image, the similitude of any figure, the likenesse of male or female, the likenes of any beast that is on the earth, the likenes of any winged fowle that flieth in the aire, the likenesse of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likenes of any fish that is in the waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the earth.</hi> Where we may obserue: first, that God in the deliuery of the Law did purposely vse a <hi>voyce</hi> onely; because that such a creature as that, was not to be expressed by visible lineaments. as if that voyce should haue said vnto the Painter, as Eccho is fayned to doe in the <note n="i" place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, that when he vttered the words of the second Commandement in mount Sinai, and forbad the making of the likenes of any thing <hi>that is in Heauen aboue, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Waters vnder the Earth</hi>; hee did at that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to shew himselfe in any visible shape, either of man or woman, either of beast in the earth, foule in the aire, or fish in the waters beneath the earth: to the end it might be the better made knowne, that it was his pleasure not to be adored at all in any such formes; &amp; that the worshipping

of Images, not onely as they haue reference to the creatures whom they doe immediately repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or to false gods, but also as they haue relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himselfe (the true God, who was then spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto them in the Mount) did come within the compasse of the Idolatry which was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Commandement.</p>
            <p>In vaine therefore doe the Romanists goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perswade vs, that their Images be no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles: and as vainely also doe they spend time in curiously distinguishing the seuerall degrees of worship; the highest point whereof, which they call <hi>Latreia,</hi> and acknowledge to be due onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, they would be loth wee should thinke that they did communicate to any of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But here wee are to vnderstand, first of all, that Idolatry may be committed by giuing not the highest onely, but also the lowest degree of religious adoration vnto Images: and therefore in the words of the Commandement, the very <hi>bowing downe vnto them,</hi> which is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanest degrees of worship, is expresly forbidden.

            <p>Nay, according to their owne principles, how is it possible that any of themselues should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, that the host which they worship should be any other thing but bread? seeing the change doth wholy depend vpon <hi>consecration

               <hi>cannot be certaine by the certainty of faith, that hee doth receiue a true Sacrament; for asmuch as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament cannot be made without the intention of the Minister, and none can see another mans intention.</hi> Apply this now to the matter we haue in hand; and see into what intricate Labyrinths these men haue brought themselues. Admit the Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention stood right at the time of consecration, yet if he that baptized him failed in his intention when he administred that Sacrament, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth still vnbaptized, and so becommeth vncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Priesthood; and consequently, whatsoeuer he consecrateth is but bread still. Yea, admit hee were rightly baptized too: if either the Bishop that conferred vpon him the Sacrament of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (for so they hold it to be) or those that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or ordained that Bishop, missed their right intention; neither will the one proue Bishop, nor the other Priest; and so with what intention soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer either the one or the other doth consecrate, there remaineth but bread still. Neither doth the inconuenience stay heere, but ascendeth vpward to all their predecessors: in any one of whom if there fall out to bee a nullity of Priesthood (for want of intention, either in the baptizer, or in the


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20635:23"/>
ordainer) all the generation following, according to their principles, goe without their Priesthood too; and so deliuer but bread to the people, in stead of the body of Christ. The Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therefore, if they stand vnto their owne grounds, must needs confesse, that they are in no better case heere, then the Samaritans were in, of whom our Sauiour saith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.22.</note> 
               <hi>Yee worship yee know not what:</hi> but we know, that what they worship (bee the condition or intention of their Priest what it will be) is bread indeed; which while they take to be their God, we must still account them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of spirituall fornication, <hi>and such fornication, as is not so much as named amongst the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These then being the <hi>Idolaters</hi> with whom we haue to deale, let vs learne first how dangerous a thing it is to communicate with them in their false worship. For if we will be partakers of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons sinnes,<note place="margin">Reuel. 13.4.</note> wee must looke to receiue of her plagues. Secondly, wee are to be admonished, that it is not sufficient that in our owne persons we refraine worshipping of Idols, but it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required, that we restraine (as much as in vs lyeth) the practice thereof in others; lest by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering God to be dishonoured in so high a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when wee may by our calling hinder it, wee make our selues partakers of other mens sinnes. <hi>Eli</hi> the high Priest was a good man, and gaue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent counsell vnto his lewd sonnes: yet wee know what iudgement fell vpon him,<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>because his sonnes made themselues vile, and he frowned not vpon them,</hi> (that is, restrained them not;) which God


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20635:24"/>
doth interpret to be a kinde of Idolatry,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.29.</note> in <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his sonnes aboue him.</hi> The Church of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus did for her owne part hold fast Christs name, and denyed not his faith: yet had the Lord something against her;<note place="margin">Reuel. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>because she had there, them that held the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling blocke before the children of Israel, to eate things sacrificed vnto Idols, and to commit fornication.</hi> So we see what speciall notice our Sauiour taketh of the workes, and charity, and seruice,<note place="margin">Reuel. 2.20.</note> and saith, &amp; patience of the Church of Thyatira: and yet for all this he addeth, <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, I haue a few things against thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou sufferest that woman Iezebel, which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse, to teach and to seduce my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to commit fornication, and to eate things sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed vnto Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second of Iudges God telleth the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel, what mischiefe should come vnto them by tolerating the Canaanitish Idolaters in their Land.<note place="margin">Iudg. 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>They shall be</hi> thornes <hi>in your sides,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and their gods shall be a snare vnto you.</hi> Which words containe in them the intimation of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger: the one respecting the <hi>soule,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>body.</hi> That which concerneth the soule, is: that their Idols should be <hi>a snare vnto them.</hi> For God well knew that mans nature is as prone to spirituall fornication, as it is to corporall. As therefore for the preuenting of the one, he would not haue a common harlot tolerated in Israel, <hi>Lest the Land should fall to whoredome and become full of wickednesse:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.29.</note> so for the keeping out of the


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20635:24"/>
other, he would haue prouocations taken away, and all occasions whereby a man might be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to commit so vile a sinne. The bodily danger that followeth vpon the toleration of Idolaters, is: that <hi>they should be in their sides,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Numb. 33.55.</note> (as in another place it is more fully expressed) <hi>they should be prickes in their eyes, and thornes in their sides, and should vexe them in the Land wherein they dwelled.</hi> Now in both these respects it is certaine, that the toleration of the Idolaters with whom we haue to doe, is farre more perillous than of any other. In regard of the spirituall danger, wherewith simple soules are more like to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared: because this kinde of Idolatry is not brought in with an open shew of impiety, (as that of the Pagans) but is <hi>a mystery of iniquity,</hi> a wickednesse couered with the vaile of piety; and the harlot, which maketh the inhabitants of the earth drunke with the wine of this fornication, is both gilded her selfe, and presenteth also her abominations vnto her followers in <hi>a cup of gold.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 17.2, 4.</note> If we looke to outward perill, we are like to find these men, not thornes in our sides to vexe vs, but daggers in our hearts to destroy vs. Not that I take all of them to be of this furious disposition, (mistake me not: I know a number my selfe of a farre different temper:) but because there are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanting among them some turbulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, so inflamed with the spirit of fornication, that they runne mad with it; and are transported so farre, that no tolerable termes can content them, vntill they haue attained to the vtmost

spirits, his Maiesty in his Princely wisedome did cause an <hi>Oath of Allegeance</hi> to bee framed; by the tendring whereof he might be the better able to distinguish betwixt his loyall and disloyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and to put a difference betwixt a seditious and a quiet-minded Romanist: this companion derideth his simplicity, in imagining, that that will serue the turne, and supposing that a Papist will thinke himselfe any whit bound by taking such an oath. <note n="l" place="margin">

When he had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all his security in that oath; hee thought he had found such a manner of oath, knit with so many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that it could not, with safety of conscience, by any meanes be dissolued by any man. But hee could not see, that if the Pope did dissolue that oath; all the tyings of it, (whether of performing fidelity to the King, or of admitting no dispensation) would bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued together. Yea, I will say another thing that is more admirable. You know (I beleeue) that an vniust oath, if it be euidently knowne, or openly declared to be such, bindeth no man; but is voyd</hi> ipso facto. <hi>That the Kings oath is vniust, hath been sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Pastor of the Church himselfe.

If matters now be come vnto this passe, that such as are addicted to the Pope, will account the Oath of Allegeance to haue lesse force to binde them then a rope of straw; iudge ye whether y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be not true which hath been said, that in respect not of spirituall infection onely, but of outward dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger also to our State, any Idolaters may be more safely permitted then Papists.
