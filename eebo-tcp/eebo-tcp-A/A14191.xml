            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This onely is to be obserued, that the time when he liued, and the age wherevnto hee did prophesie, had great need of the doctrine which he taught them: for that (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the course of his wordes) they were growne vnto great extremitie in rebellion against the Lord, and besotted so senslesly in their iniquitie, that albeit the hand of God was heauie vppon them, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered it not, but to the ende that those on

whome God had ordained to bestowe his grace, might be rowzed out of their sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and they whom in his heauie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal displeasure he had cast off, might be made the more without excuse: the Lorde stirred vp this prophet to speak vnto them, which teacheth vnto vs this doctrine for our instruction, that in those places, and among that people,<note place="margin">

of the order of <hi>Leui,</hi> or of some other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, raised vp extraordinarylie from God, wythout the calling of men: the which, (though it be so) bringeth no doubt either of the doctrine to be deliuered, or of the party by whom it is to be made knowen. For as concerning the doctrine, albeit it be euery way authenticall (that is, of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authoritie in it selfe) yet when wee looke into the matters for which this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is alleadged, in the new Testament we shall see, that with the Lord it is of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne account, being made (as it were) the vmpare of so great matters: for it is not only alleadged by the apostle <note n="a" place="margin">

of so great importance they might regarde and respect it, and not the party by whom it was to be vttered: which thing is also vnto vs worthy the consideration, to teach vs that wee maye not hang the credite or truth of the worde of God,<note place="margin">

is that, wherein the calling of the prophet is prooued both vnto his owne conscience, and also to the people: to his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thus, that when hee should enter into the triall of himselfe,<note place="margin">

vnto the woorde of God, and in their liues (as they bee placed aboue others) giue no example for them to follow, but that which is good and holie, and (if they would well consider of it) they should see that there is great cause that they should doe so, for as the great Cedars in <hi>Libanon,</hi> while they staied, are a defence vnto manie shrubbes and bushes vnder them, but if they fall, they crush all that be within their reache, euen so, they that are of higher estate and calling, while they continue in the feare of God, &amp; the waies of holines, are as props and staies vnto many that look vpon them, and great meanes to drawe others on by their authoritie &amp; example, but when they fal and giue them selues vnto the waies of sinne and wickednes, they go not that waie alone, but are an occasion of falling vnto manie others besides of their inferiours, and followers, nowe albeit it be true that (because one man sinneth willingly) the<note n="a" place="margin">

lyon, that is, not runne them selues out of breath, wyth theyr fiercenes, but preuaile and become inuincible: In which words, are the enemies of the Church of GOD verie notably described, whether they bee suche as haue a will and cannot, or haue not onelie a will, but also power to make hauocke, and doe hurt vnto Gods people.</p>
            <p>The first sort of enemies bee described in the former Metaphor, wherein they are sayd, to haue the teeth of a lyon, that is, to be sharpe, and bitter, verie willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to rauine and deuour, and prepared for the purpose against the daye that they desire.

The Israelites hauing had many a blessing bestowed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as namely the quiet possession of the lande of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with the plentiful store of al good things that it yeelded vnto them) were not only taught by the lords messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers (which hee raised vppe among them from time to time) the true feare of God, and manner howe hee will be worshipped, but also the right vse of those blessings: and wee haue receiued from his handes the like tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessinges (if not greater) and haue been taught and instructed in as plentiful

The Israelites were so farre from hearkening to the voice of God by his Prophets, that they intreated them euill, imprisoned, and shamefullie abused them: and wee haue so little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the voice of God sounding in our eares, by the mouths of Gods Ministers, and make so little account of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered vnto vs by the mouth of God, that wee conceiue displeasure against the messengers.</p>
            <p>The Israelites (when the Lorde sawe that the ministerie of his seruants profited them not) were afflicted with the hand of God, and among other scourges, wyth a scarcitie of bread, which they had inioyed before in great abundance: and wee haue had the hand of God many wayes vppon vs (howsoeuer we haue felt it) and among others, with that scarcity of bread (though not in the like extremitie) that they felt.

The Israelites not profiting by this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle correction from the Lord, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their vngodly ways without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, were threatned to haue their forrein foes inuade them, and vtterly to ouerturne both the state of religion, and the common wealth, subduing the lande vnto intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miserie: and we are threatned (I wil not say with whom, nor when, no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Prophet did) with a people as great as they were, as rauenous to deuoure, as desirous of our confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as their foes were of theirs.

drinke-offeringes that were brought into the temple, were either consecrated vnto the fire, or (for the most part) allotted vnto the priestes, and therefore this reason see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to reach no further then onelie vnto them, that were to minister in the temple, because their liuings did decaie: but wee must note, that he meaneth not onelie that they should mourne because their ministers lacked liuing, (albeit, euen that is a iust cause, for the people of God to mourne) but especiallie hee had regard vnto the exercise of the ministerie in the temple, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned both the glorie of God, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their own soules, and then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is in effect thus muche: there is great cause you should mourne, seing not onelie, the meanes wherby your soules haue bene fed, is taken away, but also the maner how the honor of God hath bin made more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious among you then in any other nation vnder the sunne.

or threaten to extinguish the same, it being the chiefe thing that we can inioy in this life, and our sinnes being the onely cause of the remouing of the same, it must sit (of all other things) most neare vnto vs, and draw our hearts vnto the greatest sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and (doubtles) it dieth so in them that haue receiued any feeling of the sweetnes of the same: for they know what heauenly consolations are to be learned out of it, and in what wofull case they be that are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of it.</p>
            <p>What miserable condition bee they then in, that are so farre from taking this course, or being of this minde, that they bende all their powers both of their mindes and bodies, to extinguish and race out of memorie, that inestimable treasure of Gods holye woorde, and neuer thinke themselues in good estate, vntill they haue defaced the same? surely if the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of it bee an argumente of a care to honour GOD, and to haue thine owne soule saued, then the disanullinge, or desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ouerthrowe thereof, is a fearefull token, that thou neyther carest for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, nor the saluation of thine owne soule, but rather (for that thou settest

thy selfe against the meanes of them both) art a professed enemie both to God &amp; thine owne saluation. If those that are such eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto the preaching of the word, were perswaded, that this were true of them, they woulde looke more carefullie about them, weying in what state they stand, but while they go on in the contempt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strucion, and consider not that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Lord of hostes, and destroy their owne soules, it commeth to passe, that they passe on blind-fold vnto their own destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <hi>The Priests the Lords ministers do mourne</hi>) these words conteine in them a second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to perswade them to mourne, which is thus: there is great cause that you should all mourne and lament, seeing they whom I haue made your guydes, in the matters of religion, who know more then you doe, and who are to haue that estimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, which becommeth messengers of so great affayers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so mightie a prince,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must frame their affections vnto the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their ministers.</hi>
               </note> do go heauily, &amp; take vp a lamentation, out of which reason, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet doth teach vnto vs this lesson, that the ministers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land, whom he hath placed ouer a people, are by the same people dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to be obserued, &amp;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:853:65"/>
their affections to bee imitated by those whom they are sent to instruct, for in this reson y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord saith vnto them mourne you, because the Lordes Ministers do mourne, as if he should saye, marke them well that I haue set ouer you: and in all things that are not vnlawfull, frame your selues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto them, the reason of the same is this: God appointing his minister to be his owne mouth vnto his people, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto him all that his will, whiche hee would haue them to know. And againe, he being a watchman vnto the people, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aloft in the tower, and espieth a farre off the enimies that are a comming and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the people a signe therof, they receiue it, and demeane themselues accordingly, or els are worthily set vpon by their enimies of a sudden, and ouerthrowne: so that the minister knowing more than the people of the will of GOD, and seeing the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD approching, when the people (otherwise very godly) can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them, it is meete that they so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his course, as if he take vp a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is because of the euil that he seeth approching vpon them, and therefore they are to mourne also, to the end, that by their
<pb facs="tcp:853:66"/>
vnfained ioyning together in repentance, they may meete the Lorde by the waye, and preuent his iudgementes, that else shoulde haue light vppon them. Againe, in that he willeth them to mourne because the Lordes Ministers do so:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The people may feare, that giue their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster cause of griefe.</hi>
               </note> we do learne that that people among whome the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of GOD hath cause geuen to be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, haue iust cause to bee greeued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, whether it doo arise from that badde entertainement that hee hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, or from that carelesse atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce that they giue vnto the doctrine of the trueth taught them by him, in both which respectes our Sauiour Christe she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the causes: for in regarde of the person hee saith: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.</note> Hee that refuseth you refuseth mee, as if hee shoulde saye, that entertainement which they giue to you, who represent my person vnto them, I take to bee geuen vnto my selfe, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor lesse. And in respecte of the doctrine hee saith: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math</hi> 10.11.</note> When you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a house, abide there, and if the sonne of peace bee there, your peace shall abide with him, but if not, it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto you againe: and whosoeuer shal not receiue you, nor heare your wordes,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:853:66"/>
when you depart thence, shake off the dust of your feete. Surely, I saye vnto you, it shall be easier for them of the land of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than for that citie. The reasons then are thus to bee gathered, they that giue Gods Minister cause of greefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, doe it either in the euill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of his person, or reiecting of his doctrine: but if they receiue not his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the entertainement due to the messenger of god, they refuse Iesus Christ, and if they refuse his doctrine, the dust of his feete that brought vnto them glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roma.</hi> 10.15</note> shall be a witnesse against them.</p>
            <p>And therefore haue that people, who by either of these meanes make GODS Minister heauie hearted iust cause to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, for that the misery which gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him shall one daye light vppon them. If this were considered, and the trueth thereof perswaded vnto our consciences, coulde wee (thinke you) offer vnto them that villanie which wee doe, by slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, reproches, disgraces, and all kinde of molestations?

Or if we do determine before hand, not to beleeue it, sauing so farre as it pleaseth our humour, no it is not possible, but rather it woulde make vs, with all zealous care attend vnto the voice of God speaking to vs by them: pray to God continually, to teache vs the vnderstanding of the same, and to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnfainedly to put in execution what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer appeareth vnto vs to bee enioyned from the mouth of the Lorde.

it woulde make them aboue all thinges seeke vnto it, that they might learne out of the same, that true and vnfained attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God, whereby the lawfull frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delight in the thinges of this life, might bee possessed by them wyth more peace: but whilest they neuer once inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any such cogitation, but rather, on the contrary part thinke, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religion bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it these and these inconueniences, depriueth of such and such commodities, and abandoneth manye of those pleasures that they cannot leaue, it commeth to passe that they are so farre from thinking well of godlinesse, as they bid battell vnto it, as if it were their greatest foe, to the end (as they falsely persuade themselues) that they may bee the more safe in their sinfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Generallie, because they had so ill successe in their callings, wherby we learn this lesson, that whensoeuer we do careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie employe our selues in the discharge of our duty in that calling, wherin the Lord hath set vs, and we see little fruit redound vnto vs from the same, we haue iust cause to howle and be ashamed, because that our sinnes haue stepped betweene the Lorde and vs, to keepe from vs his blessing vpon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:853:75"/>
our labours, which doctrine is needfull to bee learned in euerie condition, for if wee, that are the ministers of the word, could be perswaded, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> not profiting of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is because of our sinnes, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate could beleeue that the rebellion and vnrulines of his subiects, were the fruit of Gods anger against him for his offences: if masters and Parents coulde be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the vnfaythfulnesse of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and vngratiousnes of their children were a punishment from God for their transgressions. To conclude, if he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth backwarde, in the worlde, could thinke that God punisheth him therewith for his carelesnesse in godlines, it woulde make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs more religious and godly, &amp; to lessen the kingdome of sinne within vs daylie more and more. The cause whiche the Prophete alleageth is, (as you see) sett downe in very many wordes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the worde in teaching.</hi>
               </note> all which do signifie one thing in effect, and might (as before) haue beene expressed in one shorte sentence, but the Prophet knowing howe hard a thing it was to make them beleeue that they shoulde so bee depriued of their commodities, doeth not onely tell it vnto them, but also vrge, and (as it were) in force
<pb facs="tcp:853:76"/>
it vnto them, that they might with the more sence and feeling bee affected with the same, which teacheth vnto vs, howe necessarie a thing it is, for vs, not onelye to haue the trueth of Gods woorde tolde in plaine and clear termes, but also vrged, inlarged, &amp; stood vpon to the ende, that our harts which are dull, may by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, receiue impression with the same, &amp; be the more throwly conformed to the liking of it, and therefore it is, that the holy-ghost requireth in a minister, to bee instaunt in season and out of seson, to improue, rebuke, exhort with al long suffering, and doctrin, for wee see that the capacitye of man is so narrowe, that oftentimes he gainsaying a good thing propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded generally vnto him, which afterward being laid open, &amp; inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the causes, commodities &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances therof, he imbraceth with great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to the end that we may learne to like of &amp; imbrace: the necessitye of those conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall discourses, whereby the word of God is persuaded vnto our consciences, &amp; not (as is the maner of many) to contemne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise them.

true, that the ill life of the minister is no sufficient cause to make any man giue lesse obedience vnto the doctrine, then is meet, for that they sittinge in <hi>Moses</hi> his chaire,<note place="margin">

            <p>For the simple people (yea, and those that thinke them-selues no fooles also) when they heare anye doctrine deliuered vnto them, that seemeth not to agree with flesh and blood, do by and by say: but wil he doe as he sayth, if it appeare by any of his disorders, that he doeth not, forthwith they say: why should wee beleeue him, or do as he telleth vs, when he doth cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him-selfe, with out doubt, that whiche hee sayeth, is but for fashion sake, for hee knoweth some nearer way to heauen then

hee telleth vs (for els hee would not doe cleane contrarie) and therefore wee will venture as well as hee. I know (beloued) that the ministers of God, whose life is no way to be reprooued of men, are often char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be such: but it is not of them that I speake, it is too true, that the complaint is most iust of manie, whose behauior (though they can speake neuer so smoothly in their pretenced eloquence) doth sow more seedes of atheisme in one year, then their doctrine will root out in their whole life: &amp; so much the greter cause haue we to lament our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that (being plunged in so many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) haue so few to be found among a gret number, that may faithfully goe before vs in the practise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course, which may lead to the preuenting of gods iust iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs. In that the ministers are willed to gyrd them selues, the Prophet vseth a borrowed speech, from the behauiour of the bodie in the businesses of this life vnto that whiche concerneth the life to come. For it was the maner (as many places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach vs) of the Iewes and other the people of the East countreis, to go in long garmences, which (when they were to do any labour of importance) they did gird vp,

to the end that they myght no waie be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but might perfourme the same, with more readines, and more effectuallie. Now the prophet by this kinde of speach, dooth teach the ministers, first, that they imploy themselues in the execution of those means that may turne awaie the iudgementes of God from the people with all expedition, and teacheth vs this lesson, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Lorde commaundeth vs out of hys woorde,<note place="margin">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:853:80"/>
which is (also) diligentlie to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for as the nature of man, being prone to all ill, hath (on the one side) manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, to drawe him from all goodnes, if they bee not wiselie looked vnto: so hath it (on the other side) by reason of the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that it is of vnto anie goodnesse, need of manie spurres and prickes to sturre him vppe, without which, hee shall not onelie keepe him selfe from the perfourming of many duties that be required at his hands, but also freeze and waxe cold in that which hee hath begunne: So that (ioyning the former and this together) hee that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth to beecome a Christian indeede, and euer looketh to attaine vnto anie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable measure of Godlinesse, or hauing attained therevnto, to contynue therein, vnto the ende, must carefullie watche to remooue all thinges that hee seeth maye hynder hym, and diligentlie take vppe, all those helpes which maie further him in the same.</p>
            <p>The lacke of obseruation whereof, is the cause, that so many in these last and dangerous daies take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of christians with so smal reformation, &amp; that so many shrink away from that good course

            <p>Nowe least they shoulde take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against him, as one that took too much vpon him, and reprooued those that were to reprooue him, hee calleth them, <hi>Ye mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of my God)</hi> wherein first of all, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth his authoritie and warrant, by vertue whereof hee did so instruct them, to shew them that in disobeying his words their offence was not against him, but the Lorde. Secondly, hee sheweth that he doth acknowledge them to be the Ministers of God, and yet dooth iustly shew them their duety, teaching vnto vs, that euen the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that are to instruct others when they do amisse, or faile in anie duetie, are to be reprooued for their fault, and taught howe to amend.</p>
            <p>As hee dealt with the husbandmen, so dooth hee with the priests, that is,<note place="margin">19.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them the special cause that is to draw them to lamentation and mourning, which is, that the meat-offering and drinke-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:853:82"/>
is taken away from the house of god: whereby hee dooth first of all teach them, that forsomuch as the glorie of God in the visible aduancement of the same, stoode in this, that the temple had great abundance of sacrifices brought vnto it: nowe that those offerings were to cease,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the gospel must greeue vs.</hi>
               </note> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Lord must so much be greeued therewithall, as the glorie of God is deere vnto them. The vse of which doctrine (for our instruction) is this, that as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward seruice consisted then in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of sacrifices, so dooth it nowe in the enlargement of the preaching profession, and practise of the gospell, so that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the same is any waye abridged (if we haue that zeale of Gods glory that we shoulde) it must driue vs vnto the same sorrowe that these are commanded to take vp in the like case. Again, we learn by this (comparing it with the cause thereof) that whensoeuer the word of God, either in the profession or practise of the same hath not that free passage that is meete, the cause therof resteth in the sins of the people, that profes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same word according as we heard yesterday deliuered vnto vs more at large.</p>
            <p>Now in that hee sayth <hi>(The house of your
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:853:82"/>
God)</hi> he doth not only put them in mind of their calling from whence it came, and the Iudge to whome they must giue account, howe they haue demeaned themselues in it,<note place="margin">

               </note> but also (in the generall backeward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the people) comforteth so many of them as laie these thinges to heart, that howsoeuer they might bee discouraged by the frowardnes of the people, and fear, that God was not therfore pleased with them, hee notwithstanding remained still their God, &amp; reckned of them according to their faithfulnes in their calling, &amp; not after the fruit that came of it, which hee always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth in his owne hand, to lessen or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it, according to his good pleasure. And surely, this lesson is very needefull to bee learned in these euill dayes, of those faithfull Ministers that doe with a good conscience discharge their duties: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coragements that we haue, by the careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; obstinat disobedience of the people to whom our feete ought to be most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, are many and greeuous,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Sanctifie you a fast, &amp;c.</hi>) After that hee hath shewed vnto them howe they are to behaue themselues priuately,<note place="margin">20.21.</note> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselues to giue the people al good example of forwardnesse, he nowe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to shewe vnto them what they are to doe publikely, that the punishment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beeing generall, the whole people might bee drawne vnto a solemne repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:853:83"/>
These woordes (contained in the first of these verses) doe describe vnto vs, the exercise of a publike fast, almost in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery circumstaunce of the same: so that I might haue iust occasion heere to handle the whole common place of it, which I thinke not so meete at this present, yet wil I briefly set it downe, so farre as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent place giueth warrant. And first of al, whereas hee willeth them to sanctifie a fast,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What a pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like fast is.</hi>
               </note> we are first to consider what this fast is, to the ende, that it may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare howe it is to bee doone: briefly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be thus described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence commaunded of the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make solemne profession of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. It is called an abstinence, not as if that were all and euery thing requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at our hands in such an action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the most noted outward helpe therevnto: for indeed fasting is no part of the thing, but onely an outward helpe to drawe vs the better vnto the inward sense of that vnfained repentaunce, which wee are to shew foorth. Nowe this fasting is not like that of the Papists, wherein they abstaine from some kinde of foode, and cram themselues with others: but it is an
<pb facs="tcp:853:84"/>
vtter refusall of all the commodities and pleasures of this life, therby to make vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apter to the inward vertue. And therfore wee reade, that the godlye were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to refraine from all kinde of foode, vnttil the euening.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20.26. <hi>Vpon what occasion fasts are to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
               </note> Secondly, wee are to see, when, and vpon what occasion this exercise is to bee taken in hande. One, and not the least, the woordes of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doe shewe vs, who vppon considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the miserie that they felt, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they feared, were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to humble themselues before the lord: so that whensoeuer the Church of God is in any distresse, or feareth any danger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching, it is the duetie of the guides thereof, to call them vnto this solemne fasting. Other causes there be of the same, as the electing of ministers or magistrats,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Actes</hi> 13.2.</note> but because they be not in my text, and my purpose is not to handle anie more of the common place than it affordeth, I wil not speake of them. Furthermore, this being an extraordinarie exercise, it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whom the Lorde hath geuen the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnto to proclaime it, some saye, that it resteth in the authoritie of the Magistrate, and some affirme it to bee a

dutie of the ministers:<note place="margin">

               </note> they that lay it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the magistrate, doe alleadge for their profe the examples of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the king of <hi>Niniuie,</hi> who both in the like extremitie proclamed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fasts amongest their people: but they are aunswered thus: First, that their particular examples doe not prooue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doctrine in this case, seeing that the commandement of God (as shall appeare) is expresse on the other side. Secondlie, it can not bee prooued, that <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> (for the other was a heathen king, whose example can prooue nothing) didde anye more in that action, than both hee might and was commaunded to doe in euery part of religion, and, that is, to proclaime and by his authoritie to compel them to whom the Church matters appertained to doe their dueties faithfully, and therefore it is, that the Holie-ghost in that place, (and also in that of <hi>Ionah</hi>) vseth a worde farre different from this in this place: for there the woorde signifieth to call or send forth, which maye in generall bee applied vnto the promulgation of anye edict whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and heere it importeth (as it were) a conseecration, or hallowing withall,
<pb facs="tcp:853:85"/>
which is a thing peculiar to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ministers of the worde, so that thus farre it belongeth to the Magistrate to see it done, to enioine the doing of it, and (if it please him) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the time thereof vnto the ministers, but that the particular notifieng of it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people belongeth vnto the ministers of the worde it is euident by these reasons: first, that which the Lorde commaundeth out of his worde vnto the Ministers of a Church established, the same (vnlesse it be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by some countermaunde) is the office of the Ministers of the word for euer: but the Lorde out of his worde commaundeth in this place, the Ministers of the Church of Israel, which was an established Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and that vnder a king, to sanctifie a fast, &amp; call the solemne assemblie, therfore it is the duetie of the Ministers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word for euer: secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which cannot be done without doctrine and publike praier, that same is the office of the Minister: but the sanctifieng of a fast (that is, the preparing of the people by instruction what it is, and to what ende, and praying vnto God to enable them therevnto) can not bee doone wythout doctrine and praier,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.</note> (for euerie thing is sanctified vnto vs by the woorde
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:853:85"/>
and praier) therefore to call a solemne fast, is the office of the Minister: thirdly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer belongeth to the publike seruice of God in the congregation, that same is the proper dutie of the Minister, but to sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a fast belongeth to the publike seruice of God in the congregation: therefore, it is the proper duetie of the Minister. And that it belongeth to the publike seruice of God in the congregation, it appeareth by the turning of the reason thus: whatsoeuer is required of a Minister in regarde of hys ministerie, that same is a part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like seruice of God: but to sanctifie a fast, is required of the priests in this place, in respect of their ministerie, and therefore it is a part of the publike seruice of God. But you may say vnto me, euery Minister hath his proper charge, the limits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he may not passe, but a solemne fast is a generall thing, peraduenture thorowe a whole kingdome, and therfore is it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that (being larger than he hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to deale in) belongeth not vnto him. Wherevnto I answere, that it is true,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> answered.</hi>
               </note> one Minister hath no further authoritie than his particular flocke, and therefore can cal no publike fast further than amongest his
<pb facs="tcp:853:86"/>
owne people. But the whole Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided by a Councell of Ministers, is to be prepared to a fast, by the authoritie of the whole.</p>
            <p>You may further saye vnto me: What if the Eldershippe of Ministers doe not, or will not proclaime it, whether oughte a particular Minister (who in that case is as a priuate manne) to doe it or no?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An other obiection answeared.</hi>
               </note> I answeare, that if other men will not doe their duetie, yet I may not meddle wyth it, but the example or authoritie of others, must not make me leaue mine owne duety vndone. So that it is true a general fast, in a whole kingdome, or in manie partes thereof may not be proclaimed by one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: yet may hee, (and by the worde of God hee ought) when God threatneth or punisheth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What is the ende of a publike fast.</hi>
               </note> call his owne charge vnto this same exercise.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he sheweth in the latter ende of the verse,<note place="margin">22.</note> to what ende all this is, to wit, that they may crie vnto the Lord, that is, bee the more effectually drawne vnto the feeling of their sinnes, and the desert ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that so they might powre out their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more effectually vnto the Lord, for the remission of the same: so that this fasting
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:853:86"/>
or solemne assemblie or anye other of the outward thing thereof, he not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as any part of Gods seruice (for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exercise profiteth nothing,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we eate we are not the worse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.</note> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee eate not we are neuer the better, in respect of any religion or holinesse) but as meanes to drawe vs the better vnto it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the day of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be more than ordinarie.</hi>
               </note> And therefore, when all these things are enioyned, to the ende, that wee may crie vnto the Lorde: wee learne, that it is not an ordinary sorrowe for sinne, a crauing of pardon, that will serue the turne at suche a time, but as the circumstaunces bee more, and the causes more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, so must our humiliation bee in more measure, than at anye other time before or after, if it may bee accepted of the Lorde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alas for the day)</hi> The crie that they are to make vnto the LORD, is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall sorte sette downe in this Uerse, wherevnto the entraunce is wyth a kinde of speache, not onelie expressing a great and heauie griefe, but also a minde excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly troubled in the same: for the words (<hi>Alas this day</hi>) which should go together, doe in effect signifie thus much: Great and
<pb facs="tcp:853:87"/>
greeuous is our miserie, and the burthen thereof lieth so heauie vppon vs, that thys day we are as vtterly cast away, and feele such a smarte of the Lordes displeasure at hande as we tremble and quake to thinke of it: So that these woordes doe expresse vnto vs, what humbled soules, and what greeued heartes wee are to bee of, when (the Lorde threatning to punish vs) wee are employed in this exercise, to the ende that wee may learne, euen (as it were) to breake our owne heartes, and to enforce them vnto a more deepe meditation of our forlorne condition than euer hath entered into vs heretofore. Againe, whereas they are willed to say, the day of the Lorde is at hand, hee dooth not meane that generall day, wherein hee wil call to account both the quicke and the dead: but in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that miserable ruine which was to fall vppon the land,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What is meant by the day of the Lorde.</hi>
               </note> wherein the people thereof shall seeme to be cutte off from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen, and in regarde of the mighty power wherewith the Lorde will stretche out his arme in such a manner, as though he meant to consecrate it, as a peculiar daie to expresse his maiestie. For as the Lorde is saide (of manne) to sleepe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psalm.</hi> 7.6.</note> when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:853:87"/>
hee sheweth not foorth his might, and (as it were) to haue lefte thinges vnto theyr owne disposition, so on the other side, it is saide to bee hys daye, when by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie power he declareth himselfe, eyther by deliueraunce of hys, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of their foes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is saide to bee at hande, thereby to teach them, that if they woulde in such maner as might be acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, humble themselues before him, then must they beware of promising vnto themselues one houre space, but rather to assure themselues of present desolation, which is diligently to bee learned of all persons, and at all times of repentaunce: For hee that will any way sooth him selfe in hope of the least tyme of forbearing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>True repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no place to put farre off the euill day.</hi>

The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from whence all thys woe must bee looked for to fall vppon them, is sayde to be the Almighty, which name is properly geuen to God, when hee sheweth hymselfe a victorer or ouercommer, whereby the Prophet geueth them an other meditation

of their miserie, that the Lord of heauen and earth, by whome, not onely all things are guyded and gouerned, but also they (in peculiar manner) had many waies bin enriched and blessed, was no more to bee looked for as a deliuerer or a protector, but as a most terrible Iudge, and seuere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroier, because that they had rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, who hadde euer beene so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and bountiful vnto them: and it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto vs this lesson, that if wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye the blessings of God, and make not the right vse of them, when the Lorde seeth that we swarne from him, &amp; doe that which seemeth good in our owne eies, hee will come against vs wyth his seueritie so much the more intolerable, as we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his blessings in greater abundance.</p>

               <hi>How did the beasts mourne?)</hi> The prophet dooth further will them to saie vnto the Lord, that the beasts did mourne, whereby hee first sheweth the miserable case of this people, that were so afflicted, as the verye sence thereof did (after a sort) mooue the brute beasts, and yet did they remaine hard harted, wherby he sheweth their condition to bee worse then that of the beast without vnderstanding. Secondly hee sheweth the miserable confusion that the sinne of man bringeth vppon all creatures, that for the
