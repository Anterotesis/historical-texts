            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:16418:39"/>Here wher Luke sayth (which is geuen) Paule saythe (which is broken). And as Luke addeth to the wordes of Paule spoken of the cuppe (which is shedd for yow) so likewise Paule addeth to the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of Luke (this doo as often as ye shall drinke it in the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>braunce of me). The rest that followeth in S. Paule both ther and in the x. chapter / pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the right vse and doctrine of the Lordes supper.</p>
            <p>Thus the Euangelistes and S. Paule haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed the wordes and worke of Christ / wherby he dyd institute and ordeine this holye Sacrament of his blessed bodye and bloud to be a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membraunce of hym selfe vntill his comminge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: of hym self (I saye) that is of his bodye ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for vs / and of his bloud shedde for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes.</p>
            <p>But this remembraunce thus ordeined as the awthor therof is Christ both god and man: so by thallmighty power of god / farre passeth all kind of remembraunces that any other man is able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke / either of hym self / or of any other thing / for who so euer receueth this holye sacrament thus ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in remembraunce of Christ he receyueth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with either deathe or lyfe / In this I doo trust we all agree. For saincte Paule saith of the godlie rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in the x. chapter of his first epistle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thians.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> The cuppe of blessing which we blesse / is it
<pb facs="tcp:16418:40"/>
not the partaking or felowshipp of Christes bloud? And also he saieth: the bread which we breake (and meaneth at the Lords table) is it not the partaking or felowshippe of Christes bodie? Nowe the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of Christes bodie and of his bloude vnto the faithfull and godlie / is the partaking or felowship of life and of immortalitie. And againe of the bad and vngodly receiuers / S. Paule plainlie saieth thus.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> He that eateth of this breade and drinketh of this cuppe vnworthily / he is gilty of the bodie and bloude of the Lorde. O howe necessarie then is it / if we loue life and would eschewe death / to trie and examine oure selues before we eate of this breade / and drinke of this cuppe. For els assuredlie / he that eateth and drinketh vnworthilie / eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his own damnation / because he estemeth not the Lords bodie / that is he receiueth not the Lords bodie with the honoure whiche is due vnto hym. And yet by that whiche was saide / that with the receipte of the holie Sacramente of the blissed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloude of Christ / is receiued of euerie one good or badde / either life or death: it is not meant that they whiche are deade before God / hereby maie receiue life / or the liuing before God / ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> herby receiue deathe. For as none is meete to receiue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall foode / wherby the naturall life is norished / excepte he be borne / and liue before: so no man can feede / by the receipte of this holie Sacramente / of the foode of eternall life / excepte he bee regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and borne of god before. And on the other side / 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16418:40"/>
no man her receiueth damnation / whiche is not deade before God.</p>
            <p>Thus hitherto withoute all doubte God is my witnes (I saie so farre as I know) there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that bee learned in the church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>de / concerning the matter of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente / but all doe agree / whether they be newe or olde (and to speake plaine / and as some of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouslye either do call other) whether they bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes / papistes / pharisies or Gospellers.</p>
            <p>And as all <abbr>do</abbr> agree hitherto in the aforesaide doctrine: so all doe deteste the wicked herisie of the Messalians whiche be otherwise called Euchites / <note place="margin">

            <p>The former wherof is / that Origene in this place spake not of the Sacramentall breade or wyne of the lordes table / but of an other misticall meate / of the whiche S. Augustin maketh mencion to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them that were taughte the faith / before they were baptised. But Origenes owne wordes in two sentences before rehersed beinge put to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / proueth this aunswere vntrue: For he saieth that he meneth of that figuratiue and misticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye / whiche profiteth them that doe receiue it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyly / alluding so plainly vnto S Paules wordes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16418:57"/>
spoken of the Lordes supper / that it is a shame for any learned manne once to open his mouth to the contrarie. And that breade whiche S Augustine speaketh of / he can not proue that any suche thinge was vsed in Origenes time: Yea and though that could be proued / yet was there neuer breade in any tyme called a sacramentall bodie sauing the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall breade of the Lordes table / which is called of Origene / the typicall / and symbolicall bodie of Christe.</p>
            <p>The seconde of the two newe founde answeres / <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vuich in the same place.</hi>
               </note> is yet moste monstrous of all other / whiche is this. But let vs graunt (saie they) that Origene spake of the Lordes supper / and by the matter thereof was vnderstanded / the materiall substaunce of breade / and wine. What then saie they? for though the ma / teriall substaunce was once gone / and departed by reason of transubstantiation / whileste the formes of breade and wyne did remaine / yet nowe it is no inconuenience to saie that as that materiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce did depart at the entryng in of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnder the aforesaide formes / soe when the saide formes be destroied / and doe not remaine / then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth againe the substance of bread and wine / and this (saie they) is verye meete in this misterie / that that which began with miracle / shal ende in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Yf I hadde not red this phantasie / I would scarselye haue beleued / that any learned man euer would haue set furth suche a folish fantasie / which
<pb facs="tcp:16418:58"/>
not onely lacketh all ground either of Gods word / reason / or of anie anciente writer / but is also cleane contrarie to the commen rules of schoole diuinitie / whiche is / that no miracle is to be affyrmed and putte withoute necessitie. And although for their former miracle / whiche is their trasubstantiation / they haue some collour / though it be but vaine / sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge it is doone by the power / and vertue / ofthese woordes of Christe / This is my bodie / yet to make this second miracle / of returning the material sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce againe / they haue no colloure at all. Or els I pray them shew me / by what wordes of Christe / is that seconde miracle wrought.</p>
            <p>Thus ye maie see that the sleigthes and shiftes whiche crafte and witte can inuente to wreste the true sense of Origene can not take place. But now lette vs heare / one other place of Origene / and soe we shall lette him goe.</p>
            <p>Origene in the 11.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16418:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his bodie / the literall sense theroflikewise doth kill<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> For it is no lesse crime / but euen the same / and all one in the literal sense / to eate Christes body / and to eate Christes fleashe. Wherfore if the one doth kyll / except it be vnderstanded figuratiuelie / and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie / then the other suerly doth kill likewise. But that to eate Christes fleashe doeth kill so vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / Origene affirmeth plainli in his words aboue rehersed. Wherfore it can not be iustlie denied / but to eate Christes body literallie vnderstanded / must nedes after him kill likewise.</p>
            <p>The aunsweare that is made to this place of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigene / of the papistes is soe folishe / that it bewrae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yeth it selfe withoute anye further confutation.

               </note> Whereas S. Augustine speaketh in effecte the same thynge that Origene doth here.

            <p>Nowe to Chrisostome whome I bring for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde writer in the Greke churche.<note place="margin">

            <p>The authoure saith one is suspected: I answere but in this place neuer fault was founde with him vnto these oure daies.</p>
            <p>And whether this authour were Ihon Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome himselfe the Archbishoppe of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / or no / that is not the matter: for of al it is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

            <p>Nay saith another / if this solution wil not serue / we maie saie that Chrysostome did not speak of the vesseles of the Lordes cuppe / <note place="margin">

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:16418:59"/>This answere will serue no more then the other. For here Chrysostome speaketh of suche vesselles / wherin was that whyche was called the bodye of Christ / although it was not the true body (saith he) of Christe / but the misterie of Christes bodie. Now of the vesselles of the olde lawe / the writers doe vse no suche maner of phrase: for their sacrifices were not called Christes bodie / for Christe then was / but in shadows and figurs / and not by the sacrament of his bodie / reuealed.</p>

            <p>Yet can I saith the thirde papist finde out a fine and a subtill solution for this place / and graunt all that yet is saide / both alowing here the writer / and also that he mente of the vesselles of the Lordes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>S. August.</hi>
               </note> is S.

            <p>This awthor as he hath written most plenteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly in other matters off our faith / so like wise in this argument he hathe written at large in manye off his workes so plainli against this error of transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation / that the papistsloue least to heare of him off all other writers / partly for his authoritye / and partly because he openeth the matter more ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly then any one other doth. Therfore I will reherse moe place off him / then heretofore I haue done of the other.</p>
            <p>And firste what can be more playne / then that whiche he writeth vppon the 89. psalme speking of the sacramente of the Lordes bodye and bloud / and rehersing (as yt were) Christes wordes to his disciples affter this maner.</p>
            <p>Yt is not this bodie which ye doo see / that ye shal eate / neither shall ve drincke this bloud / which the Soudiares that Crucefye me schall spille / or
<pb facs="tcp:16418:64"/>
shedde: I doe commende vnto you a misterie or a sacramente / whiche spiritually vnderstanded shall geue you life. Nowe if Christ hadde no moe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and corporall bodies but that one / whiche they then presentlie boeth harde / and saw: And none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall bloude / but that whiche was in the same bodie / and the whiche the souldiers cruellye did after shedde vppon the Crosse / and neither this bodie / nor this bloude / was by this declaration of S. Augustine / either to be eaten / or dronken / but the misterie therof spirituallye to be understanded: Then I conclude / (if this saiyng and exposition of S. Augustine be trwe) / that the misterie whiche the disciples shoulde eate / was not the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christe / but a misteri of the same / spirituallye to be vnderstanded. For as S. Augustine saieth in his 20. booke contra faustum. Cap. 21 Christes fleashe and bloude was in the olde testament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by similitudes / and signes of their sacrefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / and was exhibited in deede / and in trueth / v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the crosse / but the same is celebrated by a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of remembrance vpon the aulter.</p>
            <p>And in his booke de fide ad Petrum. Cap. 19 / he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in these Sacrifices (meaninge of the olde lawe) it is figuratiuelie signified / what then was to be geuen: But in this Sacrifice it is euidentlie signified what is alreadie geuen / vnderstanding in the sacrifice vpon the aulter / the remembraunce and thankes geuing for the fleashe / whiche he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16418:64"/>
for vs / and for the bloude whyche he shedde for vs vppon the Crosse / as is in the same place / and euidentlye there it maie appeare.</p>
            <p>Another euidente and cleare place / where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it appeareth that bythe Sacramentall breade / whyche Christe called hys bodye / he meante a fygure of hys bodie / is vppon the thyrde Psalme: Where Sancte Augustine speaketh thus in plaine tearmes. Christe did admit Iudas vnto the feast / in the whiche he commended to his disciples the fygure of hys bodye. Thys was Christes laste supper before hys Passion: Wherein he dydde ordayne the Sacrament of hys bodye / as all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned menne doe agree.</p>
            <p>S. Augustine also in his 23. Epistle ad Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium teacheth howe Sacramentes doe beare the names of the thinges wherof they be sacraments / boeth in Baptisme / and in the Lordes table.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. Epi.</hi> 23.</note> Euen as we call euerie good fryday / the daye of Christes passion: and euerie Easter day the daie of Christes resurrection. When in verie dede there was but one daie wherin he suffered / and one daie wherein he rose. And why doe we then call them so which are not so in dede / but because they are in like time / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d course of the yeare / as those dais were wherin those things wer done: Was Christ (saeth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin / offred any more but once? and he offred hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>self:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16418:65"/>And yet in a sacramente / or representation / not onely euery solempne feast of Easter / but also euery daie / to the people he is offered. For if sacramentes had not some similitude / or likenes of those things wherof they be sacramentes / they could in no wise be sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes. And for their similitudes / and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ly they haue the names of the thinges wherof they bee sacramentes. Therfore / as after a certaine maner of spech / the sacramente of Christes bodie / is Christes bodie / the sacramente of Christes bloud / is Christes bloud / so likewise the sacrament of faith is faith. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After this maner of speache / as S. Augustine techeth in his questions Super Leuiticum / et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra adimantum / <note place="margin">

            <p>For we muste not considre in sacramentes (saieth S. Augustine in an other place) what they be / but what they do signifie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Contra Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. lib. ca.</hi> 22.</note> For they be signes of things / being one thing in themselues / and yet signifiyng an other thing. For the heauenly breade (saieth he) speakinge of the sacramentall breade / by some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

of speach is called Christes bodye / when in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye dede it is the sacrament of the bodye / &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What can be more plaine / or more clearely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken / then are theis places of S. Augustine before rehersed / if men were not obstinately bent to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne an vntrewth / and to receiue nothing what so euer doth sett it fourth.</p>
            <p>Yet one place more of S. Augustine will I alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dge which is verie cleare to this purpose / that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes naturall bodye is in heauen and not here cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally in the sacrament / and so lett him depart.</p>
            <p>In his 50.<note place="margin">

               </note> Treatyse which he writeth vppon Ihon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he teacheth plainly / and clearlie howe Christ being both God and man / is both here after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine maner / and yet in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> / and not here in his naturall bodye and substaunce which he tooke of the blessed virgine Marie speking thus of Christ and saing. By his diuine maiestye by his prouiden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce / by his vnspeakable and inuisible grace / that is fulfilled which he spake: Behold I am with yow vnto the ende of the worlde. But as concerning his fleash / whiche he tooke in his incarnation / as towching that which was born of the virgine / as concerning that which was apprehended by the Iewes / and crucified vppon a tree / and taken dow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne from the crosse / lapped in lynen clothes / and bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed and rose agayn / and appeared after his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recton
<pb facs="tcp:16418:66"/>
/ as coocerning that fleash he sayed / Ye shall not euer haue me with yow / why so? For as concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning his fleashe he was conuersaunt with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples 40. dayes / and they accompanying / seing / and not following him / he went vpp into heauen and is not here.

For as concerning the presence of his fleashe / the church had him but a fewe dayes / no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we yt holdeth him by fayth / thowgh it seeth him not.</p>
            <p>Thus much S.

            <p>Here now wold I make an end / for methink S.

And yet (I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed) I wold alledge three / of the Latyne church / to testefye the truthe in this cause.</p>
            <p>Nowe therfore the last of all shalbe Gelasius / <note place="margin">Gelasius.</note> which was a Busshop of Rome / but one that was Busshopp of that Sea / before the wicked vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / and Tyrannye therof spredde / and brast owt abroade into all the worlde.
