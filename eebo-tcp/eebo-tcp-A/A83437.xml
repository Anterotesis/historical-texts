         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOod Reader, I fully intended, and accordingly had provided
that this firſt Part of <hi>Anti-Toleration</hi> ſhould have come into
thy hands more compleat and perfect then it does for the preſent:
I prepared an Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Honourable Houſes of
Parliament ſutable to the nature of Toleration and the Times, as
alſo a Preface and Introduction to that Argument and Subject
wherein laying down the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> &amp; <hi>Praecognita</hi> of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and famous Queſtion of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as certain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions

of Perſons holding them, of Toleration and Liberty, as ſome
<hi>Conceſſa,</hi> ſome <hi>Negata,</hi> certain miſtakes and miſrepreſentations

               </gap>en ſheets, (the
reviewing, perfecting, and printing whereof would take up at leaſt
twenty dayes) and not knowing what a Day might bring forth,
the Storm comming on ſo faſt, I thought it beſt, for fear this Book
might be ſuppreſſed at the Preſſe and never ſee the Sun, to ſend it
forth as it was, that the Church of God at home and abroad might
have the benefit of it, and to reſerve the reſt for a ſecond Part (if
God ſpare life and liberty.) In this preſent Tractate is handled
the Scripturall part of <hi>Anti-Toleration</hi> (the beſt foundation and
only ground-work to build on) wherein there are not only the
Scriptures produced for proof, but made good by ſeverall reaſons
from the text and context, with all the evaſions to clude and put
them off, fully anſwered. The ſubject matter of this Book is the
great Controverſie of the times, <hi>Toleration</hi> being that very thing
for which God hath a <hi>controverſie</hi> with the Parliament and Land,
having moſt juſtly, (however tis moſt unjuſt on their part)
raiſed up that Generation not to ſuffer them, becauſe they have

And we may ſee how God hath now fulfilled this upon the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
Miniſtry, City, Kingdome, vexing us and threatning
heavy things againſt us by the Sectaries, puniſhing us wherein we
have offended. In all ages and hiſtories of the Church we ſhall
find that Hereticks and Sectaries, however whilſt weak and few,
have pleaded for Toleration and Liberty, yet when they have
come to grow ſtrong and to have power in their hands, they never
would ſuffer the Orthodox, but have been the greateſt tyrants and
perſecutors, as the Arrians, Donatiſts, Anabaptiſts, Arminians.

                  <p>As <hi>de facto</hi> 'tis evident in the examples related (beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

from the approbations, ſpeciall teſtimonies, promiſes, rewards
and bleſſings given by God of them, made to them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed

not hide from <hi>Abraham</hi> the thing that he was doing concerning

<hi>Iacob</hi> took away the ſtrange Gods from his houſhold and all

terror of God was upon the Cities round about <hi>Iacob,</hi> and they
did not purſue after the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob;</hi> yea God gives ſuch
teſtimony to Princes and Magiſtrates ſuppreſſing falſe Prophets
and falſe worſhips, that he hath rewarded with temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
wicked Kings for ſo doing, as is evident in <hi>Iehu,</hi> who

of the Judges, Magiſtrates and Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> as
no ſufficient proof for Magiſtrates power in ſuppreſſing falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,

were typicall Kings, types of Chriſt as King of his Church, and
the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> a typicall Land, which no other Magiſtrates
or Land beſide ever were or are; I deſire that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that other Magiſtrates, Judges, and Princes who were
before the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was erected and the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
lawes given, and of other Common-wealths and Kingdoms
did take away and puniſh Idolatry, Blaſphemy, and command
men under their power to worſhip God, and ſome ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are not only barely related in the Scripture, but approved
of. <hi>Abraham, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were before the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron,</hi> before the judiciall Lawes or the Leviticall Prieſthood
for the Government and worſhip of the Jewiſh Church and

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114270:12"/>
in the tenth <hi>Theſis.</hi> And that in <hi>Iobs</hi> time, and that out of
the Land of <hi>Canam</hi> in the Land of <hi>Vz</hi> (no typicall Land) Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and falſe worſhip were to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrates,
is apparent by <hi>Iob</hi> 31 26, 27, 28. where <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks of himſelfe,
<hi>If I beheld the Sun when it ſhined, or the Moon walking in brightneſſe,
And my heart hath been ſecretly intiſed or my mouth hath kiſſed my
band: This alſo were an iniquity to be puniſhed by the Iudge: for I
ſhould have denied the God that is above,</hi> the meaning of which place
according to the judgement of the beſt Interpreters, <hi>Mercer,
Merlinus, Iunius, Pineda</hi> and others is that Idolatry and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the creatures, as Sun, Moon, and the Heavens (a worſhip
much in uſe in the Eaſt where <hi>Iob</hi> lived) was an iniquity worthy
to be taken notice of and puniſhed by the Judges: ſo <hi>Mercer</hi> reads
it, <hi>digna eſt,</hi> it deſerves and ought to be puniſhed by the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and then obſerve the reaſon, <hi>for I ſhould have denied the
Lord that is above:</hi> So that all falſe worſhip and falſe doctrine
that denies God that is above, is worthy to be puniſhed by the
Judges; and this is further proved and illuſtrated that Idolatry
is to be puniſhed by Judges corporally, by the 9, 10, 11. <hi>verſes</hi>
of this chapter, where he ſpeaks the ſame of adultery, that <hi>'tis
an iniquity to be puniſhed by the Iudges,</hi> ſo that the ſpirit
of God here in <hi>Iob</hi> makes Adultery and Idolatry of the ſame
cognizance, and as Adultery is to be puniſhed by the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
ſo Idolatry and all falſe wayes whereby men deny the
God that is above, are by this Scripture to be puniſhed alſo.
And that it may further appear the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>
did not <hi>qua</hi> Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>qua</hi> dwelling in ſuch a Land,
as Kings over ſuch a typicall people, bearing viſibly, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
typically the kingly office of Chriſt in his Church, meddle
in matters of Religion, but as Kings in places of authority and
power, I ſhall ſhow that other Kings, not of the Tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
ruling over other Kingdomes and Countries, when by
any of the great works of God done before them, or upon any
inſtinct of the Spirit of God upon them by any meſſage from
God by his Prophets and ſervants, they came to be touched in
heart and ſenſible of themſelves, they uſed their power in making
Lawes and Edicts for the worſhip of God againſt Blaſphemy and
Idolatry, and for puniſhing of thoſe who were Idolaters and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114270:12"/>
Blaſphemers. Thus <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia, Ezra</hi> 7. makes
a Decree that whoſoever will not do the Law of God, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhoule be executed ſpeedily upon him, whether it be unto

with the King, bleſſing God for the Decree of the building of

puniſhing; and to put it paſt queſtion, <hi>Ezra 10. verſe</hi> 7, 8. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
this Decree of the King was accordingly put in execution

work of Gods power in delivering the three children out of
the fiery furnace, made a Decree that whoſoever ſhould ſpeak
any thing amiſſe againſt him, ſhould be cut in pieces and their
houſes made a dunghill. <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 6. 25, 26. upon Gods
great work in delivering <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the Lions den, made a
Decree that in every Dominion of his Kingdome men tremble

the firſt ſort are ſpeciall particular Types of him, ſo that the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
things done by them do typifie and ſet forth Chriſt in many
particulars of his perſon, actions and ſufferings: yet the rancks
and orders of men as the Firſt-born, Kings, Prophets, may not
be typicall in all the particular perſons of thoſe ranks and orders,
at leaſt to the particular acts they do in thoſe ranks and orders:
but 'tis enough for many in thoſe orders to agree in common, as
in being Kings and Prophets, as Chriſt was, there being ſome in all
thoſe orders and ranks appointed of God eſpecially and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly

the further handling of that to a ſecond part upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Laſtly, ſuppoſing <hi>Aſa, Joſiah,</hi> and thoſe godly Kings to be

their ſubjects to the true worſhip of God, they did only as.
Types by vertue of that Notion, and not as they were tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Kings, which muſt be proved before their examples can be
made null; and I am ſure the Scripture no where faith that the
Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in what they commanded in matters of
Religion, they did as Types of Chriſt, and not as Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates:
'Tis one thing to be a Type, and another thing to doe
ſuch things meerly <hi>qua</hi> Types; and what if Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates

the laſt day when they ſtand before the judgement feat, they

Types of Chriſt and all they did was by vertue of their typicall
notion, ſhal tell them no, but as Magiſtrates entruſted by God with
a power and authority, how will they be then confounded? will
this diſtinction and notion found out by Libertines deliver from
the wrath to come? had not Princes need be on better grounds
then Apocryphall notions, ſuch diſtinctions of which God in his.
Word never gave any foundation? but beſides the Apocryphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this notion, that theſe Kings reformed Religion not
meerly <hi>quae</hi> Types, but as Kings and Princes over ſubjects, may be
proved thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe Magiſtrates before them, and Magiſtrates of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Thirdly, for that which they ſay the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Iews and

duties which he ought to do, and all others alſo in ſuch relations:
ſo that though ſome perſons be Types, and the things they do ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall,
yet they may be Morall too, and ſo binding, which though
as they were typicall they may be taken away, yet as they were
Morall may be in full force; As for example, Chriſt was figured
in <hi>Joſeph, Ioſeph</hi> was an eminent Type of Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> Treatiſe of Types, <hi>c. 6. p.</hi> 33 34, 35, 36.</note> in the firſt

and among other things he was a Type in feeding his Father and
his Brethren, that when advanced in the kingdome he provided

Now though <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in this action was a Type of Chriſt, and
did it typically, yet not only typically, but did this morally and
naturally too by vertue of the fifth Commandement, and ſixth
Commandement, of childrens duty to their Parents, and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

thoſe who plead this Argument of typicalneſſe, whether this
were a good Anſwer? and if not, neither is theirs againſt the
practiſe of the kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> from being Types of Chriſt; and
I wiſh the Pleaders for <hi>Toleration</hi> would ſerious conſider of, and
reſolve this Queſtion, though <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a ſpeciall Type of
Chriſt, and in this action of preſerving his Father and Brethren
a Type of Chriſts preſerving his Church, yet whether this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his to his Father, Brethren and their children, do not
bind now in the dayes of the Goſpel children to their Fathers
&amp;c. or whether the typicalneſſe of it hath cauſed it to ceaſe? and
in the reſolution of this caſe, the ingenuous Reader may ſee what
to judge of the typicalneſſe of the kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and that typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſſe

1 <hi>Cor. 10. viz.</hi> examples to Chriſtian Magiſtrates to teach them to
do ſo likewiſe, as Fathers then were to teach Fathers now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
their children, and therefore though ſuch an order of men
as Kings in <hi>Iſrael</hi> might be intended to typifie Chriſts Kingdom,
yet that no way hinders, but what they did as Kings in ruling
and ordering of their ſubjects, they performed as the proper
works of their places common to them with other Princes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reference to their being Types, or doing them as Types,
God in Scripture recording all along what they did, as going
upon common morall grounds, and ſpeaking nothing of them in
their Reformations as in a figurative typicall notion. And in
the cloſe of my Anſwer to this evaſion of the inſtances of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114270:19"/>
Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> I ſhall hint to the Reader to conſider ſome
notes of diſtinction between actions meerly typicall and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Antitype, done only to repreſent and ſhadow forth
what Chriſt was to do,<note place="margin">☜</note> and mixt actions, morall and typicall too,
or at leaſt the actions of one who by perſon or order is a Type;
and upon ſearch it will be found that all the notes of actions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
not meerly typicall, will be found in the practiſes of thoſe
Ks of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> before named, As firſt, when their practiſes
and wayes are not barely related, but commended and praiſed by
God, wheras actions meerly typical are only related and ſet down,
as in <hi>Samſon,</hi> and divers others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, when done upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
grounds and reaſons, motives drawn from mercies, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
evils, and judgements, commands and meſſages from God
experiences of God, upon Gods convincing and converting men.
Thirdly, when they of ſuch an Order and office are reproved and
puniſhed for not doing ſuch things, or for not thoroughly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, whereas I ſuppoſe perſons typicall, and whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are intended to be meerly typicall, will and ſhall do ſuch
things though they may not know the meaning of them, of
which many inſtances might be given in ſome actions of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Jonas</hi> and others. Fourthly, when as their actions are ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thoſe qualifications, titles and deſcriptions given in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of Magiſtrates and that office in generall. Fifthly, when
what they do is agreeable and ſutable to the commands and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
given by God to all of that order and rank, and they do
in the matter of Religion in commanding to good and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
evil, what all other Magiſtrates have done in all times and
ages, who have cared for any Religion at all, as Heathen Princes
before they knew the true God, and others after they have known
him, however through ignorance or ſuperſtition they might miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
about the true way and worſhip: Now let the Reader but

only, as tis 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 33. 17. were put down and the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Prieſts ſuppreſſed, and thoſe good Kings who did not,
are upon record blamed (which kind of worſhipping was not
ſo bad as the Herodians and Sadduces, who held <hi>Herod</hi> for the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> and denied Angels and Spirits) and that I may come up
yet more cloſe to <hi>M. S.</hi> objection, who ſaith nothing was done
againſt Sectaries or Sciſmaticks, I conceive they were to the
Church of the Jewes, as Sectaries and Sciſmaticks are now, and
their worſhip a Sciſme, worſhipping the true God in a ſeparated

all things were out of order, the Church of the Jewes did
then haſten to their deſtruction, and ſo no wonder if Hereſies and

true) yet by vertue of thoſe very commands and examples
Magiſtrates might exerciſe a coercive power againſt evills
of the like kind, though not in the letter ſpecified; and
the reaſon is this, becauſe the commands of God and the

with Apoſtafie to ſerve ſtrange Gods, the Gods of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whom God had caſt out of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Iſraelites were moſt in danger of, the Idolatries moſt
in uſe in thoſe times, and by the Nations round about them when
they ſhould come to <hi>Canaan</hi> (as is evident by many places of
<hi>Deutr.</hi>) and the falſe Prophets and Seducers then went moſt about
to ſeduce men in that way, therefore God in the letter (as it was
moſt needfull) ſpoke by name againſt ſuch Prophets and ſuch I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
as were moſt ſtirring in thoſe times, under which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are forbidden by a Synecdoche and by Analogie other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations
of Gods worſhip and name that might ariſe in after
ages, for by the rules of Interpretation of Scripture given by
Divines, where a thing is forbid, there all of that nature and
ſort are forbidden alſo; as for example, greater ſinnes of that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114270:22"/>
kinde, then thoſe expreſſed in the letter muſt needs be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and ſo leſſer alſo. Now certainly where God hath given a
command to Magiſtrates in the letter to puniſh ſuch offences,
if his ſubjects commit greater and higher againſt God and his
worſhip by the equity of this command he is to puniſh them (if
none in the letter for thoſe) as if there had been no command
but againſt Idolatry of ſuch Nations, yet worſhipping the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
offering up children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> blaſpheming God and his
worſhip, with other ſuch, ought to be reſtrained, and if they
commit Idolatry or other corruptions, not ſo great or ſo groſſe,
yet by way of proportion and equity ſuch ought to be, though
in a lower kind and way. And 'tis evident by many inſtances
that the Iewiſh Magiſtrates Kings and others, as <hi>Ioſiah Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,
&amp;c.</hi> did puniſh in a proportion (though not with death)
thoſe who violated the worſhip of God, and the firſt Table,
though they were not guilty of Idolatry and Apoſtafie to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
other gods, nor of worſhipping the true God by Idols, as by
the golden Calves of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> And if that be good Divinity

that the equity and ſpirit of a Law may upon better grounds

(though granting according to the letter of thoſe Lawes
no man ſhould be put to death for any thing leſſe then that kind
of Idolatry with Apoſtaſie, worſhipping falſe gods) that
thoſe who worſhip the true God by graven Images by making
likeneſſes of him, and that corrupt the doctrine of Faith and
Religion, ſhould alſo by the Magiſtrates bee puniſhed as well
by ſuppreſſing their Conventicles, putting them out of places
of power, &amp;c. though not ſo much as the others. Or is there
any equity and proportion in this, that God ſhould command
puniſhing with death (the higheſt kinde the Magiſtrate can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict)
for Idolatrie in worſhipping ſtrange gods, and ſhould
forbid any puniſhment or reſtraint at all of Idolatry, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of his worſhip in the next degree to that? According
to degrees of faults to have degrees of puniſhments is of the
light of nature and right reaſon; but to have a higher degree
of an offence to bee puniſhed with death, and all others not to
bee puniſhed at all, is againſt the light of nature and all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
Lets but look into the Scriptures for the violation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commands of God, as in the 6, 7 and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and wee ſhall finde that where the higher degrees and
violations had greater puniſhments, the others went not ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free.
For example, when adultery was puniſhed with death,
fornication was puniſhed with fifty ſhekels of ſilver, and wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Seventhly, there is a great agreement between the falſe

alwayes with him. Now the Law there ſpoken of is meant the
whole Law of God, the firſt Table as well as the ſecond, that
which concerned God as well as man, becauſe it was a Copie of
that Originall which was kept in the Tabernacle for the Prieſts
and Levites, whoſe office was principally about matters of the
firſt Table; and then the end expreſſed in the 19. <hi>verſe,</hi> that the
King might learne to feare the Lord his God, to keep all the
words of this Law, ſhowes as much that by the name of the Law

theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this King, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. was to be one from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
a Brother, not a ſtranger, who was to know the Law of
God, and to keep it perſonally as well before he was a King, as
after, the Law of God being committed to private perſons equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as to Kings for their particular perſonall obſervation, and
therefore ſure in this ſolemne injunction there's ſomething new
and more required of Kings then was of them before, or is of
perſons meerly private.</p>

throne, ſo ſaith the text, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. The Law was committed to
the King as a King at his Coronation, which ſhowes it had not
reference to the Kings private converſation as a meer man, but
to his Princely function as a Magiſtrate, which ſtood in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
others, not in guiding himſelfe. For no man is a King in
reſpect of himſelfe, but in ruling his Subjects. So<note n="*" place="margin">Auguſt. Epiſt. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
ſaith of Kings, <hi>As a man hee ſerveth God one way, as a King ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; As a man by faithfull living, as a King in ſetting forth
Lawes to command that which is good, and remove the contrary. So
that Kings as Kings ſerve God in doing that for his ſervice which
none but Kings can doe.</hi> This is alſo proved from 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.
12. compared with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 11. where to King <hi>Jehoaſh</hi>
in his ſolemne inauguration as ſoon as the Crown is put upon
him, the Book of the Teſtimony was given him from the high
Prieſt, that hee might know the care and publick cuſtody of the
Law was committed to him in his being made a King; and in
that the command of God with the practiſe accordingly, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with putting the Crown on the head was to give the Law
in the Kings hand, it ſhowes it was to command it to others,
and make others keep it. And that this was the meaning of it
in <hi>Jehoaſh,</hi> and ſo in other Princes, it may further appeare in that
the people at that time being much corrupted in Religion, and
<hi>Jehoaida</hi> the high prieſt deſiring much their Reformation, and
the Reſtauration of Religion, as a meanes to effect it made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

his dayes in his Kingdome, hee and his children in the midſt of</hi>
Iſrael, <hi>of his not turning aſide from the commandement to the right or to
the left,</hi> of his learning <hi>to fear the Lord God, and keeping all the words
of the Law,</hi> ſhow, 'tis underſtood of a publike officiall keeping
the Law; for the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> could not prolong
their dayes in their Kingdomes, nor their children enjoy good
dayes after them if they ſuffered Idolatry, Apoſtaſie, &amp;c. in their
land, though themſelves practiſed it not, as may bee ſeen in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
and the ſtories of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> neither
could they keep all the commands of God, there being many
commands given to the Iewiſh Magiſtrates (as is confeſſed, but
pleaded to bee Iudiciall and peculiar to them) to ſee their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſerve God only, and to puniſh Idolaters and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the practiſe of the good Kings among the Iewes not
only keeping the Law themſelves, but cauſing others alſo, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,
Hezekiah, Aſae, &amp;c.</hi> and that from this Text, and ſuch like,
ſhowes it was meant of a publick keeping the Law; the diligent
execution of their office ſerves for an evident expoſition what
God required at their hands.</p>
                  <p>And as I have proved that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. ſpeaks of a keeping the
Law <hi>ex officio</hi> as a publick <hi>cuſtos,</hi> ſo for the taking of another

I deſire the Reader to obſerve that God having given power and
authority to the Magiſtrate to ſee the firſt Table kept, the duties
commanded to bee performed by all under his juriſdiction, and

it muſt bee underſtood in the uſe of ſuch meanes and wayes God

delivering the fourth Commandement, and the other three before
it, a three-fold difference. 1. All the other are plainly negative,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> but this of the Sabbath is expreſſely affirmative
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114270:25"/>

adds a word <hi>Remember,</hi> by all which God would reach that 'tis

<hi rend="margQuotes">'Tis manifeſt, in this Commandement 'tis required of Parents,
Maſters of families, and Magiſtrates, not only that themſelves
ſanctifie the Sabbath, but that it is their place and duty that
they care it be ſanctified of others, and prohibite and puniſh its
prophanation. And God doth ſhew that the Magiſtrates ought
to care, that ſtrangers inhabiting within their gates ſhould
conform to the true Religion, leſt otherwiſe ſcandals ſhould
ariſe.</hi> And that by [<hi>thou</hi>] the Magiſtrate is underſtood, and ſo
by this command, the care of the publike worſhip and Sabbath
to ſee it ſanctified, is given to the Magiſtrate, is further proved
from thoſe words, <hi>nor the ſtranger that is within thy gates.</hi> By
gates, in that place, are underſtood not only a particular family
or city, but the whole country of any people, as <hi>Gen. 22. v. 27. He
ſhall poſſeſſe the gates of his enemies,</hi> and <hi>Gen. 24. 60. Deut.</hi> 24. 24.
So learned <hi>Rivet</hi> upon the 4. Commandement, by ſtrangers
within thy gates are meant, Firſt ſtrangers who commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
and lived in the common wealth of Iſrael, Secondly
ſtrangers who came from other countries for a time, not to
remain, but either to ſee the country, or to traffick, &amp;c. both
which are to keep the Sabbath, the latter ſort ſo far, as not to
violate it with any externall ſervile work, as is evident by
<hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. v. 19, 20, 21. Now the meaning of <hi>gates</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtrangers</hi> fully

the Father of a family had nothing to do out of his houſe, or with

                     <hi>Rivet</hi> and <hi>Zanchius</hi> do ſhew how 'tis the part of
a Magiſtrate to provide that ſtrangers may not give ſcandals in a
common-wealth, but that at leaſt they be made to keep outward
diſcipline with others. The ſtrangers among the Jews were
compelled not only to ſtand to their Political laws, but to ſome
of the outward precepts of Religion, and that partly leſt the
good manners of the Jewes ſhould be corrupted and diſturbed
with the Gentiles evil manners, and that the ſtrangers among
them might be in ſome ſort inſtructed in the knowledge of the
Divine law.</p>

And whoſoever would be fully ſatisfied in this point that the
publike exerciſe of piety and Religion is commanded in the

as they are Magiſtrates, ſo that 'tis their part to care by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

all theſe commands, as their ſubject matter conſiſts of things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in the ten Commandements, as Blaſphemie, Apoſtaſie,
Witchcraft, Prophanation of the Sabbath, &amp;c. So that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
for puniſhing ſuch (for the ſubſtance of them) are moral too
of common reaſon and equity given to all Nations, and for all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as to the Jewes and their times, I ſhall prove by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reaſons; and for the moſt materiall things brought of
old or of late by the grand Patrons of Toleration <hi>Minus Celſus
Senenſis, Acontius, Bloudy Tenet, M. S. Hagiomaſtix</hi> to make
void theſe places of Scripture, (as that theſe commands either
are abrogated by Chriſt, the things commanded in thoſe lawes
belonging to the Jewes only, but not the Gentiles nor Chriſtians,
or if they be any way morall, yet they extend not to Hereticks
and falſe-teachers, but concern only Apoſtates, Blaſphemers, ſuch
falſe Prophets who endeavoured to perſwade men to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of a falſe God; and that by affirming that they ſpake by the
inſpiration of ſome deity) to them alſo I ſhall returne aſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, let the Reader lay together theſe particulars.
1. that tis evident ſome of theſe commands, as againſt offering
their children to <hi>Molech,</hi> as againſt dealing and contracting with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114270:29"/>
a familiar Spirit deſerve puniſhing among Chriſtians and under
the Goſpell now, as well as under the Law, and if theſe, why not
the other of Blaſphemy, Idolatry, falſe-prophecie, &amp;c? theſe latter
are of moral things as well as the other; the firſt and theſe are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
both by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſamebooks, time, propounded after the
ſame tenor and way, upon the ſame grounds and reaſons. No diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all, unleſſe that theſe latter concerning Apoſtaſie, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
falſe prophecie, be more ſtrictly commanded and further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
which the Reader by comparing the texts ſhall obſerve.
But if it be ſaid thoſe commands againſt offering their ſeed to
<hi>Molech</hi> and of witches, are therefore puniſhed by the Magiſtrate,
becauſe they offend againſt lives and eſtates of mankind, in killing
the children, in cattell being killed, and mens bodies being
hurt by Witches and Wiſards, which is not in the other of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie,
Blaſphemy, &amp;c. I reply, tis to be obſerved that in
all thoſe places where the commands are given by God to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
about theſe, there's not one jota or tittle expreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
offending againſt the ſecond Table in life or goods, but all
the reaſon formally declared, is, becauſe againſt God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the commands of the firſt Table: For giving the ſeed to
<hi>Molech, Levit.</hi> 18. 21. this is the reaſon alledged by God againſt
it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not let any of thy ſeed paſſe through the fire to</hi> Molech,
<hi>neither ſhalt thou prophane the name of thy God: I am the Lord,
Levit.</hi> 20. 3. the reaſon given againſt it, is the defiling of <hi>Gods
Sanctuary,</hi> and prophaning his <hi>holy name,</hi> both which ſpake in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the worſhip of God only and matters of Religion, as
<hi>Ainſworth</hi> in his Notes upon both theſe Texts, fully and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
ſhows, as alſo the late Annotations of our Engliſh Divines.
It is further proved by thoſe two Texts <hi>Jerem. 7. 31. Jerem.</hi> 19.
5, 6. where God ſpeaking againſt the Jewes offering up their
children to <hi>Molech,</hi> layes open their ſinnes in theſe expreſſions,
<hi>which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart, which
I commanded not, nor ſpake it, neither came it into my minde,</hi> in
which words God anſwers to what was in their hart, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
did it as a worſhip to God, a thing commanded by him, and ſo
out of conſcience, but God tels them, and that in theſe reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
expreſſions it was never commanded by him among all the
duties of his worſhip he never ſpake a word of any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114270:30"/>
and among all the places in <hi>Moſes</hi> Books, Prophets, the
Books of Kings, Chronicles, where 'tis ſpoken of, we ſhall
never find this condemned as murther, but ſtill ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
as Idolatry, a corruption of Gods worſhip, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
among ſuch tranſgreſſions: beſides according to Gods
owne rule and way of acquitting ſome men of murther, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Cities of refuge, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. in ſome caſes for men that
had ſlaine their brethren, upon that ground, becauſe they <hi>hated
them not in time paſt,</hi> twice expreſſed <hi>verſe</hi> 4. 6. the givers of
their children to <hi>Molech</hi> will be found to be adjudged to death
for their Idolatry rather then the killing their children: for it
cannot be ſuppoſed that the worſhippers of <hi>Molech</hi> hated their
children in time paſt, or at preſent, and out of that hatred offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them up in ſacrifice, but out of their blinde zeale and ſtrong
deluſion, thinking therein they ſhould doe a high and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſervice; <hi>Rabbi Bechai</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the Parents were perſwaded
that by this ſacrifice the reſt of their children ſhould be delivered from
death, and that they themſelves ſhould proſper for it all the dayes of
their life.</hi> For ther's no queſtion but theſe Idolaters loved their
children and had affections to them as might be proved by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reaſons, among others by the great noiſe made by beating
upon Drums in the time of ſacrificing to drowne the cries of the
children, left their cries working on their Fathers naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ſhould make the Fathers ſpare them; whereupon the place
of ſacrificing was called <hi>Tophet</hi> of <hi>Toph,</hi> which is a Taber or
Drum. For the commands given to Magiſtrates againſt Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
they are ſet down either without any reaſons at all of them,
or elſe in thoſe places where any reaſons are aſſigned they relate
wholly to God as a breach of the firſt Table, nothing at all as
to men, as theſe Scriptures ſhow, <hi>Levit. 20. 6, 7. 26, 27. Deut.</hi>
18. 10, 11, 12, 13. and our Engliſh Divines in their late Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that upon paine of death. Some have thought Witches ſhould not die
unleſſe they had taken away the life of mankind; but they are miſtaken,</hi>
(the proof of which the Reader may finde ſet downe there) <hi>But
why then muſt the Witch be put to death?</hi> Anſwer, <hi>Becauſe of the
league and confederacie with the Devill, which is high treaſon againſt
God, becauſe he is Gods chiefeſt enemie, and therefore though no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

enſue this contract at all, the Witch deſerver preſent and certaine
death for the contract it ſelfe.</hi> Secondly, theſe commands to the
Magiſtrate concerning Idolaters, Blaſphemers, &amp;c. were not
for the puniſhing of Iſraelites, the Jewiſh people only, but of all
ſtrangers in their Land, both of Proſelytes that dwelt among them,
and of others that only travelled thorough, or were there a while
upon trading or ſuch like occaſions, as theſe Scriptures ſhow
<hi>Levit. 20. verſe 2. Whoſoever he be of the children of Iſrael, or of the
ſtranger that ſojourne in Iſrael, that giveth any of his ſeed to</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,
<hi>he ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> Levit. 24. verſe 16. <hi>Hee that
blaſphemeth the name of the Lord ſhall ſurely be put to death, as well
the ſtranger, as he that is borne in the Land.</hi> Upon which places of
Scripture and others, as the fourth Commandement, &amp;c. beſides
many reaſons that might be given why ſtranger is to be taken in

they may binde the Chriſtian Magiſtrate under the Goſpel. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Ceremoniall law being given for certain uſes, and for a
certain time, till the comming of Chriſt, upon the ariſing of
this Sun, all theſe ſhadowes vaniſhed away, as being but of one
time. But now the Judicial lawes, however delivered to one
Nation, yet were not of one time, never tied to one time only:
ſo that had the commonwealth of the Jewes continued untill this
day, excepting a few things belonging to the vindication of the
ceremonies (which would have ceaſed with the ceremonies) they
would have uſed their Political lawes ſtill, in regard the Goſpel
neither changed nor took away any of them, as <hi>Beza</hi> obſerves in
his Tractate <hi>de Haereticis à Magiſtratu puniendis,</hi> p. 154. And for
the better underſtanding and proving that the Judicial lawes
under the Old Teſtament are ſtill in force, I ſhall lay down two
or three diſtinctions. 1. The judicial law may be conſidered,
ſo far as concerns the diſtinction of the Iewes from the Gentiles,
and the typical ſignification of the kingdome of Chriſt; or only
ſo much as belongs to the forme of Civil government. Now the
judicial law, according to the firſt acception, is abſolutely and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114270:33"/>
ſimply abrogated; but, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in part and ſome kinde
only, in the latter: that is, Whatever was in the judicial law
of particular proper right peculiarly concerning the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as
of inheritances not to be transferred from one Tribe to another;
of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> having no inheritance among the other
Tribes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 20, 24. of the emancipation of an Hebrew ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
or handmaid in the ſeventh yeer; a mans marrying his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife, and raiſing up ſeed to his brother; the forgiving of
debts at the Jubile; marrying with one of the ſame tribe, with
other ſuch like, all of this kind is ceaſed: But what was of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
right, common to other Nations with them, according to
the common law of nature; of which ſort are lawes concerning
the puniſhment of Moral tranſgreſſions, and other ſuch; that
all remains, and is in force. Of which diſtinction the Reader may
find more in <hi>Piſcator's</hi> Appendix to his Obſervations upon the

may be conſidered according to their ſubſtance and equity, or
according to many acceſſories, circumſtances, forms, &amp; manner of
them. Now though the Magiſtrate under the Goſpel is not bound
unto theſe lawes ſimply, that is, to every circumſtance and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of them for form, manner, time and place; as for example,
not to the ſame kinds and formality of puniſhments ſet down in
thoſe lawes; for thoſe forms are acceſſions of the law; and therfore
out of the nature of perſons, times, places, and conſtitution of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
mutable: Yet he is bound to the ſubſtance &amp; equity
of them, ſo as not to derogate from the right of thoſe lawes. Of
this diſtinction the Reader may find much ſaid by <hi>Cartwright,</hi> in
his 2. Reply to Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> p. 98, 99. <hi>Beza de Haereticis â Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratu

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114270:33"/>
Preface before the five Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thirdly, theſe Lawes may
be lookt upon as containing doctrine from God of puniſhment,
<hi>i. e.</hi> that thoſe who ſeduce, blaſpheme God, &amp;c. be reſtrained, yea
and by death in ſeverall caſes, or elſe as in their latter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of puniſhment, the ſeverity and utmoſt rigor the Magiſtrate
is not now tied, yet to the thing in caſes of Idolatry, ſeduction,
falſe propheſying, ſpeaking lies in the name of the Lord he
is bound, and in ſome caſes of groſſe and high Idolatry and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy

the Reader to obſerve theſe few Reaſons. 1. The Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Law differs from the Decalogue, the Law of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
in this, that whereas the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Beza</hi> de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticis à Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratu puniendis paſia 54.</note> Decalogue comprehends
in a few words all righteouſneſſe and equity, in all kind of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to God and man, the Iudiciall explains only that part of
righteouſneſſe and equity which ſtands in thoſe things of which
judgements are appointed; and therefore ſeeing the judicialls
preſcribe the equity of judgements which is a part of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
we muſt be bound to that as we are to the reſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,
<hi>viz.</hi> ſo farre as they containe a generall equity though
we are not tied to the formes of the Moſaicall politie; Now
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. he came not to deſtroy the Law, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114270:34"/>
to fulfill it; which words are comprehenſive of the Judiciall Law
as for the ſubſtance a part of the Moral Law, (the Iudicial being
indeed an Appendix and a more particular explication of that
part of the Morall Law concerning matters of Iuſtice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and therefore muſt be underſtood by Chriſt to be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
2. Though there be many pregnant proofs in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
for aboliſhing the Ceremoniall Law, yet we nowhere
read in the New Teſtament of making void the Iudiciall Law
concerning the puniſhing of ſinnes againſt the Morall Law, in
the number of which are Idolatry, Hereſie, Blaſphemy. Now
theſe<note n="*" place="margin">See Cartwr-ſecond Reply to Dr. <hi>Whitgift pag.</hi> 98. 99.</note> Iudiciall Lawes being the Lawes of God and by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will once ſettled, they muſt needs ſo farre forth remaine
as they appeare not by his will to be repealed. They who hold
the Magiſtrate under the Goſpel is not bound to puniſh for ſuch
ſinnes, muſt prove from the Scripture thoſe Lawes of God revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and cancel'd, which none of the Patrons of Toleration have
ever yet done. 3. The ſubſtance and equity of the Iudiciall
Law remains in that Chriſt and his Apoſtles make uſe of, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and prove by ſome Iudicial laws divers things under the New
Teſtament. Chriſt makes uſe of a Iudiciall Law concerning pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<hi>Matth. 5. 38, 39. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth, viz.</hi> that of <hi>poena talionis, Exod.</hi> 21. 24. and frees it from
the falſe gloſſe and interpretation of the Phariſees, in which he
teaches the Iudiciall Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> underſtood in their right
ſenſe are to be obſerved in the New Teſtament: For if Chriſt in
that Sermon, of which this is a part would teach the Decalogue
belonged to Chriſtians, by his vindicating it from the falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of the Scribes and Phariſees; then it followes hee
meant to teach the Iudiciall Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of Morall tranſgreſſions belonged to them alſo, becauſe
he vindicated alſo one of them, of which particular with the
proof of the conſequence the Reader may finde more in <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators</hi>
Appendix to <hi>Exodus.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul 1 Cor. 9. 9. 1 Tim.</hi>
5. 18. among other proofs brought by him from fimilitudes
fetched from the common uſe of men, that the Miniſter of the
Goſpel ought to be maintained of the Churches charge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they might object thoſe were but humane reaſons, he alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as the eternall Law of God one of the Iudiciall Lawes of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114270:34"/>
                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was, <hi>that a man ſhould not muzle the mouth of the
Oxe which treadeth out the corne:</hi> where 'tis manifeſt he
doubteth not to bind the conſcience of the Churches unto
the equity of that Law which was judiciall, likewiſe from
the 13. verſe, of thoſe that miniſter about holy things, and
wait at the Altar, living of the things of the Temple, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partakers of the Altar hee concludes that they which
preach the Goſpell ſhould live of it: Now this maintainance
of the Prieſts albeit in the manner of proviſion it be held by
many ceremoniall, yet as it was a reward of their ſervice
due by men (as the puniſhments alſo if they failed in their
duties) was meerly judiciall. So the equity of that judiciall
Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2.<note n="*" place="margin">

thename of the Lord to bee puniſhed by the Magiſtrate,

I would know of the Patrons of <hi>Toleration</hi> whether under the

The rule of juſt and unjuſt in God and in his Law is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the ſame and immutable: It is as equally juſt to puniſh
evill things as to forbid evill things, and therefore the right and
Law of puniſhments is alſo immutable: Where and of what

Magiſtrates ſhould have ſome power in matters of Religion. The

Secondly, the Magiſtrates ſword in matters of Religion in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Blaſphemies, Idolatries, Hereſies, hath been found by
good experience in all ages to make greatly for the defence and
preſervation of the firſt Table, to ſtirre men up to obedience
and deterre them from the contempt and violation thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the contrary, for the want of this, all Blaſphemies, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and Errors have abounded, of which I could give many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
but ſhall referre them to the more proper place of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the Reaſons for Magiſtrates puniſhing men for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
Blaſphemies, Hereſies, Schiſmes; only for the preſent

the Lord gives this bleſſing unto the puniſhment
of ſuch offendors, that others not only which ſee, but heare of
them, have the bridle of feare put upon them whereby kept
from the like. Thirdly and laſtly, this coercive power of the
Magiſtrate will be found every whit as uſefull and neceſſary
now for the glory of God, ſalvation of mens ſoules, peace
of Church and State as it was then, yea and in ſome reſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more neceſſary, there being in our dayes not only the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

alſo: Were there under the Law many incorrigible preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
offendors againſt God and his worſhip, that could not be
otherwiſe reclaimed, and are there not ſuch now? were there
then many groſſe ways of falſe worſhip and Religion deſtroying

drawing away and ſeducing many ſoules? were they
then provoking the wrath of God cauſing it to waxe hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his people? Ought the glory and Name of God to bee
then dear to Magiſtrates? Why, behold under the Goſpel there
are as incorrigible deſperate perſons broaching all kind of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Hereſies, making it their work to lay waſt all Religion,
whom no Admonitions, Church Cenſures can do any good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

truth now, as there was then,</hi> and ſhowes though we cannot argue
the being of ſpirituall Ordinances from our need of them, but
from their inſtitution, yet in naturall and civill things this way of
arguing is ſtrong enough; <hi>there is need of ſuch a help, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould ſeeke to have it.</hi> And the neceſſity of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
coercive power under the Goſpel he ſets down as follows.
<hi>Now ſure the need we have of ſuch a power is exceeding great, we
were in a moſt miſerable condition if we had no externall civill
power to reſtraine from any kind of Blaſphemies and Seducements.
The condition of the Jewes, O how happy was it in compariſon of
ours, if this were denied us! for if any of theirs did blaſpheme
God, or ſeeke to ſeduce any from him, they knew what to doe with
him beſides perſwading of him to the contrary; but if any ſhould
ſeeke to ſeduce the wives of our boſomes, children of our bodies,
friends as deare to us as our owne lives into thoſe wayes that wee
thinke in our conſciences will und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e their ſoules to all eternity, yet
we muſt only deſire them they would not doe ſo, we muſt only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
or ſeeke to convince them or remove them, but reſtraine
them we cannet: If the deliverance of us from the Pedagogy of
the Law hath brought us into this condition,<note place="margin">☞</note> our burden is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in this thing then any that the Law laid upon our forefathers;
Hath Chriſt delivered us from one burden to lay a greater upon us?
Muſt we now ſee thoſe who are deareſt to us drawne into the way
of eternall deſtruction, and ſtand and looks on, but no way
left to help them or our ſelves, unleſſe we can perſwade to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
Surely our condition is very ſad: Have we not cauſe to
ſay, Lord let any burden of the Ceremoniall Law be laid upon our
necks, rather then this; If there were a company of mad men
running up and downe the ſtreets with knives and ſwords in their
hands, endeavouring to miſcheif and kill all they meet with, and
we muſt doe nothing to reſtraine them; if we could perſwade them
to doe otherwiſe well and good: but that is all we can doe for helpe;
what a dangerous thing were this? The caſe is the ſame, when thoſe
who are mad with damnable Hereſies, run from place, to place, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to draw all they can from the truth: If we have no meanes of
helpe but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, it is ill with us; Surely God hath not put his

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114270:39"/>
for his people then thus.</hi> And I appeale to the conſciences and
experience of men, whether this power of the Magiſtrate of
puniſhing Blaſphemies and Hereſies be not found to be
uſefull and neceſſary both for the honour of God, the ſafety of
other mens ſoules, the peace of Church and State? and whether
all other mens without this (when this might have beene had)
have made good theſe ends? or whether this coming upon other
means, as Admonitions, Inſtructions, Synods, Church Cenſures,
hath not ſuppreſſed Hereſies,<note place="margin">☜</note> Schiſms, vindicated the honor and
truth of God, recovered many ſouls, ſetled the peace of Churches
and States, as among the Donatiſts of old, and the Arminians
in <hi>Holland</hi> of late. Any mans reaſon, yea ſenſe may tell him,
that in this ſinfull corrupted condition of man there is in coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power a naturalneſſe and ſutableneſſe to work upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man for the furtherance of ſpirituall good, and that when
no other means can, this power removes outward things that
hindered, keeps from outward evils, applies outward means. And
yet further, beſides the ſame reaſons and grounds now of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of the Magiſtrates coercive power, as well as under the
Old Teſtament, there ſeemes to be new reaſons under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

As that under the Goſpel ſo many outward viſible judgement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the World, of all ages and times, as Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,
&amp;c.</hi> give us many inſtances in this kind among all ſorts of
Religions and people. Whence 'tis that ſo many learned men,
<hi>Zanchius, Muſculus, Peter Martyr, Beza,</hi> with divers others finding
lawes and puniſhments of this nature ſo common and generall
among Commonwealths and Kingdomes, and that in ſo many
examples recorded in the old and new Teſtament and in other
Authors, make puniſhments by Magiſtrates for violation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to bee of the light of nature as they doe the knowledge
of a God, and that hee is to bee feared and worſhipped. <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger</hi>

which Chriſtians are now freed, ſaith that this coercive power
was not by <hi>Moſes</hi> then inſtituted as being never before, and as
a ceremoniall law which ſhould ceaſe in the time of Chriſt,
but from the beginning this law as natural and neceſſary was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God. For all the old Magiſtrates before <hi>Moſes,</hi> from
this command of God uſed this ſword. And this law therefore
God inſerted in the <hi>Iſraelitical</hi> laws, which is not now taken away
by Chriſts coming as a moſaicall coaction, becauſe Chriſt abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated

by a generall reaſon; and the immutable nature of the law-giver
hath its place and vertue in appointing mutable commands.
Yet where the reaſons of a law <hi>ex natura rei</hi> &amp; not meerly <hi>ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituto</hi>
are perpetual and univerſal, and the duties following from
thoſe reaſons founded thereon, the ſpecial inward and proper
reaſon of ſuch a command being morall and perpetual; there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
it followes that law is morall and perpetual, of which the
Reader may bee further ſatisfied in <hi>Ames Caſes Conſc. lib. 5.

                  <p>Now the ſpeciall inward and proper reaſon of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>Deut. 13. ſo ſhalt thou put the evill away from the midſt of
thee,</hi> is <hi>juris moralis &amp; naturalis,</hi> and therefore ſo is the command
itſelfe. For a concluſion of this that theſe lawes of puniſhing
Idolaters, falſe Prophets, &amp;c. were not properly judiciall
lawes, nor abrogated by Chriſts comming, lets take notice that
that diſtinction of the judiciall law from the morall, <hi>viz.</hi> the
morall law was given of God publikly declared by his voice
twice writ in tables of ſtone, but the judiciall was afterwards
delivered to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people without any ſuch
ſolemnity, is no exact nor perfect one. For many of the laws not
expreſſed in the Decalogue, but delivered afterwards among the
judiciall, as about reſtoring the pledge, of weights and juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
of giving the hire to the laborour, and many other ſuch
like, are no more judiciall or leſſe morall <hi>then thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi>
Yea ſuch commands are transferred to the times of the Goſpell,
as that of <hi>Levit,</hi> 19. 17. to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. and <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3.
and therefore though theſe commands of puniſhing Blaſphemers,
Apoſtates, falſe Prophets, &amp;c. bee not expreſſed in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
but added after, yet they may bee no more judiciall then
the third and fourth Commandement. And therefore the
moſt accurate diſtinction that is given by Divines between
judiciall lawes properly ſo called, and thoſe lawes numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the judiciall, is this, thoſe were properly judiciall lawes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114270:46"/>
which had a ſingular reſpect to the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſo as
the reaſon cauſe and foundation of them was placed in ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

wont to be reckoned among the judicials, and yet in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
had no ſingular reſpect or relation to the condition of the
<hi>Jewes</hi> more then to other people, all thoſe are of morall natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

that falſe Prophets Blaſphemers, &amp;c. may be bodily puniſhed
under the New Teſtament is all one as if a man ſhould go

about to prove that the man <hi>Moſes</hi> is now alive, by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe hee was alive under the old Teſtament, I
anſwer, 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> is alive under the new Teſtament, as God
ſaid in the buſh to <hi>Moſes,</hi> I am the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the
God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo God is the God of
<hi>Moſes</hi> as well as of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Now God is not the God of the
dead but of the living. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 32. compared with
<hi>Mark</hi> 12. 26, 27. 2. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> body be dead and buried by
God in a Sepulcher that no man knowes of, yet his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may be alive, tis a groſſe <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
muſt be dead and buried whoſe bodyes are dead, for then
<hi>Davids</hi> Doctrine in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> the Prophets Doctrine, yea
the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles Doctrine ſhould be dead, they
being now all dead as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo all proofes brought
for any Doctrine, from <hi>Davids Pſalmes,</hi> the Prophets, the new
Teſtament may be thus evaded, by ſaying, we may go about to
prove <hi>David,</hi> the Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles are now
alive by this arguments, becauſe they were alive ſome of them
thouſands, and others of them many hundred yeares agoe.
Thirdly beſides this falſe conſequence, tis evident upon many
grounds that Doctrines are alive, doe bind when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers

things are ſpoken and written to be a rule of direction to the
Church, intended to take place rather after their death then in

take hold of your Fathers?</hi> though Pen-men and writers of
Scripture die, yet their words and Doctrine take hold and place
when they are dead. Fourthly by this reaſon of holding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
is now alive, if the law of God in the old Teſtament binds, it
will follow that all <hi>Moſes</hi> Doctrine, the ten commandements
and all he writ in the <hi>Pentatench, Geneſis, &amp;c.</hi> are void as well
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114270:47"/>
as theſe commands about puniſhing falſe Prophets, &amp;c. for
they were made known and written by <hi>Moſes</hi> when hee was
alive, and to bee found in his Books together with theſe lawes
termed judiciall: So that the Antinomian may as well ſay the
ſame againſt the morall law under the Goſpell, when the ten
Commandements are preſſed, and the Socinian and Anabaptiſt
againſt thoſe commands to put to death murtherers, which now
Maſter <hi>John Goodwin</hi> doth againſt theſe lawes in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. &amp;c.
that men may as well prove the man <hi>Moſes</hi> is now alive, by
theſe commands, becauſe he was alive under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as bring thoſe places of Scripture written by <hi>Moſes</hi> to
prove the morall law in force, and thoſe commands <hi>who ſo ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud bee ſhed.</hi> Fifthly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> by way of ſcoffe hath ſpoken thus of proving
as well <hi>Moſes</hi> may be now alive, tis evident, beſides the new
Teſtaments Confirmation in many places of the Evangeliſts
and Epiſtles, of the old Teſtament being in force in the dayes
of the Goſpell (of which I ſhall ſpeak in the 18. THESIS

theſe things being laid together, I ſuppoſe by this time every

to the Reverend Author of the Vindication of the printed
Paper entituled an Ordinance for the preventing of Hereſies, &amp;c.
and the reſt of the Presbyterians.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as to that anſwer of <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> p. 48. 49. they that
<hi rend="margQuotes">will have the ancient law for putting Blaſphemers &amp; Idolaters

if men will urge this law as being ſtill in force, they make

who hath any power to make an Election or Reprobation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Commandements of God, where God himſelf hath
made none.</hi> I reply, it followes not: tis no good conſequence
that all circumſtances, acceſſories, particularities muſt bind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſubſtance of a command binds; or that the ſubſtance and

Evangelicall Ordinances and Commands, in points of worſhip

ſuch forms, acceſſories, manner of proceeding, which were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to that time and people. And if wee do but obſerve and
conſider the compoſition of moſt of the moſaicall lawes, how
they are mixt of morall,<note place="margin">☞</note> judiciall, and ceremoniall, how lawes
judiciall have ſomething morall, and ſomething ceremoniall in
them, and ceremonials have ſomething judiciall and morall in
them, and how that thoſe things which in their nature are moral
and perpetuall, have yet ſomewhat judiciall and ceremoniall
annexed to them, of all which we may be further ſatisfied in
<hi>Zepperus</hi> his explanation of the moſaicall lawes, we may eaſily
conceive how in theſe moſaicall lawes, a command the thing
it ſelfe may be binding for the ſubſtance, and yet ſeverall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

of deſtroying Cattell, the whole Cities, &amp;c. And to ſtop <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomaſt.</hi>
mouth for ever, I wiſh him to conſider this, that by vertue
of commands under the old Teſtament, Apoſtates, falſe Prophets,
Idolaters, may be now put to death, and yet the Magiſtrates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel not bound to deſtroy whole Cities, cattell, nor
fulfill the reſt of his inferences: For it will appeare by many
inſtances in the old Teſtament, even in that time of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant, wherein the 13. of <hi>Deut.</hi> was written,
that the Magiſtrates held not themſelves bound to àll thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of deſtroying all the inhabitants, cattell, &amp;c. though they
inflicted puniſhments, yea death upon ſome Idolaters, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114270:50"/>
which might be given. And therfore if Magiſtrates under the old
Teſtament, though all thought it their duty to puniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Apoſtates, were not tied to all the particulars in <hi>Deut.</hi>
13. then certainly the Magiſtrates under the new are leſſe tied
to thoſe acceſſories and formalities of that Law, by all which tis
apparent thoſe things laid down in<note n="*" place="margin">The ſtoning to death with ſtones Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, was not eſſentiall as <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 3. ſhowes who there prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they ſhall be thruſt through, not ſtoned.</note>

eſſence of it; yea holding only in ſome particular caſes, time, but
not generall to the Iewes themſelves, which in what caſes and
how, I ſhall forbeareſpeaking of now for feare of inlarging this
part beyond its proportion intended.</p>
                  <p>And for a concluſion of this; the conſideration of this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and compoſition of the Lawes of God under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is exceeding uſefull for this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee may judge more eaſily of the mutabilitie or immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of them, whether they be temporary or perpetuall, and
ſo whether they bind all men, or only ſome. In commands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
out of the old Teſtament, this is to bee carefully
lookt into whether they be meerly and purely morall or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
or judiciall;<note place="margin">☞</note> or whether mixt and compounded, and
how, of what lawes mixt. If the command bee pure and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the thing is evident, where morall is binds, where ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
or judiciall it binds not. But if it bee mixt of judiciall, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
and morall, or of ceremoniall and morall, the morall
remains and is in force: by all which wee may ſee the weaknes
of <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> inference, that if that command in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. does
at all bind Chriſtians, it muſt binde in every particular there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of: for whats morall in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. abides, and yet whats
properly judiciall and ceremoniall is taken away: look as that
were no good argument againſt the fifth commandement being
in force under the new Teſtament, becauſe then what was judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
and ceremoniall in it as containing the promiſe of the Land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a bleſſing in it &amp;c. muſt remaine under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
ſo neither is this of <hi>Hagiomaſt.</hi> For as a command morall may
have ſomewhat judiciall mixed with it, ſo may a command ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
have much of morall in it; but now what judiciall lawes
and how mixed are temporary and changeable, and upon what
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114270:51"/>
rules and grounds, and what judiciall lawes are immutable and
perpetuall, and how to bee known, I referre the Reader for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

Blaſphemers and Seducers to Idolatry to death, ſhould
not now bee in force upon any ſuch terms as it was when and
where it was given; becauſe in all difficult caſes that happened
about maters of Religion, the Iewes to whom this Law
was given, had the opportunity of immediate conſultation with
the mouth of God himſelfe, who could and did from time to
time, infallibly declare what his own mind and pleaſure was in
them. So that except thoſe that were to give ſentence in caſes
of Religion had been deſperately wicked, and ſet upon bloud
and deſpiſed that glorious Ordinance of the Oracle of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, they could not doe injuſtice, God being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at hand to declare unto them, what kind of Blaſphemer
and what kind of Idolater it was that hee by this Law intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhould be put to death. Whereas now the beſt Oracles that
Magiſtrates and Iudges have to direct them in doubtfull caſes
about matters of Religion are men of very fallible judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and every way obnoxious to error and miſtake. Yea confident
I am, that the wiſeſt &amp; moſt learned of them are not able cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or demonſtratively to informe the Magiſtrate what Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
or what Idolatry it was which was by God ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to death under the Law: Therefore the going about to
prove that the Law for putting Blaſphemers and Seducers to
Idolatry to death, is now, or amongſt us in force, becauſe it was

as by the bleſſing of God all men who have not ſold themſelves

for the preſent I ſhall hint theſe things by way of Reply.</p>
                  <p>1. This very point of Infallibilitie and Fallibilitie was the main
riſe and cauſe of ſetting the Pope in his chair, of making one that
muſt be an infallible judge in the Church, and ſo is the ground
work of the Popes Authoritie and Tyrannie over the Church,<note place="margin">☜</note>
which all who underſtand the Controverſies between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and the Reformed Churches <hi>De Papa</hi> doe well know:
And on the other hand tis made the foundation of bringing in
all Anarchie and Libertiniſme into the Church to overthrow
all power of Magiſtrates, and of Synods and Councels in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion: ſo that at on the one hand it hath exalted the
Pope and given him an unjuſt Domination and uſurpation, ſo
on the other it caſts down the uſe of all civil and Eccleſiaſticall
power for the good of the Church, ſo that the ſame thing
that ſet up the Pope and made Antichriſt, ſets up a Toleration
and univerſall libertie of conſcience, which is a new and worſe
Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>etting up the Pope (as I ſuppoſe <hi>Hagiomaſt.</hi> and all the Sectaries

Toleration of all Religions, a farre greater evill then a Pope.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I deny that which <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> takes for granted,
the reaſon it ſelf upon which he founds why the old Teſtament

was Idolatry, or Blaſphemie, or this man an Idolater, or falſe

God given to them, and in difficult caſes too hard they were

doe <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> no good, nor is to the point at all brought by
him, becauſe this enquiring by <hi>Vrim</hi> is not to know from the
Lord what kind of Idolatrie and Idolater this is, whether that
for which death is to bee inflicted, but whether this be a
falſe or a true witneſſe, as the words cleerly ſhow; the queſtion
is not about matter of Law, whether ſuch a thing be Idolatrie, or
not, what kind of Idolatry, but of matter of fact, whether the

<hi>And the Iudges ſhall make diligent inquiſition: and behold if the

ſhould ſhow, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 11. The ſubject matter of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is not to enquire of the Preiſts whether this were a caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or a wilfull Murther, and for them to tell who were the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
that had ſlaine this man (the reſolution of which queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

but all the matter is, whats to be done to expiate the
bloud of a man ſlain in the Land, it being not knowne who
hath ſlaine him; thats ſuppoſed, and is the caſe upon which all the
direction both for Elders, Prieſts and People is built. Laſtly

<hi>Moſes</hi> that they ſhould be ſtoned, I anſwer, Firſt, the<note n="*" place="margin">Theodoret Quaeſt. in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Quaeſt. 33.

was put in ward, that the Lord might be conſulted with, what
kind of puniſhment ſhould bee inflicted upon him; by the
light of nature and the Law of the Decalogue, the people of
the Jewes knew hee was to bee puniſhed for it, though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

God doth not only declare what ſhall be done to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

16. verſe, taking an occaſion from this as hee did from other
tranſgreſſions committed, and his peoples ill manners, to publiſh
judiciall lawes, the appendixes of the morall Law in matters
of juſtice and judgement: But though God was immediately
conſulted with before there was a law (for that is the caſe
here) of which there was all the reaſon in the world, how doth
it follow that after an expreſſe Law is given, and ordinary
means and wayes appoynted by God, for the full knowing and
executing of that Law, now Perſons muſt immediately upon all
occaſions have immediate Anſwers from God whether and how
they may puniſh upon that Law? and indeed to what end were
expreſſe laws written &amp; made known, and knowing able men in
thoſe laws deputed by God to judge according to them, if imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

the Sabbath Breaker ſhould die; but they knew he that prophaned the

from God, as well for the manner and kind of their Lawes and
puniſhments as for the puniſhments themſelves, and ſome of
them being not declared, no wonder that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtayed till hee
enquired of God; but whats all this to make good <hi>Hagiomaſtix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>
aſſertion that becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> who was to receive Lawes from
God both for matter and forme for that people, did wait upon
God by ſpeciall immediate inquiring in caſes of ſome tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114270:62"/>
that accordingly all things might bee done, therefore
after God had given all Lawes both for matter and forme in
caſes of Idolatry, Blaſphemie, prophecying falſly, as in <hi>Deut.
13. Deut. 17. 2. Levit.</hi> 24. 16. the Judges and Magiſtrates fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
muſt doe ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in both theſe inſtances alleadged, the men were put
into ward, not to enquire of God, concerning their ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
whether they were Blaſphemie, and Sabbath-breaking,
there was no queſtion in that kind, both the people and <hi>Moſes</hi>
were ſatisfied in that, as appeares by the ſtories and by putting
them in ward, but only in what manner they ſhould be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt, God not having before declared his mind particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in thoſe caſes, ſo that theſe inſtances helpe <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, as not ſpeaking to the matter in hand: For whereas
<hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> makes this ground of the Iews putting to death Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
Idolaters, their enquiring and Gods declaring by <hi>Vrim
what kind of Blaſphemer, and ſo what kind of Idolater particularly
it was, that be by his Law intended ſhould be put to death,</hi> Moſes
and the people neither inquired any ſuch thing, what kind of
Blaſphemie it was, nor did God ſpeake to <hi>Moſes</hi> in that kind;
but, <hi>bring forth him that hath curſed in the campe, and let all that
heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the Congregation
ſtone him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the declaration of the mind of the Lord in theſe
two examples, was no Anſwer by <hi>Vrim;</hi> for beſides that there
is no mention in the text of the high Prieſt being ſpoken to
put on the Ephod to enquire by <hi>Vrim,</hi> neither doe any Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
underſtand it ſo, both the texts are againſt it in thoſe
words, <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, bring forth him that
hath curſed; And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>The man ſhall ſurely
bee put to death,</hi> the declaration of Gods mind being to <hi>Moſes</hi>
immediately; whereas in the judgement of <hi>Vrim,</hi> it was to the
Prieſt immediately, ſo that theſe Anſwers of God were the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of a Law-giver, giving Lawes and Penalties by the hand
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not any new Interpretations and declarations of
the meaning of the Law upon controverſies and doubts ariſing;
and beſides Gods way of anſwering <hi>Moſes,</hi> and anſwering by <hi>Vrim</hi>
were different things, as the Rabbins and other learned men
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114270:63"/>
who write of thoſe things ſhow, Gods anſwering <hi>Moſes</hi> and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him Lawes and Commandements being by voice, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
by <hi>Vrim</hi> being in an other way by beholding the Breaſt-Plate,
and ſeeing therein by the Viſion or Inſpiration, as theſe
Scriptures <hi>Exod. 25. 22. Numb. 7. 89. Exod.</hi> 28. 30. with <hi>Ainſworths</hi>
Annotations expreſſe. As for the immediateneſſe of theſe
Anſwers from God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> though not by the judgement of
<hi>Vrim,</hi> there were ſpeciall reaſons thereof, God in an immediate
way, communicating to <hi>Moſes</hi> all his Laws morall and judiciall
<hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 22. and <hi>Moſes</hi> being ſuch a Prophet <hi>whom the Lord knew
face to face,</hi> and ſuch an extraordinary man in ſeverall reſpects as
there was none <hi>like unto him. Numb. 12. 6, 7, 8. Exod. 33. 11. Deut.</hi>
34. 10, 11. But for the Magiſtrates and Iudges that came after
<hi>Moſes,</hi> to whom the morall Law and the Appendix of it the
judiciall Law was given and delivered, they were to proceed
according to the written Law, and there were in hard matters
higher Courts, conſiſting of a greater number &amp; more able to go
to to determine what the lower could not; &amp; then the higheſt of
all the Synedrion at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> who were in all their judgements
aboue morall tranſgreſſions, to goe according to the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> as many Scriptures teſtifie <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 11. &amp;c But no ſuch
Grounds after the whole Law, morall, ceremoniall and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
was publiſhed, of immediateneſſe of Anſwers from God to
any of their Courts, no not to the high Synedrion as to <hi>Moſes</hi>
who was to receive all for the firſt conſtituting of their policie,
according unto which all Courts and Iudicatures higher and
lower were bound to goe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In theſe great and weighty caſes of the Blaſphemer
and Sabbath-Breaker, <hi>Moſes</hi> did not preſently paſſe ſentence,
but made delayes, put them in Priſon, till he knew the mind of
the Lord, and as for other reaſons before alledged, ſo for theſe
following, 1 to teach Iudges in matters of great weight of
life and death not to be too ſudden and haſtie, 2 in cauſes that
are very hard to aske councell and to uſe all means to be well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
before they doe any thing. In <hi>Ainſworths</hi> Annotations
upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 34. the Reader may find the Chaldee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrazing
thus; <hi>This judgement was one of the foure judgements
that came before</hi> Moſes <hi>the Prophet, which he judged according to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114270:63"/>
the word of God: Some of them were judgements of leſſer moment and
ſome of them judgements of life and death. In the judgements of
leſſer moment (of pecuniary matters</hi>) Moſes <hi>was readie; but in
judgements of life and death bee made delayes. And both in the one
and in the other,</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, I have not heard,</hi> [viz what God
would have done] <hi>For to teach the Heads (or cheife) of the Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drions
(or Aſſiſes) that ſhould riſe up after him, that they ſhould bee
ready to diſpatch inferior cauſes (or money matters) but not haſty
in matters of life and death. And that they ſhould not be aſhamed to
inquire, in cauſes that are too hard for them; ſeeing</hi> Moſes <hi>who was
the Maſter of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>had need to ſay I have not heard, Therefore hee
impriſoned him, becauſe as yet it was not declared what ſentence
ſhould paſſe upon him.</hi> Babington in his comfort: Notes on <hi>Levit.</hi>
24. writes, <hi>Moſes</hi> although ſuch a man, yet will doe nothing
haſtily in judgement, and eſpecially touching life, but he will be
adviſed by God, who then ſpake from betwixt the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
<hi>Exod.</hi> 25. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. But it followes not becauſe Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Courts of Iuſtice were to learne to be cautious and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in matters of religion for what they puniſh eſpecially
with death, that therefore they may puniſh no violations in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
though expreſly and directly againſt the word of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
God doe immediately from heaven declare them Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
&amp;c, and ſuch kind of Blaſphemies, which the Law intends
death to: And for a concluſion of my Anſwer to this Evaſion
of Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> of the judgement by <hi>Vrim</hi> in the caſes of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie,
Idolatry, Prophecying falſly, the cleare reaſon why
then they were puniſhed with death but may not be ſo now that
being ceaſed under the new Teſtament: I ſhall ſay no more but
this, I challeng him among al the examples recorded in Scripture
of puniſhing men with death, impriſonment or baniſhment, &amp;c
for Blaſphemie, Idolatrie, Prophecying falſly, prophaning of the
Sabbath, marrying Idolatrous wives and other tranſgreſſions of
Gods worſhip, to produce any one Inſtance that by the Iudges, or
by the high Sanhedrin God was enquired by <hi>Vrim,</hi> whether ſuch
and ſuch facts were Blaſphemie, Idolatrie, &amp;c, and of that kind
and nature intended by the Law as puniſhable with death, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Claſſicall Authors, <hi>Rabbins</hi> and others who have
written of the cuſtomes of the Iewes, of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> of

Blaſphemie, &amp;c. to enquire by <hi>Vrim,</hi> and to paſſe ſentence upon
perſons according to that Anſwer,<note place="margin">☜</note> and not according to the law;
which if he cannot doe as I am confident upon ſerious ſearch, he
cannot, then the Reader may eaſily ſee what poor ſhifts this great
Champion of the Sectaries is put unto, to uphold his damned
curſed cauſe of Toleration of all Religions, and to elude the
commands of God fore-named for puniſhing Blaſphemers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates,
Idolaters and falſe Prophets.</p>

Section of <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> againſt the old Teſtament Law being
now in force <hi>for putting of falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to Idolatris to death,</hi> upon which hee vapours and triumphs
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114270:64"/>
ſo exceedingly over the<note n="*" place="margin">One of the Members of the Aſſembly was the ſole Author of the Vindication of the printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, entituled <hi>An Ordinance for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the growth of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,</hi> and not 3. or 4. which worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber could hee get any time from his often preaching and conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Aſſembly, wold (I doubt not) make <hi>Hagioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtix</hi> not only a ſtripling, but a very child.</note> 
                     <hi>Anti Quaeriſts, certaine ſtriplings of the
Aſſembly</hi> (as hee by way of ſcorne terms them) is ſo farre from
fighting againſt the Magiſtrates puniſhing (even by virtue of that
old law) for matters of Religion, where hee is ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the things hee puniſhes for, are Apoſtaſies, Idolatries, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
Blaſphemies and that hee is not miſtaken, as that in all
ſuch caſes of certaintie and infallibility, it eſtabliſhes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
coercive power in matters of the firſt Table, and
is indeed a ſtrong reaſon for it: For if that were the formall
cauſe and reaſon why Magiſtrates might then puniſh Idolatrie,
falſe Prophecying, &amp;c. becauſe they might infallibly know,
ſuch a thing was Idolatrie, &amp;c. and ſo bee out of danger of
fighting againſt God, then what things may bee as certainly
known under the Goſpel to bee Idolatrie, falſe Prophecying,
Apoſtaſie, &amp;c, the Magiſtrate may as well reſtraine: I ſhall not
need to prove the conſequence, becauſe, beſides its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that it neceſſarily follows, Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> in expreſſe
terms grant and confeſſes <hi>page</hi> 130. that for his <hi>part hee ſhall
thinke it equall nd meet, hee that ſhall doe preſumptuouſly, and not
hearken unto what is by infallible Revelation from God ſhould be put
to death,</hi> and the only ground brought by him in this 36. Section
of denying this power to Magiſtrates now, is their uncertaintie
in matters of Religion, <hi>the beſt Oracles that Magiſtrates and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
have to direct them in doubtfull caſes about matters of Religion
being men of very fallible judgements, and every way obnoxious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
error and miſtake, and therefore to goe about to prove that the old
Law is now in force, becauſe it was once given to the Iewes, is as if
one ſhould prove that a man may ſafely and without danger walke
among bogges and praecipices at midnight, becauſe he may well do it
at noone day.</hi> So that by <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> owne confeſſion, whats
certainly and infallibly known to be Error, Idolatrie, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
Hereſie, may and ought to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate
under the new Teſtament, which is indeed a yeelding the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
that Magiſtrates may puniſh under the Goſpell in matters
of Religion, for thats not the queſtion what is truth and what
is Error, what is Hereſie, and what is Idolatrie, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing can bee known certainly under the Goſpell to be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114270:65"/>
truth or no? and how the Magiſtrates come to know it, and
who ſhall tell them which is truth, that is quite another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the queſtion in hand about Toleration and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
coercive Power in points of Religion, is, ſuppoſing and
granting there are many things certaine in Religion, which he
certainly knows and beleeves, whether then the Magiſtrate may
puniſh? which upon this very queſtion, <hi>whether Princes have full

long ſince in his anſwer to a Jeſuite, making this objection,
Yea, But who ſhall tell Magiſtrates which is truth? <hi>That is
not this queſtion: When wee reaſon whether Princes may command
for truth, and puniſh error, you muſt not cavill about the meanes to
know truth from error, but ſuppoſe that truth were confeſſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on, and in that caſe what may Princes doe for truth. If I
ſhould aske you whether Princes may revenge Murthers and puniſh
thefts, were this an Anſwer to ſay, but how ſhall they know what
Murther is, and who be theeves? No more when we demand what duty
Princes owe to God and his truth, ſhould you ſtand quarrelling what
truth is or how truth may be known? The Princes dutie to God is one
queſtion which wee now handle; the way to diſcerne truth from error
is another, which anon ſhall enſue when once this is ended; But firſt let
us have your direct Anſwer whether Princes may command for truth
or no?</hi> And then the Ieſuite anſwering, for truth they may: but

before the firſt be finiſhed, ſtay for that till this be tried.</hi> Now then
to bring this point to ahead and iſſue, <hi>Hagiomaſtixs clear reaſon</hi>
grants that in caſes about matters of Religion ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the Magiſtrate may puniſh in the times of the Goſpel,
which directly overthrowes that univerſall Toleration ſo much
pleaded for in divers of his Books: ſo that Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi>
by his own <hi>cleer reaſon</hi> is forced upon this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to
hold no points in matters of Religion and Doctrine of faith
can be certainly and infallibly known under the Goſpel,<note place="margin">☜</note> or if
they can, then the violations of ſuch may by the Magiſtrate be
lawfully cenſured. And here in this matter I doe appeale from
Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> wanton wit, great applauſe among his Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

Fourthly, upon the ſame cleer reaſon and ground why the
old Teſtament Law for puniſhing falſe Prophets &amp;c, ſhould
not now be in force, becauſe the Iewes in all difficult caſes

of Hereſie, Idolatrie, Blaſphemie, or for Church-Officers cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
by Depoſition, Excommunication in points of Error,

                     </gap>iaſticall cenſures ſhall be all evaded,
for the ſame thing may be ſaid, and is ſaid againſt the places of
the new Teſtament, that in the time when the Goſpels, Acts of
the Apoſtles, and Epiſtles were written, the Churches had
Apoſtles and Prophets who were immediately inſpired and
infallible, and could in all difficult caſes that happened about
matters of Religion declare infallibly from God, what was
Hereſie and Sciſme, and what was not; and therefore a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
after the firſt and ſecond admonition might be rejected,
and <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> delivered unto Satan, and <hi>Iezabel</hi>
for ſeducing cenſured, becauſe Chriſt was alwayes at hand
by Apoſtles or Prophets to declare unto them infallibly who
were Hereticks and ſeducers, whereas now ſince the Apoſtles
and Prophets are ceaſed, and all extraordinary wayes, the beſt
Oracles Miniſters and People have to direct them in doubtfull
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114270:68"/>
caſes about matters of Religion, are men of very fallible
judgements, and every way obnoxious unto error and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
the beſt Synods and Councels being not infallible. And
ſo whatſoever <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> ſpeakes of the old Law, another may
ſay the ſame of the new, as to this effect; I am confident that
the wiſeſt and moſt learned of the Miniſters are not able cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or demonſtratively to informe the Magiſtrate what Hereſie
or what Sciſme it was, or what kind of holding the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
paſt already it was for which the Apoſtles cenſured <hi>Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and commanded to reject &amp; avoid Hereticks and Sciſmaticks;
and therefore to goe about to prove thoſe commands in the
new Teſtament againſt falſe Prophets, Hereticks, Sciſmaticks,
Troublers of the Church, to be in our dayes in force, becauſe
they were given in the Apoſtles dayes and practiſed by them,
is as if one ſhould prove that a man may ſafely and without
danger walke among bogs, Precipices and ditches at midnight,
becauſe he may well doe it at noon day. The Socinians upon
this very ground plead againſt Excommunication, and al Church

becauſe they dare to reſiſt the Spirit ſpeaking by the Apoſtles, and when

ſuch aname aſſure us, or certifie that wee cannot erre? What Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
can wee now perſwade our ſelves ſo uncorrupt, as that of the
Apoſtles or Primitive Church? Thoſe who deny Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Hereticks, ſay, bring not arguments and reaſons out of the new
Teſtament, but that power of the Spirit with which the Apoſtles being
endowed, delivered up to Satan and kild Hypocrites with a word:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114270:68"/>
If you want this Powerfull efficacie of the Spirit, acknowledge your
raſhnes and iniquitie in condemning thoſe, to whom you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
your Interpretation of Scripture: Neither is the Spirit
now ſo weak, but that bee is able to give Teſtimonies of the divine
Authoritie, and his preſence in his Miniſters now againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
It followes not becauſe many things were not tolerated in the
infancie of the Church in the Primitive times, therefore they ought
not to bee tolerated now in the old age of the Church: They deceive
and are deceived who would bring our times to the example of that
flouriſhing age. When the Church was healthfull and ſtrong in that
firſt flower of its age, and whilſt the company of the Apoſtles were living,
the uſing of violent remedies in reſpect of the Churches vigor was meet
and agreeable. Now the Church with diſeaſes and old age being weakned
and ſpent, it now almoſt falls downe under its prevailing ſickneſſe:
neither is it any time more in danger, then when it fals into the bands
of cruell Phyſitians. In time paſt its firſt vigor admitted of opening of
veines and loſſe of bloud; now if after ſtrength exhauſted by ſo many
evils there remaine any vitall Iuyce and moisture, it cannot but by
letting bloud be poured out with the life and Spirit, and therefore
this remedie of the puniſhment of Hereticks for the Preſervation of the
Church ought to bee omitted now, when it will bring more hurt and
danger, then profit to the Church.</hi> So ſome of our Sectaries in a

brought out of the old or new Teſtament in matters of dutie,

and 130. page why Magiſtrates under the old Law might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
coercive Power, upon falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers, &amp;c
becauſe in all difficult caſes of Religion the Iewes to whom
this Law was given, had the opportunitie of enquiring by <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim,</hi> of immediate conſultation with the mouth
of God himſelfe by the high Prieſt, ſeems not to be any reaſon
upon theſe grounds. Firſt, that reaſon is never expreſſed in
thoſe commands or examples for putting to death falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Blaſphemers, Idolaters, &amp;c. but other reaſons are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<hi>viz.</hi> from the nature of the ſinnes, drawing away from God,
the putting away of the evill, and that others may feare and do
no more ſo, with other ſuch like, all, reaſons of a common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the times now as well as then. Secondly, before there
was a high Prieſt, and holy garments made for him, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

22. 20. and in <hi>Jobs</hi> time long before the high Prieſt, and in a
Land where the high Prieſt was not enquired by, Idolatry was
an iniquity worthy to be puniſhed by the Iudges. 3. Thoſe
who were Heathens ſtrangers in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not in the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor underſtood not what the

their children to <hi>Molech,</hi> as appears in <hi>Levit,</hi> 20. 2. and in
page 49. 50. of this Treatiſe. Fourthly, the Magiſtrates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
their coercive Power in matters of Religion, as freely
after <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were loſt, and that judgement cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

It is the judgement of moſt of the learned writers both <hi>Robbins</hi>

<hi>Truely tis no common honor that is given to a cruell Tyrant when
God aſſignes his Prophet as the Preacher to publiſh the Lawes he
made, and puts thoſe Lawes among his acts, and numbers them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his holy Oracles. What? whether is</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>praiſed
by the Teſtimoniall of the Holy Spirit, and of the Prophet for taking
upon him according to his Power and Authoritie the defence of the
glory of the true God, that holy Magiſtrates ſhould beare with the
wicked prophanation of his glory, and does not the Lord rather under
the Perſon of a Prophane King ſhowe what becomes them to
doe? And certainly what is more prepoſterous then in the boſome of
the Church to foſter unpuniſhed wicked contumelies againſt God,
which was in</hi> Babylon <hi>enacted to be puniſhed with capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
Fifthly, this <hi>cleere Reaſon</hi> of Gods immediate and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
declaring his own mind and pleaſure under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even according to <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> Principles, is ſo far from
being any reaſon why Magiſtrates might then puniſh Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Idolaters, falſe Prophets, &amp;c but not now, as that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſeems more reaſonable: for in caſes of immediate and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Anſwers from Heaven, God declaring who was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and what was Idolatrie, &amp;c convincing men ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as leaving them without all ſubterfugies, one would think
there ſhould need the Magiſtrates Power a great deale leſſe,
then in a time when there are no ſuch immediate Anſwers
from God, nor diſcoveries of men from heaven; For it cannot
be thought but that very bad men, when they certainly knew,
that if they prophecied falſly, entiſed perſons to Idolatrie, &amp;c
could not upon any Pretences whatſoever eſcape from being
convicted, but ſhould by God himſelf from heaven be judged I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,
falſe Prophets, and thereupon bee but to death, they
would either wholly forbeare the outward acts, or if commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any ſuch, they would confeſſe them, repent, and do no more
ſo; whereas when men know there is no ſuch way of finding
them out, of God from heaven naming perſons and things,
this is the man, and this is Idolatrie, Blaſphemie, &amp;c they
would be incouraged both to doe ſuch things and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them when they have done, to bring Scripture againſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114270:71"/>
Scripture, and Reaſon againſt Reaſon, as knowing all immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Anſwers and Diſcoveries to be ceaſed: Unto which if that
be added, that under the old Teſtament God himſelfe inflicted
more outward bodily puniſhments upon perſons for Idolatrie,
wil-worſhip, Sciſme, &amp;c, then hee does now under the new (the
judgements under the Goſpel being more ſpirituall as many
examples in the old Teſtament ſhow, being a more <hi>Immediate
Iudge, and Inflicted of bodily puniſhments on the Jewes,</hi> as he was
to them a more <hi>Immediate Legiſlator</hi> of which I have ſpoken
before in <hi>page</hi> 64. of this Booke) there appears leſſe reaſon
for thoſe coercive commands being in force under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then now, there being in both theſe reſpects now named
without the Magiſtrates coercive Power, greater means for aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reſtraining Violators of the firſt Table, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
diſcovering, and inflicting of puniſhment, then
in our times; And for illuſtrating this wee may obſerve that in
the Primitive times when there were extraordinary gifts in
the Church, of Miracles, &amp;c, and immediate Anſwers and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
by Apoſtles and Prophets, then the Church needed not
ſo much the helpe of the Magiſtrates and the civill ſword,<note place="margin">☞</note>
God giving no Chriſtian Magiſtrate all that time, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
that were in thoſe dayes were Perſecutors and enemies
of the Chriſtians, but after the Planting of the Goſpel and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
it, and the extraordinary Gifts and Offices in the
Church ceaſing, then God gave Kings and Princes to be nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Fathers, to defend the Church and the truth by their Laws
and Power, and hath continued ſuch ever ſince, as a great
helpe to the Church, as a wall to the weak Vine: So when
under the old Teſtament there was according to this Reaſon
of Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſuch immediate and infallible Anſwers from
the Mouth of God himſelfe in all difficult caſes of Religion,
and ſuch immediate viſible judgements by the immediate hand
of God upon Idolaters, falſe Prophets, eſpecially upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers
of the glorious <hi>Ordinance of the Oracle of God amongſt
them,</hi> except men had been deſperately and outragiouſly
wicked, and had with a high hand deſpiſed God himſelfe
ſpeaking and preſently ſtriking dead in caſe of diſobedience,
they could not have been obſtinate Seducers to Idolatrie, falſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114270:72"/>
Prophets, Blaſphemers, ſhould neither ſo much have needed
Magiſtrates armed with commiſſion from God to execute thoſe
commands of the 13. and 17. chapters of <hi>Deut.</hi> &amp;c, as in theſe
dayes we doe, wherein both theſe are wanting according to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomaſtixs</hi>
own confeſſion, and ſo much for the fifth Anſwer.
Sixthly, If this bee a <hi>cleer Reaſon</hi> why that old Teſtament
Law for the putting of falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers, &amp;c
to death ſhould not be now in force, <hi>becauſe in all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
caſes that happened about matters of Religion, the Jewes to
whom this Law was given, had the opportunitie of immediate
conſultation with the mouth of God himſelfe, who could and did
from time to time infallibly declare what his owne mind and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
was in them. So that except thoſe that were to give ſentence in
caſes of Religion, had been deſparately wicked and ſet upon bloud,
and had deſpiſed that glorious Ordinance of the Oracle of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, they could not do injuſtice, becauſe God himſelfe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at hand to declare unto them what was meet to be done;
whereas now the beſt Oracles that Magiſtrates and Iudges have
to direct them in doubtfull caſes about matters of Religion, are men of
very fallible judgements, and every way obnoxious unto error and
miſtake:</hi> then tis as cleer a Reaſon why the old Teſtament
Law, for puniſhing Murtherers and other Malefactors for
offences againſt the ſecond Table, ſhould not bee in force
now; and whatever is ſaid by <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> in this reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all bodily and civill puniſhment for tranſgreſſions of the
firſt Table, holds in all reſpects as ſtrongly againſt the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
puniſhing for killing, ſtealing, &amp;c, and the Anabaptiſts,
Socinians and other Hereticks, who wholly deny the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

Reaſon why the old Teſtament Law for puniſhing of Murtherers,
Theeves, Adulterers, &amp;c ſhould not now be in force upon any ſuch
terms as it was, when, and where it was given; becauſe in all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114270:72"/>
difficult caſes that happened about matters of the Second Table, the
Jewes to whom this Law was given, had the opportunitie of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
conſultation with the mouth of God himſelfe, who could and
did from time to time infallibly declare what his owne mind and
pleaſure was in them: So that except thoſe that were to give ſentence
in caſes of bloud, theft, &amp;c had been deſperately wicked, and ſet
upon bloud, and had deſpiſed that glorious Ordinance of the Oracle
amongſt them, they could not do injuſtice, becauſe God himſelfe was

that Magiſtrates and Iudges have to direct them in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
caſes about matters of life, eſtate,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>are men of very fallible
judgements, and the Lawes they are to proceede by, of doubtfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation

here ſpoken of, if immediate and infallible by <hi>Vrim,</hi> extending

or rather more, there being divers particular inſtances
in Scripture of Anſwers in Civill matters, as of war and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling

                  <p>Sixthly, this <hi>cleer Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> making infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the ground of coercive Power, and Fallibility a being
ſubject to error and miſtake, the ground of the deniall of ſuch

puniſhments in Criminall Civill matters, and ſo at once ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
void all the Civill Power of the Magiſtrate, and all the
Eccleſiaſticall power of the Church: For the Magiſtrate is not
infallible, abſolutely free from all poſſibility of error and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in his judgement in matters of the ſecond Table: many
Magiſtrates in thoſe matters have and doe daily groſly miſtake,
many innocent perſons have ſuffered, and doe daily, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
guilty perſons have and doe eſcape; who does not ſee in
Civill matters what miſtakes there are, and may bee both in
point of law and matter of fact, how Lawyers and Iudges are
divided in their Opinions, what controverſies and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ariſe upon caſes, what doubts and Scruples grow upon

ſo that what Iudge can ſay hee is infallible and certaine that

Hereſie, Sciſme, but for Murder, Theft, Polygamie, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie,
&amp;c yea as unlawfull for the Church to admoniſh

as for the Magiſtrates to puniſh corporally: But now <hi>M. S.
Hagiomaſtix, Ancient Bounds or Liberty of Conſcieuce ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
with divers of our Sectaries who write of this queſtion
yeeld the Magiſtrates power in matters of the ſecond Table,

meant of Miniſters, not Magiſtrates, and of ſpirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
not Civill, who yet are alike fallible and ſubject to error
and miſtake, the Magiſtrates in Civill judgements, and Miniſters
in ſpirituall, as they are in puniſhing corporally in matters of
Idolatrie, Hereſie,  and indeed conſidering the ſtate of the
queſtion of Magiſtrates coercive Power in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as I have laid it downe in the Prolegomena, and ſo is to
be underſtood <hi>viz.</hi> that the Magiſtrate is to doe it upon advice
and after advice in all difficult doubtfull caſes with the ableſt
Godlieſt Miniſters in the Church, by the advice of Synods, with
Solemne Prayers, after meant of inſtruction and conviction
uſed to the parties, which means and helps being not in Civill
cauſes nor in the cenſures of particular Churches, are more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to error and miſtake then Magiſtrates: So that if Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
and Churches may puniſh, the one corporally in matters
of the ſecond Table, the other ſpiritually in caſes of both
(as is confeſſed by our grand Patrons of Toleration) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their fallibilitie and poſſibilitie of miſtake,<note place="margin">☞</note> then
in difficult doubtfull caſes Magiſtrates may puniſh in matters
of the firſt Table, notwithſtanding they are men of very fallible
judgements; or in caſe the want of the Magiſtrates infallibilitie
puts a <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> to his coercive Power in matters of Religion,
the ſame want deprives him of Power in Civill things, and
Miniſters in Eccleſiaſtical, becauſe of their Poſſibilitie of erring
in both: By all which the Reader may ſee tis a very rotten foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
both to build upon, or to take away the Power of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
evill and erroneous perſons upon the infallibilitie or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie
of thoſe who have Authoritie from God; no, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this Power and dutie of thoſe who are in place both in
Church and State, are founded on the Ordinance and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, in appointing ſuch Offices, and in the nature of
the Crimes and offences, and on the ends of vindicating Gods
Glory and Name, and preſerving others from being ruined,
&amp;c, but never on that, that the perſons who ſhould exerciſe it
were infallible and not ſubject to error, which that tis ſo, may
be demonſtrated by theſe following reaſons. Firſt, In the
Churches of the new Teſtament in the Apoſtles dayes when
they had men amongſt them immediately inſpired, who
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114270:75"/>
could dictate the mind of Chriſt infallibly, and tell them the
certaine meaning of any Scripture, notwithſtanding all that
Infallibilitie and Immediateneſſe of Inſpiration, ſuch Perſons
Tenets and Practiſes (though erroneous and miſtakes) as by
the rules of faith and love could and might be tolerated and
ſuffered, were tolerated, and the Apoſtles in thoſe things ſo far
from giving any directions to the Churches for withdrawing
or excommunicating, that they give commands to the contrary,
namely to <hi>receive, bear with, pleaſe ſuch, and not our ſelves, follow
after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may
edifie another, and whereto we have already attained to walk by the
ſame Rule,</hi> as theſe Scriptures <hi>Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 19. Rom.
15, 1, 2, 3. Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16. with divers of the like kind ſhow:
The holding <hi>the day of Chriſt to be at hand,</hi> was an error, and
<hi>Paul</hi> writes pathetically to diſſwade the Theſſalonians from
it 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. yet for all that hee accounts them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and ſo I might inſtance in other ſuch particulars;
whereas on the contrary in damnable Hereſies, Sciſmes, and
ſuch like, as denying the reſurrection of the dead, holding
Circumciſion neceſſary to Iuſtification, in denying Jeſus Chriſt
to be come in the fleſh, in teaching the Doctrines of <hi>Balaam</hi>
and of the Nicolaitans, in ſeparating themſelves and going out
from the Church, the Apoſtles are againſt all ſuffering, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with, receiving of, and for rejecting, delivering up to
Satan and cutting of all ſuch, as theſe Scriptures teſtifie 1 <hi>Tim.
1. 20. Tit. 3. 10. Gal. 1. 8, 9. Gal.</hi> 5. 12. the ſecond Epiſtle of
<hi>Iohn. 7. 9, 10. Jude 19, 23 v. Revel.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 20. with many more.
Now in the Tenets, Opinions and Practiſes of the firſt ſort,
the Apoſtles could have reſolved the Romans, Philippians as
infallibly, who held the truth, and who in the error in thoſe
particulars, as in the latter of Hereſies: This is acknowledged
by Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> himſelfe in <hi>page</hi> 59<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 60, 61. of his <hi>Heart
diviſions,</hi> even where he pleads for a Toleration in all points
doubtfull and controverted among godly men, who writes
thus, <hi>all theſe people ſpoken of in</hi> Rom. 14 <hi>were not in the right, for
a man not to eat fleſh out of conſcience when the thing was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
certainly was a ſin, or to make conſcience of a Holy Day
which God required not, was a ſin: Now the Apoſtle did not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114270:76"/>
come with his Authoritie, and ſay, I will make you leave of keeping
ſuch dayes, or you ſhall eate, or to abſtaine thus as you doe is evill,
and it muſt not be ſuffered in you. No, the Apoſtle layes no Apoſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Authoritie upon them, but tels them, That every man muſt bee
ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y perſwaded in his owne mind in what he doth; and who art
thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? the Lord hath received
him. And yet the Governours of the Church in the Primitive
times might upon much ſtronger grounds have ſtood upon ſuch a
Principle, then any Governours of the Church now can; there was
leſſe Reaſon why they ſhould ſuffer any difference in Opinion or
Practiſe amongſt them, then why wee ſhould ſuffer differences amongſt
us; for they had men amongſt them immediately inſpired, who could
dictate the mind of Chriſt infallibly, they could tell them the certaine
meaning of any Scripture;</hi> And yet we ſee plainly, the Apoſtle
applies himſelfe both in the Romans and Philippians rather
to preſſe mutuall forbearance, and keeping the Vnitie of the
Spirit in the Bond of Peace, uſing all arguments of that kind,

the judging of what is Hereſie, Sciſm, and who is a Heretick or a

The Apoſtles who were infallibly and immediately inſpired, yet
in caſes of Controverſie ariſing in the Church, and in cenſures
and determinations thereupon, did not act from infallibility and
immediatenes of Anſwers from God, but from Scripture grounds
by way of reaſoning and diſputation deduced, and in a Synodical
way by the joint common reſolution of Elders as well as
themſelves, as is evident by <hi>Acts 15. Acts</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20, 21.
In that diſſention that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had with certainemen

thoſe who were to give ſentence in caſes of Religion, upon

or according to their own corrupt affection and intereſt,
which conſidering what many of the Prieſts were under the

Whoſoever does but conſider theſe examples following recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

8, 11. and there were many complaints by <hi>Ieremiah, Ezekiel,</hi>
and other Prophets, of the Prieſts, and cheife Prieſts being
<hi>out of the way through ſtrong drink, erring in viſion, and ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

and Prophaning of holy things, putting no difference between the
holy and prophane, hiding there eyes from the Sabbaths: the chiefe

Lord, which he had hallowed in Ieruſalem</hi> Eſay 28. 7. Ierem. 2.
27. Ezek. 22. 26. 2 Chron. 36. 14. Now if the Prieſts would doe
all this when they degenerated, offer violence to the Law, ſay
to a ſtock thou art my Father, pollute the houſe of the Lord,
and much more that is recorded in the Scripture of them, then
there is no queſtion to be made, but they might pervert the
ſentence by <hi>Vrim</hi> and give an Anſwer quite contrary to what
they received immediately and infallibly from God, therby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

might heare the Anſwer as well as the Prieſt, but in a

or by looking into his breaſt-Plate upon the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or brightneſſe of his Iewels by which he knew, or by ſome
letters in the breaſt-Plate in which he read the will of God,
and ſo by the Prieſt communicated to the Iudges, and ſtanders by,
but if the Prieſts would pretend other Anſwers from God then
he gave, how ſhould the Iewes diſprove them, and what more
certaintie had thoſe who in difficult doubtfull caſes came to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114270:80"/>
the high Prieſt to enquire by <hi>Vrim</hi> (ſeing they received the
Anſwers not from God immediately but from the high Prieſt,
and the Prieſt might poſſibly deceive them in caſes falling out
about their own children or neer bloud ſhowing partialitie
and affection) then may be had by us now in theſe times; nay
going according to Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> Principles, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the high Prieſt was by <hi>Vrim</hi> and not by the Law, the
judgement of <hi>Vrim</hi> from the Prieſt was the ſupreme and laſt
Iudge, in caſe the Prieſts would be falſe, as in ſome particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they might, the Iewes were in a more uncertaine and worſe
condition, then if to be judged by the Law, or wee in theſe
dayes, who if our Magiſtrates and Iudges ſhould degenerate
might appeale to the Scriptures and urge them to them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to convince them, but ſo could not the Iewes according to
<hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> Doctrine, the Prieſt by <hi>Vrim</hi> being appealed to in
caſes where they ſuppoſe the Law could not helpe; and laſtly, if
wee conſider how Prophets under the old Teſtament, who were
as immediately and infallibly inſpired, as the high Prieſt by
<hi>Vrim,</hi> yet in all their Anſwers and Dictates were not without
all poſſibilitie of miſtake, as is evident by <hi>Nathans</hi> Anſwer
to <hi>David</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 4, 5. &amp;c, nor without all danger of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe they ſpake to, as is to be ſeen in that example of
the old Prophet in <hi>Bethel</hi> 1 Kings 13. 11, 17, 18, 21. and divers
other places of Scripture ſpeaking of Prophets, wee may eaſily
conceive how Magiſtrates and Iudges then might be liable to
error as well as now, eſpecially if they tooke all the Prieſts
and Prophets ſaid without comparing and examining thoſe
things by the Law: So that by all this and a great deal more
that might be ſpoken to this effect, as the Magiſtrates and
Prieſts combining together, <hi>&amp;c. the Iewes to whom the Law
was given for putting falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers, to death</hi> for
all <hi>the opportunitie of immediate conſultation with the mouth of God
himſelfe</hi> by <hi>Vrim,</hi> and by <hi>Prophets</hi> might in many caſes have
been deceived, miſtaken, and in as great uncertaintie every
way as <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> ſuppoſes the Church to be in under the
new Teſtament. Thirdly, ſuppoſing and granting there had
been ſuch a certaintie and infallibilitie in the matters of
Religion under the old Law as is contended for by <hi>Hagiomaſtix,</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:114270:80"/>
and that free of all the exceptions now ſpoken of, yet I affirme
there is an infallibilitie and certaintie under the new alſo in the
Doctrines of faith and worſhip, and Chriſtian Magiſtrates may
infallibly and certainly know ſuch and ſuch Doctrines to be
falſe, and ſuch true, ſuch Practiſes and ſpeeches to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
blaſphemous as well as the Iewiſh Magiſtrates did, and
ſuppoſing that true which <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> ſaith, that the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Magiſtrates had a certaintie of knowledge in all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
caſes of Relgion by the judgement of <hi>Vrim</hi> which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Magiſtrates have not, yet in another way and by other means
they may have a certaintie and infallibilitie that theſe and
theſe Doctrines are of God, and other Doctrines are not
of God: when there are three or foure wayes to come to the
certaine knowledge of a thing, a man may be ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in one or two, though he have not all the wayes, A Iudge
who hath three or foure honeſt witneſſes and many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
with the parties own confeſſion may be certaine though
he might not ſee the fact committed, nor have all wayes of
knowledge that poſſible may be, and ſo may Magiſtrates now
in this caſe of Religion though they ſhould want ſome one
way the Magiſtrates under the new Teſtament had; And for
the certaintie and infallibilitie in matters of Religion under
the new Teſtament, it may apeeare thus, 1. <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> muſt
confeſſe upon his own Principles, that during the Apoſtles
times (which was under the new Teſtament) in all difficult
caſes that happened about matters of Religion, Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
might have had the ſame opportunities of immediate
and infallible Anſwers as under the old, Apoſtles, Prophets
then having as infallible immediate Revelations from God as
the high Prieſts, and therefore in caſe there had been Chriſtian
Magiſtrates in the Apoſtles days they might by this reaſon have
exerciſed coercive power on Apoſtates, Hereticks, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
as well as the Iewiſh Magiſtrates, by which tis apparent
thoſe Lawes about falſe Prophets and Blaſphemers were not
only old Teſtament Lawes proper for <hi>Moſes</hi> Paedagogie, but
new Teſtament Lawes, and that for the prime flouriſhing ſtate
of the new Teſtament, the Apoſtles times. Secondly, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents

and Diſcourſes tell us of a time at hand wherein there will be
a new and marveilous light, when wee ſhall cleerly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

among which our times are to be numbred, there is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie

ſhall find the infallibilitie and certaintie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and of the Doctrines of faith contained in them under
the new Teſtament abundantly cleared and made good, and
the cavils about the interpretations of Scripture, the need of
a viſible infallible Iudge, of every mans private Spirit being
Iudge, &amp;c fully anſwered, and therefore I ſhall not enlarge
further on it; only I ſhall briefly adde, that God in theſe times
of the new Teſtament hath left this threefold way, and means
of infallible certainty in Doctrines of Faith and Worſhip.
Firſt, the Scriptures, and more eſpecially ſince the Canon hath
been ſealed and compleated, contains and holds forth all
things neceſſary to ſalvation, and out of them they may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and infallibly known: the word of God written is an
inflexible golden rule (not leaden nor be bent) for all matters
of faith and manners, and there is ſuch a certaintie of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of faith laid down in the Scriptures, that 1. all poins of
faith neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly therein ſet forth, ſo
that all men who have ſpirituall eares and eyes may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

that no man who can underſtand the words need doubt
of the ſenſe. 2. There is not only a certaintie and aſſurance
to be had from the Scriptures of things more plainly laid

but from the Scriptures, by comparing Scripture with
Scripture, conſidering of circumſtances, by juſt conſequences,
and ſuch like, many hard doubtfull points in Religion which
to one man alone, or to weak unlearned men are very
uucertaine and doubtfull, yet by the helpe of many learned

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114270:83"/>
caſe deſerve to die; and ſo in the new Teſtament ſome things
in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles hard to be underſtood, which they that are
unlearned and unſtable wreſt to their own deſtruction, learned
men well ſetled in the faith may underſtand and beleeve cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
and not be led away with their error to fall from their

in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. about keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion

                  <p>Secondly, The Spirit of God in and by the Scriptures doth
infallibly and certainly aſſure and perſwade the heart of the

that which the Doctors of</hi> Paris <hi>doe teach of the infallibilitie
of Councels. For it may be piouſly and probably beleeved that
Councels truely generall and Lawfull, that is Lawfully gathered,

that they may not erre in fundament all points. I ſay this may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
becauſe tis certaine ſuch Councels have never hitherto erred
in Doctrines fundamentall.</hi> Secondly, although the Authoritie
and Power of Synods and Councels is not of it ſelfe infallible,
neither appointed of God that it ſhould be the ſupreme and
principall Rule of our Faith; and therefore cannot by it
ſelfe and of its owne Authoritie bind the faithfull to beleeve
whatever is determined in a Synod or Councell, yet there is in
them the ſupream Eccleſiaſtical Power of judging and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Controverſies of Faith; and that appointed by God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

Hence <hi>Cameron</hi> ſpeaking of Councels well obſerves,
<hi>So oft as any thing is decreed by an Aſſembly of men, who are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Anthoritie in the Church, that ſhould be a ground that ſuch a

not the Scriptures, ſhowes cleerly whatever anſwers the high
Prieſt gave in matters of judgement, they are limited expreſly
to the word of God, and that is made the ſupreme Iudge:
The Iewes were not ſimply to reſt in the judgement of the
high Prieſts whatever they pronounced, but as it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Reader to obſerve againſt <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> who makes ſuch a do of
infallibilitie, that not whatſoever is infallible is the ſupreme rule
of faith, for that is a grand miſtake to make every thing that
is infallible the ground of beleeving, or the cheife rule of it;
but this is the ground of being the ſupreme Rule of faith,
that it be <hi>ſummae ſuaeque authoritatis</hi> of ſupreme authoritie, of it

and that the Iewes opportunitie of immediateneſſe of

why that old Teſtament Law for putting of falſe Prophets,
&amp;c to death was given to them, yet it followes not theſe Laws
cannot be in force now, unleſſe that can be made apparence to
have been the only reaſon and ground of the Magiſtrates pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
for if there were other reaſons as well under the old

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114270:89"/>
and I have proved <hi>page</hi> 70. 76. and divers other pages of this
Treatiſe) then they being in force ſtill, the Lawes bind though
one particular reaſon, or more proper to that time bee ceaſed:
I might inſtance in many morall things commanded under the

enjoyned by God under the Law to be inflicted
in his Church upon delinquents to be bodily or afflictive at
all to the outward man, as by donfiſcation of goods, or
by death, but they were ſpirituall and inflicted upon the
ſoules by ſuſpenſion, excommunication, and ſuch like ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
cenſures, as well as now under the Goſpel: Tis true,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114270:90"/>
there were bodily outward puniſhments in the Civill Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
inflicted then on the bodies of falſe Prophets, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
&amp;c, but by the Magiſtrates, the Civil Governors, and not
by the Prieſts, the Eccleſiaſtical Governors in the Church of
the Iewes: For under the Law the Jewiſh Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
the Civil Government and Eccleſiaſtical, the
cenſures and puniſhments of Church and State were formally
diſtinct, as Maſter <hi>Gilleſpie</hi> hath fully and excellently proved in
his <hi>Aarons rod bloſſoming</hi> in many places, particularly 1. Book
cap. 2. 3, 4, 5, and the Church of the Iewes proceeded then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
falſe Prophets, only with the ſword of the Spirit, and
ſpirituall weapons, and the State with the materiall Sword,
and bodily puniſhments: Which truth is fully acknowledged
alſo by Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> (however differing from Presbyterians
about a National Church) in his Anſwer to Maſter <hi>Williams</hi>
Bloudy Tenet, ſaying, I <hi>ſhould think mine eye not only obſcured, but
the fight of it utterly put out, if I ſhould conceave as he doth, that
the National Church State of the Jewes did neceſſarily call for ſuch
weapons</hi> (a ſpeaking of a Sword of Iron or Steel) <hi>to puniſh Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
more then the Congregetional State of particular Churches doth
call for the ſame now in the dayes of the new Teſtament. For was
not the National Church of the Iewes as compleatly furniſhed with
ſpirituall Armor to defend it ſelfe, and to offend men and Divels as
the particular Churches of the new Teſtament be? Had they not
power to convince falſe Prophets as</hi> Eliah <hi>did the Prophets of</hi> Baal?
<hi>Had they not power to ſeperate all evil doers from the fellowſhip of
the Congregation? what power have our particular Churches
now, which their National Church wanted? or what efficacie is
there found in the exerciſe of our power which was wanting to them.
It is therefore a Sophiſtical imagination of mans Braine to make a
mans ſelfe, or the world believe that the National Church State of
the Iewes required a Civil Sword, whereas the particular State of
the Goſpel needs no ſuch helpe. And was not the National Church of
Iſrael as powerfully able by the ſame ſpirit to doe the ſame? ſurely it
was both ſpoken and meant of the National Church of the Jewes, not
by might nor by Power, but my Spirit ſaith the Lord of Hoſts</hi> Zach.
4. 6. So that by what I have already ſaid <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> muſt
either (I ſuppoſe) recall what he hath written of carnal bodily
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114270:90"/>
puniſhments enjoyned by God then to be inflicted, in his
Church upon delinquents, or elſe muſt joyne with the Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in holding the Iewiſh Church and Common-wealth,
their Governement and Cenſures all one and the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
The foundation upon which <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> rears this
building of outward puniſhments under the old Teſtament
being typical of ſpiritual under the new, (viz <hi>the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan
with the external happineſſe and peace there being typical,</hi> and
therefore reaſons <hi>a compara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is</hi> and from the Analogie) is
ſandie and unſound: for the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with the external
happineſſe and long life in it, whatſoever it was typical of,
was from what God had put into the Land, being a Land
healthful, pleaſant, flowing with milke and honey, abounding
in excellent precious fruits, the immediate bleſſings of God
upon it, and not from what came to it by the Magiſtrates Laws
and their good Government, for further ſatisfaction of which I
wiſh Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> to reſolve me this queſtion, whether the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> were not typical as well in times of wars and
troubles and under bad Princes, as in dayes of peace, and under
good Princes and ſo to <hi>reaſon a comparatis</hi> (to uſe his owne
Phraſe and <hi>adidem,</hi>) if temporall threatnings and bodily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
inflicted upon delinquents under the old Teſtament,
were <hi>typicall and Praeſignificative of greater under the Goſpel,</hi> they
muſt be threatnings and bodily puniſhments inflicted from
God upon falſe Prophets, &amp;c, not thoe executed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
on them. Thirdly, Granting both <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and the building reared upon it to be good, yet they
no whit prove bodily and outward puniſhments to be wholly
taken away under the new Teſtament; for ſuppoſe the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
happineſſe and the temporal puniſhments had typified more
ſpiritual happineſſe, and leſſe of the earth, more ſpiritual
judgements, and leſſe of outward or bodily ſufferings under the
Goſpel, yet it followes not, they take away all outward hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
and bleſſings, and all outward bodily puniſhments: there
may be greater or leſſer degrees of things under the old and
new Teſtament ſuitable to ſome difference in the manner of
Adminiſtration betweene the old and the new, and yet not the
ſubſtance of the things taken away: Theſe are knowne axioms,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114270:91"/>
                     <hi>Gradus non tollunt ſubſtantiam, Magis &amp; Minus non variant ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem:</hi>
Tis apparent by ſenſe and experience that how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſpirituall bleſſings, and ſpiritual judgements in the dayes
of the Goſpel abound above the times under the Law, yet
they take not away all temporal outward bleſſings, nor all
temporal outward judgements, but God for all that gives ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
outward bleſſings, and ſends many temporal judgements on
the earth, So ſuppoſing God ſhould inflict more ſpiritual
judgements on the ſoules of men under the new Teſtament, and
the Church greater ſpiritual cenſures then under the old, it no
way followes the Magiſtrates may inflict none at all, eſpecially
when all ſpiritual judgements on the ſoule are ſlited, and with
a high hand contemned. Fourthly, Whereas puniſhment by
the Magiſtrate and cutting off by death under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in caſes of Apoſtaſie, Blaſphemie, &amp;c, is made a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
and type of excommunication under the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cutting off of caſting out, and of eternal damnation,
I may truly Anſwer this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> ſaid, but not proved,
and therefore might deny it without giving any reaſon, and
bid the Patrons of Toleration prove it, but that the Civill
Magiſtrates puniſhing delinquents under the old Teſtament,
was no Ceremonie nor Type, I ſhall give theſe reaſons. 1. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,

in the times of the good Kings and Magiſtrates puniſhing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
&amp;c with the Civil ſword, let the Reader Conſult <hi>Aarons
Rod bloſſoming</hi> 1 Book 4. 5, 6, 7. chapt. That there was Hell
and eternall damnation under the old Law, as well as the new,
both before thoſe commands in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 17. were given, and
all along after, many places of Scripture ſhow, as <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 30.

that which <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> ſaith, that <hi>cutting off from his People

as well then as now, yea <hi>cutting off</hi> ſpoken of in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
in many places, means nothing elſe but caſting out of
the Church by excommunication, for full proofe of which I

to death the falſe Prophet, as thoſe for inflicting puniſhment
upon the Idolater and Blaſphemer were moral, and ſtill in
force under the Goſpel, yet theſe could not reach unto He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and falſe Teachers among us, <hi>at not being thoſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Idolaters, Blaſphemers,</hi> ſpoken of in the old Law. If
it can be proved that Hereticks are thoſe Blaſphemers, falſe
Prophets, Apoſtates, which <hi>Moſes</hi> commands to be killed,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114270:93"/>
then it ſhall be acknowledged Hereticks are to be killed; but
there is a large difference between a Heretick and ſuch a falſe
Prophet or Apoſtate, as the Presbyterians in their owne defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Hereticks make. A Heretick does not deny God
the Creator of heaven and earth, neither doth he teach that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gods are to be worſhipped; <hi>a Heretick does not deny the
name of Chriſt;</hi> a Heretick does not deny the word of God
which an Apoſtate does: So that the word of God may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as a weapon againſt Hereticks, which againſt an Apoſtate,
cannot. A Heretick therefore is not mentioned nor touched
in any one word of theſe Lawes: But if any will go about to
draw theſe Lawes unto an Heretick, that cannot be done by
the proper force of the words, but (as the Lawyers ſpeake)
<hi>per extenſionem latamque interpretationem,</hi> by ſtretching of them
and far fetched interpreation. And it would firſt be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, whether every Law does admit of ſuch extenſions, and
if not every one, which of them then does admit, and wherfore?
and whether in this Law there are thoſe things for which an
extenſion is to be made. By the falſe Prophet who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be put to death <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 5. was not meant every
Heretick or erroneous perſon, nor yet thoſe who taught or
publiſhed any falſe Doctrine though of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
but only thoſe who endeavoured to perſwade men to
the worſhip of a falſe god; &amp; that by affirming that they ſpake
by the inſpiration of ſome deitie, and that their ſayings were
to be eſteemed Oracles. What Doctrine it was which made
the Prophet or Teacher of it guilty of death, is expreſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the Law it ſelfe, and aſſerted to be this; <hi>Let us goe
after other gods,</hi> which thou haſt not known, and let us ſerve
them. And that the Law of God made againſt falſe Prophets
and worſhippers of falſe Gods, was not intended againſt thoſe
who otherwiſe held that the Law of God was to be kept, but
were infected with ſome other error, is ſufficiently evident
from hence, becauſe in former times among the Iewes, who
were affected with a vehement love and zeale towards their
law, Hereticks notwithſtanding were tolerated, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Sadduces. Theſe although the greateſt part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Rulers beleeved them to erre exceedingly, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114270:93"/>
they were not expelled the Citie, neither exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
from being Magiſtrates, or bearing any other Civill
office: yea they were not hindred from coming to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or the Synagogues. The Scribes and Phariſees alſo both
held and taught many moſt dangerous and erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;
yet were they alſo in great honor and eſteeme in
this Church and ſtate. And though our Saviour upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reaſoned againſt; yea and reproved them all for holding
and teaching theſe errors, and gave warning to take heed of
them; yet did he never charge this Church or State, or thoſe
that bare office in either, with ſin, or unfaithfulneſſe in their
places for not proceeding againſt them in regard of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
either by impriſonment or death. And yet we know
<hi>that the Zeale of his Fathers Houſe, did</hi> eat him up, and that he
attempted a reformation amongſt them; yea Chriſt did teach
and preſſe upon men, all, and all manner of duties from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
mercy, and faith, even to the paying tithe of Mint, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe,
and Cummin.</hi>

                  <p>Now unto theſe and other ſuch like, beſides ſome hints I
have already given upon the 14. Theſis, which may ſerve in
part for ſatisfaction to ſome of theſe evaſions, I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to mind theſe following Anſwers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there are other places of Scripture both of commands,
or elſe examples approved by God, concerning the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
with death or reſtraining by Civil power, (the laſt of
which makes good the point in hand againſt <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> and
other Libertines, as well as that of death) for other faults in
matters of Religion, beſides Blaſphemie, Apoſtaſie, and falſe
Prophecying in the ſenſe now alledged by <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> and his
Compeers, which theſe following inſtances prove Firſt in <hi>Deut.</hi>
13. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, that very chapter verſe 5. brought by <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtix</hi>
to prove only thoſe were to be put to death, <hi>who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to perſwade men to the worſhip of a falſe God; and that by
affirming, that they ſpake by the inſpiration of ſome deitie, and that
their ſayings were to be eſteemed by Oracles,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt
layes downe the contrary, giving a diſtinct Precept and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from that of the falſe Prophet, or dreamer of dreams,
who publickly and openly ſollicites to Apoſtaſie, concerning
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114270:94"/>
the killing of ſuch who in a hidden and clancular way ſeduce:
Tis obſerved by learned <hi>Junius</hi> in his Analytical explication
on <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. that there are two ſorts of Seducers to Apoſtaſie
commanded to be put to death, the one of ſuch who publickly
and boldly ſollicite, who are ſpoken of in the 5 firſt verſes, the
other of ſuch who ſecretly intice in verſe 6. and the five fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
Now however the falſe Prophet or dreamer of
dreames might pretend to ſpeak by the inſpiration of ſome
deitie, for which the 5 verſe of the 13. is quoted by <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtix,</hi>
yet the private enticers to Apoſtaſie, as the <hi>daughter,
the wife of the boſome, the Son,</hi> beſides that they are made a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſort from the Prophet and dreamer of dreams, and
thoſe ſix verſes from the ſixt to the twelfth containe a diſtinct
command from the five firſt verſes about falſe Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they give out ſigns or wonders to confirme their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the parties inſtanced in the text, being of daughters to
Fathers, Wifes to Husbands, &amp;c, were not likely ſo much as to
pretend to them the name of Prophets ſpeaking by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome deitie, but rather drawing by their neerneſſe of
relation, intimateneſſe of affection, opportunities of private
and conſtant converſe (which many phraſes in thoſe verſes, <hi>the
wife of the boſome, thy friend which is as thy owne ſoule, entiſe thee
ſecretly, thou ſhalt not cenſent unto him, neither ſhall thine eye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and ſuch like imply) and yet theſe are commanded to be put
to death, as well as thoſe Prophets who openly and bodily
gave out ſigns and wonders to confirme their being Prophets,
of which the Reader may be further ſatisfied, by reading <hi>Junius</hi>
his Analytical explication on <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part of the chapter ſhowes plainly, contrary to the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> and other Libertines, that others who
perſwade men to the worſhip of a falſe god beſides thoſe who
pretend themſelves Prophets, are to be killed, ſo in the latter
part of this chapter from v. 13. he layes downe how they are
to be put to death alſo that are guilty of Apoſtaſie, that have
ſuffered themſelves to be drawn away from the true worſhip of
God to other gods, who are ſo far from comming under the
notion of falſe Prophets, <hi>endeavouring to perſwade men to the
worſhip of a falſe God, and that by affirming they ſpake by the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114270:94"/>

falſe Prophet is to be ſtrangled to death, although he Prophecie in

he Prophecieth that which he hath not heard by propheticall viſion,
or who ſo hath heard the words of his fellow Prophet and ſaith
that his word was ſaid unto him, and he prophecieth thereby; hee
is a falſe Prophet, and is to be ſtrangled to death.</hi> And tis evident
by <hi>Jerem.</hi> 26. 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16. in the Prieſts and Prophets

and therefore to be put to death, for ſaying <hi>this houſe
ſhall bee like Shiloh, and this City ſhall be deſolate without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant;</hi>
Whereas <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſtill makes his defence, <hi>The Lord
ſent me to prophecie againſt this houſe, and againſt this City all
the words that yee have heard,</hi> that other falſe Prophets were to
be put to death, then thoſe who taught men to worſhip other

There is a great agreement and analogie made by the Holy-Ghoſt,

the Heatheniſh Apoſtaſie and Idoaltrie of ſtrange Gods under

God, by Images, Saints, and the beleeving of falſe Doctrines

and that by affirming they ſpake by Revelation and immediate

13. 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 20, 22? In a word I ſhall conclude this with
a paſſage out of * <hi>Beza De Haereticis a Magiſtratu puniendis,</hi>
brought by way of Anſwer to a like objection againſt <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
&amp;c, <hi>Thoſe Lawes are not now in force, becauſe there is no man
now a falſe Prophet, according to</hi> Moſes <hi>definition, that is, who
foretels any thing to come and teaches to worſhip other gods:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114270:100"/>
that the mind of the Law-giver is to be underſtood from
the cauſe of making the Law, <hi>Becauſe he hath ſpoken to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Lord your God: Now there are divers publick Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of this defection, of which although the Principall only, and
thoſe which moſt commonly fall out be named in the Laws, yet the
very reaſon of the Law is expreſſed in a univerſall forme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the general oúght to be in force againſt thoſe who doe fall from
the true religion and ſollicite others to defection, whom in a generall
word we call now Hereticks, not falſe Prophets or dreamers of dreams,
or Sacrificers to other gods: becauſe that thoſe out ward ceremonies
and thoſe gifts of Prophecie are ceaſed. But though they be ceaſed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
neither defection, nor the puniſhment of it is ceaſed.
Moreover I ſay, thoſe who interpret the holy Scripture wrongfully,
withdraw men from the true worſhip of God, and ſo perſwade them
to the worſhip of other gods. For tis neceſſary that all Doctrine
which ſpeaks of the worſhip of God, if it be not of God it proceeds
from the Devil; Therefore he that receives it intertains the Devil, and
he that perſwades the receiving it drawes away from God; For
Paul cals the Doctrines of forbidding meats and marriage the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the commands given by God either againſt
ſuch and ſuch ſins, or for puniſhing in ſuch and ſuch ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſtretching of the commands at all, or interpretations
at large, many things not named muſt neceſſarily be contained,
as under generals the particulars, as under one kind other
kinds of a higher nature, or of the like nature, as under the
male, the female alſo, and other ſuch, or elſe many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
received Rules given by Divines for interpretation
of the Decalogue and Scripture are to be rejected; Yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things that are evill and abominable are not forbidden in
the Law of God: There are many things may be inſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed in
out of the new Teſtament of which God ſhowes his diſlike,
which yet in the letter and particularly by name are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in any of the commands of the old Teſtament, as <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 26. with divers others that might be named; and there are
many abominations that have been, are, and may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
even of things againſt the light of nature that are neither
in the old Teſtament, nor new forbidden particularly; and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114270:101"/>
yet certainly theſe things are forbidden directly and properly
in the commandements, and the commandements are not
ſtretcht, nor wyre-drawn by thoſe who alledge ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
againſt ſuch Practiſes: If the Scriptures muſt ſet down
particularly by name all the kinds and degrees of evils, with
the particular manner and way of doing them, which the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature of man is capable of committing, and al particulars
of all kinds and manner of duties, with all particular caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
puniſhments, and all kinds and degrees of puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to all kind of offences that may fall out, and that both
in Civil and Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, with the particular way
and manner of proceeding in them all, I ſuppoſe ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of great volumes would not containe them all, but that
it might be ſaid in this caſe as tis <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. the laſt verſe of
the things which Ieſus did, <hi>that if they ſhould be written e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one the world it ſelfe could not containe the Books that ſhould
be written.</hi> And if there muſt not be an extenſion and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of commands, ſo as to hold ſuch commands and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture, forbid or enjoyne ſome things not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
named, how will <hi>Hagiom.</hi> prove many things practiſed by
Papiſts and Prelaticall men to be againſt the ſecond command
or againſt any command, as the making Croſſes for Religion,
Holy-Water, Saints, Reliques, bowing at the name of Jeſus,
Holy-Dayes, Surplices, Altar-Clothes, with a hundred other
Ceremouies and Inventions of men in the worſhip of God, are
theſe literally and by name forbidden in the ſecond command
or any other? and may not the Papiſts and Prelates in all
the texts of Scripture brought againſt their Wil-worſhip, and
Inventions of men, ſay the very ſame to <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> and
his fellowes, that <hi>Croſſes, Holy-Dayes, bowing at the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
&amp;c, <hi>are not mentioned nor touched in any one word of thoſe Laws
under the old Teſtament given againſt Idolatrie: But if any one will
goe about to draw theſe words unto their Croſſes, &amp;c, that cannot bee
done by the proper force of the words, but as Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ers ſpeake</hi> per ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſionem

and if not every one, which of them then does admit, and
wherefore, and whether in the ſecond commandement there are thoſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114270:101"/>
things for which an extenſion is to be made?</hi> Again, I deſire <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtix</hi>
and his compeers to reſolve me theſe queſtions, ſeeing
there muſt be no extenſion of that command in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 5.
nothing elſe commanded but what is in the letter of the Law,
Whether a falſe Propheteſſe that ſhould ariſe and <hi>endeavour to

as well as the falſe Prophet? and yet a Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into it? and yet the words of the Law are only the Oxe or the
Aſſe, and not a Horſe or Sheep. Whether that command
concerning the putting to death thoſe children that did curſe or
ſtrike their Parents, though it expreſſed not in the letter death
for killing of them, did not include much more death upon
thoſe who killed their Parents? and ſo I might inſtance in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<hi>that the Law of God made againſt falſe Prophets and worſhippers of
falſe Gods was not intended againſt thoſe who otherwiſe held the
Law of God was to be kept, but were infected with ſome error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in former times among the Jewes who were affected with a

were tolerated, and particularly the Sadduces, theſe were not
exempted from being Magiſtrates: The Scribes and Phariſees alſo
that taught many dangerous errors, yet were in great honor in this
Church and State,</hi> I anſwer, 1. <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> foundation upon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114270:102"/>
which he raiſes this argument is unfound, for the Scribes

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ees and others in place, in the time of tolerating the
Sadduces, Herodians and other Hereticks (which was in Chriſts
time) were not zealous of the Law of God, as is evident by
many of Chriſts Sermons reproving them for want of love
and zeale to the Law, and the true worſhip of God, <hi>Matth.</hi>
5. from the 19. verſe to the end of the chapter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.
from verſe 3. to the 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. from verſe 3. to the 29.
verſe. They were zealous indeed of the traditions of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and of their owne Superſtitions and Devices, but not of
the Law of God, they corrupted and tranſgreſſed the Lawes of
God by their traditions and hypocriſies, but had no true love
nor zeale to the Law nor the Jewiſh Religion, and therefore
no wonder they tolerated Sadduces, Herodians, &amp;c, but of
this point how religion was then mightily corrupted and all
things out of order, I have ſpoken before in <hi>p.</hi> 30. of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
and ſo wil not tautologize. 2. Can <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> upon ſecond
thoughts think the Practiſe of the Rulers of the Jewes and the
people that followed them in a time ſo deſparately corrupt as
that was, when Church and State haſtened to deſtruction, and
all things were amiſſe, a ſafe Ground for Chriſtian. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
to walke by, and not rather judge they did amiſſe in
that as well as in other things, and that their Practice is not
a probable Rule to be followed: I ſhall mind him of one
particular inſtanced in by himſelfe <hi>viz,</hi> their not hindring the
Sadduces and other Hereticks, <hi>from coming to the Temple or the
Synagogues,</hi> which if it were well done tis by this argument as
unlawful for the Church to cenſure her members with Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
cenſures for any Hereticall Tenets, as for the Civil
Magiſtrate to puniſh, and ſo all Church Cenſures for Hereſies
and falſe Doctrines are overthrown as well as civil; whereas I
took it for granted, Church cenſures in matters of Religion
had been Lawfull, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſpiritual weapon ſuitable, by their
owne confeſſion, for a ſpirituall evill Hereſie, and <hi>M. S.</hi> a good
Friend of <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> in anſwer to that Argument againſt
Toleration, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 20. yeelds it, ſaying, that's meant of Church
cenſures, but not of bodily outward puniſhment by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
and therefore I think the practiſe of the People and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114270:102"/>
their Rulers ſuffering Sadduces and all other Hereticks to be
no better argument for Juſtification of a Toleration, then their
practiſe of crucifying Chriſt a Juſtification of that. 3. Beſides
that all may ſee what you and your party aime at in ſpeaking of
the Phariſees and Saduces being in honour in the Jewiſh State
Magiſtrates and bearing civill offices, not a bare Toleration of
your conſciences, but that you may be in places of honour, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and profit: This gives us a cleare reaſon of the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Errors in thoſe times, namely that Scribes, Phariſees and
Saduces were in places of power and government, had a great
intereſt in Church and State, and therefore no wonder if they
would tolerate themſelves and their owne Opinions: can you
think it a good argument that Adulterers and theeves ought to
be tolerated, becauſe Adulterers and Theeves having power,
ſuffer ſuch to goe unpuniſhed: Or can you thinke it reaſon to
ſay many Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, being in places of Government
ſuffered Papiſts, Anabaptints, therefore tis the duty of the godly
Magiſtrate to ſuffer them and all other Hereticks: Pray Maſter
<hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> reſolve me this queſtion, ſeeing Scribes, Phariſees,
and ſuch like were Magiſtrates and in places of power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who ſhould puniſh Phariſees and Saduces for their Errors
and dangerous Opinions?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, as to that laſt clauſe that Chriſt did never charge
this Church or State, or thoſe that bore office in either with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in
or unfaithfulneſſe for not proceeding againſt the Sadduces,
Phariſees, &amp;c. in regard of their Errors, either by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or death, and yet Chriſt did teach and preſſe upon men
all and all manner of duties. I anſwer, Firſt, how is that proved
he never did: Can the Patrons of Toleration <hi>Minus Celſus Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
Hagiomaſtix,</hi> &amp;c make it follow by ſaying tis no where writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Goſpels, and therefore he never reproved them, can
they reaſon from the Scriptures negatively in matters of fact,
ſuch things never were, becauſe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are not ſpoken of? what

conſequentia,</hi> were not there many things that Chriſt did which
were not written, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. the laſt verſe? But if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
yes in ſome things, but not in matters of judgement,
righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſſe ſuch a weighty matter as this is made to be; I
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114270:103"/>
rejoyne that in many weighty matters of the Law and juſtice,
Chriſt either ſpoke not particularly of them, or if he did, they
are not written, neither can be found in the Goſpels more then
this of puniſhing Sadduces and other Hereticks in matter of
Religion: I might inſtance in many things unqueſtionably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
or commanded by God in the Morall Law, that are not
particularly ſpoken of in the Goſpels, which yet from hence
to reaſon againſt them wery vere bad Divinity. What inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
can be given of Chriſts giving any commands to thoſe in
place to puniſh for Murther, Adulterery, Theft, more then for
Idolatrie, Blaſphemie, Here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie? 2. <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> brings in the
Church again, as well as the State, ſurely he is for a Toleration
of all Hereſies, Blaſphemies, &amp;c, in the Church as well as the
State, to have no man puniſhed for his religion with any cenſure
of Admonition, Excommunication, or Non-Communion: In
his <hi>M. S.</hi> he was for ſpiritual cenſures, but in theſe 3. yeers
laſt paſt the man is well improved (belike) to reaſon againſt any
Church cenſure as well as State Puniſhment: And by the way
I deſire the Reader to obſerve whatever reaſon in the wiſedome
of God there might be, that nothing is ſet down in the Goſpels
of Chriſts charging the State with ſin for not proceeding againſt
the Sadduces, &amp;c, that cannot be the reaſon to ſhow the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes
of Magiſtrates puniſhing Hereticks, becauſe <hi>Hagiom.</hi>
confeſſes the ſame of the Church, that Chriſt charged not the
Church nor the Officers with ſin, for not proceeding againſt
the Sadduces, and yet I ſuppoſe <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> will not openly
profeſſe tis a good Argument that no Church cenſures may be
uſed againſt any Heretick; however I am ſure many of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers
in handling the queſtion diſtinguiſh of a Toleration and
cenſures, granting Eccleſiaſtical cenſures though denying Civil,
And I am ſure if Chriſts never charging the church nor thoſe that
bore office in her with ſin, for not proceeding againſt the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
be no good argument to take away all Church cenſures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it to lay waſt all Magiſtrates puniſhing in ſuch caſes. 3.
Chriſt did to the Scribes, Phariſees &amp; Sadduces ſpeak and reaſon
againſt their errors, yea reproved and threatned them for thoſe
errors, which alſo is granted by <hi>Hagiomaſtix,</hi> in doing of which
he did equivalently and really preſſe upon them the ſuppreſſing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114270:103"/>
and puniſhing of Hereſies in perſons under their power, whilſt
he ſpake to men in Authoritie and denounced the judgements
of God becauſe of them: He that preaches to a Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Idolatrie and ſhowes the evils that will come upon a
King and his Kingdome for it, preaches to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
Idolatrie, though he doe not particularly in expreſſe
words call upon him not to ſuffer any man to practice Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
and therefore Chriſt ſpeaking to the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
the Rulers and Elders, that knew the Laws of God,
how Magiſtrates in <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to puniſh falſe Teachers, in
ſpeaking ſo againſt falſe Prophets, Hereticks and Sectaries,
as Sadduces, &amp;c, that was a charging them (ſuch a thing being
ſpoken to ſuch men) to doe their duties againſt them, which
by the Law was more then if private perſons, and being ſpoken
to <hi>qua</hi> ſuch, as Scribes, &amp;c, was a commanding them according
to their places to proceed againſt them: For tis a rule among
Divines that in many things recorded in Scriptures, which
are delivered only in common and in general, they are to be
taken by every one according to their relations and places,
by the Magiſtrates according to their relation, the Miniſters
according to theirs, and the People according to their Sphere,
of which many inſtances may be given in the new Teſtament.
4. Suppoſing it could be proved, Chriſt never reproved the
Jewiſh Church and State for ſuffering the Sadduces, &amp;c, yet it
followes not Magiſtrates therefore ſhould tolerate Hereticks,
and Sectaries, and that both, becauſe Gods declaration of
his mind in other parts of Scripture, though not in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is a ſufficient, as alſo becauſe there might be ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
reaſons proper to the Iewiſh State, as that Chriſt
ſaw the Iewiſh State and Magiſtracie it ſelfe that then was
to be leavened and corrupted with thoſe errors and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
to be either Sadduces, Phariſees, Scribes, Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and ſuch like, ſo that to have ſpoken againſt Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and for puniſhing Sadduces, &amp;c had been to have
ſpoken to the State, not to have ſuffered it ſelfe, as if one
ſhould preach to the Parliament now, not to tolerate but
to puniſh themſelves: So was it for Chriſt to have urged
thoſe commands in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. &amp;c, and thoſe examples of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114270:104"/>
                     <hi>Ioſiah, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c upon the Iewiſh State then. 2. That
in the times of Chriſts preaching, the Civil Power of the
Common-Wealth of the Jewes, was much weakned, if not
wholly taken away from them by the Romans, of which I have
ſpoken ſomething before <hi>page</hi> 30. and doe now adde, that the
Iewes had no power at all of capitall puniſhments then, and
therefore to what end ſhould Chriſt charge them with thoſe
Lawes of putting falſe Prophets &amp;c, to death, for full proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. Chriſt knew that Church and Common-wealth
were to be certainly ſhortly diſſolved, the Chriſtian Church
to be ſet up, and though he warned the People of thoſe errors
and wayes, and denounced the judgements of God againſt
them, yet becauſe he knew the purpoſe of God was to deſtroy
the Iewiſh Common-wealth, he might not ſpeake for that
and the other Reaſons forenamed to the Magiſtrates, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

chapter ſhows this 13. chap. is not all one commandement but
there are three diſtinct commands in this chapter, the firſt of
the falſe Prophet publickly teaching Apoſtaſie in the five firſt
verſes, the ſecond of the Clandeſtine Seducer, in the ſix ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
following, the third of a publick defection of a whole Citie:
which being obſerved &amp; wel conſidered, beſides what I have ſaid
already to <hi>Hagiomaſtixs</hi> anſwer that the command in <hi>Deut. 13.
concerning the putting of falſe Prophets and Seducers to death, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bind, becauſe then whole Cities muſt be deſtroyed, Cattel, &amp;c,</hi>

part of the chapter upon which he vapors ſo, is a <hi>diſtinct
command quite another thing,</hi> from that in the firſt verſe to the

fallacie to confound Lawes which are diſtinct, to ſpeak all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
of that 13. chapt. as one Law and command (for ſo he
does <hi>page</hi> 48. 47. make them all one) <hi>fallacia compoſitionis</hi> is

which God hath made diſtinct; and therefore the one
command may be in force, and wee <hi>neither add, nor diminiſh

caſes (of which I ſhall ſpeak more preſently) and among many
differences that might be obſerved between the two former
commands in the firſt 11. verſes and this about a Citie, this is

there be no particular command nor example a new

are ſo far from giving any diſpenſation or Libertie, that quite

theſe reaſons, 1. That Chriſt and the Apoſtles all along in the

old Teſtament <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſtill referring the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all Controverſies of Faith and Practice to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the old Teſtament, as is evident by theſe places, <hi>Luk.</hi>
16. 29. <hi>John 5. 39. Rom. 15. 4. 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. 2 Pet.</hi>
1. 19. <hi>cum multis aliis</hi> which are all underſtood of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the old Teſtament, as beſides many things in thoſe
texts ſhowing as much, no Scriptures of the new Teſtament,
being then extant, when Chriſt gave thoſe exhortations to
<hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and when <hi>Timothy</hi> was a child, of which
Scripture the Apoſtle ſpeaks, which <hi>Timothy</hi> learned of a child,
as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well expounds: Now that was the Scripture
of the old Teſtament, becauſe the new was not as yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to writing, then when <hi>Timothie</hi> was a child: Nay further
all the texts by way of Scripture proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e brought in the new
Teſtament to prove any thing in matter of faith and manners
are all quoted out of the old Teſtament, and not the new,
whereupon wee ſee how frequently <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pſalms, and
Prophets are cited by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but to my beſt
remembrance, I doe not find in all the new Teſtament any
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:114270:107"/>
place of Scripture brought to prove any thing from the new
Teſtament, but that one paſſage out of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.
15, 16. 2. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. ſaith <hi>All Scripture
is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
for Correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe:</hi> Now if all
Scripture be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, then the Scripture of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſo to, and as given by inſpiration is with all reverence
to be acknowledged and received by Chriſtians: Againe if
all Scripture be <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for reproofe, for Correction,
for inſtruction of righteouſneſſe,</hi> therefore Doctrines of faith and
Practiſes of life may be profitably fetched from thence, and
when things are laid downe in the old Teſtament, they are
commanded in the Scriptures, (they being the Scriptures too)
although not mentioned in the new: But who ſo deſires to be
further ſatisfied in this queſtion of the Scripture of the old
Teſtament being of the ſame Authoritie with Chriſtians as
that of the new, let him conſult <hi>Bullingers</hi> Books againſt the
Anabaptiſts <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 4. 5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Spanhemius</hi> his Diſputations

Chriſtiana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, every command of God made knowne in the old
Teſtament, and never afterwards repealed nor revoked by him;
nor expiring in the nature of it, is perpetual and in force:
whatever God once commands til he declares either particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
that tis not his will ſuch a Law ſhould any longer bind,
or at leaſt generally in equivalencie, obliges: So that tis no
good argument, to ſay againſt a Practice, as long as tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the old, this cannot be proved out of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
and therefore may not be done, but rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wee may inferre, that the ſilence of the new Teſtament
concerning a Law expreſly and clearly delivered in the old
Teſtament, is a confirmation rather then an abrogation of it
or an intimation that it is expired. There are many particulars
might be inſtanced in, ſome expreſſely commanded, and others
forbidden in the old Teſtament, which are not ſpoken of at all
in the new Teſtament (unleſſe in general) that yet are held
by Orthodox Divines, and I ſuppoſe by <hi>Hagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſome other Malefactors, with divers others that might be

were no new Teſtament proofes for the Magiſtrates puniſhing
Apoſtates, Blaſphemers, &amp;c. yet the old Teſtament affording
ſuch a <hi>cloud of witneſſes</hi> is teſtimony abundant, eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what I have at large proved in divers pages of the
laſt Theſis, concerning the nature of thoſe commands and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
recorded in the old Teſtament, and indeed conſidering
how clearly, largely, and importunately the Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and dutie in puniſhing in matters of Religion is ſet down
and preſſed by the Holy-Ghoſt in the old Teſtament, it had
been no wonder if nothing had been ſaid of the new, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
urging in the old ſerving for a reaſon of ſilence in the new.

ſhall referre the Reader thither where he ſhall find many
grounds brought to prove it, extracting only one paſſge out
<hi rend="margQuotes">of the Book. Whatſoever Law in once delivered to the
Church, and accordingly recorded in the Law Booke the
holy Scriptures even of the old Teſtament, whoſoever would
claim exemption from it whether particular Perſon or
Church, muſt produce ſome what to prove that that Law is
now (under the Goſpel) repealed, or at leaſt expired, more
then bare ſaying that it is no longer in force. It is ſo in the
ſtatute Law of our Kingdome (and of all Kingdomes) if a
man can alledge for himſelfe in point of Right or Priviledge
(or the Kings Councell for the Kings Rights and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives)
any ſtatute that was once made, it ſtands good for all
purpoſes, unleſſe they who would gainſay it, can alledge
and prove that ſuch a Statute is out of date by expiration or
repeale: So that the proofe lies originally upon the refuſer
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114270:108"/>
of the Law, and they that would maintaine it and urge it,
need plead nothing more then the enacting of it once, till the
abrogation of it can be verified; and if it be ſo in the Statutes
of men, and the poſitive Lawes of Kingdomes, much more in
thoſe of God, whoſe Authority in unqueſtionably more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
and whoſe wiſedome, Holineſſe, Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
is infinitely beyond that of all Princes and States in the
world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Tis granted Princes and Magiſtrates under the old Law
before Chriſts comming, had a coercive power in matters of
Religion, and did puniſh Blaſphemers, &amp;c Now 1. ſeeing they
long had it, can any proofe be brought how and upon what
occaſion it was taken from them? can any man ſhew any text
out of the new Teſtament where Chriſt and his Apoſtles took
away this power from Princes, or declared that however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the old, Seducers and falſe Prophets were to be dealt
with by the Civil powers, yet not under the new, but only
with the word of God? <hi>Bullinger</hi> in his fifth Book againſt the
Anabaptiſts chapter 3. <hi>page</hi> 169. pleading for Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in matters of Religion, ſpeaks thus to them. <hi>Are Princes and
Magiſtrates of the new Teſtament endorred with leſſe Spirit and
power then thoſe of the old? Or in what place have Chriſt and
his Apoſtles removed Chriſtians Princes from this power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates?</hi>
Whatever reaſons or grounds any way or in any kind
there were under the old for this power of Magiſtrates, the very
ſame remaine now, were errors and Hereſies then deadly and
damnable, ſo they are now? were they then ſpreading as a
Gangrene and corrupting many ſo they do now? were they then
hateful to God? ſo they are ſtill: were falſe Teachers in thoſe
times unreaſonable, perverſe obſtinate not to be convinced
by words? behold they are as froward and deſparate in theſe;

they are no way looſers but gainers by Chriſts comming:
Chriſts Kingdome is not of this world, it alters not the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Preeminence God once gave to them as Kings and
Magiſtrates. Laſtly, If Magiſtrates under the new Teſtament,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114270:109"/>
ſhould have this power taken from them, the Church of God
ſhould be in a farre worſe condition and more uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

ſhould loſe a great helpe it ſometimes enjoyned: neither can

                  <p>Fourthly God is unchangeable, the Covenant of life under
the old and new Teſtament is one and the ſame for the eſſence
and ſubſtance, as our Divines ſhow againſt the Socinians,
Antinomians, Anabaptiſts; and the rule of righteouſneſſe
and holineſſe is the ſame under the new, that it was under the
old, and therefore God hating corruptions of Religion ſo as
to command his Vice-gerents to puniſh them then, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

and ſuppreſſing the diſhonors of God, ruine of ſouls by his
ſword be altered and changed by God in the times of the
Goſpel, then that power of puniſhment was either truely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial

<hi rend="margQuotes">Ground of Chriſts comming. As for that they alledge

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114270:112"/>
his paſſion, tis a weak one and injurious unto the comming
and death of Chriſt, for he appeared that he might deſtroy
the workes of the Devil; this makes our Saviour Chriſt to
build againe that Kingdome of ſin which he hath deſtroyed.
For when in common reaſon and by the manifeſt word of
God the Lord giveth this bleſſing unto the puniſhment of
ſuch greivous offenders by death, that others not only which
ſee, but which heare of them, have the bridle of fear put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

needs follow that whoſoever maketh our Saviour Chriſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this looſeneſſe in puniſhing ſuch offenders, maketh him
forthwith to looſe the bridle whereby others are afraid from
running into wickedneſſe, and what is this but to make
Chriſt a Troubler of Common-wealths: Beſides if Chriſt by
his comming looſed theſe civil puniſhments and purchaſed
this grace of his Father for Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Hereticks,
that they ſhould eſcape civil puniſhments which the Law of
God adjudged them to, how comes it to paſſe that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

pardon he obtained for us, did never make mention of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing
of theſe puniſhments: If Chriſt had obtained this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
it was worth the Preaching, and therefore unleſſe they
can ſhow out of the writings of the Apoſtles to warrant this
Sanctuary, which they would build to the ſupport of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
Hereticks, that followes that the Apoſtles have
not anſwered the truſt committed to them, but in that the

againſt the Word of God, but they denied the minor that they
