         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ned in <hi>London,</hi> that begining at <hi>Aldgate,</hi> it burnt down Houſes and Churches all the way to <hi>Ludgate;</hi> together with the ſtately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and the ſtrong Caſtle called the Palatine Tower, which ſtood on the Weſt part of the City towards the little River of <hi>Fleet,</hi> the Stones of which Caſtle were afterwards employed for the reedifying of S. <hi>Pauls;</hi> in the place where that Old Fabrick ſtood, <hi>Robert Kilwarby</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> erected that Houſe of <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> called by the name of <hi>Black-Friers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, in ſeveral places of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> happened many grievous Fires: For firſt, the City of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> with the principal Monaſtery (a ſtately Building) was wholly burnt down to the ground. Next, in <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Weſtcheap</hi> to <hi>Aldgate</hi> a long tract of Buildings was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Fire. Alſo <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> were wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed even in the Kings preſence. Then <hi>Wincheſter, Bath, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Lincoln, Peterborough,</hi> and other places did alſo partake of this calamity; that there could be no charging the Fire with any partiality.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1135. the Firſt Year of the Reign of King <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> a Fire began in the houſe of one <hi>Ailward,</hi> near unto <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Stone,</hi> which conſumed all Eaſtward to <hi>Aldgate;</hi> in which Fire the Priory of the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> was burnt; and Weſtward to S. <hi>Erkenwalds</hi> Shrine in <hi>S. Pauls. Now it plainly appears by the three foregoing Relations, that the greateſt part of the City of</hi> London <hi>in the ſpace of Fifty Years was three times conſumed by Fire: the greateſt deſtruction that ever happened to the ſaid City before or ſince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1171. the whole City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was almoſt burnt. Alſo about the Year 1250. there happened another great Fire in the ſame place, which laid level with the ground the Church of S. <hi>Mildred,</hi> with the greateſt part of the City.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1189, the whole City of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and the Abby, with all the Houſes belonging to the Friers Minors was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Fire.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1293. a great part of the Town of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> with the Church of our Lady was burnt.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1299. by a ſudden and lamentable Fire the Kings Palace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with all the rich Furniture and Monaſtery adjoyning, was wholly conſumed with Fire. In the ſame Year the Monaſtery in <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was likewiſe burnt.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1406. the Town of <hi>Royſton</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> (a fair large Market-town) was wholly burnt.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1463. the Minſter of <hi>York,</hi> one of the faireſt and ſtatelieſt Fabricks in <hi>Europe,</hi> was burnt; alſo <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 20. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1485. a great Fire happened in <hi>Breadſtreet London,</hi> which burnt down ſeveral whole Streets, and diverſe Churches.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1561. the Spire of the Cathedral Church of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> being 520 Foot from the ground, and 260 from the ſquare Steeple where it was placed, and was made of wooden mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, but covered with Lead, was with Lightning burnt down, together with the Roofs of that large Church, and that within the ſpace of five hours: the Roofs were afterward reedified, but not the Spire.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 13 of <hi>February</hi> 1633. a Fire began in the houſe of one Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi> (at the hither end of <hi>London-Bridg</hi>) a Needlemaker, between the hours of 11 and 12, towards mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, which burnt down in both ſides the way from S. <hi>Magnus</hi> to the firſt open place: where 42 houſes with the greateſt part of the Wares, Goods, and rich furniture on them, were devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Raging Element before 8 a clock next morning.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the Second of <hi>September</hi> this preſent Year 1666. about one a clock in the morning, there happened a ſad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Fire in <hi>Pudding-Lane</hi> near <hi>New Fiſh-ſtreet,</hi> which fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in a part of the City ſo cloſe built with wooden houſes, propagated it ſelf ſo far before day with ſuch violence, that it bred ſuch diſtraction and aſtoniſhment in the Inhabitants and Neighbours, that care was not taken to ſtop the further diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it by pulling down houſes as ought to have been, ſo that this grievous Fire in a ſhort time became too big to be maſtered by any Engins or working near it; and being fomented by the hand of God in a violent Eaſterly wind, which kept it burning in ſuch a raging manner all Sunday and Sunday-night, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf by Monday morning up <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet</hi> to <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-ſtreet,</hi> and to S. <hi>Swithins</hi> Church in <hi>Canon-ſtreet,</hi> and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from <hi>Canon-ſtreet</hi> to the Water-ſide as far as the <hi>Three Cranes in the Vintry,</hi> and Eaſtward beyond <hi>Billinſgate.</hi> The greatneſs and vaſtneſs of the Fire was ſuch, that made the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and diſtracted people take care onely to preſerve their own goods, and ſecure every man his particular concerns, making but ſlender attempts to extinguiſh the Flame. In fine, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all Monday and Tueſday with ſuch impetuoſity, that it had, at 10 of the clock on Tueſday-night, Weſtward conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Houſes and Churches all the way to S. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> Church in <hi>Fleetſtreet;</hi> at which time by the favor of God the wind ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that night by the vigilancy, induſtry, and indefatigable pains of His Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs, calling upon all people, and encouraging them by their perſonal aſſiſtances, a ſtop was put to the Fire in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Inner Temple</hi> and <hi>Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Lane,</hi> at <hi>Holborn-Bridg, Pie-Corner, Alderſgate, Cripplegate,</hi> near the lower end of <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> at the end of <hi>Baſinghall-ſtreet,</hi> by the <hi>Poſtern,</hi> at the upper end of <hi>Biſhopſgate-street,</hi> and <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet,</hi> at the Standard in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> at the Church in <hi>Fanchurch-ſtreet,</hi> near Cloathworkers-Hall in <hi>Mincing-Lane,</hi> at the middle of <hi>Mark-Lane,</hi> and at the <hi>Tower-Dock.</hi> But on Wedneſday-night it ſuddenly brake out afreſh in the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> which happened (as is ſuppoſed) by flakes of fire falling into the gutters of the Buildings: His Royal Highneſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon fortunately watching there that night, by his care, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, great labour, and ſeaſonable commands for the blowing up with Gun-powder ſome of the ſaid Buildings, it was moſt happily before day extinguiſhed, after it had laid level with the ground, <hi>Tanfield</hi>-Court, <hi>Parſons</hi>-Court, and the Buildings in the Church-yard, and done ſome little damage to the Church and Hall.</p>
