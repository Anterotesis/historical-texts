            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The manifest of <hi>Sir Job Harby Knight,</hi> unto all perſons, of Honour, who are piouſly inclined to hear, and Commiſerate the oppreſſed, and eſpecially unto thoſe patient Creditors, who did formerly lend their monies, upon the ſecurity of <hi>Sir Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Dawes, Sir John Jacob, Sir Nicholas Criſpe, Sir John Nulls,</hi> and himſelf; when he, was unfortunately, made one of the farmers of the cuſtomes for three years, and did enjoy them onely two of the ſaid three yeers, they being forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the third year before they had paid back thoſe monies, which were taken up at interest for that ſervice, and for the payment of their fine to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He publiſher of this enſuing remonſtrance, doth deſire, that it may not ſeem impertinent, nor diſpleaſing unto any of you, that one of your debitors doth take the boldnes to declare, that he did not come into the cuſtoms, with any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter intent, nor with the leaſt inclination, to defraud you nor any of you, but with a conſtant reſolution, to deal juſtly with you, &amp; with al men; nor did he foreſee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117735:3"/>
ſuch a ſudden ruin, to fall upon him, for his receiving thoſe Cuſtoms two years, which himſelf, as a merchant had paid for 40 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Neither did he after the diſaſter was unexpectedly faln upon him, come to priſon (as ſome perſons have moſt unworthily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged) to deceive you or any of you; But did go on paying, as long, as he was able, his full ſhare of ſuch monies as were called in; even to the value, of above thirty thouſand pounds, as will appear by the ſequell of this (to me) ſad ſtory; being out of purſe for the ſaid two years Farms, above eight thouſand pounds, more then any of his afore named partners, and that before he ſubmitted his perſon to impriſonment, which was in <hi>November</hi> 1646. when he could no longer enjoy his liberty, unleſſe he would have diſhoneſtly layd a debt of one thouſand pounds with intereſt upon his friends that bayled him; for at that very time, when the Execution was laid upon him ſingly by Maſter <hi>Squire</hi> deceaſed (being done with the privity; and (as he believeth) at the inſtance of Sir <hi>John Nulls;</hi> he ſent ſome friends unto the ſaid Sir <hi>John Nulls,</hi> and unto Sir <hi>John Jacob,</hi> to intreat each of them to pay one third part of the debt, thoſe friends offering to pay the other third part for diſcharge of the ſaid execution: the ſaid Sir <hi>John Jacob,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Nulls,</hi> did both of them poſitively refuſe the ſame, although they knew, there was then due unto me from that very accompt above 8000 pounds all the debts ſatisfied; The narrative of which their unjuſt proceeding with me, I had then prepared with intent to publiſh the ſame, But that I was by ſome friends diſſwaded, who did rationally adviſe me rather to ſuffer for a ſeaſon, then to fall out amongſt our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had obteined relief for the great debt of three hundred thouſand and odd pounds, owing unto Sir <hi>Paul Pynder</hi> and us, by the late King; for theſe conſiderations, and being diſabled to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any part of mine own means, I have endured impriſonment three years and a half, with aſmuch hardſhip ſcandall, and diſgrace, as if the debt had been properly mine own; But now that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of my eſtate is conſumed for the payment of other mens debts; And that I daily undergo ſuits, and reproaches, and (which is worſt of all) am continually ſlandered, as one that deteyneth thoſe effects which ſhould ſatisfie you, I ſay, having hitherto ſmothered my grief, and even wearied out mine own patience, finding no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as yet from thoſe above us, neither juſtice nor equity amongſt my ſaid parners; and being, in all probability at the brinck of my grave, aged above 70 years; I have thought it requiſite for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117735:3"/>
the vindication of mine own integrity; for the diſcovering unto you that are Creditors; upon whom you may juſtly, and ſecurely lay your debts; and for the inſtructing my wife and poſterity, what is become of my eſtate, and whom to purſue for the ſame, when I ſhall be no more; I have, I ſay, thought upon this expedient in my plain manner to publiſh the truth in print; rather then by Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a ſuite in Law to protract your ſatisfaction, and to bring my ſelf to a morſell of bread.</p>
            <p>And that you may not conceive that this diſcourſe of mine is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken raſhly, or groundleſly, I muſt crave leave, to acquaint you, that I have uſed all the friendly means I could think upon, for the continuance of a right underſtanding twixt my ſad parners and my ſelf, yea beſeeching them (as if I ſhould have begged for life) to finiſh the accompts amongſt themſelves; or to permit ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned knowing perſons to examine them, to the end we might equally and juſtly joyn together, and proportionally ſatisfie you that are Creditors to the uttermoſt of our Abilities; And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have ſolicited them, not ſo few as one hundred times; by word of mouth, by letters, by friends, by ſtrangers, yea even by ſome of your ſelves; And at laſt by declaring unto them, that I might not (without robbing my ſelf and poſterity) forbear them any longer. But all in vain, nothing will prevail; they are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, And it ſeems fully bent totally to ruin me and my family, and to give a mortall wound unto my reputation, which is as dear unto me as my life; I am farther to beg your patience, to read the hiſtoricall parts of the moſt materiall paſſages of our engagements in this (to me) fatall Cuſtome buſineſſes, as they ſtand in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter book, and in ſeverall accompts, drawn up by the ſecretary, book-keepers, and accomptants, ſome of them having near relation to the Treaſurer, Sir <hi>John Nulls;</hi> who is and hath been the chief cauſe you have not been ſatisfied long ſince, as you will diſcern very plainly by the ſequell. For the more clear demonſtration, that what I affirm is really and punctually true; I beſeech you obſerve and weigh, theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To invite and intice me to joyn in taking the Cuſtomes, there was an inſtrument in writing, brought to me, ſigned by thoſe who made the contract for the farms, with the late King, (and the Lord Treaſurer) wherein I was named to be the Treaſurer, which place if I had ſupplyed; there had not been at this day one penny owing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117735:4"/>
to any of you; for aſſoon as the farms were ſetled upon us, and that I had advanced twenty thouſand eight hundred &amp; odd pounds in ready money for 7 ½ ſhares of the ſaid farms, and that the deeds of partnerſhip were ſigned and ſealed, the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> who was the chief undertaker, and had eight ſhares of the ſaid farmes, addreſſed himſelf unto me, to aſſiſt him with greater ſums of money, then I was willing to ſtand engaged for: when I did plainly and poſitively refuſe him; conceiving that the payment of mine own ſhares, and the finding money for the Credible performance of the joynt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, would be work ſufficient for ſuch a Treaſurer, as intended to deal ſafely for himſelf, and juſtly with all men, that ſhould lend their moneys; The ſaid Lord <hi>Goring</hi> taking ill my refuſal, ſeeks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us for one to ſerve his turn, and at laſt prevailed with Mr. <hi>Nulls</hi> (now Sir <hi>John</hi>) to promiſe the ſaid Lord his aſſiſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally to make him treaſurer, which the L. <hi>Goring</hi> did perform, &amp; did put me from that very place which firſt induced me to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Farmes: and this was effected the third day of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1638 at the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> houſe in <hi>Tower-ſtreet;</hi> At which time, if I could have had my twenty thouſand pounds again, &amp; have bin diſengaged, I had withdrawn my ſelf and bin freed of the great preſſures I have ſince undergone, but God had nor ſo appointed; (I was caught for want of judgment, or foreſight) and therefore was author of mine own wo: The ſaid Maſter <hi>Nulls</hi> (now sir <hi>John</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo choſen treaſurer, and 500. <abbr>li</abbr> 
               <hi>per ann.</hi> allowed him for his intended good ſervice, he being to give ſecurity for ten thouſand pounds, to keep exact accompts, &amp; deliver them unto the Farmers at all times upon demand; and to pay no conſiderable ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but by order and direction of the ſaid Farmers, or three or more of them; the very ſame day were the receipts divided; and the Lord <hi>Goring</hi> was to have the ſubſidy of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and impoſt of Currants in <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Out ports,</hi> &amp;c. The treaſurer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, began to lay about him, and under colour of being provided of money for the joynt ſervice, he taketh up at intereſt all the money he could Compaſſe, that is to ſay, thirty thouſand pounds more then there was any joynt occaſion to uſe, and did make particular uſe thereof for the reimburſing himſelf of what money he had formerly lent the Lord <hi>Goring</hi> for his own ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter end as a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

without any ſufficient warrant; ſince I am ſure he cannot ſhew my hand to any ſuch warrant, though my ſhare was the greateſt next unto the Lord <hi>Gorings;</hi> neither was there left any latitude in our articles of agreement to lend any money at al, much leſs ſuch vaſt ſums, unto a noble man of a fortune ſo perplexed, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was underſtood to be at that time; the orders themſelves ſpeaking no ſuch language as you may diſcern by the copie of them drawn out of the Regiſter Book kept by him that was ſecretary to the Farmers, the originall, (by Gods providence) is now in my poſſeſſion, and ready to be ſhewed unto any perſon that ſhal deſire to be ſatisfied in that particular, the dates of the ſaid orders, and the expreſſions do follow <hi>verbatim.</hi>

            <p>Since my ſending in this accompt, I have many times importuned them that we may fairly and friendly ſettle all our differences and go joyntly on, hand in hand to the ſatisfaction of our Creditors, and this done by word of mouth, by ſeveral meſſages unto Sir <hi>John Jacob,</hi> Sir <hi>John Nuls</hi> &amp;c. having written ſeveral times unto them unto that purpoſe; the Copy of my laſt is hereunto annected but never anſwered, and I think never will be; the letter follweth.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I take it this is the firſt time, that (after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) I did ever miſſe to wait upon you, for the ſettlement of this accompt for the two years Farms; And were it not that my attendance before a Committee in Parliament, doth now hinder me, I ſhould inſtead of theſe lines, have been perſonally with you. Although I muſt confeſſe, ſuch is my apprehenſion, that all our meetings, yea, and our purſuite for ſatisfaction of the great debt Owing unto us, will be to very little purpoſe, unleſſe we either come reſolved to do as we would be done unto; Or elſe admit of ſome unconcerned knowing perſons to decide matters in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between us: and indeed how can we expect to have juſtice done unto us upon our petitions, ſo long as we are not enclined to deal equally and juſtly one with another. For my part I am ſenſible, and the courſe of nature teacheth me, that it will not be long, before I muſt render accompt of my ſtewardſhip, even unto the great Judge of all the world; Before whom I do now profeſſe, that I would not willingly wrong the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts amongſt us, nor any of you in particular, no not, if by my ſo doing I might gain all your eſtates; In purſuance whereof I affirm, that if by errour or miſtake, I have claimed any thing, or ſhall demand that which doth not juſtly belong unto me; Let it be made apparent wherein any ſuch omiſſion or miſtake of mine is, or may be; and it ſhall be rectified inſtantly to the utter moſt farthing, both of principal and intereſt, yea, though I ſhould be a loſer thereby. It is not meeting by our ſelves alone, nor Conteſtations about Punctillo's, or Circumſtances, that will make a juſt end of our accompts, no nor ever ſettle any peace amongſt us; ſuch proceedings will rather make the breach wider; We have had words more then enough already, and all to no purpoſe; It is

action muſt do our work, that is, to ſet down juſtly in writing the true ſtate of this accompts, which may moſt eaſily be effected in a few dayes, nay in a few hours, by the Treaſurer, and by him that kept the book of accompts; and have had ſufficient ſallary for their pains, if their wills be ſutable to their abilities; the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work lying readily before them, in their own cuſtodie, ſo as if they two will ſpend together but half ſo much time, as we have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually and fruitleſſely ſpent at any one of our meetings, there may be more done in that ſhort ſpace, then we have done in all our impertinent and confuſed conferences.</p>
            <p>And whereas that inconſiderate order of the 30 of September 1641. is Conceived to thwart thoſe deeds under our hands and ſeals for the equal diviſion of principal and profit upon the Farmes; groundleſſely inferring that the diviſion then made was as well upon the ſtock, as upon, the ſuppoſed gain; It doth contrarily and plainly appeare that at the time when this order was made; none of you there had one peny of principal ſtock remaining undivided, each of you having had his whole principal before; onely Sir <hi>Abraham dawes</hi> was a Crediror; &amp; my ſelf for ſo many wine Merchants bonds as were then known to be deſperate, and were left in my hands as part of my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal; how ever that very order ſo much inſiſted upon, doth ſpeake plainly, that the ſaid diviſion ſhould be equally made, and that who hath more then his proportion, ſhould pay preſently unto the other that ſhould come ſhort, ſo that every thing might be juſtly ſtated and cleared; and withal, that if the remainder of the ſtock ſhould not come in to ſatisfie the debts, every one ſhould rateabl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This was my tenent at the firſt, and God willing ſhall be whileſt breath is in my body. Onely this I adde, that without ſome ſettlement of the accompts between us; I ſhall not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to aſſiſt you at all neither in payment of the old debts, nor with any ſupply towards the procuring of ſatisfaction for the great debt due unto us from the late King: but if you will pleaſe to order the juſt liquidation of the ſaid accompts (though my condition be the pooreſt amongſt you) I ſhall hope to finde friends ſo as to ſatisfie my full proportion of what ſum ſoever ſhall be concluded between the creditors aſwell for the two years as the contracted farmes, So wiſhing friendſhip, and praying God to direct you and me for the beſt, I take leave and reſt</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That you will ſerioſly obſerve theſe particulars,</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the debts owing unto you for the two years farmes, is but 20000. <abbr>li</abbr> at the moſt; ſecondly, that the very ſame accompt ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me twelve thouſand pounds, thirdly, that for ſome of thoſe debts (by the Art of Sir <hi>John Nulls</hi>) I have lain priſoner three years, and a half; fourthly, that the ſaid Sir <hi>John Nulls</hi> as treaſurer did take up at intereſt and lent more of theſe monyes without any ſufficient warrant then would have paid all theſe debts unto you and me, and moreover doth keep in his hands, bonds, and ſecurity, to a far greater value, although he be tyed in equity, and by the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers joynt order, with his own conſent to be the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and had the receipts of Tobacco, and Currants for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity; he having loſt nothing by the ſaid Farmes, but hath clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gained thereby, 7 or 8000. <abbr>li</abbr> And is beſt able to pay the ſaid debts; fiftly, Sir <hi>John Jacob</hi> doth owe me upon that ſcore 2200. <abbr>li</abbr> with intereſt ever ſince <hi>Janna.</hi> 1641 and never payd me, one peny principal nor intereſt; howbeit theſe two perſons have made it all their work to keepe me priſoner 3 ½ years, for thoſe very debts which properly belong to themſelves.</p>
            <p>In tender Conſideration of the premiſes, and for that all my ſaid partners in the two years farmes, are gainers, and my ſelf onely a great loſer; you will pleaſe, that I may be no further proſecuted for thoſe debts belonging thereunto; but that I may be ſet at liberty, to joyn with you as a Creditor in the purſuit of thoſe two perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named, who do wrongfully keep our means from us, and yet have viſible eſtates ſufficient to pay.</p>
