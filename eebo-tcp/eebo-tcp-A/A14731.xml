            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

because he will not bee found, and
had of such as seeke but lasily, and
coldly for him, that enquire not
through the streetes, as vndone
without him; as had rather then
want him, want all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
and crying as the Spouse,
<hi>Where art thou whom my soule lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,

            <p>These are the affections that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

The sluggard lusteth, and
wanteth. He that desires any thing
aboue him, equally with him, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11900:14"/>
without him, shall neuer obtaine
him; he will bee wooed in the first
place with all thy soule, strength,
and might, with all that is within
thee, or not at all of thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All</hi> let him bee in all thy loues,
and aboue all other beloueds;
when thou hast gotten him, thinke
not enough to make much of him,
but remember hee well deserues to
bee and must bee All in all. Take
him not by the hand, but embrace
him with both thine Armes of
loue, and hold him with all thy
might, loue him till thou be sicke
of loue for him: such as will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
any one ordinary obiect, wife,
friend, health, or wealth, will
not giue him content; nay, not a
compound of many, but a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licion
of all; as hee hath deserued,
so he deseruedly challengeth. All
thy weake Riuerets vnited, will
scarce make one current strong
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11900:15"/>
enough for him. Hee that did all,
suffered all, tooke all thine infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
finished all for thee, is it not
reason he should be all in all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any corriuall in all thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Such as entertaine Princes,
can neuer thinke they shew loue
