            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

up and downe in flocks about
the Countrey. Never was
more writing, or leſſe matter.
That of the Preacher, if ever
it did reflect on any, may fitly
ſuit with our times. <hi>There is no
end of making many books.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 12</note> For in many, in moſt,
there is no end indeed; Nay, there is neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
nor ending; that is, neither head nor foot,
as it is in the Proverb. I will not abſolutely rank
yours in the number of theſe, yet I conceive (and
many, I preſume, will be of my opinion) you
ſhould have ſhewne more wiſdome, if you had
taken leſſe paines, and ſpared your Diſcourſe.
For though I commend your moderation, in not
being affected with the Epidemicall diſeaſe of the
times, Railing, yet I cannot approve your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
in acting that upon the publique ſtage of
Printing, which might have paſſed better by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intercourſe of writing. I was once about to
have anſwered your Diſcourſe with nothing but
ſilence, (if ſo be that might have been reputed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64002:3"/>
an Anſwer) and to this the perſwaſion of ſome
friends had almoſt induced me, as well becauſe
the ſleighting of ſome wrong, is the beſt way to
overcome them, as becauſe it is not an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
for a Practicall Divine on the ſudden to turne
Polemicall. But I was diverted from theſe (to
my thinking) by ſtronger conſiderations: As firſt,
the giving of occaſion unto the adverſe ſide, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
and triumph; and next to ours, the ſcandall
of deſerting my ſelfe; and which is more, the
publique cauſe of the Church, at which (it is
plain) you ſtrike, though through the ſides of
me, an unworthy member of it. Over-ſwaid by
theſe, I thought it better to ſhew my ſelfe (is the
times now are) a foole in print among the reſt,
then that the Truth ſhould ſuffer by my default,
or that your pretending to invincible, unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
arguments, ſhould conduce to the offending
of others.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon your Book, I cannot paſſe
by the Title; as a man that is to ſurvey ſome
new building, ere he enter the houſe, will caſt his
eye upon the Portall. Now this (me thinks) is
not given with that adviſedneſſe of judgement
that ſhould have been, for you call it <hi>A Diſcourſe
concerning the fitneſſe of the poſture, neceſſary to be
uſed, in taking the Bread and Wine at the Sacrament.</hi>
Had you left out <hi>[neceſſary,]</hi> it would have been
a great deale better; for you change a matter of
indifferencie, into a matter of neceſſity. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(or at leaſt, writing of that ſubject, ought not
to) be ignorant, that Ceremonies, in their owne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64002:3"/>
nature are but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, indifferent things; your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
therefore being not yet enjoyned by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
cannot be neceſſary. But a rough outſide
may have a ſmooth inſide, and a jewell is not
alwayes knowne by the caſe or casket that
doth encloſe it; I will therefore come to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And this is compoſed in the forme of a Letter,
I muſt therefore ſhape my Anſwer accordingly;
onely I will adde a Superſcription, leſt I ſhould
not ſeeme to deale with a man of your faſhion
as I ought to doe.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reaſon that induceth me to this, is,
becauſe the elapſed time you ſpeak of,
hath brought forth the foule iſſue of
a collapſed diſpoſition, which (as
you would ſeeme to pretend) my rudeneſſe hath
made abortive, and cauſed it to come into the
world before the time: But the truth is, (for ſo
much I have heard you affirme your ſelfe) it was
conceived many yeares before, though perhaps
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64002:4"/>
not altogether in the ſame ſhape it is produced.
Who adviſedly conſidering this will not argue
you of much weakneſſe, for being grounded in
your opinion? why did you ſo often before take
the Sacrament kneeling without queſtion or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if it were a matter againſt conſcience ſo to
doe? If it were not, why doe you now refuſe
it? I refer my ſelfe to the indifferent Reader, if in
this you doe not render your ſelfe ſuſpected to
ſide more with the times then with the truth.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. In the firſt place (though an
eaſie apprehenſion may conceive it an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
introduction) you taxe my defect of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
Indeed I was never bred in the ſchoole of
complements, and may therefore haply commit
a ſoleciſme againſt ceremonious forme, but here
(I preſume) I may juſtly acquit my ſelfe. The
irreverence was on your part, the affront on mine,
I did but my duty, which you anſwered with
indignity, and for my beſeeching, returned a
threatning. As for the ſatisfaction which you
would ſeeme to have deſired, you know well that
I was not chiefe in the place, but (as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
me your ſelf) ſubordinate, Curate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſhould rather have ſought it at his
hands who was chiefe, eſpecially being there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
then at mine, and I make no doubt, he
would upon the leaſt intimation of this deſire
from you (ſo well I know his willingneſſe and
ſufficiencie) have given you (if any thing could
have done it) ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, had you requeſted as much of me (for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64002:4"/>
it hath never been my cuſtome to obtrude my
labours upon another, eſpecially where I had
juſt cauſe to ſuſpect the party poſſeſt with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
opinion, and ſo the matter in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to meete with deriſion inſtead of accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
I ſhould as far as my meane ability, and my
many occaſions and interruptions would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me leave, have done what I could. Let the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
Reader now judge, whether there were
more want of manners in me for not writing, or
of civility in you, for taxing me in this kind.</p>
               <p>Next, you affirme, that being to receive the
Sacrament, you did ſtand, with juſt ground, and
therefore I ſhould not have denyed it unto you
in that poſture. I anſwer, you are no <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
or if you were, I am none of your Diſciples, to
be ſatisfied with an <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> Who of ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not think that I was tyed in duty to
comply rather with publique authority, then with
your private, ſingular, irregular opinion: And
whereas you ſay, I ought not to urge an impoſed
kneeling, though backt by the authority of the
Ordinary, the Biſhop, the Canon, becauſe it is
not confirmed by Act of Parliament; I anſwer,
firſt, that your inference is not good: Are all
things unlawfull, that are not confirmed by Act
of Parliament? Surely then many indifferent
actions muſt needs be unlawfully performed;
Hath the King, hath the Church no authority in
theſe things? what then ſhall become of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if there be no Parliament? But it may be
you deſire ſuch a time as the Iſraelites had when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64002:5"/>
there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but every man did
that which was right in his own eyes.<note n="b" place="margin">Judg. 17. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that your aſſertion is not
true, there is an Act of Parliament for that and
other Ceremonies, entituled, <hi>An Act for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Common Prayer,</hi> and prefixt as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to the Service Booke; but I beleeve
you have taken little notice of it, becauſe you
are not much affected to the Booke it ſelfe.
Againe, whereas you ſay, Kneeling is not
commanded in the Rubrique: ſurely you doe
but take the matter upon truſt, and that hath
deceived you; for the words are plaine, that
the Receiver muſt take the Sacrament kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I will repeat them, that the truth may the
better appeare: <hi>Then ſhall the Miniſter firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in both kindes himſelfe, and next deliver it
to other Miniſters, if any be preſent, and after to the
people in their hands, kneeling.</hi> What can be more
plaine? Certainly, if you did not take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon truſt (as I ſaid before) it muſt needs be,
that either you did not looke ſo far, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke
it.</p>
               <p>Your diſallowing of the Canon cannot make
it of no validity; for it is confirmed by the King,
whom we acknowledge Supreame, in cauſes as
well Eccleſiaſticall as Civill; yea the power
thereof is further ratified by a clauſe mentioned
in the latter part of the Act made for the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Common Prayer; This three-fold cord
then cannot be broken by you, ſtrain a hard as
you can. And yet let me adviſe you as a friend,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64002:5"/>
not to ſtrain too far, leſt by this means you doe
not onely forfeit your judgment, but your eſtate;
for the Act being ſtill in force, may lay hold upon
you.</p>
               <p>But to follow you, (as you proceed) you urge us
next (as if we did we know not what) with many
demands, concerning the object you ſhould kneel
unto, and ſome of them very poore and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
you cannot (without much prejudice to
your own judgment) conceive us to be ſo ſimple
as to require you to kneele to the creature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Miniſter or the Sacrament; but
what that ſhould be which may hinder you from
kneeling unto God, I am not (I confeſſe) quick
ſighted enough to perceive; yes, ſay you, for if that
be required, why did not the Diſciples kneele?
I anſwer, firſt, it is not of abſolute neceſſity that
wee ſhould in all things imitate the Diſciples;
next I affirme, that with all the skill you have,
you cannot clearly and fully determine whether
they did kneele or no.</p>
               <p>Touching the forme of adminiſtration, what
if we ſhall affirme (for all your negative) that part
of it is a prayer? I doubt not we ſhall make it good
well enough, doe you your ſelfe examine it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better, and you cannot (if you will confeſſe a
truth) but conclude it to be ſo; I will repeat the
former part (for that only is materiall to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpoſe)
<hi>The Body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt which was
given for thee, preſerve thy body and ſoule into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life.</hi> The later part is by you vainly added,
for who did ever conceive that to be a Prayer?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64002:6"/>
But if it be a Prayer, ſay you, the words ſhould
run thus, <hi>I pray God to preſerve thy body and ſoule to
eternall life.</hi> Why ſo? I ſee no ſuch neceſſity. Is
not that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord
give thee underſtanding in all things,</hi> a prayer for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy?</hi>

               <p>Nor is it convenient (for all your cavill) that
the Miniſter ſhould kneele at the time of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
though the Receiver doe, ſeeing the
former ſubordinately under Chriſt our Saviour,
imparts the bleſſing; the latter takes it miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from him. Suppoſe the King (nay, let it be
ſome Vice-gerent, or Generall under him) be to
beſtow the Order of Knight-hood, becauſe he
muſt kneele that takes the honour, muſt he doe ſo
that gives it? Or, to come neerer to the preſent
queſtion, conſider this in matter of Ordination,
for though it be no Sacrament, it is a holy action:
becauſe he muſt kneele who receives Orders, muſt
he doe ſo that doth ordaine him? who ſees not
the manifeſt abſurdity of this conſequence? It is
ſufficient that the Miniſter himſelfe receiving
firſt, according to appointment, doe take the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
upon his knees. And why (I pray you)
may you not kneele to Chriſt, when you receive?
what neceſſity is there that your kneeling to him
ſhould make him to be corporally preſent in the
Sacrament, when you take the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
more then he is at other times, when you pray
unto him?</p>

My Lord of Yorke (and it is much that you
ſhould vouchſafe to give him that title) confeſſeth
no ſuch thing as you quote him for; Yea, in the
Page following, he is directly againſt you: For
he affirmes out of approved Authors, that it is a
matter of conveniencie for every Countrey to uſe
ſuch Ceremonies as they ſhal think fit.<note n="d" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Your Propoſition that we ought to follow
Chriſt in all things, is too generall; S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
will tell you otherwiſe, and ſo will all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe
Divines; They will affirme we ought
not to imitate him in his Miracles, but in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;
For though the one may entitle us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the other cannot acquit us from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>In the next place you come upon me like a fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer:
But <hi>(Venia tua)</hi> give me leave to tell you in a
friendly manner, your Venies are but triflings in a
cauſe ſo ſerious; I feare your ſharp as little as
your foils, for unleſſe your weapons be (and I
hope they are not) <hi>tincta Lycambaeo ſanguine,</hi> I ſee
no great danger in them, an indifferent judgment
may eaſily blunt their point, and turn their edge.
Howbeit, I thanke you for your friendly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
for <hi>praemonitus praemunitus,</hi> forewarn'd
forearm'd; and however you may ſeeme to your
ſelfe an iuvincible <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet I a little <hi>David</hi> dare
enter the liſts with you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you make a flouriſh, not with a two-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but with a two-edged ſword; nay with that
which is ſharper then any two-edged ſword,<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The
Word of God:</hi> Such a weapon, I grant, as being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64002:7"/>
well handled, is not to be reſiſted; but you doe
onely flouriſh it, and make a ſhew of ſtriking that
which you doe not come neere.</p>
               <p>Your Argument runs thus, That geſture is beſt
which was uſed by the Apoſtles; but the Apoſtles
uſed this geſture, therefore it is the beſt geſture.
And here you fall into an error, for you doe not
ſtand to your tackling, but goe from Standing to
Sitting; Nay, you uſe the demonſtrative <hi>this,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you mention Sitting at all. For the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which you would prove, you cite
many Texts of Scripture; among which, ſome
are meerly impertinent, as belonging nothing to
the Diſcourſe in hand, becauſe they imply an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
not in Ceremoniall, but Morall duties:
Such are <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 16. you
meane (I conceive) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 7. The
other conduce not rightly to your purpoſe, though
they ſeeme to come nearer. For however you
make much adoe with the Greek Text, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Tranſlation, where (by the way) you have
<hi>occubuit,</hi> for <hi>accubuit,</hi> which I am willing to paſſe
by, becauſe but a literall error, and conclude that
the poſture uſed was Sitting, (howbeit no direct
ſitting neither, but ſuch an one as did encline to
leaning) yet I may ſay all this will not help you
a jot: For we have two Bucklers to oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this ſharp of yours, (as you call it;) the
one, that all this proves nothing, but that our
Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſate at the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Paſſeover, not at the inſtitution of
the Sacrament; Nor can you by direct and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64002:7"/>
Text of Scripture urge it further, as ſome
of the learned have judiciouſly obſerved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
others for want of a due conſideration,
have given too much way to your aſſertion.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if I among theſe ſhould doe ſo too,
yet it would fare with you, but as with him, <hi>qui
ſuo ſe jugulat gladio,</hi> who ſtriking fiercely at his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
wounds, yea kils his owne cauſe. Your
pretence is to plead for Standing at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
nay your offence was, (howbeit <hi>Scandalum
acceptum non datum)</hi> becauſe you might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it in that poſture; and now you plead for
ſitting, nay affirme it is unlawfull to uſe other;
concluding it to be, not indifferent, but neceſſary.
<hi>Riſum teneatis amici.</hi> Surely when you wrote this
Diſcourſe, you were either forgetfull of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Poſition, or irreſolute in your preſent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
So that if one Proverb will not hit you, You
are a man ſitting <hi>duabus ſellis,</hi> yet another may fit
you, <hi>Aliud ſtans, aliud ſedens judicas,</hi> and thus you
quite overthrow, what you ſeeke to eſtabliſh;
for if ſitting onely be neceſſary, I do not ſee how
you can ſtand more for ſtanding, then we for
kneeling.</p>
               <p>Your bringing in of <hi>Calvin,</hi> makes nothing to
the purpoſe; he writes againſt adoring the Hoſt
in the Sacrament; and what is that to our kneeling
at the Communion? You might as well ſay, The
Papiſts kneel to Images, and worſhip them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may not kneele to worſhip God. You
preſſe further the ſayings of <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who (if you cite them rightly) take that for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64002:8"/>
granted, which remaines to be proved, namely,
that Sitting was the poſture uſed at the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Supper. Indeed I ſhould ſide with <hi>Chemnitius</hi>
in his opinion, that the reverence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be taken from the Word of God, if there
were any preſcript forme, or certaine direction to
be found in it. As for that which you quote out
of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> namely, that Kneeling was never
uſed in three hundred yeares after Chriſt; were it
true, (which I ſhall hardly be induced to beleeve,
without more pregnant teſtimony) yet it is not of
ſufficient force to infringe the lawfull uſe of this
Ceremonie, no not though you could directly
prove the Apoſtles did receive ſitting.</p>
               <p>For againſt this we lift up our ſecond buckler
of defence, which (I conceive) will be able to
ward off the blow that you would give us, and that
is this: In circumſtantiall things which are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
there is no abſolute tye of neceſſity that
we ſhould follow our Saviour Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
much leſſe the practiſe of the Primitive
Church; if there were any ſuch neceſſity, why
doe you not plead as well againſt the change of
time and place, as that of geſture? Seeing you
cannot be ignorant, that what the Apoſtles took
in the evening, we take in the morning; what they
received in a chamber, we receive in a Church;
If the Church had power to alter theſe, why
ſhould it not have as much to doe the other? The
inſtances which you produce for ſtanding, (were
they to the purpoſe, as they are not) would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
as much. For if the Church in thoſe times
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64002:8"/>
had power to varie from the order of ſitting, and
make uſe of ſtanding in the place of it, why had
not the Church afterward as much power to
change that ſtanding into kneeling?</p>
               <p>But the truth is, the words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as S.
<hi>Ierome</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>In Epiſt ad Epheſ.</hi>
                  </note> notes, have no reference to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but to the Reſurrection: We ſtand then,
ſaith the Father, (and it is not at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but every Lords day) becauſe it is <hi>Tempus lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiae,
quo nec genua flectuntur, nec curvamur, ſed cum
Domino ad coelorum alta ſuſtollimur:</hi> A time of joy,
in which we neither bow nor bend our knees, but
are with the Lord lifted up (as it were) to the
higheſt heavens. So S. <hi>Auguſtine, Propter hoc jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
relaxantur, &amp; orantes ſtamus, quod eſt ſignum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectionis:</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note>
For this we give over faſting, and
pray ſtanding, which is a ſigne of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Canon of the Nicene Councel is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
meerly on the ſame reaſon, and ſo is alſo that
which you cite out of S. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit did all theſe make to your purpoſe,
they would yet but make good what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the change of things indifferent is in the
power of the Church; and if ſo, why ſhould not
that power be obeyed now as well as in former
Ages? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is firme for it; That is (ſaith
he) to be accounted indifferent, and to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
in reſpect of the ſociety of thoſe among
whom we live, <hi>Quod neque contra fidem, ne<expan>

               <p>But you goe about to make kneeling no matter
of indifferencie, becauſe it tends (as you ſay) to
Idolatry. What conformation hath kneeling,
(ſay you) unleſſe to conforme us to Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation?
Since you doe not know, I will tell you;
It ſerves to conforme you to Reverence, to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
to Order; and I hope theſe are not Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.
Indeed could you prove what you
pretend, that kneeling at the Sacrament is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
(though that would not neceſſarily bring in
ſtanding) you ſhould doe ſomething; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
you produce for that purpoſe, are ſleight
and triviall. That which you alledge concerning
a reaſon before the Rubrique in the beginning of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is nothing probable; we have
but your bare word for it: I may therefore
ſay as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> doth in another caſe, <hi>Pari facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
rejicitur qua recipitur</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cent. Helvid.</hi>
                  </note>: I may as eaſily reject
it, as you obtrude it. The reſt I omit, as not worth
the anſweriug; and the rather, becauſe you knit
up afterward the full ſtrength of all in an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64002:9"/>
Onely I cannot paſſe by that ſpeech of
yours, It is an abſurdity to kneele to Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
It ſhould ſeeme you doe not either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
or regard what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In him
dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the God head bodily,</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Coloſ. 2. 9.</note> and
ſhall we not worſhip that wherein dwels the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Godhead? Doubtleſſe we are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Humane nature with the Divine, for our
bleſſed Saviour is not divided,<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note> and we are to
adore whole Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I come now to your Argument, which you
frame in this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>To bend the knee to a creature in divine worſhip, is
Idolatry; but to bend the knee at the Sacrament,
is to bend the knee to a creature:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> To bend the knee at the Sacrament is
Idolatry.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In ſeeking to prove the <hi>major</hi> or Propoſition,
you ſpend more time, more paine then needs.
For as when one would have made, or did make
a long Oration in the praiſe of <hi>Hercules,</hi> another
did put him off with this ſhort anſwer, What
needs all this? Who ever went about to diſpraiſe
him? So I may ſay to you, Who among us did
ever bend the knee in divine adoration to a meere
creature? Therefore you might have omitted this
as granted, and have proſecuted the proof of your
<hi>minor</hi> or aſſumption, which how weakly &amp; poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you doe, when you come at it, will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
upon a due examination of it. In the meane
time, you urge ſome things by the way, at which
we may take juſt exception; as the definition of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64002:10"/>
will-worſhip, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which you would faſten
upon <hi>Perkins,</hi> but unjuſtly; for who of ſound
judgement would ſay, that Will-worſhip is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of God, with the intention of the heart,
and goes no farther; how doth this diſtinguiſh it
from true worſhip? No, he affirms it to be when
God is worſhipped with a naked and bare good
intention, not warranted by the Word of God.
Againe, you ſeeke an utter extirpation of all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that is humane, wherein you deale with
too much inhumanity againſt it: For it may no
doubt in ſome kind be lawfull, uſefull, ſo long as
it doth not oppoſe Gods Word: Nor doe any
of the learned (as far as I could ever reade) deny
it in this reſpect: Even <hi>Perkins</hi> himſelfe doth in
the place where you cite him, affirme as much:
Nor is it any pollution of Gods worſhip, no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or diminution of Scripture, (as you pretend)
to make uſe of an indifferent Ceremonie. Laſtly,
your implicite concluſion from the perfect exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Saviour Chriſt, (as you ſay) doth make
explicitely againſt your ſelfe; for ſtanding hath
as little relation to ſitting, as kneeling hath.</p>
               <p>You proceed now to the Aſſumption, and ſeek
to make good the proofe of it, becauſe (as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
but you doe not, indeed you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
it) we reverence the actions, and the things
in the Sacrament more then we ought. In this you
are quite miſtaken, and cannot be thought to
write well, (though you applaud your ſelf never
ſo much in this worke) becauſe you diſtinguiſh
no better:<note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>qui bene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguit, bene direct.</hi>
                  </note> for you confound uſing reverence in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64002:10"/>
the actions, and of the actions, bowing the knee
at the Sacrament, and to the Sacrament. Your
Argument then is of no force, unleſſe you can
prove we worſhip the actions, or the Bread and
Wine, which I am ſure you will never be able
to doe.</p>
               <p>But leſt all this ſhould not availe to take away
Kneeling, you urge an Argument of <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
to doe that for you, which you cannot doe for
your ſelfe: It ſhould ſeeme the ſword of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
failing you, you are glad to borrow a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
from your adverſarie, and it is brandiſht by
you in this manner: If kneeling at the Sacrament
may be as the Calviniſts ſay, without ſin, then it
is not Idolatry to kneele before Images. To this I
anſwer, firſt, that the caſe is not alike; for the
Sacrament, though it be a repreſentation, is not
properly an Image. Beſides, we may be without
Images, we muſt not be without the Sacrament;
The one is peremtorily commanded, the other
onely in ſome ſenſe permitted. Again, I anſwer,
that to kneele before Images is not ſimply in it
ſelfe unlawfull, that is, as the act hath no relation
to the image, no more then it is to kneele before
a pewe, or a pillar; for the command is not, that
we ſhould not bow before them, but bow to
them.<note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 20. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As little availeable is your following reaſon,
that we ought not to kneele, becauſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a giving of thanks, and kneeling
no fit geſture for thankſgiving. Certainly you
have little ground for this opinion; for if thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vc:\balbir\cptx\print\print\ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64002:11"/>
be a part of Prayer, (as who almoſt ſave
your ſelfe will deny?) what fitter poſture can
there be for it then kneeling? Your inſtance of
<hi>Solomon</hi> makes little to the purpoſe; for firſt, it
is ſaid, <hi>He made an end of praying;</hi> ſecondly, that <hi>he
ſtood to bleſſe the congregation:</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">1 Kings 8. 55.</note> So that it was not
onely a thankſgiving unto God. And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
it were in our publique prayers, when we
are upon our knees, as ſoone as we come to a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of thankſgiving, to ſtart up ſuddenly upon
our feet, let the Reader judge. Howbeit, if exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in this point may be availeable, it will be a
matter of no great difficulty to produce ſome,
who have kneeled in their giving of thanks. The
Apoſtle tels the Philippians, that <hi>he thanks God
upon every remembrance of them alwayes, in every pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that he makes for them.</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Philip. 3. 4.</note> Now it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but in ſome of thoſe prayers he was upon his
knees. The Samaritane Leper when he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
did expreſſe greater reverence; <hi>He fell downe
on his face at the feet of Chriſt, and gave him thanks.</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 17. 16.</note>
But what ſhould I ſpeak of theſe? Doe not the
Angels and the Saints in heaven expreſſe their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of thanks with all ſubmiſſion and reverence?
we know they doe, for ſo we read,<note n="w" place="margin">Revel. 7. 11. &amp; 11. 16.</note> And if knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
be fit to be uſed in Prayer, it is ſo alſo in
Thankſgiving, for that is to be joyned with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.<note n="x" place="margin">Coloſ. 4. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Continue in Prayer, and watch in the ſame with
thankſgiving,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Beſides, who will not confeſſe the geſture of
kneeling in this action to be moſt becomming?
For if the Iſraelites receiving onely a meſſage of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64002:11"/>
their corporall deliverance, by the miniſtery of
<hi>Moſes, bowed their head and worſhipped,</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 4. 31.</note> ſurely we
have greater reaſon when we receive an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pledge of our ſpirituall deliverance by the
death and paſſion of our bleſſed Saviour, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our ſelves to Almighty God, and upon our
knees to offer up the ſacrifice of praiſe &amp; thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
We know that men doe many times upon
their knees receive temporall favours from the
hands of mortall Princes: Without doubt then it
will become us to receive with all ſubmiſſion and
reverence, this ſpirituall favour from the hands of
immortall God, the great King of Kings.</p>
               <p>That Epiſtle of S. <hi>Aug.</hi> by you cited for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
of indifferent Ceremonies, helps you little,
unleſſe you will ſay he doth (which he doth not)
contradict what he had delivered in the Epiſtle
immediately going before: For there he gives
this rule to <hi>Ianuarius, Nulla diſciplina eſt in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior
gravi prudenti<expan>
                        <am>

                        </am>

In theſe things no diſcipline can be better
for a grave and wiſe Chriſtian, then to demeane
himſelf in that manner the Church doth, to which
it is his hap to come: And he confeſſes he tooke
this rule from S. <hi>Ambroſe, Tanquam à coeleſti oraculo,</hi>
as from ſome heavenly Oracle. Therefore if you
would be indeed, as you deſire to be accounted, a
grave and wiſe Chriſtian, you muſt obſerve that
diſcipline which is enjoyned by the Church
wherein you live. And indeed in that Epiſtle you
cite, he is ſo far from diſallowing the rule before
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64002:12"/>
mentioned, that he doth highly commend it, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of it, that it is <hi>una &amp; ſaluberrima regula reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenda,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18.</note>
the onely wholſome rule to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Your laſt Argument to take away Kneeling at
the Sacrament, is drawn from the avoiding of an
inconvenience: It is (ſay you) an occaſion of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
and offence. I anſwer, The beſt actions may
be ſo; but then the offence is in thoſe that take it,
not in thoſe that give it. But I would fain know of
you, if ſitting or ſtanding ſhould be ſubſtituted in
the place of kneeling, (for you ſeeme to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
for either of theſe, and I think would not
care what the poſture were, ſo it were any other)
how theſe could be uſed without ſcandall. For I
perſwade my ſelfe, that as they would give more
occaſion of offence, ſo they would give occaſion
of offence to more then kneeling doth. In this the
greater number ſure will ſide with us. To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that whereas you can pretend onely the
bond of charity, we have beſides this the bond of
duty, even the command of Authority, which (as
<hi>Beza</hi> obſerves) doth impoſe a kind of neceſſity.<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 24.</note>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo affirmes, that where the doctrine is
ſound and pure, and the Ceremonies tend to a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
decencie and honeſty, it is fit rather to ſubmit
unto them, then to diſſent about them,<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 254.</note> eſpecially
if the greater number carry it. Now ſuppoſe all
the congregations in the Kingdome were united
into one, and the matter were to goe by votes, I
preſume I may ſafely affirm, that where you have
ten for ſitting or ſtanding ſeverally, nay for both
joyntly, we for kneeling ſhall have an hundred.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64002:12"/>
This reaſon therefore of yours is of no validity,
ſeeing ſcandall would not be leſſened, but encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by this meanes.</p>
               <p>You draw now to a concluſion; and ſo would
I too, for I am even wearied with following you
in ſuch a confuſed courſe, but that I meet with
one thing which will detain me a while. Indeede a
good Chriſtian, nay a good Subject, though a
Heathen, could not paſſe by it without offence:
Are the names of Kings (thinke you) fit things
to be plaid upon, or to be ſtigmatized by the pens
of private perſons? if not, what meanes your new
coind word <hi>Carolicall? Minutius</hi> records of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Treſmegiſtus,</hi> that even the Heathen, becauſe
he was a great Philoſopher, would not uſe his
name without great reverence: Is there not as
much reſpect due to Kings, as to Philoſophers?
<hi>Suetonius</hi> reports of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> he wrote to
the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> to take order that his name
might not <hi>abſole fieri,</hi> be worn thread bare among
the common people, by their frequent and trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
uſing of it; And can our King then take it wel at
your hands you ſhould abuſe his name, and that
in ſo ſerious and weighty a matter as Religion?
Surely when I conſider this, I cannot a little
wonder at your inconſiderate boldneſſe, nay, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
impietie. For if a Subject may not revile
his Prince, no not in his thoughts,<note n="d" place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 20.</note> much leſſe is
he to doe it in his words, eſpecially in ſuch as
proceede not from ſuddain paſſion, but from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deliberation, and being committed to the
preſſe, are expoſed to a publique view. I could
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64002:13"/>
never heare that his Majeſty is any way tainted in
Religion, you may juſtly be ſuſpected, therefore
I ſhall rether follow that Church, which is (if I
may lawfully repeat the terme you uſe) <hi>Carolical,</hi>
then that which is <hi>Peytonicall,</hi> that is, rather the
Doctrine, and the Diſcipline of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> then the fancies and factions of ſome
few Sectaries, and Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>And now I will ſhut up all with an inverſion of
your concluſion. Seeing kneeling at the receiving
of the Sacrament, is in it ſelfe a Ceremony that is
indifferent; ſeeing it is as judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> terms it,
the geſture of pietie;<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſiaſt. polit. lib.</hi> 5.</note> nay, as <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,
doth carry a ſhew of pious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 12.</note>
ſeeing it is enjoyned by authority, and that
of the King, of the Church, of the State; ſeeing it
is practiſed by the generality; ſeeing it is refuſed
only by ſome few out of ſingnlarity, <hi>Qui niſi quod
ipſi faciunt nihil rectum exiſtimant,</hi> as Saint <hi>Aug.</hi>
ſpeaks,<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> who thinke nothing to be right but
what they doe themſelves, you ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at my hands an adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
unto you ſtanding, or to be offended with me
or any other, who <hi>(rebus ſic ſtantibus)</hi> ſhall refuſe to
ſatisfie your deſire, that he may comply with the
authority of the Church.</p>
