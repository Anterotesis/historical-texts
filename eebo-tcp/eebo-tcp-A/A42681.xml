            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it a ſign of great Misfortune towards him, if any man communed with
him of his Affairs; and would be very angry with thoſe about him, if they
troubled him in any Matter whatſoever upon this day.</p>
            <p>But I will deſcend to more particular Inſtances of Lucky and Unlucky
Days.</p>
            <p>Upon the Sixth of <hi>April, Alexander the Great</hi> was born: Upon the ſame
day he conquered <hi>Darius,</hi> won a great Victory at Sea, and died the ſame day.</p>
            <p>Neither was this day leſs fortunate to his Father <hi>Philip;</hi> for on the ſame he
took <hi>Potidea; Parmenio</hi> his General gave a great Overthrow to the <hi>Illyrians;</hi>
and his Horſe was Victor at the <hi>Olympick Games.</hi> Therefore his Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
to him, <hi>Filium cujus natalis, &amp;c.</hi> That a Son whoſe Birth-day was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Three Victories, ſhould prove Invincible. <hi>Pezelius in Melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio
Hiſtorico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Thirtieth of <hi>September, Pompey the Great</hi> was born: Upon that
day he he Triumphed for his <hi>Aſian</hi> Conqueſt; and on that day died.</p>
            <p>The Nineteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was the day of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Adoption: On the
ſame day he began his Conſulſhip: He conquered the <hi>Triumviri;</hi> and on the
ſame day he died. Hitherto out of the <hi>Memoirs of K.</hi> Charles I. <hi>Heros.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Solomon</hi> count <hi>the day of ones death better than the day of ones birth,</hi> there
can be no Objection why that alſo may not be numbred amongſt ones Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Happy days. And therefore I will inſert here, That the Eleventh of
<hi>February</hi> was the Noted day of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who was born
and died that day. <hi>Weaver, p. 476. Brook in H. 7. Marriage. Stow in Anno</hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>John Perot (Stow</hi> corruptly calls him <hi>Parrat</hi>) a Man very remarkable in

died in the Tower, the Third of <hi>November,</hi> 1592. (as <hi>Stow</hi> ſays) Grief, and the

Marſh-land, very conveniently flanking its Up-land; and in thoſe days this
Marſh-land was uſually let for Four Nobles an Acre. My Father died 1643.
Within a year and half after his deceaſe, ſuch Charges and Water-ſcots came
upon this Marſh-land, by the influence of the Sea, that it was never worth one
Farthing to me, but very often eat into the Rents of the Up-land: So that I
often think, this day being my Birth-day, hath the ſame evil influence upon
me, that it had 580 years ſince upon Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and others concerned in

            <p>The Parliament ſo fatal to <hi>Romes</hi> Concerns here, in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time,
begun the Third of <hi>November,</hi> (26 of his Reign); in which the Pope, with

Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having full Authority to reform all Errors,
Hereſies, and Abuſes of the ſame: Alſo the Firſt-fruits and Tenths of all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Promotions and Dignities were granted to the King. See <hi>Stows Annals,</hi>
and <hi>Weaver, pag.</hi> 80.</p>
            <p>Not long after which, followed the Viſitation of Abbies, Priories, and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries;
and after that, their final Suppreſſion: This Parliament being the
Door of entrance thereto.</p>
            <p>The Third of <hi>November,</hi> 1640. began that Parliament ſo direfully fatal to
<hi>England,</hi> in its Peace, its Wealth, its Religion, its Gentry, Nobility, nay, its
King. So verifying the former Verſe of the <hi>Calendar,</hi>

            <p>Theſe Verſes I preſented in <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. to a moſt Honourable Peer of the
Land, and of great Place near His Royal Highneſs.</p>
            <p>Since which time, old <hi>Fabian</hi> coming into my hands, from him I got know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that that advantageous Peace, mentioned by <hi>Stow, Anno</hi> 1360. (conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between the forementioned King <hi>Edward</hi> III. and the <hi>French</hi> King) was
acted upon the Fourteenth of <hi>October,</hi> with grand Solemnity.</p>
            <p>The two former Circumſtances muſt needs fall out Providentially: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this laſt of <hi>Anno</hi> 1360. was deſigned by <hi>Edw.</hi> III. or no, (as remembring
his former good hap) may be ſome queſtion: I am of opinion, not. Where
things are under a Mans peculiar Concern, he may fix a time; but here was the
<hi>French</hi> King concerned, equally with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and many other Great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
intereſſed: To have tied them up to his own Auſpicious Conceit of the
Day, had been an unkind Oppreſſion, and would have brought the Judgment
of ſo Wiſe a Prince into queſtion: We may conclude then, 'twas meerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous.
And therefore to the former Obſervation concerning this famous <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>

An advantageous Peace, on day ſelf ſame,</l>

            </q>
            <p>A memorable Peace (foretold by <hi>Noſtredamus</hi>) much conducing to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Blood, was made upon the Fourteenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1557. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. <hi>Henry</hi> II. of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> II. of <hi>Spain. Noſtreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
ſays, Theſe Great Princes were <hi>frappèz du Ciel,</hi> moved from Heaven to
make this Peace. See <hi>Garencieres Comment on Noſtredamus, pag.</hi> 76.</p>
            <p>A Lucky day this, not onely to the Princes of <hi>England;</hi> but Auſpicious to
the Welfare of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Third of <hi>March</hi> laſt (being the day of St. <hi>Eutropius</hi>) His Royal
Highneſs withdrew towards the <hi>Low-Countries: Procopius</hi> tells us, <hi>Humana ſaepe
contingit a Deo mutari. Terence</hi> ſays, <hi>Viciſſitudo omnium rerum eſt.</hi> Which
two Sayings I can no way better Engliſh, than by that of <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 11. Time and
chance happens to all men:</hi> Nor no way better ſecond than with that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 11. <hi>Incertis vagamur ſedibus.</hi> This Accident therefore (our <hi>life being but
a pilgrimage,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> termed it to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) is nothing to a General Providence
in the main. Therefore from the Augury of His Fourteenth of <hi>October,</hi> and
from the good <hi>Omen</hi> comprehended in the Signification of <hi>Eutropius,</hi> which
hints, that all this ſhall end <hi>well,</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> to the beſt; and from <hi>Ecclus</hi> 14. 14, 15.
I accoſt His Royal Highneſs with a <hi>Non defraudabitur a die bono;</hi> He ſhall not
loſe his Good day.</p>

               <l>Dixerunt Ibis, pariter dixêre Redibis</l>

            </q>
            <p>I juſt now ſaid, That the Third of <hi>March</hi> was dedicated to <hi>Eutropius,</hi> which

               <hi>to turn:</hi> It is alſo dedicated to St. <hi>Maximus,</hi>
St. <hi>Marinus,</hi> St. <hi>Lucius;</hi> which three alſo have notable hints in relation to His
Royal Highneſs. Firſt, No man can deny, but that He is <hi>Maximus Princeps.</hi>
Secondly, He is <hi>Maximus Marinus;</hi> for in the time of His Exile He was Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>Aragon,</hi> as I have been told many years ſince in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and I am ſure
very many Commiſſions in thoſe days paſt under His Name: And till 1673. He
was Lord High Admiral of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucius</hi> comes from <hi>Luci,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>in the morning;</hi> and betokens a
Child born in the morning, or at Sun-riſing, (which ſome affirm to be a good
time for Birth): But I will for my preſent purpoſe deduce it <hi>a Luceo;</hi> and I
muſt affirm, <hi>Quod hic maximus Princeps geſtis marinis maxime lucet, &amp; alias
lucebit;</hi> This moſt Great Prince is extremely Illuſtrious in Sea Negotiations,
and ſhall yet be otherwiſe moſt Illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>That his Highneſs has long ſince verified the firſt Paragraph of my Aſſertion,
take it not onely on my Credit; but (beſides what has been ſaid before) hear
part of an Ode to His Sacred Majeſty, on His Highneſs Victory over the <hi>Dutch,
June</hi> 3. 1665. compos'd by Sir <hi>T. H.</hi> a moſt Worthy Perſon, whom his Foreign
Negotiations have made enough known.</p>
