         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Church of God wheresoever dispersed, Elect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to
the foreknowledge of God the Father vnto Sanctification of the Spirit, through
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ, (apprehended with true
faith) Grace &amp; peace be multiplied vnto you all, Amen.</head>
            <p>CHristian Reader, it was wy lot to light vpon these few leaves.
And being pervsed by som that had in times past bin acquainted with the author
him self, And so fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this canvasing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference such sound satisfaction
for matters of doubt, which in the other Epistle of the pestilence, were short
&amp; brief, learned and scholerlike rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, still striving to bring out the
kernel of knowledge, which lay couched vnder the shell of obscuritie. And the
further he ripped and reached, to make Gods glorious power knowen, which others
so long had masked: it caused many questions to bee mooved, which in this
canvasing conference is answered to the full. I my self being an eare-witnes,
to som part of that doctrine: which was as strange to many at the first, as it
was to the men of Athens in Mars street, which counted Paul but a babler,
because he preached vnto them, Iesus and the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But I heare the Author is in prison, And why? Because som
Ministers complayned that he preached a doctrine (which they could neither
begin nor end) past the boundes of their knowledge.</p>
            <p>But Henoch wher are thine accusers? hath the finger (of<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn. 8. 6.</note> God) written their faults easie to be read, doe
they not stand out to accuse thee? Then I hope the learned will not condemne
thee, that haue trod out the corne before thee in the same path.</p>
            <p>So was the doctrine of possession likewise distilled out of the
cloudes, and so high past every lay mans reach, that the layety were driven to
their Pastors for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the doubt of that doctrine (because the
Priestes lippes should preserue knowledge) but they being found nonresidence in
those studies, one made answer thus: I am no Prophet, I am no Apostle, Miracles
are ceased, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These hearers could not be at the beginning &amp; ending of all
these Sermons, which was the cause they rested vnsatisfied,<note place="margin">One made that aunswer.</note> and so they began to expounde the
doctrine them selues according to those parcels which they had gleaned by peece
meale from the author, never vnderstanding the Author as he meant. But
whosoever thou be, that will take vpon thee to say all, before thou heare all,
shall be sure to lye all.</p>
            <p>And so damnable speaches were bruted abroad, before either of the
doctrines were finished: but the last Sermon of possession, made all plaine,
and so plaine, that since that time (to the glory of God be it spoken) I never
heard of any about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don nor elswhere that were so extraordinarily possessed.
But ordinary wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are never dispossessed of a wicked tongue:
like the Athenians which gaue them selues to nothing els, but either to tell,
or heare som Newes. but in the end M. Marbery set in foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to maintaine
the same doctrine, vpon Christes Temptation in the Wildernes, affirming that
[<note n="*" place="margin">Ergo no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</note> If no going in, no coming
out.] So did the last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the Pestilence make all attentiue hearers
satisfied.</p>
            <p>These circumstances considered, I tooke it for duty, once towards
the Church [who is the piller and ground of truth] as also for profitable
acquaintance hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had with the Author: I could do no lesse but diuulge
it. And so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that therein is cleared, what in all points is
to be held touching the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: A doctrine hetherto, over-confusedly and
slenderly handled of many, If my iudgement fayle me not.</p>

            <p>THE last great <hi>Pest-time</hi> (I speak of the Great plague in
<hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for otherwise, it is now the greatest Pest-time in the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and throughout his Highnes Dominions) it pleased God to give me
affection and strength to continue &amp; hold out my Ministerie to the end,
publikelie teaching, and privately comforting the Lords poore flocke abyding in
the Citie of <hi>London</hi> (as occasion here and there, night and day was
administred) what time the Citie was much infirmed for Civill governement, and
well-nigh emptied of due ecclesiasticall cure.</p>
            <p>Satan<note n="“" place="margin">Revel. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The
accuser of our brethren,</hi> maligning the happy successe of my labors, he
gets som vnwise Spirits to bruite abroad, that <hi>Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> taught <hi>The
plague not to be infectious,</hi> and that <hi>All that dyed of the plague were
damned, as dying without faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first accusation came readily to the present Lo. Bb. of
London, but the second (it seemeth) not so. For about som 34. wekes after my
first Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitment, the said Lo. BB. and Sir <hi>Edward Stanhope</hi> in Court
did publikely affirme, that they had not heard of that bruite before: what time
I my selfe then first vttered it in their court, that so then in the face of
all by-standers it might be checked, so well as other slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, forged only
for obscuring myne innocency.</p>
            <p>The BB. beleeving the first tale, he (without sending for me, or
tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with me) caused me to be taken (euen presently vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Sermons ending,
wherin I had opposed to such insensible reportes) and so was conveyed to

some inter-currentes (which in som other my writings are layde downe) he at the

Pestilence;</hi> and that in contempt of the booke of <hi>Orders</hi> for the
Wednesdayes fast, authorized by the King. To both I answered
<hi>Negatiuely,</hi> if so by <hi>Plague</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not that stroke
of the Angel termed of the Holy-Ghost <hi>Deber;</hi> but that which grew from
corruption of the Creature. Well to the Gate house prison I was sent, and to my
booke and the contentes, I should answere in another place.</p>
            <p>To passe by the second Convention, it being to no other end then
the former, the weeke before the Archb. death, I was called to
<hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both.</hi> There, after assurauce had of certaine Articles their
compasse, I <pb facs="tcp:8446:3"/> tooke my othe to answer truly to them. The next Monday
at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters office I did so. The answere was sent to the BB. of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
He seeing it made not to his purpose, did not convent me, but (without all
adoe) he let me ly in prison still as afore. My wordes nor writings prevayling
any whitt, I complayned to the King on<note n="“" place="margin">1604.</note>
               <hi>Easter monday,</hi> who appointed the same to be conveyed to the BB.
<hi>And he thereto to giue in his answer.</hi> Hearing nothing more of that of
7. weekes, I on the day of Pentecost insuing, complayned to his
<hi>Highnes</hi> againe. Thereto, Sir <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in his Maiesties
name subscribeth thus. 
<q>The Kings Maiesty hath eftsoones referred this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the
  Lord Bishop of London, who is required by his Highnes calling other of the
  Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commission vnto him, withall convenient expedition and according to the Law,
  to proceede to iudgement, either with or against the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as his cause
  shall deserue; that his Highnes may not further bee importuned herein. So farre
  the Kings commaund.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the Bishop I sent it, but hearing nothing from him, a fortnight
after, I sent to the King againe. About a week after, I was convented. And
after much talke to no purpose, the Bishop concluded thus: <hi>you may doe this
at least; the Doctrines being put downe as supposed to be taught of you, you
may subscribe herein, I was truely or not truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</hi> I answered,
let that be done, and I shall doe what I ought. Doctor <hi>Stanhope</hi> then
said, Maister Deanes of Westminster &amp; Pawles are appointed to that, who (at
their convenient leasure) will send for you. So the Court broke vp. This was
the eleventh of Iuly last; and then the first time also of excepting at the
doctrine of <hi>Faithes appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending deliverance from the plague,</hi> taught
in the foresaid <hi>Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus left to the two Deanes, I writt to them sundry times
for speedy proceeding. One of them sent my messenger to the other, backward and
forward. At the Monethes end, Doctor <hi>Androes</hi> sends me word, that he
had put the matter from him. And so he never sent for me, according to the
Courtes Depute.</p>
            <p>Passing by inconvenient repeates, about three weekes after, I was
sent for to the Registers office. Coming thither, his man lets me see Doctor
<hi>Androes</hi> his moneths worke. And what was it? <hi>A flat
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,</hi> and nothing answerable to that which the Court (in myne
hearing) appointed as afore. So much I signified to the Bishop, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the
<hi>Doctor,</hi> But other answer since I could haue none but this: put in
bondes so to protest, <hi>When and Where we</hi> shall appoint, and so 
<pb facs="tcp:8446:3"/> departe prison. So my cause at the penning hereof standeth.</p>
            <p>The severall pointes, for the which I am thus handled, in the

the doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the question. The question is doubtfull by reason of the

vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereof, let vs first examine the seuerall senses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plague,</hi> is a word taken in the evill part, and spoken of
any harme inflicted vpon any Creature. All diseases are termed plagues, be they

for a speciall kinde of evill inflicted on mankinde. The Divine Prophets

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I vnderstand that plague, or pest not to be
single, or of one kinde. And so farre as I conceaue, no learned Divine 
<pb facs="tcp:8446:4"/> or Phisition, is otherwise minded. Thereof it is, that sometimes
they vrge textes of scripture for making the Angell Agent, according to that
speach of our King in his Parliamentall Oration, who termes the <hi>Pest</hi>
the <hi>viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

devouring Angell:</hi> and sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine they discourse of Corrupt ayre in
suing Constellations and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming corruptions. In which respecte, naturall
politicall Orders are vrged; as for the other, Fasting and Prayer. In regard of
the first, one (speaking of the Plague in Davids time) writes thus:<note place="margin">W. Cupper, on 2. Sam. 24. pag. 78.</note> 
               <q>This Plague came not by any Caryer or Travailer, or by any
  infected persons tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayling from place to place &amp; infecting the people
  wher they came, but it was sent sodainly from God, as the revenger of
  sinne.</q> He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes graunteth, that such a plague is not at this day for
vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and quick dispatch,
but yet still that God hath the same meane at his pleasure, so to do. And this
writer must be remembred, to haue beene authorized by the Sea of
<hi>London:</hi> and the same Booke applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Preface of an ancient
paynfull<note n="*" place="margin">Stephen Egerton.</note> Preacher. For the
other sorte of Pest, namely derived from some corruption of the Creature, and
not immediatly from the Angells stroke, any learned (skilfull in nature) do
graunt. And for that, take a Christian Physitians testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie amongst vs. He
having alleadged som reportes from histories touching naturall Contagion, doth
then conclude thus<note n="*" place="margin">Doct. Fran Hering in his Epist. to
  his Defence, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>This may be sufficient to shew, that the Plague
is not always the immediat stroke of an Angell.</hi> In this Pestilence
generally scattred through the land, there so falleth out some stroke
<hi>Supernaturall,</hi> some <hi>Naturall,</hi> as I haue againe and againe
taught in my Epistle so much traduced. He that is against me in this, is so not
contrarie minded to me, but to our King, to our Divines, and Phisitians also.
No marvayle then though another authorized Divine do say with the right learned

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <q> 
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> FIrst let me heare what infection is. A domestick
Doctor, signifying what person is infectious, doeth write thus: 
<note n="*" place="margin">D. Lodge in his booke of the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
  cha. 1.</note> Very properly (saith he) is he reputed infectious, that hath in
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an evil, malignant, venomous, or vitious disposition, which may be
imparted and bestowed on another by.<note n="“" place="margin">Touching is of
  sundry natures.</note> 
                  <hi>Touch,</hi> producing the <hi>Same</hi> and <hi>As
Dangerous effect</hi> in him to whom it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, as in him that first
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunicateth and spreadeth the infection. <hi>So farre He.</hi> It being
remembred, that Infection properly vnderstood, is not that which begetteth
<hi>Another</hi> but the <hi>Same</hi> euill, so Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
            </q>
            <p>That stroke which the Angell inflicteth, is
<hi>Supernaturall,</hi> and not within the compasse of Phisicall causes:</p>
            <p>But Infection is Naturall and within the compasse of Phisicall
causes:</p>
            <p>Therefore the Angells stroke not infectious.</p>
            <p>For the second proposition, I leaue it till anone. Meane time the
first proposition would be cleared, seeing the conclusion dependes
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordially of it. That the Angels stroke is <hi>Supernaturall,</hi> it may
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, once in that He the Angell (be a good or bad one,<note n="“" place="margin">Bucer in Mat. 8.</note> for either may be so imployde) he is a
Spirit, and this his Action done by an immediate spirituall power beyonde our
reasons pitch. Secondly, we see the Angell in <hi>Aegpit,</hi> as also in
<hi>Iudea &amp; Israell</hi> (nor els where do we ever heare the contrary) to
be imploide in smyting house af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter house, and City after City, even all along
the Coastes, from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> and not smyting that
which might smyte another, which otherwise (if but for instruction sake) would
somtyme haue bene done, and mentioned. And this (no doubt) caused one to write
as afore in the former chapter, that<note n="*" place="margin">W. Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on 2.
  Sam. 24.</note> 
               <hi>The Pest in Davids tyme, came not by any infectious
person.</hi> Thirdly, by the <hi>Septuagintaes</hi> version of the word DEBER,
it may be collected to haue bene then the Church of <hi>Israels</hi> iudgement.
The word DEBER in proper En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish <hi>The Pestilence,</hi> they turne by the
Greeke word <hi>Logos</hi> in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish <pb n="9" facs="tcp:8446:5"/> 
               <hi>The word;</hi> as
if in the text it were not DEBER but DABAR, this indeed signifying a
<hi>word;</hi> and the very terme that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his first chapter
doth giue vnto the Son of God, by whom as by a <hi>word,</hi> the Creature had
his beginning and beeing. So that the 91. Psal. and third verse, they thus
read, <hi>He shall deliuer thee from the word,</hi> not fro the Pestilence. And
why? because that Pest (as the comon Creature at first) had the beginning and
beeing solely by the word of God: and this plague for contemning the blessed
Covenaunt sealed vp in him that is <hi>Logos the Word.</hi> Afterwardes in the
sixt verse of the same Psalme, the Hebrue-Greekes read, thou shalt not be
affraide [<hi>Apò toû pragmatos] of the thing,</hi> in steed of
pestilence. Why? Because it was such a <hi>RHEMA,</hi> such a <hi>PRAGMA,</hi>
such a Thing, as they knew not properly how to terme it in the Greeke language:
They well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that the Heathen-Greekes did terme it <hi>LOIMOS,</hi>
and in respect of the popular spreading <hi>Epidemia,</hi> wherefore then in
their translations should they so avoyde these wordes, and rather choose such a
terme, as should drive the <hi>Heathen</hi> to a <hi>Non-plus?</hi> No reason I
can render, but that thereby they finely checked the Gentiles, as Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of
that plagues cause, and therfore must be glad (leaving their great Naturians)
to come vnto the written <hi>woord</hi> of God for better learning. And in so
doing, they shall finde that DEBER is indeed DABAR, which not only signifieth a
<hi>Word,</hi> but also a <hi>Thing;</hi> Yea, a <hi>miraculous Thing;</hi> as
in Genes. 18. where <hi>Sarah</hi> thinking the woord of promise impossible,
the Angel thus checkes her; <hi>shall any</hi> DABAR <hi>be heard to the
Lord?</hi> where that miraculous thing was to be effected by the power of the
word DABAR signifying both. Now if the Pest was such a word, or such a thing,
effected by a word, then it is to bee nombred amongest <hi>Supernaturalls,</hi>
and so not infectious, seeing the partie so smitten, could not by all the
corruption in his nature sende out such a <hi>Word,</hi> such a <hi>Thing,</hi>
begetting the same effect in another: for so (which I thinke were a petie
blasphemie) in steed of <hi>Iehovahs</hi> Angell, mans beastly corruption
should equalize the Angell, &amp; take the worke out of his handes, as being
<hi>Iehouahs</hi> messenger herein (for Angell is the Greeke word, and
Messenger the English) which I haue not read of, at least not observed. True it
is, that the Angells blowe, rayseth vp mudde in mans nature, giving it an head
to the heart; and therefore in Psalme 91. 3. with <hi>Logos</hi> they ioyne
<hi>Tarachodes</hi> turned of vs noysome, but in proprietie,
<hi>Bemudding,</hi> as if by such a stroke, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:8446:6"/> the mudde of
our vncleane poole, were stirred vp to the poysoning of all the blood and
powers; even as è <hi>contra,</hi> the Angells <hi>Mooving</hi> of
<hi>Bethesda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 5.</note> brought sanitie to the
diseased. And true it is also, that <hi>that</hi> corruption may offend and
hurt nature in others, but yet not infect, that is beget the <hi>Same</hi> and
as dangerous effect in another: for many things
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, that the Angells stroke is <hi>Super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<q>In the <hi>Addition</hi> to the first <hi>Section</hi> there I
  say thus; This kinde of plague of pestilence, is of him (namely <hi>Galen</hi>)
  termed <hi>Loimos,</hi> respecting only bodyes bursting out in corruption,
  which may be cause sometimes of corrupting bodyes; specially such as are
  inclinable to, and capable of such corruption. <hi>Then to the second Section

  sores and markes appearing &amp; arising, are an effect. The first not
  infectious. The second is Infectious sometimes more or lesse. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
  in the third Section having said,</hi> It is for none to make
  <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke</hi> their staffe, nor yet their first meane, I <hi>then write
  thus:</hi> Is Phisick then in this, and all other plagues to be avoyded? No, we

should haue skipped ouer such naturall respectes (and why? may not a Divine do
it, whose practise is, not to preach Phisick) how would all accusations then
haue passed for current against me. Yea, the Bishop knowes by a letter writ to

            <p>That the Plague (that is, pestilenced ayre, earth bodyes) should

apprehending such deliverance?</head>
            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <p>Ans. FIrst I will propound the sortes of <hi>Faith.</hi> For
though it bee said of the Apostle in the Epistle to the Ephesians and 4.
Chapter, <hi>There is one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one Faith,</hi>
he meaneth not that there be no moe sortes in any sence: seeing besides the one
body mysticall of Christ, there is another of Antichrist. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that one
<hi>Spirit</hi> which giveth life to the Church, the aforesaide body, there is
another Spirit, that breatheth in the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, &amp; many Spirites
rationall, &amp;c. So, besides that one, hope, which is the Ancker-hold of the
true Church, there is another of the false. And besides that one,
<hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>apprehends Christ vnto eternal life,</hi> there is a
second <hi>Faith,</hi> termed <hi>Historicall,</hi> which is that Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> speakes of, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayeth;<note place="margin">Iame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thou Believes</hi>
(or thou <hi>Faithes</hi>) that there is one God, thou dost well, <hi>The
Devils beleeve, and tremble.</hi> Such, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Bibles history to be
true, the wicked haue in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Godly. A third faith, ther is, termed
<hi>Miraculous,</hi> by reason won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes are thereby effected, whereof the Apostle speaketh in 1. 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8446:10"/> Corin. 13. 2.<note place="margin">Beza on 1. Cor. 1.
  13.</note> If I had all faith (that is as <hi>Beza</hi> well noteth, the whole
of this kinde of faith) <hi>so that I could remooue mountaynes, &amp;c.</hi>
And this faith also the wicked haue in comon with the Godly. There is another
fatth termed <hi>Temporary,</hi> whereof the Apostle speaketh in 1. Tim. 4. 1.
when he saith, <hi>That in the latter tymes som shall Apostate from the
Faith;</hi> that is shall fall away from the Ghospell, sometymes meant by
faith: for from the first faith abouesaid, there is no fallinge away, no more
then from Election. And this kinde of temporary faith is peculiar to som
Reprobate, speaking only of mans-estate since Adams fall. Otherwise in the time
of Innocency, <hi>Adam had faith</hi> touching the Trinitie, their workes and
goodnes (but not of the Son as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> for yet was no need, because
no Sinne) from the soundnes of which faith he [<hi>écousios</hi>]
frankly and freely fell,<note place="margin">Hebrues 10 26.</note> Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a

<hi>Hezekiah</hi>) to the same and a more Excellent Faith touching a seede (not
seedes) which should arise from woman, for destroying the workes of Satan.</p>
            <p>Of these 4 sortes of Fayth or Beliefe, the first is of an Eternall
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of a grayne or cranell growing in fine to a Tree, having the Roote
grounded in Christ.<note place="margin">Eternall or iustifying Faith.</note> But
as the <hi>Vine</hi> riseth by meane proppes, so this faith ariseth
<hi>Gradatim,</hi> som and som by temporarie favoures and promises of this
life; as may appeare thorough-out <hi>Moses,</hi> who by such <hi>Shadowes</hi>
leades vs to the <hi>Substance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Temporarie Faith.</note>
In which respect, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the distinction of <hi>Faith Temporarie,</hi> and
faith <hi>Eternal;</hi> not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Temporarie for that it selfe indureth for a
tyme, so much as for the Obiect, it eyeth and apprehendeth, which is som
temporary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and blessing: as also the other <hi>Eternall,</hi> for the
eternall promises and blessings, it eyeth, apprehendeth, and holdeth. Both of
them meet in the Elect, as two eyes in the soule, to see by, but often times
(as were <hi>Leahs</hi> eyes) very tender: yea, with the poore man in the
Ghospell, do often behold me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but as Trees: which caused another to cry, <hi>I
beleue, Lord, help my vnbelief.</hi> In this distinction of <hi>Eternall</hi>
and <hi>Temporary Faith</hi> I here rest as fittest to the present purpose, as
also to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such writers as already I haue vrged, and againe must
vrge.</p>
            <p>My Answer so to the second question is, that both these sortes of
faith are commended and called for in the 91. Psalme. <hi>The Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie</hi>
is propounded in the first sence, &amp; according to the Letter. <hi>The
Eternall</hi> and Iustifying Faith, in the second sence, and according to

               </gap> 
               <hi>having the promise of
both,</hi> and both the gift of God, David could teach no otherwise, seeing
<hi>Moses</hi> gaue him his Text from Levit. 26. and Deut. 28. and can be
construed no otherwise. Our Saviour sends his hearers to <hi>Moses</hi> for
triall of his wordes and workes; and in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> they could never be
found, but by seeking a mystery in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; a Spirit in his letter; a
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in his shadowe, an eternall blessing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veyed vnder a Temporarie.
They that teach otherwise, must frame a man of only soule or only body; or
invent a Christ with the <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes,</hi> that hath litle or nothing to do

And in that place the point is cleared, seeing by the Fathers faith, the Child
then became dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of an vncleane Spirit; that bodily good being denied
vpon his state of incredulitie. A cloude of witnesses haue their faith extolled

that such so dying, had no Faith. Hearke what his wordes be wherevpon such
bruite was raysed. In his said Epistles fourth <hi>Section</hi> he writes thus:

<q>But seeing the Lord promiseth deliverance from the plague, to

               </q> it may

faith, for their eternall iustification, and finall salvation, by vertue
whereof their flesh resteth in hope of an happy resurrection, and their spirit
is gone to God that gave it.</hi> So farre There. In them wordes is the former
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion plainly resolved; namely, One may dy of the Pestilence, having
notwithstanding true faith in Christ, to their eternall Iustification, &amp;
Salvation: but such a one so dying, wanteth that faith, whereby that particular
temporary deliverance might also haue been had. It is not said, that they haue
<hi>No Faith</hi> (for the contrary is affirmed, namely, that such a one may
haue true Iustifying Faith) but that in such a one, there was <hi>A want of

farre He with authoritie, but in me, it must be a Heresie. He saith such faith
for deliverance, is required in Psalme 91. And many of our Cleargie haue deried
it in me. If faith, for deliuerance from Pestilence, bee not in every
Christian, Required, why is our Church [<hi>in the Collect on Trinitie
Sunday</hi>] inioyned to pray against <hi>All adversitie;</hi> as also in the
<hi>Letany</hi> to pray directly thus: <hi>From the Pestilence good Lord
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs?</hi> Al true prayer, is to be made in <hi>Faith;</hi> (for what is
not of faith, is sinne) and as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> vrgeth, in chap. 1. 6. to
bee made without wavering, as we would haue assurance, to obtayne our request.
This doctrine so, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is the
doctrine of the <hi>Heads</hi> of our Church, enioyned vnder the payne of

also in ferre necessarily therevpon, that in the lacke of such faith, the very
Elect, may iustly perish of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence? Yea, that the lacke of such sayth,
is cause of any Adversitie inflicted vpon vs? Vnfold this Riddle that can, for

               <hi>Augustine</hi> is bold (and the scriptures so teach him) to

also, to the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of God in all his proceedings? The contrary doctrine
cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth man to arrogate to much to him selfe, and to giue vnto God to

            <p>But let vs heare how another Divine writt last Pest time:<note n="“" place="margin">T. C. on psal. 91.</note> He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said there be two

comon course of nature; the other <hi>before the time</hi> (stumble not at the
latter phrase, for the<note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 7. 19.</note> scriptures
approve it) of this latter he thus saith: Another way, death may happen to a

               <hi>he will cause Pestilence to raigne:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 13. 5.</note> Whereout it is certayne, that when they be
kept, the Plague bydeth out. 
<q>Likewise saith the Lord in the Commandements, <hi>Honor thy
  Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, &amp;c.</hi> out of the which it is certayne, that his
  life, which doth them not, shalbe shortned. Afterwards, the same Writer
  speaking of the promise in the 91. Psalme, he addes thus: <hi>Of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
  Death only speaketh this Psalme, and promiseth the faith full Christian men,
  that they shalbe free from it.</hi> For fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted death, into
  the which we haue consented in Baptisme, we neither can nor shalbe deliuered.
  Wherefore if a vertuous Christian man dy of the plague, it is certainly <hi>his
  very houre appointed him of God,</hi> which he cannot prevent. But doubtles,
  there dy of it many sinners also beside, which might well live longer if they
  repented. <hi>So farre He.</hi> From whose wordes the collection is evident,
  namely, that none dy of the plague sent out from God, but vpon their
  disobedience, be they Believers or Sinners.</q> And then every Divine must
graunt, that Error in <hi>Fact</hi> proceedeth from error in <hi>Faith;</hi> as
from want of faith exhibited in his threatnings or promises.</p>

            <p>In my traduced <hi>Epistle</hi> and <hi>Section</hi> 4. I say of
<hi>the wicked escaping in middest of strongest Pestilence, First, it is not
because they have any promise, but because it pleaseth God both to them and vs,
to be in many things, many times better then his promise.</hi> So I speake of
the wicked in generall for their escape, as also of any promise in scripture,
as vnto them not belonging, that is properly and blessedly. Afterwardes in the
same <hi>Section</hi> I adde. <hi>Secondly, the wicked so escaping are
ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily such as haue walked boldly thorough the Sicknes, bragging of their
faith in God, touching deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pestilence; shewing plainly, that
they had of faith in God for apprehending promise of deliuerance, though they
have not had faith for apprehending things spirituall and eternall.</hi> So
far. And herein appeareth, that the conclusion is inferred, not in respect of
all wicked escaping in middest of the pests-heat, but of some certaine wicked,
namely, such as gloried first in their hope and trust, walking thorough it
without feare. Now their speach &amp; <pb n="24" facs="tcp:8446:13"/> behaviour compared

(seeing I can iudge but by externalls) that I may not thinke such to haue had
that faith, which apprehendeth that temporarie.</p>
            <p>True it is, that all promises in proprietie and blessedly, are
made to the children of God (whither we respect Christ the sonne of God by
nature, or the sanctified mankind, the sonnes of God by Adoption) but yet it
followeth not, that therefore; God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateh none of the things so promised
to the wicked. God hath commaunded both sortes of <hi>Faith</hi> to goe

                  </gap>Y Greke.</note> running
thus, as a Doctor of our owne hath turned the Greek. 
<q>Many of our Brethren (<hi>saith Dionisius</hi>) by, reason of
  their great loue and brotherly charitie, spared not them selues, cleaued one to
  another, visited the sicke, without wearines or head-taking, attended vpon them
  diligently cured them in Christ which cost them their liues; and being full of
  other mens maladies, tooke the infection of their neighbours; translated (of
  their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) the sorowes of others vpon them selues, cured and confirmed
  other sick persons, and dyed most willingly themselues, fulfilling in deed the
  common saying, <hi>only friendship is always to beretained:</hi> and departing
  this life, they seemed the of-scourings of others. In this sorte, the best of
  our Bretheren departed this life (whereof som were <hi>Ministers</hi> and som
  <hi>Deacons</hi>) in great reuerence among the common people: so that this kind
  of death, for the <hi>Piety</hi> &amp; strength of <hi>Faith,</hi> may seeme to
  differ nothing from <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> for they tooke the dead bodyes of the
  Saintes, whose brestes, and hands, and faces layd vpwardes, and closed their
  eyes, shut their mouthes, and ioyntly with one accord, being like affectioned,
  <hi>Embraced them,</hi> washed them, &amp; prepared their <hi>Funeralls.</hi>
  In a little while after, they enioyed the like them selues. For that the living
  continually traced the steppes of the dead. But among the Heathen, all fell out
  the contrarie. For scarse had the Pestilence taken place amongest them, but
  they contraried them selues, and fledde from their most friendly and dearest
  friendes. They threw them halfe dead into the streetes; the dead they left
  vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, to be devoured of dogges; to the end they might avoyde the partaking
  and felowship of death; which for all that they could devise, <hi>They could
  not escape.</hi>
               </q> So farre <hi>Eusebius.</hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> besides other thinges, I wish these pointes to be observed:
<hi>First,</hi> it was helde piety, a worke of faith, charitie, glorious as
<hi>Martyrdome,</hi> to stand by it, doing service one to another, even to the
death and buriall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the persons <pb n="26" facs="tcp:8446:14"/> so
holily imployde, were <hi>Ministers, Deacons</hi> and others. As for the
Heathen set in an <hi>Antithesis; First,</hi> they fly one from another, euen
from their dearest friends, exposing the dead to prophane vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> for all their flying so, Gods hande did overtake them: Such
being the iudgment and practise of the Church in them purer tymes: and such was
the behaviour of the Heathen; iudge nowe, who last pest-tyme walked as the
Christians, and who as the Heathen.</p>

            <p>For my doctrine there of the Leprosie, I leaue it to be tryed by
Gods worde, for already it is vnder the tryall of the Bishops sworde. Only
heere thus much.</p>
            <p>1. The Leper was not put off;<note place="margin">Leuit. 13.</note>
till his disease were throughly seene, tryed and censured. But our sicknes are
shaken off without tryall: &amp; often tymes vpon false suppositiôn.</p>
            <p>2. The Priest then was tyed by dutie, to take such tryall. But the
Priest ordinarily with vs, is of the rest, furthest from that; shaking off not
only the sicke, but the sound also.</p>
            <p>3. The Priest and people got the Leper conveyed to some place
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, providing sufficiently for him, that so his lothsom body might 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8446:15"/> bring no grievance to the Congregation. But the most of
our Priestes and people haue beene so farre from convaying forth the sick so
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; as they rather haue put out them selues, providing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and leaving the sick behinde them.</p>
            <p>4. The Leprous house and garment came also vnder the Priestes
tryall and censure: will our Priestes do the like? I will hardly beleeue it,
till I see it.</p>
            <p>5. The Leprous garmentes were to be burnt, and the houses pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe: will they deale so with pestilenced houses and garmentes? Then downe
with all England. Haue I not (these circumstances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred) had iust cause to
complayne of abuse committed against the Ceremoniall law of Leprosie? <hi>Sub
Iudice lis sit,</hi> Let the Church of God all abroad iudge it.</p>
            <p>As for any Rules of <hi>Politicall</hi> decency, or safetie to be
drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Levit. 13. or any other scripture, nether haue I (nor I think any

none els would; if all this be layd to heart, am I Iron, that I should not

thou that art stronger, helpe to sustayne me: at least, simpathize so my

            <head>A Letter to a friend.</head>
            <p>YOu desire to heare by what Law, I was committed, and so am still
continued in prison? I protest, in the presence of God, I know not, by what
Law, all this is done, There is a Law, that toucheth som, concerning iudgement
and doctrine of the Pestilence. It is layd downe in the booke called the
<hi>Queenes Orders</hi> for the Pestilence: I speake of our late sweet
Soveraigne, now gone vnto God. The same booke since (as I take it) was
published last pest-tyme, in his Maiesties name, and this is it
<hi>verbatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <q> 
               <p>
                  <hi>Order</hi> 16. Item if there be any person, Ecclesiasticall or
Lay, that should hold, and publish any opinions, (as in som places report is
made) that it is a vayne thing, to forbeare, to resorte to the infected: or
that it is not charitable, to forbid the same; pretending that no person shall
dy, but at their time prefixed, such persons shall not only be reprehended, but
by order of the Bishop, (If they bee Ecclesiasticall,) shalbe forbidden to
preach: and being Lay, shalbe also enioyned to forbeare, to vtter such
daungerous opinions, vpon payne of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which shalbe executed, if
they shall perseuere in that errour. And yet it shall appeare manifestly, by
these Orders, that according to Christian charitie, no persons of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
degree, shalbe left without succour and relief.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Admitt now, I had bene coulpable, of such doctrine: my punishment
should not haue bene imprisonment, but som in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, <pb n="32" facs="tcp:8446:17"/>
               <hi>to preach.</hi> But, as may appeare, by all my writings, I am cleared from
all such imputation: and so no Law (that yet I can heare of) in this matter,
violated of me. His Maiestie commaunded, I should be proceeded withall; <hi>By
the Law,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that there was a Law to cleare me, or condemne me:
and yet (as you heare) I am kept still in bondes, only vpon my L. of London
commaund, (not vpon any Law Civill, or Ecclesiasticall, once spoken of) others
of the <hi>Hy-Commission</hi> vnited with him therein, who (I suppose) dare
not, easilie, be in any thing, vnto him, repugnant: and he having imprisoned
me, before he truely vnderstood the cause, doeth thus goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make good
his imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by wincking at the truth of the cause, seeming to plague me
for the contrary.</p>
            <p>This may suffice, for your question; wherewith I end, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring

which is in heauen is perfect, Mat. 5. 48. Also the great commandement doth
say: <hi>Loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp; with all thy soule,

great commandement. And the second is like vnto this: Thou shalt loue thy

despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Authour of the doctrine even Christ him selfe.</p>
            <p>Although no man can be perfect in this life, yet it is no reason
that the mouth of the Oxe should be moozled, for treadinge out the corne before
them: and telling men what they ought to bee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh he knoweth, that none
