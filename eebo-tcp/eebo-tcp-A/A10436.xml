            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>¶ A nother reason / they alege that man was ordeyned and made to haue an infynyte beynge / therfore after this mortall dethe he must haue infynyte ioy or infynyte payne. So tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is not ordeyned to haue payn in purgatory that hath an ende.</p>
            <p>¶ A nother reason they alege and that is this.

                  <p>¶ Syth thys thyng is now well by the perceyued / now will I procede to the solucyon of thyne obieccyon. But fyrste I wyll shewe the an example of thyngys hauynge soule vegetatiue as an apple whyche hath but soule vegetatiue yf such an apple growyng on the tree be hurt with som great stroke / &amp; therby in some parte somwhat rotten &amp; peryshed / &amp; if that apple immedyatly after be pulled frome the tree / now that apple can neuer len ger growe: and then yf thou woldeste kepe that same apple to the intent to serue the at thy table at some grete dyner &amp; feaste that thou woldest af terwarde make to thy frendys &amp; louers / this appell shall not be able than to do to the no good seruyce / because the lenger thou kepeste it / it wyll be wors &amp; worse / and by reason of that stroke it wyll wax more rotten / and at the laste wax all to nought and not able to be eten: and also if thou lay that appell amonge other apples / it wyll infecte all thos appels / whyche lye nygh it / and make them rotten &amp; nought. But yet yf such an appell ha uynge such a stroke growynge vpon the tree / be suffered styll to growe &amp; not pulled of the tree / such an apple oftymes wyll naturally preserue and hele it selfe agayne / and the radycall naturall humour of that appell wyll increase whyle it is growynge / and expulse those humours whyche were corrupte by reason of the sayd stroke / and so make that appell a hole and a sownde appell / able to be kepte to do thy seruyce after at thy table / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou shalt make thy dyner and feast to thy fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and louers. But yet yf thou take an appell from that tree / whych is a sownde appell but yet it is not fully rype / because there remayneth i it such a sowre watery humour which maketh yt not pleasaunt to be eten / yet yf thou laye that appell in fayre strawe in some howse where the temperate eyer may come to it / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that eyer wyll puryfye &amp; purge that appell frome that sowre humour and vapour out the tartnes and sowernes of that humour / &amp; so make it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe &amp; pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be eten. So lyke wyse now I may say of a man whych hathe soule intellectyue / yf he be infecte or corrupted withe the stroke of

doynge some great mortall synne and offence agayns god / and than the soule immedyatly pulled &amp; separate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body by naturall dethe wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the soule of that man shall neuer be able to be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of god / &amp; do hym seruice in heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / because it hath such a mortall wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wherby it is infecte &amp; putryfyed not worthy to be admytted to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clene pure soules in heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Or cllys yf such bestys haue taken some dysease by ex cessyue colde or hete / &amp; the flesh not putryfyed nor corrupte / but bare and lene / and therfore not pleasaunt to be eten for mannys mete: yet yf those best vs be kylled / yet thou mayst make the flesshe of those bestys / though it be neuer so lene by sethynge or rostynge it wyth butter or fat larde to be good mannes mete / and pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be eten able to serue the at thy dyner

A reall thynge is that whych is perceyued by the organes &amp; instrumentes of the. v. wyttys / as the thyng whych may be seen hard tasted / felt or smelled / be called reall thynges.
